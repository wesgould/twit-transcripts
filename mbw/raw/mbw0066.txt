[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.200]   >> From the Bob Heil PR40 Microphone Capital of the World,
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.200]   it's Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.100]   >> Wow, that was great.
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, Scott Born our announcer of the week.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.100]   You must have worked in radio at some point.
[00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.400]   >> Who said that?
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.300]   >> Scott Born is here from the Apple Phone Show at Applephone
[00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.600]   Show.com and also girlsgongeek.tv.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.100]   And look, it's a girl gone geek.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.100]   I brought my very own with me.
[00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.100]   I just, you know, we had girls gone geeks laying around.
[00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.500]   So I said, what the heck was bring one to Mac Break Weekly?
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.200]   >> Leanna, how do you say your last name?
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   >> Lehua.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.900]   >> That's what I said.
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.900]   >> Lehua.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.900]   >> Leanna Lehua.
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.900]   That sounds like a Hawaiian name.
[00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.900]   >> It is.
[00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.900]   >> It's beautiful.
[00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900]   Leanna Lehua is one of the, probably the chief girlsgongeek,
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.900]   although I wouldn't say that in front of the other girls because they didn't.
[00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.900]   >> Oh, well, she's the geekiest of the girlsgongeek.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.900]   >> The geekiest girlgongeek.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.900]   But she's a woman now.
[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.900]   Because she's on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.900]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.900]   >> Thank you for having me.
[00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900]   >> Also here, Alex Lindsay, in fact, we're being hosted in the
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.900]   Alex Lindsay Memorial Studio today.
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.900]   >> I never thought of it as a memorial studio, but it doesn't, you know.
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.900]   >> Should fire break out?
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.900]   Well, it'll be like the Apollo 11 capsule.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.900]   Because he pumps pure oxygen in here.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:11.900]   Does that keep you younger?
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.900]   >> It does.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.900]   It does.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.900]   64 degrees pure oxygen.
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.900]   No windows.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.900]   It's really very effective.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.900]   >> And that soundproofing on the walls, that's fireproof, right?
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.900]   >> It is.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.900]   It's the expensive fireproof kind of.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.900]   >> Do you have a lighter, Scott?
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900]   >> Yeah, let's give it a shot.
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900]   Come on.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900]   >> That's the one problem with the pure oxygen atmosphere as your
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900]   cigarette breaks only last about three seconds.
[00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.900]   It's only negative.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900]   >> It's good to be all of us together in one room.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.900]   We don't have to do this very often.
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.900]   We're usually skyping in.
[00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.900]   >> I can wink it at Ms. LaHoe here over here.
[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.900]   >> Thank you.
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.900]   >> It's got what's C.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.900]   Right around your head.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.900]   So news today, there's actually a little bit.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.900]   1.1.2 came out, Mr. Phone Show.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.900]   >> It did.
[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.900]   1.1.2.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.900]   >> I didn't notice anything.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.900]   >> Does it do anything?
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.900]   >> You would notice it if you lived in Germany because it does
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.900]   the international character set for our friends in Germany.
[00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.900]   O2 has been selling a lot of phones.
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.900]   And allegedly, there's a couple of bug fixes as well as the TIFF
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.900]   exploit fix.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.900]   However, according to Leon Olehooah, let's find out some more
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900]   about that.
[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.900]   How does it affect the iPhone or some of those things?
[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.900]   >> You know, I haven't.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.900]   The only application I've tested with it since I updated it is
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.900]   the eye toner.
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.900]   >> Had you done a jailbreak on the phone before you did the update?
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.900]   >> Well, the one that I tried eye toner on with the newest 1.1.2
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.900]   is not a jailbroken phone.
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.900]   I did try to update my jailbroken phone because I have another
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.900]   phone that's jailbroken.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.900]   And it didn't do anything.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.900]   I actually just didn't update, but it didn't break it or do
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.900]   anything to it.
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.900]   There is now with, I think, Erica Stoon and the iPhone dev team
[00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.900]   or it might be iPhone Elite.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.900]   I'm not sure which team it is.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.900]   But one of the teams has created a new GUI jailbreak that you
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.900]   actually have to go in, but you can't do it with an hacked iPhone.
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.900]   >> Jailbreak.com no longer works.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.900]   >> Correct.
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.900]   >> So don't use, if you're going to 1.1.2, don't go to jailbreak.com
[00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.900]   first.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.900]   >> Correct.
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.900]   >> If you want to go to 1.1.2 and if you've gone to 1.1.2, it
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.900]   won't work at all.
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.900]   >> Correct.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900]   >> You have to go back to 1.1.1 to try to make that happen from
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.900]   what I had to do.
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.900]   >> Can you restore if you've done a jailbreak?
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.900]   No.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.900]   You can't.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.900]   I don't think you can run a restore.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.900]   >> You can't.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.900]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:16.900]   >> You cannot.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.900]   I haven't been able to own my jailbreak broken phone.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.900]   >> Okay.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900]   So you're stuck with a jailbroken phone and you can't get to 1.1.2.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.900]   >> Correct.
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.900]   >> You have basically a very expensive iPod.
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.900]   >> Well, no, because jailbreaking doesn't, you're still using AT&T.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.900]   You haven't hacked.
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.900]   >> Well, I'm sorry.
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.900]   >> I'm going to say jailbreak, I don't mean necessarily that you've unlocked it.
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.900]   So you have the unlocked phone.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.900]   >> Correct.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.900]   I tried to unlock it, but when I did, I actually did something that completely corrupts my
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.900]   baseband.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.900]   >> I see you have an iPod.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.900]   >> So I do have an iPod.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   Yes.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.900]   >> I had been dropped and was going to be discarded.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.740]   So that we made that our test phone.
[00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.780]   See, I haven't dared.
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.540]   I have one unlocked phone in Canada, but I know that 1.1.2 won't work on that.
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.900]   Although they had to get 1.1.1 working on it.
[00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.900]   Good.
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.500]   >> So I'm still at 1.04.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.500]   >> With your unlocked?
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   >> Just my iPhone.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.500]   >> Your regular one.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   You don't like to update?
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   >> No, I wait.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.500]   I wait and see.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.260]   There's nothing in the new updates that has had me want to, my eye toner worked really
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260]   well and I didn't feel like I didn't have the time to test out every version.
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.260]   >> They also serve who merely sit and wait.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.260]   >> Yeah, you know.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.940]   >> I have to admit, I tend to be when I look at upgrades and I think this comes from being
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.140]   in production environment where, you know, if everything's working and I don't see anything
[00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.940]   that I really need from a new update, I tend to just wait it out and just see how it turns
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.340]   out before I'm not one of those people like, "Oh boy, there's a new operating system."
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.660]   And I mean, when we were working on Star Wars, I think I was using like two versions old
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.140]   of After Effects because that's what we started with when we started the movie.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.020]   You know, and so that you tend to kind of move very, very slowly into that and I've carried
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.020]   on that personality.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.820]   >> So there's what they call a dirty jailbreak for one one.
[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.300]   Which means it's just an ugly process but supposedly works.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.420]   That's from Conceited Software.
[00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.660]   >> We're going to see lots more updates in the next couple of months, Leo.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.940]   >> It's interesting that they are no longer stymied with what Apple's up to.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.940]   They pretty quickly respond.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.420]   >> We're going to see the cat and mouse game continue but I bet you we see a 1.13, 1.14,
[00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.540]   1.15 in the next six to eight weeks.
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.620]   >> You know, I talked to Will Harrison in England and he went to the Apple store to get it or
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.180]   maybe it was the O2 store.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.460]   I can't remember to get an iPhone.
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.460]   He said there was no line.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.460]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.460]   >> Not that much interest.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.460]   More interest in Germany, apparently.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.100]   >> Well, actually, you know, O2 says it's the hottest selling device in their history.
[00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.620]   They sold 8,000 to 10,000 phones in the first four or five hours.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.140]   We do have actually a field reporter, believe it or not, from the Apple phone show.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.820]   We're going to get a field report today from a keen who's in Germany who's doing it.
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.060]   But it sort of mirrors what I saw right here in San Francisco on the phone launch.
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.180]   We had huge lines at the Apple store here in downtown San Francisco.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.340]   You were lounging in Petaluma, I believe.
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.300]   >> Yeah, there was a line but you could have gone in two hours later.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.300]   >> But we had big lines at the Apple store.
[00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.380]   What was really funny is I walked by the AT&T store, which is a block away.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.540]   There was 13 people in line.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.420]   And I think some of this has to do with who you trust.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.780]   And the UK, perhaps certain resellers.
[00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.740]   I mean, Carphone Warehouse is the big name in the UK.
[00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.900]   So it might have been people standing one place or another.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:30.860]   But the sales by all accounts were very brisk.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.980]   And according to some of the people I've heard from, the lines weren't as long as they were
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.700]   in the States as you wouldn't expect they would be.
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.940]   But they've been very brisk.
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.580]   >> And so there was no line at all in England.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.580]   But where in where was it?
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.140]   >> Well, in England, that's a big play.
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.020]   He maybe met where he was.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.780]   >> Well, in Birmingham.
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.780]   >> In Birmingham.
[00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.780]   >> In Birmingham.
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:52.780]   >> In Birmingham, we saw pictures a lot.
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.020]   And maybe some were interested.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.700]   But 8,000 isn't like a million.
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.700]   I mean, but no, no.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.020]   For '02, they say that's more than they expected, they thought they'd have 3,000.
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.020]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.020]   >> The first day.
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.580]   >> It's a size of Rhode Island.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.100]   [LAUGH]
[00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.580]   >> With ocean all the way around.
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.260]   So I mean, it's just, you know, the iPhone is now available.
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.220]   Now, when is the France phone coming out soon?
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.020]   That one will be the unlocked one.
[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.020]   >> That'll be the unlocked one.
[00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.020]   >> That should be interesting.
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.780]   >> And we got a way to hear what the issues are with France, Minitel and all the various.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:30.340]   I mean, what people don't understand, Leo, is that the regulatory issues surrounding
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.020]   the release of a cell phone are significant in a lot of countries outside the United
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:40.220]   States and the hoops that Apple has to go through with its various providers to get
[00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.580]   this phone into these markets are significant.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:48.900]   I mean, we would have seen a phone in Canada by now had it not been for the Canadian regulators.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.340]   And you know, France has got the Minitel agency.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.740]   You know, if you've ever dealt with them.
[00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.620]   It's like any French bureaucracy.
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:02.060]   Hello, we work from 10 to 11, then we have lunch, then we go back to work at three, then
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.260]   we have T8 four, and we come back home.
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.140]   >> I wonder how many people in Germany and England though might be waiting for a flood
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.620]   of unlocked iPhones from France to use their own carrier.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.620]   >> That's a good question.
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.620]   You know, that might slow.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.740]   If you think that that's coming, you might wait, right?
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.740]   >> You might.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.020]   >> Is there any way for Apple to actually block it?
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.420]   >> So only if you use France or is there no?
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:22.420]   >> I'm sure there is.
[00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.420]   >> That's what they're working on.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.780]   Because they block through keeping in mind that this is all hooked to iTunes.
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.220]   You know, they block, if they could block it through iTunes they could.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.020]   But you know, I don't know how they're going to do updates.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.860]   They do the iTunes updates on a country by country basis somehow.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.980]   Like we don't get to see what's in the England iTunes store and they don't get to see what's
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:43.980]   in ours.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.980]   I don't know if they have a way of extending that.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.700]   >> Well, you can know, you can go on iTunes and pick England at the bottom.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.540]   You got a little flag and you can look at their store.
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:50.540]   >> But we can't buy stuff.
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.980]   >> I can buy stuff when I'm in Africa.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.340]   I can buy stuff from iTunes because it's my iTunes.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.340]   >> You use my American iTunes.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.340]   >> Yeah, I'm an American.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.340]   >> Right, right.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.060]   Scott's point is unless you have a credit card registered in the country that you're
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.740]   buying from, you can't buy from that store.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.700]   Although since we can buy more in the States, it doesn't hurt us.
[00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.980]   But if you're in Canada, I know a lot of my friends in Canada, I'm sure this is true
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:11.980]   in Britain too.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.740]   Look at what we can get in the States and they're a little miffed because they can't
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.740]   buy TV shows.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.740]   They can't buy a lot of it.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.740]   >> They probably can't buy a lot of it.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.740]   >> Definitely.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.740]   >> Okay, yes, we better.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.820]   >> No, I don't.
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.820]   >> And Scott says- >> She's buying the stairway to heaven.
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:29.740]   >> Okay, that's eight seconds stop.
[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:30.740]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.740]   Scott says we can do eight seconds.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.020]   I don't want Jimmy Page knocking on my door.
[00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.020]   That's all.
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.020]   >> Bong, bong, bong.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.020]   >> Bong, bong, bong.
[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.020]   >> Did you get yours?
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.020]   >> I got it.
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.020]   At 12.01 a.m. it went live.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.020]   >> Wow.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.020]   >> And so all 185 or whatever.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.020]   >> Downloaded.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   >> Downloaded.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:51.220]   >> You know, immediately did a little bathed and confused.
[00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.180]   >> We thought we'd do a spoken word version.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.180]   >> Let's do that.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.860]   >> If there's a bustle in your head row, don't be alarmed now.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.180]   It's just a spring clean for the May Queen.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.700]   Yes, there are two paths you can go by.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.140]   But in the law, I think this is still a copyright file.
[00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:10.660]   >> Actually, we should.
[00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.740]   >> That's eight seconds right there.
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.260]   We'll just stop right there.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.260]   So that's exciting.
[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.740]   I guess for Led Zepp fans.
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.740]   >> You're obviously Zepp.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.580]   >> Are you going to fly to England and see them?
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.860]   >> You know, I'm sorely tempted.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.060]   >> They bailed.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.060]   >> I know.
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.060]   >> And they blamed it on Jini Page.
[00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.460]   >> But now, allegedly, it could be back on.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.780]   Apparently some big money.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.220]   >> Would you be suckered again?
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.220]   >> Yes.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.860]   >> Because one of the first concerts I ever saw was Led Zepp.
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:39.860]   And then Prince on you.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.260]   You're like a baby duckling.
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.260]   >> Here's the thing.
[00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.700]   Here's my lucky pedigree of growing up when and where I did.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.700]   >> First concert ever?
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.700]   >> Beatles.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.700]   >> Wow.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.700]   >> That's second concert ever?
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.700]   >> You must be older than dirt.
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.700]   >> I am older than dirt.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.700]   Thank you.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.700]   >> Second concert ever.
[00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:54.700]   James Hendricks.
[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.700]   >> Wow.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.260]   >> Jimmy the Great One.
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.780]   Third concert, Led Zepp.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.940]   >> Fourth concert, Tommy Dorsley.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.940]   >> Tommy Dorsley.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.940]   >> So come on.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:03.940]   You know.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:04.940]   >> Did you see Cap Callaway?
[00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:05.940]   >> Never.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:06.940]   >> Never.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.540]   >> I did really like Betty Grayville though.
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:15.660]   >> My problem was is that when I grew up, you know, the prom dance just oscillated between
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.540]   Free Bird and Stay With Heaven.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.980]   Every other year it was one or the other.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:22.140]   You know, it just went back and forth.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.460]   Well, last year was Stay With Heaven.
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.220]   So let's do Free Bird, man.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.220]   And yeah, I don't.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.940]   >> When I started here, hear that again.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.660]   >> Rock and roll DJ.
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.220]   Those are the three requests.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.220]   Free Bird was number one.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.220]   >> Play Free Bird.
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.220]   >> Stay with it to have number two.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.260]   And then you know what three was?
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.700]   Green grass and blue skies for everybody out was.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.700]   I don't know why.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.700]   >> Wow.
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.700]   >> Leon, I'm so sorry.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:43.700]   You probably don't remember any of this.
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.180]   >> I know this song.
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.180]   It's only eight.
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.820]   >> But Puffie and Lumi and what do they call them?
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:52.340]   The Spice Girls.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:57.220]   She would know these songs if they are on guitar hero than I know them.
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:02.980]   >> Veronica is out buying a Priestess song because she keeps playing in on guitar hero.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:03.980]   >> Absolutely.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.980]   >> That's a great one.
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.620]   >> I haven't played guitar hero three.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:07.620]   You played it?
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.300]   >> Well, I haven't played guitar hero three.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.940]   I played, well, I did guitar hero three Legends of Rock on the PS3.
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.700]   I played in the Best Buy and it was awesome.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.980]   Some great songs, but not as many classic songs as the original guitar hero.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.780]   It's guitar hero too.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.300]   >> It lists a different band, but it sounds like the same song.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.820]   I don't understand.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:28.980]   So some they've licensed and some they have covers.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.980]   Is that how it is?
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:30.980]   >> Correct.
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:32.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:33.980]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:34.980]   >> I can't keep up.
[00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.980]   >> It's tough.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.980]   >> You know what it is?
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.780]   It's a dance dance revolution with your fingers.
[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.780]   >> Right.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:40.780]   >> Is all it is.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:41.780]   >> Does it actually teach you how to play the guitar?
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.780]   >> No, it does not.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.700]   >> The first thing I ask, in fact, I know how to play a lot of these songs and it messes
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.780]   me up because my fingers wouldn't.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:53.100]   >> If they did one of those that actually taught you how to play, that would be a great
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.100]   point.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.100]   >> Yeah, that would be good.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.100]   >> Why don't they do that?
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.100]   >> And they could use this technology to do that.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.100]   That would be the same exact technology.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.100]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.100]   >> It's kind of crazy.
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.620]   >> Dance dance revolution to teach you how to play the Smiths would be very popular for
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.620]   me.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:05.620]   >> Well, that's the other thing.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.900]   It's the kids who've learned how to dance with dance dance revolution don't really dance.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.900]   They stomp.
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.900]   >> Right.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.900]   >> Right.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.900]   >> That's a shame.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.900]   >> It is.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.020]   >> Because you put hours and hours into a game like Guitar Hero.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.620]   You should come away with it.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.940]   I won't let my kid do it.
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.940]   He plays a guitar.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:21.940]   I said, no, no, no.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.140]   You're not going to spend five hours a day learning how to play a cheap plastic controller.
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.140]   >> Right.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:28.900]   >> What is that going to do?
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.900]   >> Right.
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.540]   >> It would actually mess him up.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.540]   >> It messes me up.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.540]   >> Right.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.540]   He can do that.
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.540]   He does that.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.540]   Aussie Osborne Crazy Train.
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:37.540]   >> Right.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.540]   >> He's really good.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.540]   He's a good player.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.540]   He's not as good.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.540]   He's not like you.
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.540]   >> Right.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:43.540]   >> He's not like you.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.540]   He's not like you.
[00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.540]   >> Right.
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.540]   >> He's not like you.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.540]   He's not like you.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:48.540]   He's not like you.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.540]   >> Right.
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.540]   >> Right.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.540]   >> He's not like you.
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.540]   >> He's not like you.
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.540]   He's not like you.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.540]   >> Right.
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:55.540]   >> He's not like you.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.540]   >> Right.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.540]   >> He is.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.540]   He's not like you.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.540]   >> Right.
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:00.540]   >> Right.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.540]   >> He's not like you.
[00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.540]   >> Right.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:03.540]   >> He's not like you.
[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:04.540]   >> He's not like you.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.540]   >> Right.
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.540]   He's not like you.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.540]   >> Right.
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.540]   >> Right.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.540]   >> He's not like you.
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.540]   >> Right.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:11.540]   >> His name is Gene Munster.
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.540]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.540]   >> Herman says --
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:14.540]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.540]   >> Lily.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:22.540]   >> He says that there won't be a big update for the iPhone till February to coincide
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.420]   with the application launch.
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.420]   And he says, I don't know how he knows this.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.180]   He says it will include SDK support and spotlight.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:31.180]   >> Oh.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.060]   >> Well, you know, what would you -- your phone isn't that big.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.740]   >> Well, but I do have to admit, it would be nice to be able to search in my contacts.
[00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.740]   >> Right.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.740]   >> You know, right now you have to find it.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.740]   >> It's very frustrating.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.220]   >> It's search cut and paste are the things that are a little like --
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.220]   >> Yes.
[00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.340]   >> I will say this, Piper Jaffrey gets it right more than they get it wrong.
[00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:48.340]   >> Okay.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.340]   Well, he must have some --
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.380]   >> But he is not the analyst that typically I follow from them.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:54.460]   So we'll -- I don't know what his prediction rate is.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.700]   He says, though, that -- and he's absolutely right.
[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:57.700]   This is much needed.
[00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:01.340]   The ability to search emails, contacts, and other iPhone data from a single place.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.780]   You could do that in a palm.
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.300]   You could do that in a blackberry eye.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.140]   It seems like the least you could do.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.380]   >> Is palm still in business?
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.380]   >> No.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.380]   >> Okay.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.100]   But you could -- they're still in business.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.300]   I don't want to get any trouble here.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   They're still around.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.300]   They're just dying fast.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.220]   Hey, what happened to Apple's stocks, speaking of dying fast?
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.780]   >> I don't look day to day.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:20.780]   >> Okay, good.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.420]   >> I don't look -- I'm dollar cost average.
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.780]   >> You feel like 72 is share.
[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.780]   What do I care about?
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.980]   >> The -- I think that part of the deal is -- I mean, some people --
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:27.980]   >> Everybody's got that ticket.
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.580]   >> I mean, it's gotten really high.
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.100]   You want to sell off a little bit.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.260]   >> I don't think it's profit taking.
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.260]   I think there's a lot more.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.260]   >> You don't think so?
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.260]   >> I think there's some --
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.260]   >> Well, the whole that went down too last week.
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:37.260]   >> Oh, it's everybody.
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.060]   >> But -- so it's not a slam on Apple.
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.460]   It's everyone must do exactly this.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.300]   It's frankly, it's the whole stock markets.
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.300]   >> You're saying.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.300]   >> It's in trouble.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.780]   Jason Calicanis on Twit told me that we won't be able to sell
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.380]   any advertising after December the whole thing's falling apart.
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.380]   So --
[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.140]   >> Ladies and gentlemen, I want to encourage you to continue
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.660]   to donate to Twit because --
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.660]   [ Laughter ]
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.260]   >> -- show and all the other shows depend on you.
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:02.460]   >> So do we think that this Mac book pro is going to --
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.460]   >> Oh, I brought a --
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.460]   >> -- wait a minute.
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.460]   Now, I just wanted to show -- because I have a prototype,
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.780]   but I thought Scott would really enjoy this.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:09.900]   This is the little mini Mac that they're going to be announcing
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.900]   in January.
[00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:12.300]   I thought Scott, you'd kind of enjoy this.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.300]   [ Laughter ]
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   >> I know I think that's pretty cool.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.500]   >> So this is Scott's looking at a little Asus.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.660]   This is the E-E-P-C.
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.660]   It's Linux.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.660]   Press the silver button.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.660]   >> Oh, it is.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.660]   >> Yeah.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.140]   It's all solid state.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.420]   And that's one of the rumors is that the next MacBook or MacBook
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.140]   Pro or mini Mac will be flash drive based.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.140]   >> That is kind of cute.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.140]   Isn't that cute?
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.140]   >> Instant on then.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.940]   >> Instant on, 2.2 pounds roughly.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.460]   Actually, it's a little less Nokila.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.460]   So maybe 2 pounds.
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.940]   >> Can you get on the Internet with this?
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:43.940]   >> Get on the Internet.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.940]   It's got Wi-Fi.
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.500]   It's got three USB-2 connectors.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.500]   It's got ethernet.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.500]   It's got a modem.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   >> How much?
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.500]   >> Built-in camera.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.500]   $399.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.500]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.500]   >> You're kidding me.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.500]   That's a pretty good product.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.500]   >> Where can you get this?
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.500]   >> Everywhere.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.500]   >> I need to upgrade.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.500]   >> You know, I bought it.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.500]   I got it yesterday.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   Today, Asus announced they're going to make a --
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:01.500]   >> Yes.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   >> There we go.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.500]   Big version with a 10-inch screen.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.660]   The only thing wrong with that is it's a small screen.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.100]   It's 800 wide.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.100]   So many websites.
[00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.100]   >> So many websites.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.100]   >> So many websites.
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:12.780]   >> Well, they didn't say, but I figured since I just bought this one any day now.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:13.780]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:18.020]   >> Well, you know, Leana made something like this out of a wood-chicken wire.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.780]   >> I used the mobile pro NEC.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:21.780]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.780]   >> The NEC mobile pro 7.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.780]   I think it was my 790.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.380]   I have a couple of them.
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.380]   790.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:31.020]   And there are actually a couple of ports for some Linux OSs out there.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.020]   J.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.660]   And so it ports onto the 790, I believe, is the correct one.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.140]   So they're working on one.
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.540]   Now I'm carrying actually my bag.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.780]   I have the mobile pro 900.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.380]   >> You see, you wouldn't like this because it's a Debian, I think.
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.060]   It's got AppKit, but it doesn't have a full suite of apps.
[00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.420]   So it's really just open office Firefox, Thunderbird.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:51.580]   It's the most of the stuff you'd want.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.580]   >> Right.
[00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.580]   >> Tux Racer.
[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.580]   That's pretty good.
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.580]   >> Touch Racer.
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.580]   >> Tux Racer.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.580]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.580]   >> It's a nice thing.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.580]   >> Ladies and gentlemen, Mac, break weekly will be back next week.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:01.580]   We're doing that.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.580]   >> I'll show you.
[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.580]   I think this is the trick.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.580]   >> Yeah, that is.
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:05.580]   >> And I think an ultralight Mac would look something like this.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.060]   >> I think it would be a little bigger.
[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:08.220]   It'll cost a thousand bucks, too.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.220]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.220]   >> At least twice a thousand.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.780]   >> The rumor is it is super thin using a lot of NAND stuff.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.620]   They're removing a drive out of the, a drive of some type out of the existing Mac.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:22.220]   >> I guess the rumor was they were going to have an optical drive, but to save space.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.220]   >> They were going to, yeah.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.460]   This is the rumor and they got rid of it.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.460]   >> They're going to find one.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.460]   >> I don't really need it.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.420]   >> But these rumors are fairly well defined now.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:33.860]   And I think it'd be, I'd be shocked if we don't see a, I mean, come on.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:38.500]   All the people that used to love the 13 inch power book, they constantly whine, moan and
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.380]   snivel about it not being replaced and aligned.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:46.500]   So the question really is, do we think it'll be more like a 13 inch or will it really be
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.860]   cute like that, Leo?
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.940]   >> I would think a 10 inch screen, ultra thin, three pounder.
[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.740]   If you're going to take the optical drive out, see, I don't need it.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.740]   >> I know.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.740]   But how do you reinstall OS 10?
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:58.740]   How do you?
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.740]   >> You get it.
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:00.740]   >> You get it.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:01.740]   >> You start a flash boot.
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.740]   >> You get an external on your flash.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.860]   >> I got that tools thing.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.860]   What is it?
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.860]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:07.860]   >> Tech tool pro.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.860]   >> Tech tool pro.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.980]   >> I have tech tool pro on a USB thing.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.260]   I can plug it in and start an EMAC.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.940]   >> Yeah, I guess okay.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.940]   That would solve this.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.740]   >> Of course, that's 280 bucks or something.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.060]   >> And it doesn't have leopard on it either.
[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.700]   >> But you could set up something like that.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.780]   >> Yeah, you could set up something.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.740]   >> So I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:30.500]   The problem is I just couldn't, to me, the 15 inches still the perfect size.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.220]   The 17 inches too big for me because I can't use it unless I'm first class.
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.580]   Which by the way, the Virgin on the way back was really good.
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.580]   >> Did you like Virgin America?
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:38.580]   >> Virgin America.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.580]   >> Oh, we like Virgin America.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.940]   >> We are the cutest pilots you ever saw.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:42.940]   Don't you agree?
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.180]   They looked like George Clooney.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.180]   >> And they don't wear caps.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:50.260]   They just wear black, a black top, black slacks with a little tiny bars in the collar.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.580]   >> Yeah, I didn't realize they were actually the pilots.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:54.740]   They're walking around talking people.
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.500]   >> Yeah, they're getting a little bit nicer and relax.
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.220]   >> And then suddenly they walked into the, I was like, what's really weird when you sit
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.660]   in the first class on Virgin America, the pilot comes and shakes your hand and thinks
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.660]   you're flying on the plane.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.940]   That's because there were four people on the flight.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.940]   Our flight was practical.
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.340]   I mean, really it was practically empty.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.060]   >> On the way back to first class, so you don't care.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.060]   >> I was in the front row.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.060]   >> Wow.
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.060]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:14.060]   >> It was a different move.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.060]   >> And we were on a plane that wasn't finished.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.460]   >> Oh, it was missing a couple seats.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.020]   >> No, it was worse than that.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.020]   So you know, it's really cool.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:21.940]   They have black lights by the way on the plane.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.740]   So they have a purple interior and it's black light.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:28.900]   I didn't know this, but Craig Severson sitting with me and saying, look at you glow.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.460]   And they, but they didn't have the purple partitions in yet.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.340]   So we were sitting in the front row and it was wide open.
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.340]   It was wide open.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.340]   There's the pilot is there.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.420]   And then, and then they didn't have any of the electrical.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.260]   So the red video system wasn't working.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:42.260]   >> Oh, that's weak.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.500]   Everything's heavily electrified, which means you can't recline.
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.500]   You can't plug in.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:47.820]   You can't really do more anything on that.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.460]   >> We did get an email before your flight saying that, that there was going to be a.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.020]   >> Oh, I knew that this was going in.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.180]   >> This plane was in its first week of flying.
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.260]   The pilot was in his third day of flying, which scared me a little bit.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.860]   >> Apparently he'd flown other planes.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.460]   >> He was he was over 18 though.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.460]   >> Oh, he was.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.260]   >> Yeah, he looked like a flight that Alex and I were on was just fine.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.260]   We had every.
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:07.260]   >> Yes, no, going to Vegas.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:12.500]   >> And and there and there a 17 inch would work really well, but just about anywhere else.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.500]   >> Again.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.500]   >> Well, and also that you can actually open it.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.700]   You know, the thing is, if you're in a regular coach, 15 inches about as big as it gets.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.260]   And even at it takes some, you know, it takes a little bit of work.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.060]   >> I had to use a 15 inch until 1995.
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:25.540]   >> Yeah, exactly.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:29.460]   >> I'm I'm really I really like for you.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.460]   I was very impressed.
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.460]   >> It was fun.
[00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:32.460]   >> I hope they do well.
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:33.460]   >> There was a lot of space.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.060]   I mean, it was for me, I could actually lay in the aisle.
[00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.060]   I mean, there was that much space and there was like 55 inches.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.860]   So I'm sure, but I can stretch.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.860]   I mean, it was great.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:40.860]   >> You guys were in first.
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.860]   What was it like back in the I've never been in coach.
[00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:44.860]   >> I've been in the coach.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.860]   The coach is great too.
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.860]   >> Yeah, I've taken 14 flights on the Virgin America.
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:48.860]   Well, I haven't.
[00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.860]   I've never ridden coach back there.
[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:50.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.060]   I've never seen the horizontal challenge podcasters of America.
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.020]   They're simply not out of room back there.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.620]   But it is a little humiliating when you have to say ask, you have a seatbell extension?
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:01.900]   I don't need those, but I'm still, you know, I'm not that bad.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.240]   But you know, four seats across, please.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:10.300]   First class on Virgin America, only eight seats versus 12 on last, which I usually fly.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.780]   Or let me say this more accurately, which I used to fly.
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.260]   Don't you like the little snack that box they gave you?
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:17.260]   I don't.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.260]   I like the.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.260]   I like the.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.260]   I'm the only one that doesn't.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.460]   Meals, if you go, if you go longer than an hour ago.
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.300]   >> I know, I know, but I'm always on that.
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:29.100]   So the LA fly or the Vegas flight, and they bring this thing and it's like an identifiable
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.820]   squid meat or something in the little white box.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.780]   It's like, it's so cool that it's too cool to eat.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.380]   We had, did you have, okay, so we got off the plane in Las Vegas.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.500]   There's a big sign as you're coming off the runway that says, okay, let's get our stories
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   straight.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   We're in Cincinnati.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.500]   >> Right.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.020]   And then we had the disco ball greeting.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.500]   >> Did you have the disco ball coming back?
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:49.500]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.500]   >> The lights were dim.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.820]   >> That's new to Virgin to do that.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.900]   We should probably mention why we were all there.
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.100]   Oh, yeah, we were, we were at Blog World Expo, which was a great time.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.260]   Thank you, Scott, for arranging that.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:00.260]   >> Yeah, it was fun.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.860]   >> We all spoke at Blog World in new media Expo and it was fun.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.420]   >> Like, Harrington stood me up.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.300]   Did you see the little bruja over that?
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.300]   >> I did.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.540]   >> Whoa, I didn't mean to start it.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.020]   You started some stuff, Leo, and I really didn't mean to.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.180]   So I was on the keynote went great.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.060]   And immediately after the keynote, I had to go to a panel.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.460]   I had half an hour.
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.220]   And before I go over there, the panel was called the Cult of Blogging.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.180]   And the idea was these A-list bloggers.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.780]   I don't know why I was on the panel, but it was me, Mike Harrington of TechCrunch and
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.140]   Omallik.
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:36.300]   So they had warned me the night before, you know, Om had a bad back as Dr. said, you
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.300]   can't travel.
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.300]   I said, fine.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.740]   Then they said, we haven't heard from Mike since Wednesday.
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.060]   Little worried, but I'm sure it'll be fine.
[00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:47.300]   So that's when I went to Justine Azerik and I said, you know, Justine, you're an A-list.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.180]   You figured I had to do a cult.
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:50.180]   I was in case.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.300]   Could you, you know, show up?
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.420]   Then shortly before I'm about to go over, they say, yeah, Mike said he forgot.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.140]   So yeah, he forgot.
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.060]   So now I go up on stage and say, you know, I can't be here as back.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.620]   I can apparently forgot.
[00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:05.620]   And we go on, we do.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.340]   I thought did a very nice panel.
[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.340]   But it got back to my--
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.340]   And you pulled Justine?
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.340]   Yeah, it was a great panel.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.340]   Right.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:12.340]   Were you there?
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.340]   I was there.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.340]   It was great.
[00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.340]   Yeah, she's great.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.340]   I mean, I'm sure people were there to see the big names.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.460]   Probably a lot of people were there to pull Mike aside and say, Mike, please plug Mike.
[00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:25.660]   You know, people, you know, they cry in front of Mike because, you know, please, if you're
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:29.260]   in tech crunch, you know, the tech crunch girl's gone gee for us.
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.260]   We'll see there you go.
[00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.260]   That's huge.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.260]   And I like Mike and he's an old friend.
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.260]   And so I didn't mean, I wasn't trying to slime him.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.260]   I just, that's what I was told.
[00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.220]   And I just repeated what I was told.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.900]   And as it turned out, it was more complex, apparently more complicated than that, Rick.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.660]   Safe to assume any Twit stuff won't be tech crunched in the next couple of months.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.660]   It's been on Twit.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.420]   Mike has been on their network and I'm sure he'll come back.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:54.180]   Let's see if he forgets, but no, no, I don't mean that.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:55.900]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.580]   Apparently they had had, there was a tentative agreement, but they hadn't followed up and
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.580]   there was a confusion.
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.380]   And that I can believe because the, it was a first year show for these guys.
[00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.380]   They did a good job.
[00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:09.900]   There was a couple of communication breakdown, communication breakdown.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.660]   Well, I didn't know I was getting this.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.660]   Sorry.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:15.620]   I thought I was doing the panel and then I found it two weeks before I was going to speech
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.620]   too.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:17.620]   So I think that's probably what happened.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:18.620]   I'm sure that's what happened.
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.620]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.620]   So no, no, we'll have you, Mike.
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.740]   Well, you know, people are so scared of Mike that they don't dare say anything.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.660]   You know, I don't even know the guy, but I'm thankful that he crunched our girls gong
[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.660]   geek.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.660]   It makes a difference, doesn't it?
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.660]   It does.
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.660]   It's a little bit of trust.
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.660]   Thank you.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.900]   I think we had 165,000 downloads in the first week.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.900]   Not bad for any of us.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:35.900]   There you go.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.900]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.900]   That'll do it.
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:38.900]   There's a couple of podcasts that have been on for a long time.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.900]   They've never got that many.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:44.500]   No, that half couple, I think 99.9.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.180]   So let's see.
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:47.180]   What else?
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.180]   Oh, has 10.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.540]   This is a weird story selling in Japan faster than Vista.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:57.700]   They love leopard 53% of all the operating system purchases in Japan last week were leopard.
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.780]   Maybe no man can have presents.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.220]   Maybe Japanese people are just simply more creative.
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.900]   Or you know, statistically they have a higher IQ than is that true?
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.020]   Yes, statistically they have the highest IQ in the world.
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:12.380]   So that I think that's connected to, you know, according to the test.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:21.660]   In October, 53.9% of the OS only market, OS 10 sales went from get this 15.5% to 60%
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:29.460]   year over year, Windows has got to hurt going from 75% to 28% year over year.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:34.380]   Well, I can understand Windows going down no matter where it is.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:40.020]   Well, I think that the anecdotal evidence that I have is that when you're at an airport,
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.500]   you see a lot of power books.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.300]   Well, and I was just going to say when we were a blog world, I mean, even though bloggers
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.140]   are traditionally more Windows people, I saw tons of Macs.
[00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.700]   I mean, that's what I noticed in the airport.
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.780]   And tons of life is how many Macs you see.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.260]   You don't really see as many PCs at least traveling.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.380]   Maybe that's just a certain cross-section of people.
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.220]   But you go to coffee shops, you go to, I mean, when you go to like coffee shops in LA,
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.140]   it doesn't really count because it's all a bunch of writers and stuff and it's all Mac.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.060]   But if you go to, if you are here in San Francisco, even, you just see a very, very
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.700]   high percentage of-
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.180]   Bowling alley managers are heavy into Windows.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:17.620]   I think this is probably the appropriate point to play the new Macintosh anti-Vista
[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.780]   ad you've heard this one.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:20.620]   Oh, I don't know if I have.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.020]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.020]   My fellow Americans, I'm a PC.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.020]   Why so official?
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.180]   Well, some people are giving up on Vista Mac because it doesn't work the way they want
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.180]   it to.
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.620]   Other people are going back to XP.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.620]   Really?
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.620]   Downrange.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.340]   If your printer isn't compatible with Vista, I say buy a new printer.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:40.740]   If Mac's new leopard operating system has dozens of new features, I say ignore them.
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.900]   Ask not what Vista can do for you.
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.140]   Ask what you can buy for Vista.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.820]   Wow, you're really committed to this.
[00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:46.820]   Oh, not really.
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:48.540]   I switched back to XP three weeks ago.
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.540]   So much happier.
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.540]   [laughter]
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:55.660]   How about the cases of this about that one I can tell you right now?
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:00.180]   No, has anyone had any, and maybe this is for our listeners as well, has anyone had
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:06.340]   any oddities with putting CDs in or having CDs read by the CD player with leopard?
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.380]   I just put, because I have leopard on a Mac mini at home.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:17.020]   And you know, I'm burning, you know, just absorbing my CD collection into iTunes or
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.380]   my wipes more specifically.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.260]   And about every tenth disk, well, every ninth or tenth disk, it just goes in, computer
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.620]   doesn't see it, doesn't react to it.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.620]   It's a hard work.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.540]   You hit eject, it pops back out and it's fine.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.940]   We only have leopard on one small machine in our whole office.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:38.620]   And the only thing we've noticed is that anything with flash got trashed because apparently
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:42.180]   the leopard install writes over whatever flash you have.
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.780]   So you have to reinstall flash.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.460]   So we were like finding out the hard way.
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:47.060]   Oh, yeah, you have to be new flash 9.
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.620]   The new flash 9 was required.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.860]   But other than that, it's been relatively trouble free.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.860]   It's great.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.900]   There's a few little things I'm not crazy about with leopard.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.260]   I mean, I'm sorry, I'm starting to really hate the stack.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.260]   Do you buy it away?
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.260]   Yeah, I didn't actually buy it.
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:03.300]   I actually wrote down that this would be the...
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.300]   You said it.
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.780]   I said how long before the honeymoon was over.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.300]   I wrote this down because this is the typical Leo the port curve.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.300]   I love it.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.300]   I love it.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   I hate it.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.300]   I hate it.
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.780]   Well, just in my defense, I was talking as a first look.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:20.300]   And I think on first blush, there's a lot of things to like about it.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.020]   But you and you don't know what the little things are.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.180]   So you don't like the stacks?
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.900]   Well, I mean, I agree with Andy when he said it right off the bat and the first our first
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:36.460]   show right after leopard was why take out the functionality of this dock icon and replace
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.700]   it with something that doesn't work as well.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.060]   And I have to say, I do miss the fact that I can put an application folder in the dock
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:46.180]   and then click on it and get a hierarchical listing of all the apps and select it.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.900]   And there are a few things that don't work quick.
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.940]   Something's going on with Quicksilver and I don't...
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.940]   Yeah.
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.940]   They're gone.
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.940]   I can't get your site.
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:53.940]   Right.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.500]   Open sourced it shortly after leopard came out.
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:02.340]   I remember reading that there was some issue with the update feature of Quicksilver that
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.660]   was de-oscing his site, but now the site's down completely.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.740]   So that's a little bit of an issue for me.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.740]   It seems to work.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.740]   Okay.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:13.060]   If you have a copy already, but I can't get a new copy to install.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.060]   Airport is a little flaky.
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:15.060]   It's a little weird.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:19.020]   If once you once you select an airport base, well, see now it's working here and I don't
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.340]   understand that.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:27.220]   What I ended up doing on my MacBook Pro, because it was acting a little slow, it was just erasing
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.380]   the drive, zeroing the drive and putting leopard on it.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.380]   It seems a little bit better now.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:31.380]   Is this a snappier now?
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.380]   You know, that's always a better way to do it if you can.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.380]   I have my...
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:38.420]   My MacBook was upgraded, but it was a fairly new Tiger installation.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.340]   So there wasn't a lot of weird stuff going on with that.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:43.340]   Have you changed any of the docks?
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:44.340]   Have you changed the dock?
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.100]   I ended up putting the dock back on the left.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.460]   And there is a way, in fact, I have to...
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.660]   We'll put this in the show notes.
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:59.740]   There is a thing called Stacks Overlay from T.E.C.K.S.D.D.E.org.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.620]   It's just an icon change, but it actually helps.
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.620]   It takes the...
[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.900]   Right now the way the Stacks work is the most recent icon in your stack is the topmost.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:10.900]   So when you download something, whatever the next thing you...
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.460]   The first most recent thing you downloaded becomes the icon.
[00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:15.460]   The problem is you can't really see what you've got.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.740]   So he's got this overlay that makes it look like a little file drawer.
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.740]   But now you at least know that's a folder.
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:25.180]   Instead of looking like the one password icon, which my applications folder always looks
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.180]   like.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.180]   So there's...
[00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.100]   And then you can turn off the transparent menu now.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.700]   A lot of people are complaining about that.
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.700]   That's fixable.
[00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:38.540]   The bottom line though is you compare this with Vista or any operating system upgrade.
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.900]   And it's been very smooth.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:45.020]   So which version of Leopard did you get the $129 version or the $129 version?
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:49.660]   I got that Leopard Ultimate, which was a $129 I think.
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.300]   I've been very happy with that.
[00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.300]   Now when you...
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.140]   There are little things, but any operating system upgrade, there's going to be little
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:57.140]   things.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.820]   I think I'm balanced.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.700]   It's really quite amazing.
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.700]   I like it a lot.
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.700]   I'm still in favor.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:03.700]   I'm still in favor.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.860]   Yeah, I really enjoy it on the Mac mini.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:09.900]   I've been testing it kind of slowly and adding things.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.860]   What's the one going to be after Leopard?
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.860]   You know they're running out of big cats.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.420]   I think there's...
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:19.340]   Puma was the first one, but they didn't widely publicize it, right?
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.340]   Did they do...
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.340]   Did this on the Lion?
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:22.820]   I heard it was going to be called Mexican Hairless.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.780]   Yeah, they're really running out.
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.780]   Lion's.
[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.780]   Lion is the last one.
[00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:28.780]   Lion.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.780]   So when Lion comes out, that's when I'll install Leopard.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.780]   They've trademarked Lion.
[00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.260]   I think at that point they're going to have to go to OS 11.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:36.420]   Because it goes to 11.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:40.060]   They're going to switch to the deer family.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.060]   Sharks.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.060]   Great white.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.060]   Sharks there.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.060]   They're the surf teachers of the said.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.060]   Hammerhead.
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.060]   That would be great.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.060]   Hammerhead.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.060]   Mako.
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:49.060]   Would it be...
[00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.780]   But see they want to branch out and bring more new Mac users.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:54.180]   Would it be better to call the new operating system?
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.180]   Oh, dear.
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.180]   Bambi.
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.180]   A female.
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:58.180]   No.
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.340]   I think Hammerhead.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.300]   I would definitely upgrade to Hammerhead.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.300]   I would.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.300]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.860]   It would be an awesome operating system.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.860]   Hammerhead.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.260]   Apple if you're listening, Hammerhead.
[00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.260]   Hammerhead.
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.020]   First start with great white would have to be the end of OS 11.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.020]   That's 11.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.220]   This is why it's difficult.
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:16.740]   See great white sounds racist.
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.900]   Hammerhead sounds like something like you're going to hit with a Hammer.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.900]   Mako.
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.940]   Mako is like what is Mako?
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:28.100]   So that's why, you know, if you think about it, Leopard, Tiger, Panther, that's actually
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.100]   pretty good.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.580]   They actually thought about it longer than I did.
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.580]   They spent some time.
[00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.420]   I know you just came up with this.
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.780]   They probably went to name lab and had somebody payed a million dollars to figure this out.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:39.780]   Yeah, you know.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.780]   Those are the guys who came up with the word new Coke.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.940]   Well, actually they are the company.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:46.380]   There is a company called name lab.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.380]   Yeah, no, I know.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.780]   And they get paid a million bucks to name your company and they come up with names like
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.780]   Plaxo, Zeros.
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.620]   They came up with Zeros.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.900]   Zeros is not a bad name.
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.540]   No, but what I'm saying is they all have those sort of that sound.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.100]   Yeah, baby talk.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.420]   Yeah, they're all baby talk.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.980]   Let's see other stories in the news.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.740]   It's kind of been a slow week to be honest with you.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:12.980]   You know, this is all this is going to shock you, but I got no story.
[00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:18.340]   And it's relative in that this has been sort of a not necessarily overly Mac based Mac
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.420]   break weekly, but the new Zunes out.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.580]   And I'm actually pretty excited about that.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.420]   I have a picture on my Facebook page of you and Rob Greenley, a Microsoft kind of arm
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.420]   and arm.
[00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:29.420]   It was a little scary.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.580]   You had your iPhone, the new Zunes out.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:39.020]   And I will say that 90% of my original complaints are gone.
[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.780]   I do have to still brown to it.
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.780]   No, no, no.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.860]   They've got Turkey, Mom, and green now.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.860]   Instead of Turkey.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:46.860]   They're colors.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.500]   I do not know who the color guy is.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.960]   I can tell you that he's color blind.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.620]   And the second thing is they still got the social in the menu.
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:57.660]   And I'm still trying to get them to understand that that refers to what's known as awake
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.660]   in Canada.
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.520]   So it's probably.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.520]   But other than that, here's the big news for us.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:07.960]   They now support podcast on the menu, on the menu.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.120]   And the Zune marketplace is going to be like iTunes in terms of where you can get your
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.600]   podcast and our buddy, Rob is in charge of that.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.680]   And I will say it looks a lot like a nano.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.800]   It has a better screen, glass screen.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.320]   The interface is probably as good as an iPod.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   To me, we've always.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.320]   I like it.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.320]   It's a pretty translucent background.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.560]   Yeah, we've always talked on this show about what makes the iPod successful.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.760]   We've all agreed it's iTunes.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:35.080]   So the real story will be what does Microsoft do with the Zune marketplace and all this
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.560]   stuff behind that.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:41.160]   If you want a subscription music model, that's the place to go.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.640]   And for Mac users, why this is important is because if Microsoft gets their act together
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.840]   with the Zune, we finally have impetus.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.240]   Somebody chasing the iPod so we actually get development because it's necessary, not
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.480]   because Steve feels like he wants to sell another couple of million minutes.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.480]   Competition is very good.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.800]   You know, I had lunch yesterday with Hector, we used to see CEO of AMD and I thanked him.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.600]   You know, AMD is now 25% of the market.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.200]   And I said, without you, Intel wouldn't be as aggressive.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.920]   They wouldn't be as innovative and they wouldn't be as affordable.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.880]   But because there's competition, competition is good.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.120]   And even if we love Apple, we have to remember, of course, now on the operating system side,
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.360]   Apple is the competition for Microsoft.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.080]   So we've kept Microsoft on us.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:27.000]   But on the portable player side, they're so dominant that it's good to have a competitor
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.920]   like Zune to put the pressure on them to keep them improving the iPod.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.480]   The honor was there with us and she spent more time, I think, with the Zune than I did.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.600]   You were talking about the Wi-Fi stuff and the...
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.120]   Oh, being able to actually share songs now.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:47.080]   And I don't think, I think Rob was saying that there is no longer the three-song limit.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.600]   I think now you can just share songs back and forth.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.160]   But I don't believe you can pull them off.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.840]   If I share a song with Alex on a Zune, I don't believe you can pull it off and pull it into
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.840]   your iTunes.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.840]   But that might have a three-song limit.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:02.600]   I'm glad to say this share podcast and they no longer add DRM to the podcast.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.080]   And I'm happy to say that the Zune comes pre-configured with a Twit podcast, Windows
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.080]   Weekly.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.960]   Not, I'm sorry to say Mac, but Windows Weekly.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   I don't know.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.960]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.960]   Why not?
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:16.440]   And I talked with Rob, I said, "Come on, where's the Apple phone show on here?"
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:17.440]   And done.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.240]   Yeah, but they did put Windows Weekly on.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.720]   And actually they're going to put, because 50% and roughly you're 40% of people buying
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.920]   iPhones now are Windows using them.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.560]   So then, you know, come on.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:32.240]   And we, if you, on the Twit page now, you know, we have a little subscribe thing under
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.240]   every podcast.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   We can drop it down.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.680]   And of course it's always said, "It actually used to be pretty long.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:38.800]   And with the iTunes, Pod Nova, Yahoo."
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.680]   And those are all, you know, everything but iTunes is gone.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.680]   Right.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.680]   I know iPod or X, but we have added a Zune drop down.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.120]   So if you are using a Zune and you're using the Zune Marketplace, you can go to our web
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   page, Twit.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:55.880]   Well, and I'm going to use this platform to announce that Padangos 2500 podcast now,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.880]   and that we have control over in Padango 2500 shows are all going to be available on the
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.880]   Zune.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.880]   It's right.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.880]   It's through the same process.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.840]   We have a, and I sure Rob did this for you, and I sent you an email, Alex, but you were
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.680]   too busy to respond.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.600]   They created a Twit page, artist page.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.840]   The artist page are very cool.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.440]   And you got a Padango artist page.
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.080]   Well, he's either done it or said he's going to do it.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.320]   And yeah, they wanted to do a Pixelcore artist page, but you said you didn't have to have
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.320]   to have to.
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.200]   And this is important because I think that they wanted it.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.840]   They wanted it in like three days or something.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:33.440]   All you needed to send them, and this is what I sent them was a list of the shows and
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.840]   the feed URLs, but it's okay.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.840]   I gave you the opportunity.
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.240]   Anyway, it's an easy thing to do and they'll add it.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:45.040]   But the nice thing is you can put a subscribe button that says Zune right next to any podcast.
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.760]   Press the button if you use the Zune marketplace, it automatically opens it and subscribes.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:54.200]   It's really important for podcasters because, you know, when the first Zune came out without
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.640]   being able to support the podcast, I was apoplectic.
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.960]   And I have to say that, you know, that was the reason why everybody's heard me make so
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.600]   many Zune jokes, but now that, you know, we can do the podcast and my buddy Rob's over
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.800]   there, I'm not making any more Zune jokes, but I will say it's important to us because
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.600]   a lot of people thought you could only get a podcast if you had what?
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.600]   And I apologize.
[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.400]   No, it's very important.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   It's very important.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.600]   So that's what I mean, I haven't reviewed the Zune yet.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.880]   I'll get one and I'll give you a real review, but I have to say after playing with Rob's
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.880]   I was impressed.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:29.120]   I thought he had it to us and let us walk around with it and didn't, you know, he didn't
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.280]   like try to restrict our use of it.
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.960]   He let me hold it for like 20 minutes and mess with it and he didn't ask for it back.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:39.080]   And you know, I was impressed by what I saw in 20 minutes, obviously in 20 minutes, you
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:40.880]   can't get a whole breakdown.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.800]   We'll give it a more thorough review, but yeah, breakdown.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.240]   And there's a larger 80 gig one as well.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.200]   That has a great screen on it.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.000]   I forget what he's like.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   It's like a nice touch.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   It's very close to the.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   It's now pretty much the same.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.240]   The big screen is what are the, you know, the price points again, Leon?
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   149 for the four gigabytes, 199 for the eight gigabyte and 249 for the 80 gigabyte.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   So it's like, what was the, what's the price point for like the last 74 gigabytes of 50
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   bucks?
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.760]   Yeah, you almost want, but the difference is the 80 is a hard drive.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.760]   It's bigger.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:14.760]   I know.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   I know.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.080]   I'll probably get the little, I'll probably get the little one for podcasts, you know,
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.560]   because it's right on the front there.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.280]   You scroll down and it says podcast.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.720]   I never, I have to say, and I was shocked.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.520]   I read one of the reasons I was in vain against the word podcast is I thought, no way Microsoft
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:28.880]   will ever use that word.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.880]   And they did.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.600]   I'm stunned, right?
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   It works.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.600]   I'm glad I'm happy.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.360]   Podcasting is not dead.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   It is not dead.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   It's just gravely ill.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.960]   It's not what Michael Gohegan said.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   Podcasting is dead.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   He did.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   He was, he was shame on you, Michael.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.080]   He was referring to the word.
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:47.080]   He didn't mean that.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.080]   He was referring to the word.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   Yes.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   Well, I said that.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.920]   Not the genre because obviously the fact that we're here today proves it's not dead.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920]   No.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:59.480]   And in fact, I just read a statistic that one million Americans now have commutes over
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.320]   90 minutes each way.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.320]   What are they listening to?
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   Podcasts.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   People don't want to listen to it.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.760]   I mean, unless you're listening, here's the problem is, is that I think with the drive
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:17.600]   time, so to speak, is that NPR doesn't make podcasts or make downloadable content of morning
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.440]   edition or all things considered.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.880]   When you are in the car, depending on when you started, you don't get to get the whole
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:24.880]   show.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:25.880]   Right.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.040]   And so what happens is that you want to listen to the show and you want to hit start.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.040]   Oh, I listen to, well, the new player, I have to say, the new NPR player is probably the
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.440]   best player on the web, but it's web based only.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.360]   It's web based only, but I get up in the morning and I'm making breakfast and everything else.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.560]   And what you can do is you can hit hit playlist and you say, hit, give me all the stories
[00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560]   and then you turn off the stories.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.080]   You don't want all those stupid ones at the end of the hour.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.840]   And so you turn those all off.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:48.560]   And then you go to my favorite hour.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.560]   I hate that.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:50.560]   I hate that.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.560]   I'm like, and that's the problem.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.360]   Here's the problem with NPR is I get between eight, so it's 45 and nine.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.520]   I'm like, I'm like, oh, you know, you know, so I just have to wait until we get to the
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   news again.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.040]   So there's a dog named Putin and Sally T.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:07.920]   Worley wants to know why he's in trouble.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.920]   Yes.
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.920]   Exactly.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.440]   I just don't want to know, you know, Americans.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:14.040]   And so they far knew.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.400]   So I think that, you know, you can't get exactly what you want there.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:20.000]   And I think that we are getting used to the idea that we can just define what we're going
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.120]   to listen to and we're going to hit start when we want to hit start and if we want to
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.840]   rewind or whatever.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.120]   And I know a lot of people that are that are downloading that.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.280]   That's what happened with Tivo.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.720]   Everybody watches TV if they've got a Tivo, right?
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.720]   They want to be able to pause.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.120]   They want to skip the commercials and they want to time shift.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.560]   And as soon as you, that's the strength of podcasting.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.440]   That's why I think it's so important to get the word out because once people discover
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.080]   it, it's like discovering Tivo.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:44.040]   Tivo took a long time.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:49.720]   And I think it took a very unaccountably long time given how good the word of mouth was
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.760]   for people to adopt.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.120]   And I think on it originally, that's why.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.920]   And I think one of the biggest things that helped is also having one of the big advantages
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.400]   was when a lot of these big companies started putting their podcasts up there, that even
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.200]   though they're filling the top 10 or top 20, they're now promoting it all the time.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.360]   You can download our podcast from CNN podcast of X, Y, and Z or whatever.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.640]   And that draws more people into the market.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.580]   Anyway, so the other thing is that for video podcasts, and we talk about this almost every
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:23.840]   week right now at TWIM, or for this week of media, is for podcasters or whatever you
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.200]   want to call us.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.520]   If the writer strike that's going on that you may have seen news about lasts until the actor
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:37.560]   strike and everything else, it is going to be the biggest year for online media ever.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.640]   Because it means that the fall season is gone.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.880]   You know, that's very exciting.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:46.000]   Do you believe in this format as well, the three to five minute versus like shows now,
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.760]   20 minute, 30 minute, people are going to look for placements for shows?
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.960]   I don't, you know, the thing is that you can make lots of shows that are three to five
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.520]   minutes long or three to eight minutes long.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:57.440]   You don't, the problem, the problem with long shows is that when you're watching them on
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.280]   a portable player, I'd rather watch a bunch of little ones because I'm sitting there in
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.920]   between things than watching a long one.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:08.000]   The other thing is, is in the, in the budgets that we can do podcasts at, it's really hard
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.520]   to stretch 22 minutes out of it.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:10.960]   Twenty two minutes is a half an hour show.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.560]   It's really hard to stretch 22 minutes that that's really worth watching.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:18.160]   Now the, but it, but the thing is, is to also remember is that mostly what you're watching
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.880]   on TV is five to eight minute segments.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.400]   These are five to eight minute shows split up by commercial and then another five to eight
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400]   minute show.
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   That's right.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.880]   You know, and so when you think about you just, if you, if you break TV into segments,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.080]   what we're really looking at is that's what people are used to watching because they,
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.640]   then they go do a break or they walk around or whatever.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.520]   So five to eight minutes is, is already kind of the natural limit.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.640]   The other thing is, is that there's some really interesting little thing, fine tuning
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:48.720]   in the H264 license that makes you want to be under 12 minutes.
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:50.720]   There's all kinds of royalties and everything else that.
[00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.640]   Well, there's that issue with MP3s as well.
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.640]   Right.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.640]   But he's raised that issue.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.920]   As long as you're not, you know, right now if people aren't paying for it, if you're
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.480]   not making a lot of money to advertise and they're, what, what they're doing that's
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.720]   smart is they're not pulling on the hook.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:06.600]   You know, they're letting the hook continue to sink into the market because they pulled
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.040]   on and the people would drop their phone.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.120]   It's like the guy that had the JIF patent, he waited till, you know, JIFs were completely
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.400]   ubiquitous and said, uh, excuse me.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   Everybody owes me anything.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:17.400]   Right.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   Right.
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:19.400]   So, 90 minutes.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   90 minutes.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   That's the average.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.480]   So if the commute ever gets to two hours and 30 minutes, then they'll be able to listen
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   to Mac break week.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.480]   All right.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.480]   Moving along.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.280]   I got the message.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.880]   A couple more quick stories.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:34.640]   Looks like 10, 5, 1 is being seated to developers now.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:40.600]   That's the probably the big update for leopard and apparently they will fix that finder bug
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   that people have been talking about.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.320]   The move bug we talked about last week.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.320]   That's good news.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.800]   Although it didn't affect me or you.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   Or me.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:50.600]   You really shouldn't affect anyone because you should never move your only file.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.400]   You're thinking what did you just I just want to grab on to someone.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.400]   What are you thinking?
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   Okay.
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   Okay.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.400]   I'm done.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.600]   I've heard some people say that the 10, 5, 1 will be out within a week or two.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   Probably.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.400]   We'll keep an eye peeled for that.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   Let's see.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.000]   There was one other quick story.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.320]   Oh, a VMware 1, 1 is out now with the leopard support.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.400]   I'm just installing it right now.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:11.800]   It does seem very fast.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.000]   Um, really that's a nice job.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.880]   parallels had a little has a little difficulty with leopard.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.560]   You have to go to the beta.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.640]   So VMware's leapfrogged them a little bit.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.240]   So, uh, I have now, are you running both?
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:27.880]   I run both and the advantage VMware fusion has over parallels at least right now is that
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.800]   it supports multiple processors.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.840]   So if you have a quad core, for instance, you can assign two processors to it.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.320]   Parallel only uses one.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.960]   Um, it also seems to support more memory.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.480]   It doesn't have the same memory.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.280]   Some of the graphics performance I think is actually better on VMware.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:44.120]   VMware 1, 1, Direct X9.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.720]   They're still mixing with fixing a pixel shaders.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.040]   But they're, they're actually supporting Direct X9, which is there are games that actually
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.600]   will run on VMware.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.800]   Um, so VMware is starting to pull ahead a little bit of a parallel.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:59.760]   I have to say, if you had to choose right now, especially if you had a multi core Mac,
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   I would go with VMware.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.760]   Yeah, I've, I've moved to VMware myself.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   I like it.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.760]   Yeah, I like it a lot.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.320]   It runs nice and, nice and swiftly.
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:10.280]   Let's get to our picks and we're going to start with Leanna, our newbie.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.280]   Yeah, you do.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   I call you a virgin, but.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   Hey, thanks.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   Would you like to check my ID?
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:24.040]   No, no, I'm sure you're well under 21, but go ahead and give us your, you actually were
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.240]   debating a PC pick.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.240]   I was.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:31.480]   Well, it was because I'm, I love gaming on, I used to game a lot on my windows box.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:33.200]   Yeah, that's only good for really.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:36.200]   And so I was looking.
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.200]   Careful.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.200]   You know what room you're in.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.200]   Right.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.200]   I know.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.200]   I know.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:46.320]   I was able to play and I was excited when Apple released or the, the command and conquer came
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.320]   out for Mac.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.320]   And so I was excited to play with it.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:50.320]   So you like real time strategies?
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.320]   I do.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.320]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, I love those games.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:53.320]   And so we need more.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:58.480]   And yeah, that's why I really like my pick is a website actually called game tap G A M E
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.360]   T A P dot com.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:04.400]   And the reason I like them is it's one of the first successful attempts that I've seen
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.400]   anyway in terms of creating a player that you can play games online with other people.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:12.800]   And so there is a light player and all of the games at game tap are not available.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:18.840]   Like hitman is available for Windows users, not for Mac users, but in this might be seeming
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.400]   like it's stepping back a little bit.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.280]   But for the Mac users on there, what they call their light player, some of the fun games
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:30.200]   that I like like classic gaming like space invaders and Pac-Man are available Zork.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.400]   And so they're doing a beta right now.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.480]   So I'm in the beta test just playing around and the player works really well.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.480]   It's very responsive.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.640]   Is it flash?
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:39.640]   It's not flash.
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.640]   It's something else.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   You know, I haven't looked into that actually.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.280]   I apologize, but it does work really well.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.440]   It's not a flash player.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.680]   But you are playing it what looks like the kinds of games you played on your desktop,
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.880]   but you're playing them online.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.880]   Correct.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.880]   Wow.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.880]   So it's really fun.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.880]   And I haven't connected to play with anybody else.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.160]   Because it says, for instance, worms are again, and this game is not available on the Mac.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   Right.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.160]   It's probably active.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:06.200]   So yeah, if you do go to game tap and want to sign up, if you do a search on all of the
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.240]   games that play in the light player, those are all supported on the Mac.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.240]   Okay.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240]   Really fun games.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.200]   There's a new missed game that's out.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:16.120]   Actually, Far Cry on this.
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   Yeah, there's some fun games.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.760]   You have to buy Far Cry?
[00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:19.760]   You don't.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   It's just a subscription service.
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.560]   Wow.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.560]   That's very interesting.
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:25.560]   I'm not sure.
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:26.560]   Far Cry's Windows only.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.560]   So anything on the light is Mac supported.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.120]   And right now, again, I'm in a beta.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:35.040]   So I don't know what the subscription rate will be.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.080]   They haven't released that yet, but they have missed rule.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:40.920]   Are you a missed player?
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.640]   I played it before on the Windows machine.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.360]   I like those kind of games as well.
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.360]   Missed is Mac.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   Isn't it?
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:47.360]   Yes.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.320]   Available for Mac.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.800]   Play free till December 31st.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:54.040]   So check it out now anyway.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:57.400]   Before we go on with more, thank you, Leon.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:03.360]   Before we go on, Leon, before we go on to more picks, I do want to mention audible.com.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:10.320]   Our great sponsor on this show, AUDIBLE.com/Macbreak.
[00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:13.640]   They're the folks who provide these great on books you can download.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:17.000]   I mean, audio books of all kinds, 45,000 titles.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.160]   They play on almost every device, including of course, all of your iPods, including the
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.160]   iPhone.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   In fact, I listen to my iPhone.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.480]   That's what all my books are on there.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.520]   And I thought, now I looked for Led Zeppelin.
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.600]   I looked for the song remains the same and all the, there's some good Led Zeppelin bios
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.600]   there.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.680]   You know, involving mudsharks and things, but they didn't have any.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.720]   However, they do have Eric Clapton, the autobiography.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.880]   Eric Clapton's actual autobiography on here.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.720]   It's not read by Eric Clapton.
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.360]   Read by Simon Vance, who's one of the best readers.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:52.200]   This is a new book, very highly recommended.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:58.760]   I mean, I'm sure there is some Led Zeppelin here, peripherally, but I mean, he's the guy.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   You as a guitar.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   Well, Primeless Love.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.480]   Here's some trivia for you.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.760]   Do you know what the Led Zeppelin's original name was going to be?
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   No.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   The New Yardbirds.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.440]   Oh, well, that was Clapton's group.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.440]   Exactly.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:15.720]   So it was the New Yardbirds until Eric said, guys, guys, but Jimmy Page was in the Yardbirds.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.240]   Yeah, Jimmy Page was in there, but, but Eric wasn't cool with them like saying the New Yardbirds.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.200]   So, so they became Led Zeppelin, like a lead balloon.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.560]   Yeah, Jimmy Page played back up to Eric in the Yardbirds.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.360]   So this is, I mean, this is the guy people sometimes say Eric Clapton is a shot.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   I shouldn't say back up.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.360]   He played lead with Eric, but he wasn't up front.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   Right.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:39.320]   When you look at Eric Clapton as a really serious good guitar player, when you look at Eric
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.800]   Clapton as a guitar player, is he that good?
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.240]   He's very good, but he's really far more a songwriter.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.240]   Yeah, wonderful songs.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:52.640]   I mean, he's known as a songwriter and Jimmy Page is a freak in terms of his guitar playing
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:53.640]   skills.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:54.640]   He burns it up.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.040]   His left hand actually comes from Mars.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:01.080]   The rest of him is human, but his left hand was transposed.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.720]   And so anyway, yeah, that's that's that's a that's probably a good pick.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.120]   I want to I want to check that out.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.120]   And this was a story.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.120]   And of course he was in cream.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:12.280]   They did Layla was Derek in the Dominos name.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.560]   Name any other member of the cream.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:15.560]   Ginger Baker.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.120]   Name and think there's only three Jack Bruce.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:21.480]   Jack, you got the Tri-base Jack Bruce ginger baker drums.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.800]   One of the best best best fans of all time.
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:25.800]   Three piece.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.400]   Leon and I just got to sit in our aim like just looking straight forward.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.400]   I love Clapton.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:33.760]   I'm in a historical sort of case.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   Okay.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.240]   Do you remember that song Tears in Heaven?
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.240]   Right.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.240]   That was a great song, right?
[00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.440]   I like Abraham Lincoln too.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:41.160]   Look one for P.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.160]   Bye bye.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.240]   Clapton is clapton is relevant today.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.240]   He's had hits in this decade.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   I'm wonderful.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   Wonderful.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   That's a great song.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.480]   Tears in Heaven is beautiful.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   That's about that.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   That's a beautiful song.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   Right.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   That's a good song.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.080]   Great guy fascinating story.
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.080]   Okay.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.040]   Sorry, we'll talk about the band Garbage Next Week.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.320]   I don't think they have an autobiography.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:08.720]   No, I already heard the police on the police I heard on an album rock.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.520]   You know like AOR station.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.520]   Class?
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   AOR.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.520]   Classic rock.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.520]   That's what scares me.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.600]   I hear songs on classic rock that are newer than anything I know.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.760]   That's what scares me.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.040]   I don't care who you like.
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.760]   You're a clapton is God.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.680]   And you should get his book Clapton the autobiography.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.360]   It is available as an audio book from Audible.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:35.200]   It can in fact be free if you sign up right now for audible audible.com/macbreak.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:38.320]   I just love Audible.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.320]   I spent a lot of time.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.560]   We were talking about how much time people spend in cars.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:44.760]   You know, you can't listen to podcasts all the time.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.200]   If you spend two or three hours, I came down here.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.560]   It was two hours.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.200]   I remember when I committed to tech TV.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:52.200]   Two hours each way was not unusual.
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.640]   Four hours in the car.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.480]   I would read a book every few days.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.920]   I mean, talk about not wasting time where you're driving or gardening or working out.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.200]   You're getting, you know, you're reading and learning.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.280]   And there's so many great books to choose from.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:10.560]   We do thank them so much for their support of the show.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.720]   They've been great.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:13.720]   Who wants to do the next pick?
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:14.720]   Mr. Borne?
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:15.720]   I'll do one.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.520]   I'm kind of on a photo theme lately.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.480]   This is roughly two Alexes.
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:20.480]   It's not cheap.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.320]   You can talk about your camouflage vest.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.840]   No, that's not available for sale.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.840]   Sorry.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.280]   He has a custom camo vest.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.280]   That's correct.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.280]   That has everything.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.960]   He's got the pots for 80 lenses and lunch.
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.960]   But you can't buy those.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.080]   That's made by my buddy.
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:36.840]   So we're going to talk about the Epson 3800.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.000]   Oh, I just bought the 2400.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.040]   Well, that's your baby photographer.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.680]   So the big boy photographers get the 3800.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.480]   17 by 22 inch print size.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.800]   So this is for the really big prints.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:56.560]   And this basically is the pro printer under 2000 that you can buy from Epson.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.000]   Unbelievable print quality.
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.280]   If you're a photographer and you want to make big prints, this is the printer to look
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.280]   at.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.280]   Here's why.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.680]   The unmatched ICC color profiles right out of the box.
[00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:13.280]   If you know which paper and ink you're going to use, and it's an Epson paper and ink, and
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.880]   you've got a calibrated monitor because you used a colorimeter, you're going to get color
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.960]   match prints that really work.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.720]   And one of my favorite things about this printer is there is no metammarism.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:28.240]   Metammarism is the bronzing, the shiny effect you see in blacks on black and white prints.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:32.040]   And that's because Epson's come up with a new patented way to lay the dots down on the
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:35.560]   paper in such a way that they overlay rather than butt up against each other, which is
[00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:38.280]   what caused that reflection in the old days.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.280]   And there are two blacks, two different black inks, and you don't have to, you don't have
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.880]   to interchange them, which used to cost you a lot of money.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.040]   Only 400 you have to change the matter.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.280]   You just leave them in there and work with them.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.880]   And there is a rip available for this printer, which I also got.
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:57.000]   Raster image processor, which allows you to make prints faster to store the profile of
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.800]   any particular picture and print it over and over with real significant duplication of
[00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:07.120]   making sure each prints the same and to get much more accurate color.
[00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:13.080]   It is a little heavy at around 48 pounds, and it does take up a lot of room because not
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:20.280]   only is it 17 by 22, but you need a clear paper path above and behind to get paper into and
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.440]   out of it.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.400]   I also will just give a little tip here.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:29.200]   If you use any Epson photo printer from the cheapest $99 printer up to something like
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:34.680]   this, when you get down low on ink Leo, it will send you a message that says change the
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   cartridge.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.680]   Ignore that.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.280]   Yeah, because you got another eight down.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   You can keep printing.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:43.920]   It will actually, when you can actually be making a photo halfway through it will say,
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.440]   oop, out of red, you can actually then put in the new cartridge.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.520]   It will pick up right where it was and you will not be able to tell.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:51.800]   Most people don't know that.
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:56.560]   And you usually can get two or three big prints out of one of these types of printers beyond
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.920]   what it says you're going to get.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:00.600]   And over a year that saves you probably a couple under bucks.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:05.520]   So it's the Epson 3800 wide variety of resellers carry it.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.720]   And that's my pick home.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.720]   And it's about what?
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.720]   14, 1500?
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:12.040]   That's about 1295 without the rip, around two grand with the rip.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:16.880]   And I have to say, I have the 2400, our 2400, which is about 800 bucks.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.880]   And I'm very happy with it.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:18.880]   It's only 19 by 14.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:24.080]   I paid $150,000 for an Iris printer years ago that didn't make prints that good.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.080]   Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.080]   And it uses the same inks.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:29.080]   The Alfa Chroma Inks are archival.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.080]   The archival.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:34.560]   Will Helm Institute University of Iowa has put them in like the 200 year mark.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.720]   Beautiful stuff.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.360]   I'm always amazed just in general about the print technology.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:43.680]   You know, when you look at even $200 printers nowadays are amazing quality, not photography
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:45.600]   quality, but for the average person.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:49.360]   You know, the ones that ship that like are bundled with your Mac when you buy them or
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.680]   whatever are just amazing compared to what we were doing only.
[00:58:52.680 --> 00:58:56.120]   Well, I spent tens of thousands of dollars on the first die sub printer.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:57.880]   I tried phaser 450.
[00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.440]   The prints lasted for eight months and we were so proud of them.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.320]   I used to pay like $12 a day.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:04.080]   They fade like eight months.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.720]   It's going to last eight months.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.000]   You have to keep them in the dark.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   Look at them.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.520]   I can't believe how cool this is.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.200]   These will last eight months.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.200]   Right.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.400]   Well, the big breakthrough that's happened and this only happened recently is monochrome
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:20.520]   printing because for you could get good color prints, but it was very hard to do black
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.520]   and white.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:25.840]   And that's a combination of being able to solve this metammerism problem and have multiple
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.840]   black ink.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.840]   That's the key.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:33.160]   And of course, the software side, both Photoshop and aperture allow amazing control over black
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:39.880]   and white prints that we used to not be able to get even basic amateur skill level people
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:45.000]   can go in and adjust the black and white settings in most of the photo manipulation software
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.680]   to really get yourself a nice, contrasty, Ansel Adams style black and white.
[00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:53.240]   We've talked before about is it luminous landscape?
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.320]   Luminous landscape, my friend Michael Reitman.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.480]   Luminous dash landscape.com.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:01.240]   He does amazing black and white prints, big prints with these printers.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:03.240]   And it's a great thing.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:05.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240]   And I think it's a great thing.

[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:18.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:29.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.240]   And I think it's a great thing.

[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:43.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.240]   And I think it's a great thing.

[01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.240]   And I think it's a great thing.

[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:32.240]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.240]   Talking to me.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.240]   And I remember those good old days.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:40.200]   One thing I have learned on my iPhone, you know, that limit of -- you have to be really
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.600]   careful of the limit of SMS's.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:48.200]   For some reason I connected data to SMS, like in my head.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.920]   And by the way, on your AT&T bill, they're very different.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.280]   You have unlimited data.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.280]   You have 200 SMS messages.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.080]   Unless you prepay for them.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.080]   Unless you prepay for them.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.080]   20 bucks to get unlimited or whatever.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.080]   So 20 bucks a month.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:03.080]   Because I've been having my tweets come into my iPhone.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.080]   Well, what happened was --
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.080]   That's incoming, though.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.080]   That includes incoming.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.080]   What?
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.080]   That's incoming.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.080]   Yeah, I'm going.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.080]   Both.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.080]   Any SMS.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.080]   And I -- yeah.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.080]   Well, I looked at the little graph on the AT&T bill.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.080]   And I saw my data, which I guess SMS is kind of folded in on the graph.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.080]   You know, it was like, this is your bill.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.080]   And then it was like, and this is your data bill.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.080]   And my data bill was like an extra 150 bucks a month.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.080]   And I was trying to figure out what -- how could that be?
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.080]   I have unlimited data.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.880]   You know, was it when I was traveling?
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:35.080]   And no, it just turns out it's -- because I do about 1000 SMSs a month.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:39.080]   If it weren't for the unlimited data plan, Justine's phone bill would be $3.2 million.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.080]   Exactly.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.080]   Well, she said that's why she got that 300-page phone bill.
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.080]   It was all tweets.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.080]   It was all SMS.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:48.080]   So anyway, so I was going to itemize each one, you know.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.080]   And then you've got another message at 115.53.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.080]   And another message to 115.54.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.080]   And 115.55.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.080]   And it's not too long before you get a bunch of them.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.080]   You turn off paper billing, that's my suggestion.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.080]   No, I turned it off.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:04.080]   But of course, the billing goes through someone else here at the office.
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.080]   And so so my -- so I turned it off thinking, "Oh, I don't want to burn all that paper."
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.080]   And then last night when I went to Carl Carlita, my phone was dead.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   It said, "You're out of service because you haven't paid the bill."
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.080]   And then by the way, if you're wondering, if you want to turn it back on, you go to the web.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.080]   Don't go to the phone.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.080]   The phone is like a half an hour process.
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.080]   And the web is like a three-minute process to have it turn back on.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.080]   And just in case you're wondering, I went through that last night while swearing and saying,
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.080]   "18T is the devil."
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.080]   And it turned out they weren't.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.080]   It actually worked out fine.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:42.080]   But so, yeah, I leave the paper billing on even with all the SMSs because otherwise the bill doesn't get paid.
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.080]   What's the name of this site again?
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:48.080]   It is SMSMac.com.
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.080]   And it is definitely worth downloading and checking out.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.080]   Cool.
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.080]   And we're all going to get SMS, right?
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.080]   Everybody in the audience is going to get a message.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080]   Everyone in the audience?
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.080]   150,000 SMS messages.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.080]   How much would that cost?
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.080]   That would cost a lot of money.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:08.080]   If I'm thinking, "Grandpa, which would you get an iPhone pre-configured with Carlita's message?"
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:09.080]   I've had my baby.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.080]   And you just set up my hospital bed and say, "Okay, hun, just hit send when you're ready."
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.080]   I'll be outside smoking.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:21.080]   But what I really want is, I want an SMS that I could just email from what I want as a service.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   And this is this part I couldn't find.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:31.080]   I just want to be able to send an email from my iPhone to a service and have it take whatever's in the body and just SMS it out to everyone.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.080]   And that I couldn't find.
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.080]   So this is the next guest.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.080]   Guess what?
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.080]   You're going to get a few emails over the next three days that we'll explain exactly.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.080]   Okay, everyone will tell me how to do it.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.080]   That's what I want.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.080]   If it doesn't exist, someone should write "Krautl's" or something.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.080]   I got one more thing, but we don't know where it came from.
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.080]   We'll try to get this into the notes.
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080]   This is from a fan.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:53.080]   I'm listening.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:58.080]   I'm listening to Scott because I'm the only one that's stupid enough to put my postal address in the wild.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.080]   It's called Merlin Manarisms.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.080]   He printed it on Lulu.
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.080]   It's spiral bound.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:06.080]   And there's a page for every day of the year with Merlin quotes.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.080]   Merlin Man quotes.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.080]   Yeah, it's like a date book for next year.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.080]   Merlin Manarism.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.080]   So great.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:13.080]   And Merlin was here on the show.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.080]   In case you're listening to Merlin, I have your copy in the condo, so I'll just come out of hiding and we'll give it to you.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.080]   I just love this idea.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.080]   And I would love if we could sell him.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.080]   It's on Lulu, so I bet we probably could.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:26.080]   All of his great quotes are...
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.080]   Barbecue potato chips were falling out of his neck beard.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.080]   It'll bring back fabulous memories of Merlin Day's gun by.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080]   Yes, every quote Merlin ever said.
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:40.080]   Maybe we could turn this into an audio book and have Merlin read it.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.080]   It's 54.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.080]   We'll fix it in post.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.080]   Page 55.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.080]   Because there's one per page.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.080]   I didn't mean to be ego assertive about that.
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.080]   There's one that I'm sure that says banana.
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.080]   Got to have banana.
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:01.080]   Following the derigibles of my mind as they drift past.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:08.080]   I have some kind of Super James Bond high priority email that I'll check because it could be something really important.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.080]   Unfortunately, all the ones about the baby didn't make it in.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:16.080]   Some of the ones about the baby have been the most terrifically funny of all mannerisms
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:17.080]   from Merlin.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.080]   I mean, this is great.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.080]   So what was the last one that we saw?
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:25.080]   Oh, he had a fun one when we were saying that he wanted to encourage his daughter to open a restaurant
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.080]   called J. Eleanor Chowder Pants.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.080]   Ooh.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.080]   Don't think about that one too much.
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:34.080]   That's one reason to follow Merlin on Twitter.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:37.080]   In fact, the reason I went back to Twitter, I'll be completely honest,
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:41.080]   is because we don't hear from Merlin because I think he made a deal not to ever contact us again.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.080]   His wife doesn't know he's part of the witness protection thing.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.080]   But he does Twitter.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:47.080]   Twitter.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.080]   Twitter.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:50.080]   You ought to be able to say that, Leo.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.080]   I should.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:57.080]   So he tweets and if you follow Merlin, I think it's actually hot dog ladies.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.080]   Hot dogs, ladies.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.080]   Hot dogs ladies.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.080]   So you follow him on Twitter.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.080]   You can at least get some witticism.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.080]   He puts three or four on a day.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.080]   So he's alive.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.080]   We much love to you, Merlin, the baby and the wife.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:11.080]   Musk has got an auto Twitter.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.080]   He put him all in.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.080]   He put him all in before he left.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.080]   And he's got this little auto Twitter.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:17.080]   Now that's diabolical.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.080]   It's for the Twittermatic.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.080]   Let me just see if there's any.
[01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:25.080]   Here's the last, the last report from Merlin, man.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:29.080]   He says, "Phil Collins, Sting, Lionel Richie, the lot of you.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:35.080]   BH1 Classic refuses to forget the time when each of you totally did not suck as do I."
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:42.080]   I just see him sitting there with the baby and a baby Bjorn rocking back and forth thinking
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.080]   of things to Twitter.
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.080]   Be honest with you.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.080]   I think that's what's going on.
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:48.080]   Well, it's been great to use your studio.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.080]   Thank you so much, Alex Lindsay.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.080]   We love it here.
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:51.080]   Yeah, it's fun.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.080]   Lovely place.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.080]   Thank you for coming out.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:56.080]   Scott Bourne out of your studio, which is just down the road a piece.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.080]   I'm an Anglo studio.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:02.080]   Always happy to stop by and the Apple phones show studios are available for any time we
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.080]   need to use them for Mac break weekly as well.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:05.080]   Cool.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.080]   We should do that.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:07.080]   Next up.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:08.080]   Next up.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.080]   Next up.
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.080]   Com is the place to go.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.080]   Also, we want to thank Leon Alahua.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   Did I say it right?
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:13.080]   Absolutely.
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:14.080]   Thank you.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.080]   I said it right for being here.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.080]   GirlsGoneGeek.tv.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.080]   Yes, thank you.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:20.080]   And that's, we do have kind of a cool announcement about that.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.080]   Oh, yeah?
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:26.080]   At Macworld, we're going to do the first ever GirlsGoneGeek Academy for young girls.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   That's exciting.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   Yeah, we're going to have a little half day conference for girls where they can come and
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.880]   hang out with the GirlsGoneGeek and learn about tech in a non-threatening environment.
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:37.080]   We'll have more details on that later.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   Oh, I want to have you do that.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080]   That's cool, right?
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.080]   That's awesome.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.760]   That's really great.
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   And GirlsGoneGeek is audio.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.080]   We're going to get some video because we do video from time to time.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.080]   We do some video.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.200]   We do video at PME.
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.200]   We do video.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.280]   They do funny little videos.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.240]   The girls are very creative.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:56.800]   And in fact, the new one Heather did is about a robot.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:57.800]   Yes.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:04.080]   When the GirlsGoneGeek Heather, she filmed herself building a robot.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.080]   It's really fun.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.080]   I don't know what she used.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.320]   She actually used an application to time remap it.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.320]   So it's really cool.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:13.080]   And she used too much time on my hands, which apparently she has a lot of.
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.080]   So.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080]   It's aptly named.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080]   That's great.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.080]   Well, thank you, everybody.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.080]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.080]   We'll see you next week.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.080]   Another Mac break weekly.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.080]   It's done.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:28.080]   It's done.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:35.080]   [MUSIC]
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:42.080]   [MUSIC]
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:49.080]   [MUSIC]
