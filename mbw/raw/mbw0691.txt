[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:45.440]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, all the latest Apple news. Renee Richie is here from iMore.com.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.240]   Hello, Renee. Hello, Leo. You're looking fabulous in all your Christmas decorations.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.320]   Yeah, we thought we jolly it up. Jolly the place up a little bit. Actually, we did it all for
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.240]   Laurie Gill, who was to join us on her holiday twit. But, fell ill. You're feeling better,
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.360]   though, yeah? I am. Thank you. Yes. Good. That punk rock lifestyle is tough.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.440]   Laurie also for my more Andi Inako is here. He's living the WGBH Boston lifestyle,
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.240]   which allows for a lot of sleep. Oh, yes. Well, because we get to lean close to the mic,
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.920]   which means we reserve our energy for our opinions. Very relaxing. Also in studio with
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.600]   the Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Core. We were talking on iOS today earlier. Somebody called in to ask
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.400]   about. I still have my K-Tek Tadpole selfie stick. I love that. That you introduced me to. The K-Tek
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.240]   people came at K-Tek. They do the booms for audio and mediums. They are like,
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.520]   yeah. And the CEO of the company, by the way, I didn't realize it took me a little while.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:57.440]   I had to go actually search. So she is in Patriot games. What? She is the red-headed girl that
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.400]   flicks her hair at the bathroom. She's in the bathroom by accident. So he walked into the woman's
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.480]   bathroom. She was doing sound or something. And they said, "We need you to get in here?"
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.600]   I think she did a little acting in her early days. So anyway, it took me a little while. She
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.640]   looked really familiar. I can't figure this out. I dug into it. But... They make high-end booms.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.320]   No, this is the company that does booms. This is the best booms company in the world.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.720]   I don't know, honestly, if it makes a good selfie stick. I mean, it does. It makes a great selfie stick,
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.200]   but it's not an inexpensive selfie stick. It's not an expensive selfie stick. It's not an
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.920]   actual selfie stick. It's an Alex selfie stick. I've got a couple of them in there.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.520]   I do too. You also feel like you could defend yourself if you were taking selfies in a dangerous
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.480]   location. These selfie sticks could hurt someone who had to watch it. They're missing a critical
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.240]   feature of selfie sticks, which is a trigger at the end. They're really boom poles. They're not
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.440]   tended to be like... Selfie sticks. And then I also, on the other end of it, somebody said,
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.720]   "Well, what is that red thing on there?" And that was something I think I'm pretty sure Andy
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.840]   recommended. The gripped phone grip for tripods. Does that sound ring a bell, Andy?
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.320]   Sounds familiar. It's red aluminum. I'm pretty sure... Yes, yes, yes. I bought it because of you.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.560]   It's like a machine aluminum maker. Machine aluminum, yeah. And so that was at the end of my
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.240]   K-Tec and Tadpole. Between the two of them, I had like $600 worth of selfies.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.320]   But the point of doing it is we're trying to figure out how we're going to shoot CES in less
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.240]   than a month. And I want to do it on my iPhone because there's a video on the iPhone. It's so good.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.240]   And so I think I'm going to bring that Tadpole. Can you make a hat Leo? A selfie hat? I should.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.080]   And then wherever you look. I have this helmet I could turn on. Oh, that's creepy.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:56.880]   And then it's Leo the Explorer. Here I'm looking for big game at CES.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:03.600]   I look like Jack Black in Jumanji when I wear this. Yeah. So anyway...
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.400]   You're ready for Captain Spalding? No, that's a good one.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.920]   So I just thought I had backbreak weekly on iOS today. I had the two big recommendations.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.880]   But those are from years ago. Those are pretty old. So he's paying off Leo. He just keeps paying off.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.200]   I think you could get something a little fancier than a selfie stick these days. How about
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:30.960]   your very own Mac Pro? There's Jonathan showing off man. So how many people got Mac Pros?
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.640]   Because you didn't write right now on YouTube. Raise your hand if you got one.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.760]   Well, Justine got one. Marquez and Jonathan. So far that I've seen. Wow. Justine was shooting
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.000]   with all. I haven't seen the footage yet. But I know that she was shooting with an 8k red.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.680]   You can see them in the footage. In the video you see these huge reds like three of them. And
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.000]   Marquez uses reds and you just tell me Jonathan Morrison uses an ARRI Flex or something.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   An ARRI Alexa Mini. So obviously we're not we're using the Canon Vixia $800 camcorder. So obviously
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.400]   we're not going to get that's why they got the list. Yeah, they're shooting in ProRes 4444.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.600]   How many 4s Alex 8 for is there 8 for is after that. So that tells you this Mac Pro is a design
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:21.040]   for but anyway Jonathan Morrison, Marquez Brownlee, I Justine all have. Jonathan's got some very
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.600]   useful benchmarks. I think if you want to see you know the performance not that there's any question
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   it's the fastest Macintosh you could possibly get velcro on the sides. There's these two huge
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   velcro straps on the side of the box that you lift up and pull out before you open the top of the
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.960]   box. Here's the unboxing. There's the straps on the side. This crazy. He's putting it next to the
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:49.360]   previous Mac Pro which is a little bit spherated I think. A lot of those engineers are still working
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.040]   at Apple. All of them have feelings. You could use it as a maybe a monitor stand. Look at there's
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.480]   the velcro. That is wild. You should get it because it starts at $6,000. So you should get at least
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.400]   velcro straps on the box and you don't want to drop anything here. So if they're making the
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:12.080]   unboxing experience like very very safe then that's a very very Apple move. I approve of that.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.080]   This looks like you know like the Pelican cases you would end up putting this in. I mean this looks
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.640]   like this is a series. I think if you spend a certain amount you should get a Pelican case where
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.760]   the question why not. I think that would actually. Is that lined with that can't be styrofoam in
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:33.440]   there. It's lined with like two inch blocks of something. Gold I believe. Hard board it looks like.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.040]   It's usually cardboard. Apple's pretty good. They don't do styrofoam. Hard board design.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.600]   Yeah I know. I would hope they wouldn't ship this. Sometimes I get stuff but just they slap a
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.480]   mailing label on the outside of the box. I would presume they're not going to ship this. It's
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.480]   during the holiday season. But that's how they ship like some other stuff. The Mac Pro. Usually it
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.000]   comes I think when I've gotten them in the past I've gotten them in a brown box. Brown box. Yeah.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.200]   And so it was in a brown box earlier with a big pull out. It's terrifying when you arrive at
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:08.880]   your front door step. There's a box that says think pad. Yeah you know. Like it's the product box
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:13.520]   with the label slapped on it. Apple does that. Thank goodness. No. So here's Jonathan. We're
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.680]   going to Jonathan called me at the beginning of the video so I'm going to use his video but
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.600]   Mark has and also Jonathan apparently has a pretty good sneaker collection it looks like as well.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:26.880]   Yeah. Don't don't tear that hood. This is probably resale value. Oh yeah every single bit of the
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.080]   plastic. Look how big the apple logo is on that. And the stickers are huge. I showed the stickers
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.800]   before they're huge. Did you get stickers that size? Not quite that size but the biggest
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.840]   stickers I think anybody's ever seen in an apple product. He's hiding it. Now I have to say I
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.040]   the they don't get to keep or do they? Do you think they keep these? No. I've never seen a
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.920]   keep thing from apple. Okay. I have these are these are loan. It was all pre Steve. Yeah yes.
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:58.240]   These are oh look how nicely that comes off. That's pretty. Yeah. So these are review
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.560]   loaner review units as typically go out. Others will get these I guess over in time. And they
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.760]   sounded like four terabytes but with all like the double graphics cards which are super super
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:16.960]   powerful and 300 something RAM. I got really that much RAM. Wow. I got I maxed out early
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:22.640]   on iOS today. I maxed out a Mac Pro and XDR monitor. I think $61,000 all in.
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.680]   That's if you buy the wheels and the stand. Go for it. Well I'll try to go for it. You know 400
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.000]   bucks for the wheels. When you already when is it going to get here? The great thing is if you
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.800]   use your apple card to buy it. You get six six percent cash back. Yeah. That's pretty
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.120]   neat. Nice deal. It's the fastest way to make five grand. I ever heard it's been $61,000
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:48.240]   in the Apple store. No someone on Twitter said the baller plays you buy the Mac Pro at the card
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.480]   you use the rebate to buy a Mac book pro and then use that rebate to buy a magic trackpad.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.480]   You go all the way down. There's the math. There's the math. It's cash back all the way down.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.400]   Yeah. So I mean of course I would love one of these but this is not not only not in the budget
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:08.000]   it's not really anything. I spec I spec'd one out to what I would get reasonably. Did you get the
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.200]   add on pro res card that I did. I did. Yeah. The afterburner. Afterburner. Because if you're
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.120]   exporting a lot of video it'd be useful. I would have got it just because of the name. Afterburner.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:22.240]   It's good. Afterburner. So that speeds up. That's that's a dedicated chip for
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:29.840]   transcribe. And so I and since I do everything in pro res it would be useful for me. Yeah.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.320]   Alex what what did you pick? What were the the configuration of the processor speed? I maxed out
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.520]   the car the video cards. I went to about three I think was three I want to say 384
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.680]   384 on um
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:56.160]   say 384 in RAM. 384 gigs. That's probably what he what Jonathan got.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.960]   Because I don't I don't have he's still unboxing we could show the unbox. Let's just have a hard
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.240]   time. I have a hard time knowing what I'm doing. I don't think Jonathan will pull us down for
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:09.680]   showing his undoxel. We encourage you. Yeah. He smells every new smells it. No, no, no,
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.920]   because I would be doing that too because there is a new there is a new computer smell
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.480]   for 30 for $30,000. I'm going to enjoy every sensory. You know what that stands. Look at that.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.440]   That is thick aluminum. That is milled. That is worth the crazy part is murder quality. I watch
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:32.000]   how it attaches to the screen. Is it magnetic? I think it's I think it's the the it's the spring
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.400]   assembly at the top of that, which is what makes it. Let's you move this. You know what? Again,
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.880]   you're spending six grand on this monitor that you're spending six grand more on the computer.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.280]   You're why not buy the stand for credit? Well, so the reason you get the visa man?
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.200]   Enjoy it. Is that with less visa? So the thing is is that I a lot of times I would get a visa
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   mount because I'm a lot of times I use the monitors. I want them to be hanging from something or
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.440]   or I'm going to attach them to something. So the reason that that I like the fact that they
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.120]   they went all out on the stand, but they made it separate was because there's people like me
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.520]   that are going to have a specific use case and may not really want to put the stand on the on the
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.920]   desk. And so then you're like, well, I can't believe I spent all that extra money on the stand.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.120]   So I think that there's an advantage to it. And I think that we're going to see a whole bunch of
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.640]   people put out specialty stands that are taking advantage of the fact that people don't want to
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.240]   spend that kind of money on a stand. Yeah. Look at that. There's the one now watch. Now watch.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.480]   So the back of the monitor, this is the monitor for six grand. This is what you get. You don't get
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.680]   a stand or amount. You get this. It looks like I want that. I want that monitor. I would just
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:36.720]   lean it up artistically on my on myself. Just tilt it against the wall. What could possibly go on?
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.680]   I want two two words. Amazon basics. What a baller move that would be. Wouldn't it be funny?
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:48.640]   Wouldn't it be funny? So he's going to just what I hope he does this. Yeah. Watch. It just it does.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.040]   There's nothing to screw in or put it. Is it that strong? A magnet? Yeah. Wow.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:00.480]   I was like, I don't want to go with this. What? That's crazy. It's just the
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.560]   magnet that's lining up and keeping it from wobbling. But it's actually slotted into a slot,
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:11.040]   isn't it? I refuse to believe that there's nothing mechanically. No, it's just going right in there.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.680]   Well, it's in a slot. So a lot of the way inside on the edge. Yeah. Yeah. It's concave on the inside.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.320]   Yeah. Right. So that's a rarest magnet with a lot of juice. Again, it just allows the
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.120]   designers to go crazy and do what they want to do. Yeah. And I also put it out too that all the
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.400]   prices are even it's not like $4.99. It's like $500. It's not consumer marketing at all. No.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:36.800]   It is. This is $400. This is $1,200. And again, the thing I remember is also for if you're in a
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:44.000]   design locate if you're in like a design firm or if you're in a video, if you're at an edit bay,
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.080]   at effects bay, these are status symbols as much as they are computing my power.
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:54.720]   So I went in an edit suite and the guy had this. I'd be pretty impressed. Yeah, exactly. And
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.880]   you must be good at what you do. It's like we're in a suit. Now, you don't get the keyboard of
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.480]   the track magic trackpad with it, right? You have to buy that separate. Okay. Just want to point
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:12.320]   out keyboard not included. But look at that black and silver trackchat. I want one of those.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:17.440]   I know I was wondering where that came from. That's nice. Apparently, it's only available when
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.240]   you upgrade from on the Mac Pro. You can't just buy it. That might change. But right now,
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:28.960]   the only way you can get it is when you buy the Mac Pro. So you want that $100.99 core version,
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:36.320]   384 gigs of DDR4. Now, Alex, when you suspect it, which video did you get? I got the dual.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:43.520]   So there's that that's really four, right? Is it two by two? I think it is. It's like a lot.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:48.960]   And I would have to do some research. This is cool. It actually has a map of your motherboard
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:54.880]   slots and what's in there. That's very handy. This is part of the system information display.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.200]   I'm not jealous at all right now. I don't know. I don't know.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.360]   All jealous. Jonathan, Jonathan deserves it. You don't want to see the full video.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.320]   Andy and I can sell our houses and go in together. And again, I see this especially painful because
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:17.120]   I bought a few Blu-rays on Black Friday. They spent last night ripping three or four of them and
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.240]   was literally a 12-hour process that ended 10 minutes before the show. And I'm just thinking
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:29.040]   about how fast would that process have gone on one of these? I still think the sweet spot
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:36.080]   by these is part of the sweet spot by these is in three to six months. When all the software has
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.520]   been updated that you might be using that's going to push the envelope of this thing when any
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:46.320]   kind of little bits and pieces of the gamma testing source itself out, gamma testing being
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.840]   everybody who bought the first round. I thought you were going to say when the leases start coming
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:54.960]   back like a Tesla. Yeah, exactly. No, no, no. I mean, I think in three to six months, though,
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.360]   they're going to I think there'll be little updates to the hardware. And then they'll be this is
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.880]   typically on a brand new piece of hardware for anybody, including Apple, there's a
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:10.480]   little bit of warm-up speed. I think that buying it right out of the gate is a scary thing to do.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:16.240]   But let me just say a couple of things. Jonathan's site is youtube.com/TLD
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:27.760]   today. Not yesterday, not in an hour. TLD today. Mark has Brownlee also showing his and look at him
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.600]   bringing in the box. See, there's the box. It doesn't say Apple. It just says heavy, heavy man.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   And I want to see I just seen lifting that box. There's a great scene where he shows that like
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   he's had his Mac Pro in the back as I Mac on the back on the whole time. And then in one of his
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.000]   old videos, he pulls it aside to show the Mac Pro he couldn't have shown you. Oh, he's had because
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.080]   he's had this for weeks, right? For two weeks. Yeah. Did Jonathan Morrison have it that long as
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.280]   well? I guess he did. I think they both had it for two weeks. You'd have to to make that those
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.400]   videos. I mean, they were a lot of benchmarking and stuff. So I'll go check. I just need all right.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.840]   I didn't mean interrupt. I just wanted to make sure that I wanted to give Jonathan his vlog
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:10.880]   because we've shown so much of his video. I just wanted to ask Alex that I think Renee actually
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.880]   hinted at something that's kind of interesting. Like there's going to be a lot of people who can
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:19.920]   profit by this but can't afford it. What would it cost to what do you think it would cost to rent
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.960]   out a piece of hardware like that for a week or a month? Well, I mean, the rule of thumb. So,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.440]   I mean, the rule of thumb on rental is oftentimes, I mean, usually when you're looking at a day rate,
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:35.200]   depending on whether it's considered software or hardware based, you know, or how durable it is,
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:42.320]   it can be anywhere from 10x to 50x. So or 150th or one one tenth. So a lot of times you'd probably
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.800]   rent that fully equipped. You probably rent that out at three to six thousand dollars a day on a
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.280]   three day week. So a three day week means if you rent it for three days, you'll get the rest of
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:57.680]   the week for free. Wait a minute. Just team got two XDR displays. Yeah. Because she's just team.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:04.720]   Two X two and two stands. They'll never want to be split. Two XDR at two.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.760]   It must have feel really good to go to your front porch and see those giant boxes.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:14.400]   I got the matte ones too. And I got a chance to see them again recently. And the
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.400]   first one I've ever seen a matte display that doesn't look dull compared to the gloss display.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.440]   Like they were right next to each other and it just didn't. There was just no glare off of it,
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.440]   but it looked identical because she got one of each for the whole display. I think she went
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.520]   matte this time. She said, I think Jonathan got one of each. It's a thousand dollars
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.960]   for the nano coating on these things. Yeah. But again, the people buying these are not,
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.160]   they're not price sensitive. It is still less than they would be spending on an equivalent
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.080]   calibrated monitor from, you know, Laurie was all over the velcro on the side. It's so awesome.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:55.440]   Sorry. I just love that they did that. Can we upcycle those into like Apple Watch straps?
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:01.120]   That would sell. This would be my bedside table. I think it'd be a very hand.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.880]   Your entranceway bench. And she bought the keyboard. No one bought any of this.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:12.400]   She has the keyboard and this black trackpad and the black mouse. Oh, yeah, the black mouse,
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:16.880]   the grace. I got that with my iMac Pro tonight. We got something different. These are two.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.160]   I think this one again is special because it's silver and black. It's not space gray. So it's
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:27.680]   another like exclusive to the Mac Pro right now. And I tell you what, you put those two monitors on
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:35.920]   your desk. Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Wow. Yeah, that is living the list. You knew desk, Laurie.
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:40.880]   I was just going to say you must have had to get a new desk for that thing right there.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.240]   That really impresses me with all three of these videos. Mark has Brownlee,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.840]   I, Justine, Jonathan Morrison is how clean their offices. Oh, no, they, it's,
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:54.320]   but I think that all of us aspire to have a YouTube channel. It's so popular we can afford
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:58.640]   to have pay rent on an office that you don't do anything but film videos in.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.080]   So your G's greater behind the table. Is your G's greater still sitting there?
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.800]   Yeah. There's a reason why I have this screen behind me and everything because otherwise
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.840]   it would be pretty grim every single week. Yeah. Yeah. And do you have to wear an Apple watch
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.560]   when you do the review? Is that in the contract? No, I think they're choosing to.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:23.200]   They're choosing to. No doubt. Justine was on with you while I was gone doing a Twit
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.480]   Alex. Thank you for bringing her in. I think she's just awesome.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.920]   She is. She's still in the Pittsburgh area. She's in LA. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.440]   So did you think Apple hand delivers those like the guy comes to the door and especially
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:42.640]   marked Apple truck? I think for the one who wants to make you go to them. Oh, you have to go to them.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   That's what I think. Get the briefing. They're like, oh, we have a Mac Pro for you.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.000]   And you have to come to our office. And you better bring in a panel truck because
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.440]   you're not going to be able to put this in the backseat of your Corolla. I don't think.
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:21:00.720]   Yeah. They rarely lend you anything without wanting to make sure that they brief you and
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.880]   coach you a little before you have your first experience. So that's, I'm sure that. But it also
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.800]   makes me think about what does the experience that they give someone who orders these like because
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:18.160]   these are people who are a spending a hell of a lot of money. And also they're probably buying it for
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.800]   a really specific, really important purpose. Can they arrange like same day shipping?
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.280]   If you need to pick one up at a store, is there a priority lane to make sure that no,
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:32.640]   it'll be waiting here for you or we will take the unused the lounge that we put in for the gold
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.640]   Apple watches that we've been using for box storage. We will refurbish that and give you some tea.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.920]   It's a creative pro training session available at noon.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:47.520]   Exactly. Like this is do people do people expect a certain level of different service,
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.480]   whether it's no, please hold my hand or no, just make sure I get it really, really fast.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:56.560]   And I have a problem. You fix it in 10 seconds on a $30,000 item.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.760]   That was the Alex thing. I always imagine like Alex, we want to talk. No, leave me alone. Can we
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:04.320]   set it up? No, do you want this? No, I have my own, I have my own jellyfish ready. Just give me
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.360]   the box and walk away. That's what I want. I don't want the concierge service. Although,
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:16.720]   we aren't quite used to it here in the Le Porte household. Oh, lovey. Oh, lovey. So I have to
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.440]   dress for the occasion, right? Dress for success. Some down our tool will have a Mac Pro.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:27.040]   Actually, I have no intention of buying one. Apple probably knew that. But I know Alex will
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:33.200]   probably get a few. So just so you know, the wheel now know the wheels, as I mentioned, are $100 each.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.520]   Not each. You can't buy them separately. You have to get a floor pack. Okay.
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:44.000]   Actually, I was stunned at the low cost of Apple Care. Apple Care plus for the Mac Pro,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.480]   regardless of configuration is a mere $299. It's good deal. Not bad. The XDR display a little
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.200]   more expensive $500 to $499. Because they're figuring it out. They probably don't have a lot
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:01.920]   of those panels yet. Well, and I think that is more likely to get damaged, to be honest,
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:08.400]   especially if you don't attach the magnet properly. Or just in a movie production. Yeah, or just,
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.440]   you know, somebody gets excited and throws something. A rack mounted version is not available yet.
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.160]   You can pre-order your Mac Pro. When will it come if I order it? December 10th. That's today.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:24.640]   I think that the 19th was the shipping of like the estimated arrival date. By the way,
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.120]   I did the one I put up on Twitter. I expect as a stand up, but I would only buy the rack
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.120]   mountable one. Like that is the to me. That's the I got a chance to see it. It gave me extra
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:38.320]   of chills like just all the feelings. It is pull it out. You pull it was beautiful. It's a 500 bucks
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.640]   extra for the rack mount, but you don't need the wheels. So see, save. Save. Save.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:49.440]   There's a rack mount. So a Mac Mini Loca. The same as server people.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.040]   Is it basically an X-serve? I mean, is it fundamentally the same? It's just what is it?
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.720]   It looks like I don't think it has a redundancy. It looks like I think it's five or six of you.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.200]   It's pretty thick. It's amazing. Is the cooling different if it's rack mount?
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.440]   Like is it louder? I don't think so. I don't think so. It's pushing so much air,
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.360]   but it doesn't have the redundancy of the mat. Like I think the the X-serve had redundancy for a lot
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:17.280]   of the different elements. Yeah, because X-serve was a screamer as just like any server that was
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:23.600]   designed for that use. A lot of people were like kind of interested in getting one as a home
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.080]   thing, even as a home server. And they were dissuaded of that rather quickly when they saw
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.120]   one actual option. And I'm wondering whether because it's more expensive, whether there's a
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.200]   reinforced front or something like I'm trying to figure out what makes it more expensive than
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.720]   the other one. And whether there's you can't it makes me think that you can't convert one to the
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:46.000]   other. Like it you have to buy it as a rack mount or buy it as a stand up. I think that's true.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.160]   That's a little bit of a bummer. The $5,000 Apple Pro Display XDR doesn't even have a webcam.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.280]   No, no, that's just one more thing and put tape on. You don't you don't want it. But I'm happy
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.840]   it's not a 720p webcam because that would be really so depressing.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.880]   It is an elaborate middle finger for people.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.240]   It's our new eyesight cam. This is the web page. If you go to the store and they
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.480]   lead off right at the top, save with business pricing. They know who's buying this. And we're
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:22.480]   here to help contact us. So this is I mean immediately they say the whole front is different. If you
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.200]   go back to the rack mount one, the whole front piece is different. Yeah, it's nice. I would
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.040]   definitely that would be definitely the one that I'd be. Yeah. And I, you know, honestly, if you're
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.440]   using this in an edit bay or a lot of places, this would be a rack. I wonder if it slides out,
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:40.400]   because it still has the handles on the front. Oh, yeah. I wonder if it's got rails and it
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.760]   actually slides out. These switches are clearly.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.280]   Switch. You pull those and the whole thing comes out forward towards you. And then you unlock the
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:58.960]   top and you can take it off. Yeah. Nice. Nice. I have an update on the webcam situation,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   courtesy of a circuit breaker column on the verge. Logitech made it bespoke. $200 magnetic 4k
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:11.680]   webcam for Apple's Pro Display XDR. And by the way, a lot of folks don't, a lot of folks that would
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   be using that monitor in a production environment would not want a webcam. They literally walk in
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.200]   and all those webcams are taped over. Yeah. So, so it wouldn't be unusual for them to not put it.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:30.560]   So you got the two Radeon Pro Vega two duos? Yeah. So that's only a $10,000 upgrade for the
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:37.200]   two by 32 gigs of what is HBM two memory? I don't even know what that is. Super fast memory.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.720]   Super fast. Okay. That's all I need to know.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.000]   By the way, Leo, if you spec this out, it is still cheaper than any of the cameras that those
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.360]   people use to film today. Right. Isn't that interesting? You know, an Alexa 25 is going to cost you a
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.080]   more. I think I put in two terabytes of, I believe I put two terabytes of storage. I don't need four
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.800]   because I don't really use it. Is it shockingly stupid that it comes to 250? No, because because
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.840]   so the reason you do 256 is because that's the operation. A strong way to do a strong,
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.880]   there's a strong argument that you don't give the internal system any hard thing. Anything.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.920]   And it forces the user to push all of the storage. It's a thunderbolt. So it's fine. It's
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.960]   equal. You fast. And it just means it keeps everybody from saving things to their drive and,
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:25.600]   you know, no, no, you only. That's what the studios wanted because it was all going on
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.840]   their network. They're huge system network systems anyway. Yeah. They have sands,
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.680]   which are really fast. Yep. And that's where the assets go. So all you really need is Mac OS
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:41.120]   and final cut. And you're done. Right. They just wanted it to boot. Yeah. Just has to do it. But
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.320]   Alex, you know, it's just money to terabytes. Well, I think there'd be things that I want to do
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:50.080]   internally. So I don't want to have to do it. Afterburner, because you work with ProRes.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.440]   By the way, those John is pointing out our studio manager. Obviously is looking into buying
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:00.480]   one of these because he says, easy to add more memory. Yes, it's not like a module. So maybe
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.120]   don't get so much memory and get it third party or no, I would have instructions up on
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:10.000]   Apple and how to do the memory changing stuff. Somebody will sell it cheaper. But to go from 32
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.080]   gigs, the stock distribution, I mean, I don't know what it's like anymore. The issue is, in my
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:22.080]   younger years, we really paid a lot of attention to RAM. The number one thing that made a difference
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:25.600]   between a stable system and an unstable system was the quality of the RAM. And we used to have
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.760]   these little program that electric image made that would test our RAM all weekend. We just run it
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:35.360]   and would find all the air blocks. You don't want to back this is DDR4. So I ECC. So this is good,
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:41.840]   good quality RAM. It is I should point out a $6,000 upgrade to go to 384. The reason is, is that I
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:46.560]   actually have a project that needs 256. So I was like, it went from one night. If there was a 256
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.680]   there, I would have gone to 256. If you have to ask, you can't afford it. It's $25,000 more.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.480]   To get one and a half terabytes. Who would need a terabyte and a half? Well,
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:03.280]   scientific calculations are definitely in that range. Artificial intelligence keeping models.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:11.680]   That's a lot. There's definitely simulation issues that would that RAM is an issue.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.720]   Or chrome taps, Leo. I mean, if you have a lot of chrome taps,
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.680]   chrome taps, man, those are the words. It doesn't sound like a lot of consultants are really going
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:26.240]   to earn their keep by advising people on how to configure this properly for your own specific needs.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:32.000]   Because I have not I'm not done the analysis myself. I've been reading a bunch of other people who
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.760]   have been saying that like, if you have the minimum configuration, you would actually not have a
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.280]   machine that was any faster than an iMac or properly spec MacBook. I think a lot of people
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.560]   who are going to thinking, Hey, as long as I max out this, as long as I max out that, it's so far
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:52.240]   above the average user's pay grade so far above my pay grade to make sure I know that no, I want
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.880]   to make sure I put money into memory. I don't actually need storage or this CPU would be nice,
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.720]   but the getting saving money and putting it into an external rate would be even better.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.880]   I apologize. You do get a keyboard in a mouse. I thought you did not. You do get a
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:13.280]   Christmas. Merry Christmas from Apple. Silver and black in. Oh, it's a magic keyboard. Yeah.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   Cold mistocking. Oh, and again, I'll point out a bunch of people did comparison videos between
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.800]   buying a new Alexa or buying a new red camera and the process and the cost was very similar to this.
[00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:27.600]   I think I went back and forth with someone on Twitter about this. When I was at ILM,
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.640]   for the time I was working on SGI's, I was working on an octane, which I believe was a
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.880]   $60,000 piece of hardware and I was without the monitor. Absolutely. So it's everyone who's
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.240]   flooding Twitter with $75,000 delves today. They're all showing how much they're delving.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:46.320]   You couldn't build a delve that would be this. A lot of this is things like the afterburner.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:52.080]   You just couldn't get. So this is a unique device only Apple could sell. It's not out of the
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:57.760]   range for comparable hardware. And fundamentally, Final Cut was actually being held back by the
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:03.360]   fact that you couldn't buy a Mac that was powerful enough to really do big work. So somebody in the
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.600]   chatroom said that one of the benefits of this of Apple selling this is eventually
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.480]   many of these technologies will be in our price range in years to come. Is that that's the case?
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:18.240]   Especially the display technology. They're doing mini LED and blue diffusion and all sorts of
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:24.160]   amazing stuff. I wanted everything soon. So this is, I've even been saying this,
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   Apple should design some stuff as if price is no object to say this is what we can do.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.320]   That's the best that we can do. And if you look at the difference, but if you go from Mac Mini
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:41.040]   to the fully Mac Pro, you're talking about a pretty, there's a lot of steps along the way
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:48.960]   that give you a lot of price, price, flexibility from $600 bucks, $600 all the way up to $60 grand.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:55.120]   No, and Apple is a company that knows they can design something like this and they will sell
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:59.760]   enough to just, I would imagine sell enough to justify it. I don't know if they'll make money on
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:04.560]   it, but they'll sell enough. And it's just like I was talking on Twitter about the Ford GT, a million
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:11.280]   dollar card, the Ford designs for racing. They don't expect to sell many of them. It polishes
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:17.200]   the blue oval, as they say at Ford. It's good for the shiny Apple. It shines up the Apple.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:22.480]   And it pushes technology forward. So there are numerous benefits and Apple, God knows, can afford
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   this. And when I say this, I mean the R&D to do something like this. It did take them.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.400]   But they're also, they have internal teams now. Like they, when we were at WWDC, they have
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.280]   internal team staff by ILM and Pixar. Like they all left ILM and Pixar and recording studios and
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.520]   went to work at Apple. And they're the ones saying, no, this is what we need. If you really want to
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.280]   be doing this kind of work, you need to give us these tools and they're listening, like all
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.120]   credit in the world, they're listening to these pros and they're building up. Like some pros said,
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.200]   we need wheels because when we're on our production lot, we're not moving those feet very far.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   Give us wheels now. All right. Hear your wheels. Yeah. Now, the other side of this, it is more
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.280]   like car development. It took them what must have taken them at least two years. That's, it was two
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:07.840]   years ago, right, that they announced that they were going to do it. In those two years,
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   it's a moving target. For instance, the AMD Ryzen processors have come out and they're
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:20.480]   beating the Intel processors. Maybe they should, Nvidia would have been a better choice from the
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:25.760]   professional point of view. I think Alex thinks that right. Yeah. So the problem is you're aiming
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:31.200]   at a moving target and maybe this, this is another example of a computer that's a little bit
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:36.400]   behind the eight ball because it took so long to develop. Is that I think that those choices
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.600]   aren't going to change for Apple anytime soon. They're not, they wouldn't go to, I don't even
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:45.520]   go to AMD. Nvidia stuff. They're doing with AMD. Sorry. Yeah. No, I was going to say like,
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.640]   Nvidia will not let them you like Apple has basically abstracted everything away. That's how
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:53.120]   they can do afterburner. It's how they can do the T2 chip on the Mac Pro is how they can,
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.480]   they basically sit there and they decide where everything is going to go. They have very intelligent
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:02.240]   services that just, I forgot what the right word is. But but AMD lets them do it.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:06.800]   AMD lets them right to the metal and videos like no, you know, we're Nvidia. We don't have to
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.400]   battle, you know, bend the knee to you. You're going to use CUDA cores and you're going to like it.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.520]   Do you think they, if given the choice at this point, Ryzen would have been,
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.480]   Ryzen doesn't come with Thunderbolt 3. So you'd have to add some additional circuitry, I guess.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.840]   I guess part of the problem. But I, I'm not getting them on the motherboard.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.920]   They're built around Intel at this point. I don't think that that, and I don't think that that is.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:31.200]   That's not making such a huge difference. No. There's going to be a 64 core Ryzen thread
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.400]   ripper in a few months. So good. That's a lot more than 28 core. Do you care?
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:42.080]   I don't, I mean, now you're really getting into some, some big computing. I think that for the
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.000]   entertainment market, that is probably going to be the largest market for this computer. I think
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.040]   that what they're providing is a benchmark is 8K, right? What they're building is a machine that
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:57.520]   can do 8K or in a music studio do a hundred logic pro tracks or lots of layers. I mean,
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:02.480]   so the other thing is stack. How many 4K can you stack up? How many, you know, there's lots of
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:09.120]   things that people need. Except it doesn't come as Burke says with a bench seat surrounding it,
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:15.840]   like a cray. Water towers. The water towers. Or like that quantum computer doesn't hang from
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.480]   your ceiling. Well, I'm going to do right now about 43 ads. Maybe I can buy one.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:26.400]   Can I sneak eight in myself so I can at least get a new activity?
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.800]   Go fund me. Let's all get out of our offer codes real quick.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:38.880]   I'm sure I'm sure a lot of us are thinking I was really saving the go fund me for if I get hit by
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:44.800]   a car and I have $130,000 in medical bills that I can't pay. But you know what? Maybe I'll please
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   this card on a Mac. Unfortunately, like a lot of things you can buy including jewelry, watches,
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:57.760]   heirlooms, the Mac Pro is not going to gain in value next year. You can't sell it for more.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:02.560]   The big argument for any any pro purchase is how fast can you get the money back.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:07.440]   Right. So if you're charging the work you're doing, if you're charging $1500 a day and this
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:11.360]   is going to go into that studio, then you're going to amortize that very quickly. You know,
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.760]   where if you're just doing it at home for hobby projects, there's no probably won't get the money
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:22.960]   back. Of Marquez Brownlee, Justin, is Eric, and Jonathan Morrison, which of those three will
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.000]   actually end up buying one of these? I bet you, Martin, this does. I bet you anything.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.840]   Jonathan has that $30,000 Sony studio monitor now. So I'm sure this is a this is a more affordable
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.680]   alternative for him. I wouldn't be surprised if Justine buys one. They're all doing pretty well.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.960]   They're all doing well enough. I couldn't. I don't know if you buy it.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.760]   It's a top doubt one, but I bet you I couldn't be surprised about one.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.960]   And the and the truth is they could use it. Unlike they're producing big videos every,
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.200]   I mean, like, higher, you know, 4k 8k.
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:58.080]   I'm not even joking. It's kind of an opt to occupational hazard of our work that sometimes,
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.640]   like we get a loaner that we have for 30 or 60 days. And then by the time we send it back,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:09.520]   we realize that my God, this this this pixel book is so exactly what I need for this problem I have
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.320]   in my workflow that, damn it. Okay, I'm returning this, but I'm also making a trip to the store
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:17.840]   and I'm buying one. So I wouldn't be surprised if I like it. The worst is when like it fixes one
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:22.080]   thing, not enough for you to buy it. But man, do you miss it? It's all right. Right. Yeah.
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:26.640]   That's why Apple said, yeah, take it for a few weeks. Try that. See how you like it.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.680]   Mark has apparently said that he would buy more ram than the 384 it came with.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.240]   I'd be curious what he's doing that required it. I'm really curious. Because I literally, I
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:42.320]   have a big appetite for ram, but I was having a hard time visualizing what I would hit personally
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:49.280]   over about 256. So you don't know that he has a secret AI doll in his house that he's.
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:56.720]   He's running windows at the same time. Well, he'll he'll he'll be put on a reservation on a
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:02.160]   Tesla truck. So he's got a lot of all those hard edges. You can't anti alias them when they're
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:08.480]   treating video that stuff. So let's take a break. This will pay the power bill, not for my Mac
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:15.520]   Pro. Nice. Take a little break. Ani and Iko Renee Richie, Lori Gill, Alex Lindsey all here.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:24.240]   Lots more to talk about, including iOS 13.3. Is that what do we get? But first, a word from our
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:30.320]   sponsor, the great folks at health IQ. It's a life insurance agency. If you've been looking at
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:36.000]   life insurance, there's one thing you should be aware of. To most life insurance companies,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.320]   you're just a number. That's how they figure out, you know, how much to charge you for your life
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:46.400]   insurance, how much you can get. It's all done statistically on an actuarial tables. And one of
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:53.120]   the things they're not very good at is pricing it for health conscious people. If you exercise
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:58.560]   every day, if you pay attention to what you eat, if you're health conscious, there's no way that
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:06.560]   health insurance life insurance company rather can quantify that. You need an agent who will
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:12.080]   represent you to them and get you better rates. There are better rates for healthy people for
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:19.360]   life insurance. Health IQ uses science data to lower life insurance rates for people, healthy
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:24.400]   people like you. You exercise four or more times a week. You get a minimum of eight hours sleep
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.920]   on average. You're doing everything right for your health. You need health IQ. You can get a
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:36.720]   million dollars in life insurance from a top rated agency, a top rated company from $36 a month.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:42.640]   See, what really the truth is those of us who are careful about our health are really subsidizing
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.840]   the less health conscious people. I'll say it that way. That's a little nicer. The less health
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.200]   conscious people. It's not a conspiracy. It's just how life insurance works.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:57.040]   You might be healthy, but how does your insurance company know that? If you're a runner, a cyclist,
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:01.840]   if you're in a crossfit, if you're an athlete, maybe a vegetarian or a vegan, you deserve to be
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.320]   rewarded for your hard work with more affordable life insurance rates. And guess what? These companies
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.920]   will give it to you if you've got health IQ negotiating on your behalf because physically active
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:17.840]   people have significantly lower risks for heart disease and cancer and diabetes. Health IQ is a
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:24.080]   life insurance concierge. They give you white glove service. They walk you through the entire
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:31.680]   process of applying. Alex, my account agent was so great. So understanding it took a lot of time
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:36.320]   to explain what's going on. You're getting underwritten by one of the top 30 insurance companies,
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:42.480]   all the big names you know. But these are savings you can only get through health IQ. You won't
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:46.960]   find them anywhere else. Of course, you have to qualify to get these special rates. So it starts
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:53.120]   with the health IQ quiz, a scientific way to assess your own health literacy. It's not a health
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.440]   assessment. It's not a self assessment. It's a knowledge assessment. They put together a team
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.080]   of the nation's leading medical health and fitness experts to create cutting edge analysis.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.600]   Depending on your score as well as other related qualifying factors, things like,
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.760]   will you wear a Fitbit or an Apple Watch? If you're already wearing an Apple Watch,
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:16.640]   can we have the information from that to verify? You can save up to 41%.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:22.560]   41% on your life insurance premiums compared with other providers. There's no commitment.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.160]   And actually, it's kind of fun. You'll learn more about potential opportunities to be
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:30.960]   rewarded for your commitment to living healthy. It is a wonderful concierge service. Health IQ,
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:39.200]   go to health IQ, H-E-A-L-T-H-I-Q.com/MacBreak, take their special health IQ quiz,

[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:54.720]   but I know a lot of you really pay attention to this stuff. I know I do. And I think this is a
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:42:04.320]   really valuable service. Health IQ.com/MacBreak. One good example, actually,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.720]   Aunt Prue was talking about this, because he lifts. He's a lifter. You know this, Alex, too.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:15.440]   His BMI makes him look like he's morbidly obese. He's not. But the muscle weight is so high for
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:20.880]   his height that they just assume. You send the BMI to the health, the life insurance company,
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.960]   and they'll say, "Well, that's off the charts." And so you'll get a terrible rate. That's what
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:30.160]   Health IQ does. They help represent you to the agency, the life insurance company, so that
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:36.320]   you get what you deserve, even if you are a lifter or you're extra healthy. It's a really good idea.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:45.440]   HealthIQ.com/MacBreak. Let's see. What else? I was so excited about the MacPro. I didn't even
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.800]   pay attention to anything else going on anymore. Anything else happened? Well, I did get 13
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:57.280]   point three on iOS. There were rumors coming out on Monday. It came out today. I haven't done
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:02.480]   my iPad yet. It's a pretty quick download. Let me ask you this, Renee Richie. You probably know.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:10.800]   So the download is like 30 seconds. Then it says, "Preparing Update." That takes like 10 minutes.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.880]   Mike and I were talking about this earlier on iOS today. Mike said, "Well, they're unzipping
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:18.640]   the file." I said, "No, they got to be doing more than that. It wouldn't take so long." What is
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:23.840]   preparing update do? Do you know? I don't know if they're still doing that, but what they were
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.640]   doing for a while when they were testing different things, especially with APFS, is they were basically
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.560]   making a safe environment to install it so that it didn't work. They could roll it back and you
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   wouldn't get it. That was my exhibition. They're like, "Okay, everybody move over. We're going to make a
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.080]   little place here. We're going to put it here to make sure everything works right. I bet you they
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:49.280]   still do that." Also, in order to get such a small download, I would bet you that they then
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:55.120]   that download then looks at what components you've got and then vectors in more stuff maybe,
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.800]   depending on what they're... Well, it's a delta to begin with, so they're giving you the bits,
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.920]   but just because the delta doesn't mean it still doesn't have to update a bunch of stuff.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:08.080]   Yeah. It's an interesting question. I don't know. I'll do it on my iPad just to see.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:15.920]   Let's see here. Software update. It is 13.3, which feels like that should be an important one,
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.680]   right? Because it's not a double dot release. It's a single dot release. I mean, normally,
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:24.400]   that would be March or June. I know. We're really early. Every update to 13 is an important
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.360]   release with all the bugs that they're finding and killing. Yes. So don't wait. They don't talk
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.840]   about what security patches there are, but they do say they're bug fixes. I would guess that there
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:40.400]   are important security patches. They often are quiet about what all the details are.
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.920]   Well, they... Because they have to acknowledge people, so they have that page that they update
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:51.040]   and find it. I don't see it yet. It says the generic security stuff. I mean,
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:58.080]   they're my passcode and then C. The first thing it does is it puts you in a queue, I think,
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.400]   update requested. So that's what's going on right now. I'll let you know when it starts to
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.280]   download. We can time it. But on the iPhone, it was very, very quick.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:11.920]   I think there's some new feature clips now. I don't know if that was part of this. It does
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:16.480]   ememojis. We played with that a little bit on the iPhone today. Terrifying.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:23.600]   What else? What else is in here? There's... Yeah, now it's downloading 49 seconds.
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   I mean, I know we're on a fast Wi-Fi network, but that's not long at all. And yet it takes
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:38.800]   minutes, many minutes to do the preparing. Anyway, worth it to get it. Apple also says
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:43.760]   they're pushing out a software update sometime soon to fix an issue that I have not had with the
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:50.000]   new 16-inch MacBook Pro and speakers popping. Yeah, I haven't had that either. I've seen a
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.720]   lot of people ask about it, but I have not had a pop or a peep. But the good news is it's software
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:01.200]   related. I think the speakers on the 16-inch are so good. Best I've ever heard on a laptop of any
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.800]   kind. Good enough that I frequently will not plug in headphones. I'll just watch or listen to music.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.560]   I was listening to Mark Kes's video and it felt like he was standing and walking all around me.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.400]   I don't know how they're doing that. The sound stage is really excellent on it.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:19.360]   It uses Dolby Atmos. And if it doesn't have Dolby Atmos available, it uses Apple's proprietary
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:27.520]   spatial placement, 360, whatever 3D spatial placement. When using Final Cut Pro 10, Logic Pro 10,
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:34.000]   QuickTime Player, Music, Movies, or other applications to play audio, users may hear a pop come from the
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.040]   speakers after playback has ended. So it's not in the music. It's after it's ended. Apple is
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:43.920]   investigating the issue of fixes, planet, future software updates. So this is a bulletin that
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.520]   went out to service providers. Do not set up servers or replace the user's computer.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:55.200]   This is a software related issue. So something you'll be getting at some point.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:02.400]   By the way, I think we were clear, but 13.3 is something you want right now. You always
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.840]   want to get these as soon as possible.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:20.240]   What else? You may remember when one of their design wizards for their chips left Apple.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:28.400]   Apple is now suing their former chief architect of iPhone and iPad microprocessors. He quit in
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:37.520]   February to found a data center chip design business called Nuvia. And Apple is now suing
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:42.400]   Saint Gerard Williams, who is the CEO of Nuvia, broke his employment agreement while setting
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.680]   up his new enterprise. Fairly typical that they'll have non-competes. Although those are illegal.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:53.360]   There's a couple of things here that's really first. If the register could stop using iGiant
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:58.400]   eight times in every article, I will pay them cash money. They used to call it the fruit company.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.520]   But once it's fine, but iGiant like several times in an article, it's just the couple of
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:07.680]   things that are fascinating to me here is they have a version of Apple's complaint, but it's
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:13.920]   been redacted, but not by Apple. So why would the register get it and redact it and put it up?
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:21.600]   There might be a reason for it. I found a version that was not redacted. It didn't take very long.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:27.760]   But the register is version. The other thing is Apple doesn't do this. There have been so many
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:33.680]   people who leave, even highly positioned people, even people who didn't leave on bad terms at all.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.000]   And I looked as long as I could last night until the wee hours, and I could not find a single
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.600]   instance of this happening before. The other case that comes to mind is when
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:53.920]   what's his name left? Google and went to Waymo and Google sued saying, and one, I believe,
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:59.440]   he brought a lot of technology from Google's self-driving, went from Waymo to Uber. I'm sorry,
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:07.760]   Corey Lewandowski, not Corey, but Lewandowski. It brought technology from Google's Waymo to Uber.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:13.040]   They sued, and I think they wanted that case. Non-compets are not legal in California, but
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:20.800]   non-disclosure and secrets are definitely still under the... So that's the thing that's the
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.480]   angle that they're going after. So you can say that non-compets are... You can't do non-compets,
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:31.360]   which is true. They accused him, I believe, of downloading a significant amount of data before he
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:37.600]   left. Anthony Lewandowski, Corey Lewandowski, of course, the other convictant felon who worked
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:43.680]   as campaign manager for the president. So my guess for this, and I'm conspiratorial,
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.800]   so this is just my guess, is that he is a legit genius, and he knows where Apple is going with
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:53.120]   its processors, and that includes what we've all been waiting for with their processors.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:57.440]   And this is not an unaligned business that he wanted to start. And I couldn't tell whether
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.360]   register, but I think it was Apple that intimated that he was starting this company to sell it back
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:06.000]   to them. So I just can't help but thinking he had a super good idea for exactly the chips that
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.160]   Apple was going to need three to five years out and figured that he had to give it to Apple.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:17.040]   But if he left and started the company, he could get like a millions of dollars for the buyback.
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.080]   Right. And that's not an, I mean, I've never seen it happen. I mean, I don't know what Apple,
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:24.080]   but with other companies, that has been something that's happened frequently, which is that someone
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:30.160]   leaves a Google or a Facebook goes out and builds something and then sells it back to them.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.800]   So here in the, in Apple's pleading, new Vias mission appears to be to build chips,
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:40.320]   levering technology, leveraging technology directly related to what Williams was developing for Apple.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:45.520]   And he never disclosed this extension of his work at Apple or the existence of this competing
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:52.160]   venture. He was required to disclose to Apple in his intellectual property agreement as a
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.880]   condition of employment if he did that. So that's, I guess where they're going. It's kind of not
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.280]   exactly a non compete. Well, I think that if he had gone to make like toys, like he had a great
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.720]   idea for chips that would work in toys and Apple's like, we're never going to make those. And he's
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:09.360]   like, okay, I'm leaving, I'm starting a toy co Apple would be like, you know, good luck.
[00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:14.240]   Tell Johnny, we say hi when you see him on the weekends, but he's like making the stuff that Apple
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.440]   wants. And he has, he knows what they're working on.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:22.080]   When he resigned in February, he told colleagues, this isn't the court
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:27.760]   pleading. He wanted to start another journey, one with family and friends to spend more time
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:33.520]   with his children and quote, chill and quote, in fact, he was doing none of this.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:40.960]   He apparently recruited coworkers to leave with him. I'm sure that was offensive to Apple.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:47.120]   Numerous of those recruits would join him at Nuvia. Apple, and this is to your point,
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.760]   this is exactly what they say. Apple does not litigate with past employees regularly.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.160]   However, Williams actions and competing with Apple while at the same time working for Apple,
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:00.880]   jeopardize years of hard work by hundreds of people and millions of dollars invested.
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:04.720]   Apple has no choice to protect its business and so files is complaint seeking relief.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.760]   So I think that that that kind of answers all the questions.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.600]   I have a feeling they take this stuff very, like with their Google, like they didn't,
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.800]   they didn't do a lot of people, like they have these feelings where they're right or wrong,
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:18.720]   that there's been an injustice, that you know, someone has done something wrong. And that seems
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:22.320]   to be when they take action. Like they don't act like a normal corporation with like,
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.960]   if it checks box B and C, then file the paperwork.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.520]   Isn't that funny?
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:28.000]   They really have a sense of grievance like, you know,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:28.320]   Yes.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:33.280]   But we were so good to you. Why would you treat us like that?
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.240]   It's pretty funny. I mean, for a big company, it's funny.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:44.400]   Um, let's see. Apple privacy director Jane Horvath will be speaking at CES.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.040]   It's a, I guess we're going to have to go to this, a consumer privacy round table.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.600]   So Apple doesn't have a booth at the consumer electronic show.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:58.480]   They won't be showing off new products. But Horvath will be there to talk about privacy,
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:03.520]   which of course is a huge issue for the entire tech industry.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.280]   And Apple seems to be on the right side of that.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:10.480]   It's a pretty big deal. This is the first time in what, over a decade that they've sent somebody
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:14.080]   in an official capacity, meaning flying the Apple colors,
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.960]   meeting probably was holed up in a suite for four days, practicing and being briefed on and
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:23.440]   discussing with her equals what she's going to say and I was just going to respond to things.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:30.160]   Mac rumors say that the last official appearance, appearance of CES by Apple was 1992,
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:36.560]   when John Scully went to show off the Apple Newton, that'll give you some idea of how long it's been.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:44.320]   Holy cow. Uh, it does send employees. They always have, uh, you, you've, right, Renee, there's,
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:48.720]   there's briefing rooms and stuff. There's Apple, Apple retail has a huge presence there because
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.840]   they're buyers. You know, they're, they're the same way. The best buy buyers are there, but also
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.840]   Apple marketing. And I'm sure a bunch of people to talk to all their home kit accessory and other
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:02.800]   parkways and it's done preparing the update. I'm going to install now.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.840]   I don't think the install takes that long either. Of course there will be.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:12.480]   And I think we're going to see a much, uh, more intense fight over getting access to messenger
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.240]   and, and iPhones and so on and so forth from the federal government. We saw something about that.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:20.400]   I think today or yesterday where there's an, you know, the, the US government is going to make
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:26.240]   another push at that. And I think as, as users, it's going to be our job to, in the same way that
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:30.640]   we push back and other things, there's going to have to be like email, mail, campaigns,
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.720]   wobbly margins. Like people have to see that there's a lot of people out here that
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:39.360]   we're not going to put up with that. Yeah, this has become a very big hot topic.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:47.520]   Facebook just told, uh, it's a US attorney general bar, uh, in a, in a, uh, a letter it wrote to
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:52.880]   leaders in the US, UK, who's also pushing for this, uh, and Australia, where they actually have a law
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:57.520]   preventing. Oddly enough, it's all the pushes are from the five eyes. Yeah, the five eyes. Facebook
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:03.280]   tells US attorney general, it's not prepared to get rid of encryption on WhatsApp and messenger.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:10.160]   Now it could just be saber rattling. I don't know, but, uh, uh, this, this is, uh, I think Apple's
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.440]   going to, you know, be doing the same thing. I hope others will do the same thing. Um, it's got to be
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:22.720]   very clear that we don't, this is the quote, uh, from Will Cass cart, uh, head of, uh, WhatsApp
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:28.560]   and, uh, Stan Chudnowski, head of messenger. It's simply impossible to create such a back door for
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:34.800]   one purpose, i.e. law enforcement and not expect others to try and open it. People's private
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   messages would be less secure and the real winners would be anyone seeking to take advantage of
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.840]   that. We can security. This is not something we're prepared to do. Yeah. This is where we're
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:51.200]   starting to get into that kind of scary. So, you know, I buy Apple products part in part because I
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:58.160]   do understand that they put privacy at the forefront, but at the same time, I'm at their, I'm, I'm at
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.920]   their behest. If they just decide to flip that switch and make a back door for whatever reason,
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.560]   even if they're forced to buy the government, that, you know, they are my, my voice to the
[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:17.440]   government. I don't want this. So if they somehow have to or choose to change that, then, you know,
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:23.840]   everything that I've put my trust in is just out the window. And I've always thought of this. I,
[00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:30.960]   I champion that Apple has this, um, privacy centric viewpoint, but I also understand as a
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:37.520]   giant corporation, they don't have to do anything like that. And they can change anytime they want
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:43.840]   to. And I'm constantly battling against that idea of, well, right now they're protecting my privacy,
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:47.600]   but what will they do next year? I think the case of Apple, I think it would be the only,
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:52.560]   the only organization that will get Apple to crack this open is the Supreme Court.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.360]   Like, I think it would have to go. It would have, it would take anything to court and they'll run it
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:03.040]   all the way to the end of the, I think that would be the, the, the last ditch area for them to,
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:09.280]   and what happens if the Supreme Court says no, you got to do it in a complicated situation?
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.680]   Yeah. I mean, are we doing that with Australia? And I think that to that point, I think that to
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:21.360]   that point, I think that we need to be pushing the democratic, uh, nominees to commit one way or
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:26.640]   the other, or whether they're going to protect privacy or not. Like flat out, it might be the
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:30.880]   most important thing or one of the most I can tell you any, any nominee, I don't care what else,
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:35.600]   what else they're talking about, any nominee that says that they're, that they would crack into a
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:42.720]   phone, I'm not voting for them. Like zero chance that I vote for them. Yeah, it's, we're waiting
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:46.800]   for this to get in the hands of Congress because we, we, if there's one thing that we learn about,
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:52.000]   controlling what tech companies can do, there is regulation, then there's legislation. If you're
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.600]   trying to regulate them, meaning an agency of a federal agency decides that here's a policy and
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:02.640]   here's the penalties for violating that policy, you can always appeal an appeal an appeal an
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.400]   appeal and they got to negotiate at some point. But if there's a federal law against a certain
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.640]   action, you're kind of screwed. You're, you're at some point, you'd have to decide,
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.320]   might be willing to go to jail for this. And I don't think anybody at large company who just
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:20.080]   simply wrote a piece of software to help people is going to be expected to go to jail to, to protect
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:26.320]   like a billion dollar company or that kind of a policy. So this, I agree with Alex. It's, uh, I've
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:33.360]   always thought that, uh, the thing missing from one of the things missing from the bill of rights,
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.960]   because, uh, 300 years ago, 200, 50 years ago, they didn't have any idea that this technology
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:43.760]   would ever exist is the basic question, do I have a right to keep something secret from the
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:49.200]   government? Do I have a right to know something that the government doesn't know? Because before
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:53.120]   now, if there is something like, there's either something that's inside my head, in which case,
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.600]   I don't have to necessarily say it or testify to it, or I've written it down, in which case,
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:01.760]   there is no matter how well I protect it, no matter what kind of a vault I put into it,
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.560]   the government has the ability to find it, get saw that thing open and get into it.
[00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:10.560]   We finally have a thing where I can keep records that I don't have, I don't happen to memorize myself,
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:16.480]   but which the government cannot possibly get at. And so we have to have this question.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:23.040]   Is it okay for me to have a secret that the government cannot possibly know without my consent?
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:28.880]   And when you put it in those terms, it's hard for me to find the wiggle room where I'm willing
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:34.640]   to negotiate on this. I don't have a lot of faith in our democratic system right now, though. So
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:39.920]   like, I have a lot of fear of the idea of this going to any kind of Supreme Court or anything,
[00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:46.800]   because that's where to me, things go wrong. And I want to have trust and faith that our right
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:51.600]   to privacy is protected and things like that. But I really just don't trust the way our government
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:59.440]   is going right now. And to me, I feel more comfortable in the idea that major companies
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:07.200]   are going to have my back more than I trust the voters sentiment heading in the right direction.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:12.640]   Like, I want Apple and Facebook and Google and Amazon and all of them. I want them to be the
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.560]   ones that stand up and say, no, we're not going to do this. And we're the ones that hold all the
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.160]   cards and we're the ones that have all the money. So what are you going to do about it,
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.200]   the fundamentally though, if it guesses the Supreme Court, it'll get to the Supreme Court. The key is
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:30.640]   to stop it from getting to that position. And the issue is, is that we can always, as voters,
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   before we even vote, apply pain. I mean, soap I got killed because we applied pain. And the
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.880]   reason that we don't see gun control laws is because it's not because the NRA has a lot of money,
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:47.760]   it's because it has a lot of voters. And so the thing is, is that we, as this issue, is as much
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.960]   up to the average citizen applying pain to their representatives as it is to anything else that
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.920]   we can worry about, we can say, oh, we'll just, we hope that they do the right thing, or we can be
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.520]   sending letters, emails showing up at their offices, marching, you know, all those things,
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:06.240]   if this starts to pick up speed, it's going to be, if we do that, they will give up, they have in
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:11.840]   the past. You know, like, you know, this is not that big of an issue for them. This is not a,
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.280]   you know, once you apply a certain amount of pain to this, this is not going to be
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.760]   something that most representatives are going to think is worth their seat. Like, this is not the
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.760]   thing they're going to fight over. This is not the battle that they want to die in, you know, and,
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:31.200]   and so, so they'll just, they'll drop out. The FBI doesn't have that much leverage. And so,
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.840]   so it's important for us to know that it's up to us to stop this.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:42.320]   Well, let's hope we do it. We've done it in the past. I mean, look at, if you look at SOPA,
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.080]   you know, like I killed because a whole bunch of people rose up and said, nope, nope, we're not
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.520]   going to do that. It's also a political angle that, you know, there may be disadvantages to doing this,
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:55.680]   this kind of thing in our dealings with the rest of the world. I mean, there's other,
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:59.680]   other pressure points besides just the voters, but hey, that's what we are. So, let's take it.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.440]   I mean, that's the power that we have. I mean, my issue is less about what the government knows
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.640]   and doesn't know and more about the fact that the government can't keep secrets. It, the NSA can't
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:15.280]   keep their own secrets. The most important secrets that they had, they can't, if they can't keep those,
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:19.040]   why would they think they're going to keep ours where we don't even matter? What if instead of the
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:25.520]   government doing that, Apple, for instance, had a system, an extra key that they created,
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.680]   that would not be used. You know, maybe it's split between several employees, it's stored
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.960]   safely, somewhere completely secure, that they could respond to a subpoena and send clear text,
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:39.920]   but that it would not be available to the government for mass spying that would not be available in
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:45.200]   any other context, but just in response to a subpoena, which I think is all that's being asked of them.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:50.400]   Some 13 year old kid would figure it out, Leo. No, they would. Apple keeps the
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:57.120]   in crypto keys secure. I mean, I think, would you, well, I guess that's my question. Would you trust
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:02.080]   Apple or only? I trust, I don't trust Apple. I trust technology and a lot of the best technology
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.120]   is engineered so that there's zero knowledge or zero access. And this technology that is forced
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.640]   to give that access is almost always the technology that ends up having some sort of
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:16.240]   exit. They do it right now with iCloud crypto keys. The key that's generated for your eyes.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.800]   It didn't use to. It's just because people were like people were losing access to their own data,
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.120]   and they discovered that for most normal people being fail safe was way better than being fail
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:29.280]   secure. They changed it so that they could give people back their backups if they had to.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:35.040]   And now that's being taken advantage of by subpoenas, but they figure it's still a better bargain
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:38.880]   to get them going the other way. And it just depends on where we want to draw those lines.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.400]   And I think from a from a constitutional perspective, I think we can fairly safely assume that the
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:49.760]   folks that wrote the Constitution would absolutely say that you have privacy. Like if you have,
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.840]   if you explain to him what a phone was, what the government wants, I don't see he's not in the
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.560]   Constitution. Well, this is that episode of West Wing member where Rob Lowe stands up and says it
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.800]   was so such an important act. They didn't feel like they had to.
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:06.160]   Well, we can all guess what Thomas Jefferson is saying, but it's not necessarily obvious.
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.920]   Well, there's cybernetics, right? Like eventually the stuff will be in our brains. And if we don't
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.520]   protect it when it's in our pockets, they're going to have full access to it when it's in our brains.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.120]   If we can get enough of the United States to pass a new constitutional amendment that says it's
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.960]   okay to break into our phone, I'm fine with that. Like we've all decided as a society that we want
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:24.640]   to give it to the government. They'll never get that. But you know, that's that's what we have to do
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:29.920]   is things have to do. We need a constitutional privacy amendment. It's also international. I mean,
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:34.560]   like my my biggest concern is never like is still it. It's not just China or Russia. It's like France
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.480]   is passing these laws Australia. And how does international company like Apple deal with it when
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:43.120]   Australia says they need a backdoor and America says you don't like what you can't just make one.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:48.080]   By the way, if you get the Apple Pro XDR display with nano coding,
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:54.000]   actually, even I will come over to your house and touch it. Even if no, you must not touch it.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.360]   In fact, here's Apple's support document. Thanks to Mac rumors, how to clean your Apple Pro display
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:08.880]   XBR XDR never use any cloth, but the special cloth provided by Apple. If you lose the included
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:15.760]   polishing cloth, you can order a replacement polishing cloth. Well, apparently you have to call
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:22.480]   to get it because there's no price on that. Maybe maybe it's free. Do not use water or other
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.360]   liquids to clean the nano texture glass. This used to be always the case when we had monitors.
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:33.520]   The the matte monitors that I had years ago, you had to be super careful about what you what
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:39.200]   you touch the screen with for the standard glass. You can use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to wipe
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:43.200]   dust or smudges. So don't touch it, Lori, because it's going to be hard to get those fingerprints.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.440]   I just want to feel it. I want to know what that feels like. What does nano text.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.960]   I have to say this is the first thing I would do is touch it and then I will have that
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:56.080]   fingerprint there for the next. Lori, I'm going to say it again because it's amazing. But Lori
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:04.720]   did ask if she could touch it at the event and he said no. Yes. You can clean the enclosure and
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:11.200]   thousand dollars stand with a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth, but do avoid getting moisture
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.840]   in openings. Don't use window cleaners, household cleaners, aerosol sprays, solvents, ammonia,
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:22.320]   abrasives or cleaners containing hydrogen peroxide to clean the enclosure. What happens if you lick
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:31.120]   it? Just like pride in the thousands, Apple has deemed this is an unnecessary thing to tell people
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:38.240]   not to do. Obviously, you don't want to be a support document. Obviously, do not lick your
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:45.040]   screen. You can hand wash the special provided polishing cloth with dish soap and water rinsed
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:52.960]   thoroughly and allow it to air dry for at least 24 hours before. I want to know what the polishing
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:58.400]   cloth looks like. Did any of the video is so bad? Oh, man, they put on the relaxing video. They
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:05.360]   got a show of the polishing cloth. The special super duper. Is it like the microfiber cloth that
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.640]   used to always come with iPhone and iPad? I still, by the way, I still have my iPad,
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.520]   microfiber cloth with the Apple look on it. I love those cloths. I think they're really good.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:26.560]   By the way, 13.3 is also available for the HomePod. So get it. Also, Catalina 10.15.2 has come out
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.280]   with news improvements, iPhone remote control support for music and TV apps.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:38.240]   iPhone, oh, so now your iPhone remote control control music on your Mac and TV.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.080]   That's nice. My favorite thing, I forget when it came out. It was a little while ago, but I just
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.680]   I don't use my Apple remote that much anymore. I just tell Siri to turn on the Apple TV,
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.920]   turn off the Apple TV, play this, play that. And it just does it when I'm walking and I'm not
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:55.520]   going to stop and look for it anymore. It's beautiful. We mentioned it once before, but I
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:03.200]   probably should say it again. 6% off if you use your Apple card to buy any Apple store hardware
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:08.720]   purchases. The watch bands count. Please say watch bands count. Yeah. Was that hardware?
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:18.000]   I don't know. It's like leather wear. They also semi-hard. They also announced that
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.080]   you can now buy an iPhone for zero percent financing with your Apple card spread over 24
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:30.560]   months. So it's similar to the whatever that special feature update, automatic update feature
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.640]   is for the iPhone, but you don't have to trade in your phone. You don't have to say, I'll take
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:41.520]   the next one. It's just pay it off over 24 months. No interest. And you'll still get 3% daily cash.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:47.040]   So wait, Leo, if you buy right now with that card, then you'll be able to get the 2021 No
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.160]   Lightning port iPhone when it comes to 13. Let's take a break and talk about that.
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:59.120]   Because that's the rumor. Well, I don't stay tuned. That's coming up next. Renee Richie, Lori
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:05.760]   Gill, Andy and I go Alex Lindsey. Hold that thought. Our show today brought to you by Metallic.

[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:35.120]   So this is a Ming-Chi Kuo, isn't it? Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. This guy again. Ming-Chi Kuo,
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:42.480]   who has now been I think his record is a little, little, little checker, but he says,
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.720]   I think Apple's finding more creative ways of tricking having multiple things in the supply chain.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:52.160]   Maybe. Yeah. He says, well, he's also predicting out like stuff that's kind of obvious to all of
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:57.600]   us at this point. Well, and by the way, this is not the 2020 iPhone. This is not the next iPhone.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.480]   This is a two-year-out iPhone. No one does one-year spoilers anymore, Leo. You got to do at least
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:08.720]   two or three if you want to speak. He says, I did those last year. This is next next year. So
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:16.320]   a completely wireless experience. In other words, don't switch to USB-C, just no port at all.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:20.720]   Does that even? Only for the pros. The main, like so for the main iPhone, the normal non-pro
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.280]   iPhone, you'll still get a lightning connector. But for pros, they don't even need USB-C anymore.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:30.240]   We're just going to seal that right up and then we'll give you a dongle so that you can plug it
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.680]   into your car play. And it'll be wonderful. You'll look. I have to point out that Ming-Chi Kuo does-
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.240]   How would you plug it into your car play though? Oh, well, you need USB-C to Bluetooth dongle.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:43.840]   You plug that into your car and then it communicates over Bluetooth to the dongle.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.800]   If you're going to have a 2021 iPhone, you need a new car and the new wireless car play. That's all.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:53.920]   Cars take too long, Leo. They just announced wireless car play with iOS 9. You can't expect
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:59.840]   those to be shipping yet. My new car, which won't be coming for another year, the Mustang Mach-E
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.960]   has wireless car play in Android Auto and it has a Qi charger right where you see it put the phone
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:11.440]   down and they're done. So I'm ready for the, you know, I don't think this is one of the words that
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.520]   like, "Courage." Everybody is freaking out about this. And like,
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:21.360]   Mazoo has already shipped a portless phone called the Zero. The Google had a Pixel 3 prototype that
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.760]   was portless, but they couldn't get remote restore working. I'm guessing Samsung. It's just like,
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.520]   it's one of those things that they all prototype when they're doing these things. Like, what can we
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.680]   do? Can we change this? Can we do that? Are we ready to get rid of this? Like eight people are
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.680]   going to ship this within the next five years, I'm sure, but it's news because, you know, Apple
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.640]   took the... HDC took the headphone jack away with the Google G with the T-Mobile G1
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:48.400]   and the Apple took it away and then everybody did. So, but so... I'm gonna make my prediction,
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:53.600]   though, that this is just not true. I don't think we're going to get a phone or a tablet,
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:59.200]   an iPhone or an iPad without some version of a port that allows us to connect to other things.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:06.720]   I think the fact that we have the ability to plug in hard drives now or, you know, like
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:13.920]   thumb drives and things like that to our devices on iOS and iPadOS is evidence that this is not...
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.160]   If you take that away from me, then this great thing that you did in the software
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:23.440]   is now completely useless. If I don't have a port that I can plug in my USB-C
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:29.200]   dongle or whatever, my USB-C thumb drive to upload files or photos or something like that.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.040]   So, what would be the advantage? What would be the point of...
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.800]   Yeah, that's the question. Why would you take that out for waterproof?
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:39.520]   No, for mechanical failure. Every vendor is that it's mechanical failure that's driving the
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:44.160]   exploration of this. It is absolutely the case that a lot of times I think people bring in an
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.320]   unchurging iPhone and they blow it out and it's full of lint in the whole... I know it's happened
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.640]   to me and it happens to be my phone. And they corrode. And they corrode. So, yeah, that's a point of...
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:57.520]   And also, it's a point of... It's a mechanical point of leverage. So, if you have something plugged in and
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:01.760]   you sit on it wrong or whatever, you can not only damage the cable, but you can damage the phone.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:07.360]   So, it would be more reliable. I hate the idea. But I think the loss of the features would be...
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:16.320]   would not balance out that more reliable option. I think getting rid of a connector port at all,
[01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.800]   like so in other words, there's just zero ports on the phone, I think that's a terrible idea.
[01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:25.520]   I don't think that technology is going to head that way. I believe they're testing it,
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:36.560]   but I think in the end, they're going to see that the exchange of versatility is not worth that
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:44.960]   loss of port and exchange. My reactions to this are number one. I don't even believe rumors about
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:53.040]   next year's iPhone, let alone year after next iPhone. You mean that iPhone SE? Yeah, I can tell
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:58.320]   you with all honesty, I am not even thinking about this as anything other than some dude on the
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:03.600]   internet said this. Sometimes there's a dude or a lady on the internet who is right two years in
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:10.000]   advance, but at this point, it's some dude on the internet has said this. Number two, I find it
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:17.120]   really impossible to believe that any manufacturer is going to remove the ability to recharge a phone
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:24.480]   in the most flexible ways possible without addressing that. I mean, the ability to, it's nice. It's
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:31.520]   the iPhone 11 Pro has kicked butt battery life, but that doesn't help you if it's the next day
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.480]   and you're at the airport and you grab your phone of checking out the hotel and you didn't notice
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:43.680]   it was at 20% and you still have to get home at 8 p.m. Do you use a $10 charger that you could
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:50.000]   probably pick up at any gift shop at any drug store? Or do you thank Apple or this company for
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.800]   saying thank goodness that you deleted that candy charging point towards the otherwise you
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:01.120]   might have had ingress failure problems or and yes, there are, yes, there is wireless charging
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.880]   and yes, there are even battery packs that have wireless charging, but they don't charge fast
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:11.520]   and they don't charge efficiently. So, yeah, so, so, so, so, what happened was in high speed
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:18.160]   wireless charging. Did any of you have the palm here? It was too small to fit a US even micro USB
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:22.160]   so they had pogo pins on it and then you had a bunch of adapters for the pogo pins that would
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:26.560]   go to USB or headphone jack and just like Dieter Bohr reminded me of this because it was his
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:30.640]   nightmare that the iPhone would just come with with this hard attack like the iPad and then you'd
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:38.160]   slap a magnetic adapter on for USB or for for this is where I think that most a lot of engineers
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:42.480]   and a lot of designers don't realize that they're down a rabbit hole where you say, well, okay, I'm
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:47.040]   gonna I'm gonna jump off this roof. Well, you can't because that's like a 40 foot drop and you're
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:51.360]   gonna break your legs and or die. So, well, that's fine because I'll put like a big stack of mattresses
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:56.080]   underground on the ground underneath you. Okay, but the thing is you might bounce off the mattresses
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:01.920]   and then still hurt yourself. Okay, then I'll put big like catch fences all around the thing.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:06.000]   Well, Kayle, what if you miss the thing entirely? At this point, you're saying, let's back up a
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.880]   step and ask us whether jumping off the roof is really worth all of this trouble we're doing to
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:15.360]   cover the problems that we're going to be going through and trying to make this thing happen.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:21.680]   We have to step back to what are you get what are you delivering to consumers by deleting that port?
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:27.200]   And I would definitely give and given and given that their most phones do last two or three or
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:32.800]   four years, this isn't a this isn't a problem that requires a radical solution. We should
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:37.120]   probably also point out that they have the Apple Watch has a sealed port. The Apple TV
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:41.360]   its port is hidden inside the ethernet jack. You have to actually go into it, open it out to get
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.440]   to it and they use that to surface it. And if you brick those devices, like if a backup or a
[01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:49.280]   or a recovery goes badly and you brick those devices, you basically have to send them to Apple
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:54.400]   unless you really know what you're doing. And that's inconvenient for a watch or for an Apple TV.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.840]   That is a game stopper, a show stopper, if it is your phone.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:04.480]   When Apple were to bless, come up with a really good line of like portless cases,
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:09.920]   like really good form fitting cases that cover up the port completely and back this up by saying,
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:14.080]   hey, we think that you we think that you we think that our new wireless standard change
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:19.680]   wireless charging standard as well as our new 10 hour battery are so good that you're not even
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.640]   going to want need to access the port. Of course, we're not we're not nuts. We put a port in there.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:29.040]   But now we've had this really good case of protect your that port from damaging your phone.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:35.360]   If it's like a like a drawer like the way the SIM card drawer is, like you have to use a little
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:41.120]   pin to remove it. And so you you have it. But if you don't need it, it's all sealed up nice and
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:48.160]   tight for you. I like that. I should also point out that Ming Chi Quo's best rumors come from the
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:53.440]   supply chain early leaks. And this would be such an early leak. There's no way Apple is currently
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.800]   sourcing in his defense. I wrote about this in 2016 when I first heard about it and like HTC
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.920]   was working on it too. That's why they got rid of like they made that squeeze tech for a while to
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:06.400]   get rid of buttons. So it is something that is in this industry. It's just when you can take it from
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:10.400]   Oh, cool. It's one of 18 prototypes we're working on and ideas we're thinking about and actually
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:16.160]   say that it's ready to ship with everything from charging to data transmission to recovery to
[01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:21.520]   everything that a consumer needs. Like I said, there's many a twist between there's many a twist
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:28.720]   twist a rumor and a ship. He's he's also using the word predict in his reports. So it sounds like
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:33.520]   I mean, if you did the thought experiment, it's not an unreasonable thing to say this might happen.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:40.240]   I don't I wouldn't get I Carson, I'll mark this segment. And in 2021, let's drag it. Yeah, let's
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.760]   come back. Yeah, how's the video? There's the maze was zero. It's amazing to see it's like a
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:48.560]   it's a literal black slab of nothing but glass. I mean, there is a certain aesthetic appeal to
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:54.640]   that right? That it would just be this, you know, seamless. I would definitely I would definitely
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:21:03.200]   that would be my year off. Wait, wait until everything settles like if they did the change,
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.560]   I would be kind of like, well, let's just see how all the technology sorts out. I'm not saying
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:13.120]   that they wouldn't keep going that direction, but I would let all the accessories, everything else
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:17.840]   settle before I bought it. It's the pro version and they're the most accepting people when it
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:24.960]   comes to change. Yeah, even saying that it's the pro version to me goes completely against the
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:31.680]   idea of why a port is there. I would believe they would get rid of the port for the non pro version
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:36.800]   for people who don't want to do things like, you know, plug their phone into their computer or
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.600]   plug a thumb drive into their phone or something like that. So it seems even the reverse of
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:48.560]   what is important about a port if you say the pros don't get the port. You know, like, I don't
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:55.840]   know, it's it's an odd it's an odd prediction for 2021, I think. The morning show nominated for
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:01.840]   multiple Golden Globe Awards, including Best TV series. This is what, of course, Apple's hoping
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:07.920]   they'd like awards for some of their Apple TV plus shows, something to drive people to subscribe.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:13.440]   Press release at first time ever for a debut streaming service to get this many nominations for
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:21.040]   for a show with a lot of f-bombs. Other best drama series, Big Little Lies, the crown
[01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:25.440]   killing Eve in succession. I just don't think it's in the same
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:32.960]   league as any of those, but hey, good on them. They'll find out January 5th that they get an award.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:40.160]   Think of shows here, how many people who are qualified to nominate nominees actually own Apple
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:44.240]   products and got their free got their free year Apple Plus. Well, remember, it's the Foreign
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:49.440]   Press Association. It's a kind of a weird award. It's a small group. It's a very small group,
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:55.280]   and it's kind of a non-transparent. Yeah, it's a not so you might be right. Who knows? Having
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:23:02.640]   forced myself to watch this show, I actually hate it more every time I watch another episode.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:07.280]   I thought usually shows get better as you get involved and get invested in the characters.
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:11.360]   They're just making me more and more angry. Leo, you make me so happy.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:17.440]   I think I watched two episodes and I couldn't bring myself to watch the third because I
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:23.360]   did not like the show. To hear that somebody else didn't like it makes me feel. In fact,
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:28.960]   there's no knock on everybody who's worked on that show, but when they announced that they
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:38.480]   were nominated, I went really? Apple has screened the final episode for critics, not for us. We're
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:45.520]   on that one week release cycle. According to Stuart Heritage writing in The Guardian,
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:51.920]   it is the best last episode of a TV series in a decade.
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:58.000]   What? That's not saying much because there's a lot of shows that have really bad endings.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.280]   He says, people seem to love our watchmen. I have seen, I am enjoying watchmen.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.800]   It took me a while to figure out what the hell's going on. I actually bought the comic just so
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:13.840]   I could figure out because it's a sequel to the original watchman. By the way, I have a question
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:20.480]   for you comic book readers. Few nerds. I'm not a big comic book reader. This is all new to me.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:24.800]   I was reading it last night. Do you look at the picture first or read the words first?
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.280]   I read the words and then look at the picture. Yes.
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:35.120]   I'm reading it like a book and I forget to look at the pictures.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:40.560]   In this one, it's a graphic novel. There's a lot of hidden stuff,
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:45.760]   little stuff in these pictures like Vietnam declared 51st state is like,
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   on a newsstand, on a newspaper and a headline having nothing to do with the dialogue.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:55.040]   I realize I'm missing because I'm reading it like a book. I'm reading the text.
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:00.880]   You read the story. Your recommendation is read the words, but then stop on that panel and examine it.
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.800]   Sometimes what they're saying in those word bubbles or even thought bubbles will be reflected
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.680]   in the illustration. I have to be taught how to read a comic book.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:18.480]   No, it's so much detail to every one of those panels. He wrote out everything that goes
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:22.240]   in every one of those panels. Yes, that's the sense I get there. The panels are not necessarily
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.400]   great artwork. They're very comic-y.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:31.040]   Here's the cool thing about comics that it's just like when you're watching a movie,
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:37.040]   you don't have to be taught, should I be looking at this person or should I be looking at this
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:41.920]   shadowy figure in the background? Because the director and the cinematographer and everybody,
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.960]   they have a way of basically giving you a visual cue that this is where I want your eye to go
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:53.040]   from here to here. I'm, I've framed this to make you think that no, the lead actor in the phone booth
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:57.440]   is not the important thing happening in this shot. It's actually the thing, the person way back
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.800]   in the background that's watching. You should just read a comic and enjoy it, but then when you
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:07.200]   read it for the second or third time, you come to appreciate how, wow, they've actually laid out
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:11.840]   a path for me for where my eyes should go and when I should see things. That's the real answer is
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:15.680]   don't just read it once. It's not like a novel. You got to kind of really...
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:20.720]   Every Washington and Dark Knight returns every year. What? Yeah. Every year, Dark Knight returns
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:26.320]   in Watchmen, a couple others. Yep. I will also say the cool thing about comics on Comixology
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:33.040]   is that now you can zoom, you can zoom all the way in and see almost like the original art level.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.320]   And when I was, I still remember, I still remember that I was taking out my glasses and
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:42.480]   like staring at it. Well, no, no, not even for that. There are things that the artist puts in there
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:46.560]   because they're reading it. They're working at that scale. One of my favorite artists, Amanda Connor,
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:52.800]   I saw her at a con and just had read like something that another fabulous book she did.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:57.760]   No, actually it was a Watchmen prequel comic as a matter of fact. And I was complimenting her
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.560]   on because of course, after I read it, I really, I could see that she put details in the background
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:09.760]   of this like 1960s 20ish woman. And I was looking at the, wow, there's, and even everything in the
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.800]   everything in the background on the on the dresser and just said, yes, yes, I called my aunt who was
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:19.520]   like the right time. And she said, Oh, she should have like these necklace made out of like apple
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:24.000]   seeds. I had that there and I had this. So yeah, it's, it's there's a new level going on that wasn't
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.040]   there when I was reading it for like 60 cents, an issue on pulp newsprint. So let me ask you this.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:36.800]   How can I so I'm looking Apple books has Watchmen for $17. Is that is it or should I get
[01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:39.600]   is comicsology a better? What's the best way to read it?
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:45.520]   Hard to say. I've never tried reading a comic book that wasn't through a comic book reader.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.680]   I have to buy all of them because in my region, like something is on Amazon that's not an apple,
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.760]   something's on Apple that's not in comicsology. Like I wish I could just use one end up having
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:59.360]   to buy it. Renee, have you have you bought comics on Apple books? Yeah, I've had to because they
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.200]   own some of the Wolverine's I want it were only available on my was that okay to do that?
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:08.080]   Can I is it pretty much the same thing? It seems like they're just all comic book readers, right?
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:14.000]   Well, well, it's a lot of advanced stuff. Yeah, comicsology has a lot of advanced stuff that I
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:20.560]   don't think at least in my experience, Kindle and Apple books don't do. But I'll give you this advice,
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:27.280]   Leo, that when you have a book that a comic that was published before digital comics,
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:32.480]   I would recommend this one. You buy it and pick the exactly so I would recommend that you buy it
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:36.640]   like as an actual as an actual physical trade paperback. I've already done that. I bought the
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:41.440]   hard cover because I thought it deserved that. Yeah, often people A because you'll love it and
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.040]   you'll be coming back to it. It's a permanent library thing. But the other thing is that
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:50.480]   the writers back then knew that at this point you will this person will be turning a page.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.160]   So let's spread this out. And also there are ways there when they know that there's a two-page
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.800]   spread or there'll be a splash that goes literally covers an entire two pages that you have open in
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:07.040]   front of you. And none of those they still do that in modern comics, but that moment where I don't
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:12.960]   turn the I turn the I one of my favorite I'm sorry that one of my favorite experiences as a
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:19.440]   comic book reader, I think was reading an issue of Thor drawn by Walt Simonson who is this amazing
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:25.040]   epic artist. And so and there's this battle going on and you turn the page and suddenly
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:32.560]   no words. There's just one huge picture of the entire wide screen battle going on of huge dragons
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:38.240]   and winged horses and just the last moments of a death burn battle. Thank you Andy.
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:42.160]   I'm so sorry. I read this. This is what I've been buying.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:46.720]   I've been buying the other loots. Let's talk from my next Superman.
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:55.920]   From the experience of somebody who literally has a closet full of comic books, be careful Leo.
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:02.480]   You may have just stepped into a very expensive, very space consuming future.
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:05.520]   I'm safe on this. My mom threw out all my comments.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.520]   You've taken your first step into a lot.
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:10.800]   That's where you're actually comics. I just want to read Watchman so I can understand what
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.960]   the hell's going on with the guy in the it is so hoarse in the it's Alan Moore before he really
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:20.640]   went into the deep, deep, deep well of this. He gets weirder.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:26.720]   Oh my god. When you hear Dave Gibbons talk about it, he's like Alan sent me pages to draw
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.960]   and I drew them immediately and they have conversations that occur back and forth over time.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:34.320]   And as far as I know, he never planned that out. He just kept it all in his head
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.960]   and wrote it all out and everything fit absolutely perfectly by the end.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:44.880]   It's amazing. I'm actually interested in getting this is because a number of people who I really
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:50.800]   respect you guys but Amy Webb even said this is actually not only the greatest graphic novel ever,
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:53.680]   it might be one of the great novels of all time. So I agree with that.
[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.680]   I agree with that. Yeah. So now I have to read it.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:02.640]   And also I'll never understand the TV show with that. Let me get back though to the morning show.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:08.160]   This is Heritage's review. One of the things he likes a lot is Billy Crud up in this who is the
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:14.560]   network executive, the guy in charge of the morning show. And he is somebody said he's like the joker.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:21.520]   He comes. Yes. He shows up. Actually, Heritage says he's like Pucker Loki. He shows up and kicks
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.320]   things over and he's so happy. Like people are so angry at him and he's just like, why are you
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:30.640]   smiling? Yeah, one point he's smiling. It's the one way that has the head of the network.
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:34.960]   Do you ever smile? You seem so angry at him in that moment.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:39.600]   He's actually terrific on that show. Here's what he he's very good. Here's what Heritage writes.
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:45.440]   I've seen the morning show finale and it is astonishing. I won't spoil it, but it is
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:51.600]   operatic slamming from high drama. I'm sorry from dramatic high to dramatic high until you think
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:57.520]   it has nowhere else to go. And then it finally strains for a grace note so audacious that it floors
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:03.040]   you. It is one of the most impressive season finales of the decade. And I'm desperate for
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:08.480]   everyone to watch it just so I can talk about it. So Laurie, you and I have some homework here.
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:12.320]   We got to start watching it again. It starts hard. Like the beginning shows aren't that good.
[01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.600]   Like they really should have screen. I got through about three quarters of the first episode.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:21.280]   You can see all the money Apple put into it, which bugs the hell out of me. I don't want to see that.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:26.400]   It needs to be a little grittier, frankly. And also you really can see that they couldn't get
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:33.760]   Aaron's sort. There's no Sorkinisms. Yeah, it's Sorkin without the wit and charm.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:40.880]   He's done that show four times. I mean, I do it again. All right, I'm going to have to continue
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:47.040]   that everybody on Twitter, both Christina Warren, who loves it and Amy Webb, I think who loves it,
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:52.080]   said, Oh, the last night's episode is amazing. So I have. And there's not that many.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:58.240]   No, it's I'm almost done. In fact, I think the finale is just a few weeks off. We did have the
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:04.800]   finale of Silicon Valley on Sunday. Okay, enough about that. Let's move on.
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:09.840]   Let's move on. I'm just waiting for the Mandalorian Leo. Just give me more of that.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:14.080]   You know, I've I broke down. Well, I didn't have to buy it. I'm a Verizon customer. I'm
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:18.880]   broke down inside of Ferd at Disney Plus. But you know, here's the problem with that kind of thing.
[01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:23.200]   You watch a lot the first day and then you never watch it again. Unless you like.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:27.760]   Well, but they're doing me by week. I watch it every single day. All day.
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:33.200]   All right. What do you watch? I love Disney. You're watching just like random Disney.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:39.040]   Old old stuff. I've been really going down the I watch Bed Knobs and Broomsticks and
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:45.040]   the Apple Dumpling King. Like I grew up on these. So like I I love the feeling that I get when
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:52.160]   I'm watching these things. The computer war tennis shoes. All of the old stuff. I wish they had
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:57.600]   even more of them. It's kind of I find the user interface of Disney Plus to be lacking because
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.320]   unless you know specifically what movie you're looking for, it's difficult to find that. So if
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:08.240]   they could do something like I know that they have things that go all the way back to like 1955.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:13.040]   So if they could do by decade and have like every single movie that they have on Disney Plus
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:19.040]   in the 50s in the 60s in the 70s, like I would love to be able to find movies better that way.
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:26.960]   There's a way to do it. If you go into the search, it will like if you hit search, then it
[01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:31.120]   below that it does Disney through the decades.
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:35.360]   Ah, this is how Carson's very first movie. Yes.
[01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:37.280]   Which was the computer war tennis shoes. Yes.
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:41.840]   Yeah. That was like the third one that I watched. There's a way to watch it like
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:45.520]   in chronological order pretty much. Yes.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:48.880]   You just made my day. I'm leaving. I'll see you guys later.
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:54.400]   No, don't don't don't tempt Disney to try to do what Marvel did and insist that no,
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:58.480]   no, no, I know I know that we've been in business for 40 years and it's just basically random
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.920]   editors and writers doing things. But no, no, we're going to tie everything together.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:07.920]   So that looks like it's all a shared universe. Again, Mary Poppins did not go to go to go to
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:11.920]   go to magic school with Betna with Angela Lansbury and Betnauban Broome sticks.
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.520]   Okay. You just came up with the best fan fiction just now.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:22.240]   Hey, if you live near Apple Park, look in your mailbox for a special invitation
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:27.440]   on the 14th and a few days Apple's going to hold a neighborhood open house.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:32.480]   What good neighbors? I wonder if they handed out really excellent candy on Halloween.
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.520]   Bring it bring a covered toys. It's a toys for Todd drive. So actually bring a toy.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:43.600]   I wonder how much of the campus you're going to get to see. It's not clear if you'll get more
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:49.120]   than the visitors center. The neighborhood did get a private viewing of the visitors center
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:54.160]   before it opened. So that would be kind of cool. The event is Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.520]   The invites are not transferable. So don't go call somebody you know who lives in Cupertino.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:04.880]   By the way, no plus ones. It's you and you alone.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:13.440]   Yeah, that's kind of a bummer. You know, like me and my family that live in the same neighborhood,
[01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:18.320]   oh, only one of us gets to go even though I've got a whole family. It's a little weird that you
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.240]   can't. Kind of the willy Wonka golden ticket. I'll be honest with you.
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:28.320]   Yeah. Whatever you do. Don't chew the blue gum. I'm just saying. Well, if Tim Cook is going to
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:31.600]   hand over the company at the end of the tour, I think that's a pretty good deal.
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:39.360]   All right. Let's take a break and I want because we were like really late today and I
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:46.080]   apologize coming up security now in the next half hour. So Steve, sorry. But we're going to take a
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:51.120]   little break and then come back with your picks. Don't forget we had a great iOS today. Just a
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:56.720]   couple hours ago that'll be coming out soon. Micah Sergeant and I talked. Yeah, he's great.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:37:02.800]   We showed off some of the Apple software award winners and couldn't stop playing Sianara.
[01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:09.040]   I think we played it for half an hour. I'm sure that Kevin will edit that out. But as we started
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.360]   playing, it got better and better. And I said, oh, I actually really like this game was Apple's
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:18.080]   arcade game of the year. But I think probably Sianara, why it was hard to serve to be the game
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:23.760]   of the year was it was really a lot of fun. Our show today brought to you by, of course, last pass.
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:30.240]   Last pass is the password manager. But it's so much more really. It's a security solution
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:35.760]   that helps not only millions of individuals, but many businesses over 60,000 businesses navigate
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:41.200]   their online lives easily and securely. We're one of those 60,000 here at Twit. And the thing
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:46.480]   that's remarkable about last pass is it does what most people say is the impossible. It makes you
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:53.200]   more secure, but it's also more convenient. And when security is effortless for your employees,
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:59.360]   you're going to be more secure. And that is so important. Every user in your company has the
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:04.640]   potential to compromise your security. I we give, you know, the passwords to our bank accounts,
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:10.560]   to our websites, to our databases, everything. They need access to that. So with last pass,
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:14.560]   they don't get access to that. They can't give away the keys to the kingdom. They get access to those,
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:19.920]   you know, the, the quick books in the bank account, but they don't get the password to share to store
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:25.520]   it or write on a post it note on the screen. With more devices, more applications, more networks,
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:32.560]   more users, it is more and more difficult to manage and protect user access. Productivity can dwindle
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:37.440]   if you have to do a lot of resets if people get locked out. But last pass minimizes the risk,
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:44.720]   gives your IT team a break. And yes, users love it. So you've got authentication solutions that
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:50.240]   solutions that help you understand what users are doing, authentication that adapts to each
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:54.800]   individual that makes it both more secure and easier for them to use, things like single sign on,
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:39:00.400]   access solutions, managing control user access for all the access points in your organization.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:06.160]   The engineering team gets the passwords to the database to the workflow,
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:11.200]   the, the business office gets the passwords to the bank account and to the quick books and never
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:15.840]   the train shall meet. You also get identity solutions that offer a simple integrative view
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:21.440]   across all the access and authentication tasks. So you can easily verify who's accessing what,
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.960]   when this is really important to supporting your security. I trust LastPass so much. I put
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:32.160]   my passports in at my driver's license, my social security numbers at work. We, we use it as a
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.880]   digital, a secure digital record store for things like Wi-Fi logins, software licenses,
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:41.680]   employee IDs. Earlier today on iOS, they were trying to get into the Apple TV and I said,
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:46.480]   well, it's in the LastPass enterprise, the password, right? So things like that, it's really nice.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.280]   It makes it easy to share passwords without giving away the password. Every employee gets
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:56.560]   their own vault for safeguarding passwords. In fact, as a kind of benefit to employee here,
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:01.280]   we give everybody who works here their own personal LastPass as well, integrates well with the enterprise.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.400]   LastPass has an expanded business lineup with some amazing features that will improve security
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.520]   across your company and make life easier for your users. So find out more for your work,
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:17.200]   for your home, for your family, LastPass at LastPass.com/twits. The first thing I install,
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:23.680]   no matter what I'm setting up, the first thing I put on there is LastPass because I, you know,
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:32.080]   it just facilitates the rest of the installation. I just love it. LastPass.com/twits. And starting
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.040]   at about three weeks, we're getting some new signage in the studio because this is,
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:41.280]   instead of the Eastside studios, this will now be branded the Twit LastPass studios,
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:44.320]   thanks to LastPass. And we're excited about that. That's great.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.720]   And you're not cool. You pick of the week, my friend.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:50.000]   Don't make your watchmen the comic book because...
[01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:56.960]   Because you already got it. I already got it. No, I'm actually recommending another comic because
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:03.440]   I jettisoned my originally intended pick because this is such a great book for you or anybody else.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:11.600]   Scott McCloud's book, Understanding Comics and the Invisible Art. It's a classic book that explains,
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:17.520]   not only how to read comics and how comic books work, but it really explains how visual
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:23.360]   storytelling and visual communication works. There are so many concepts in here that will
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:28.800]   really blow your mind, not because, hey, this McCloud fellow has this brand new way of thinking,
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:34.480]   but no, he's pointing out things that have, that tools that artists and visual communicators
[01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:41.040]   have been using for decades, even centuries, that you immediately recognize once they're pointed
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:46.880]   out to you. When the classic, classic, classic mind-blowing pages from this, when I first read
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:52.640]   it in the mid 90s, was the idea of, well, okay, here's a continuum. I'm going to draw the same face
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:57.760]   like 10 different ways with more and more detail every time. On this one extreme, I'm just going
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:04.000]   to draw a happy face. On this other extreme, it's going to be a photo-realistic drawing of this person.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:08.880]   As we go step by step by step, you can see all of them from left to right. I'm going to add more
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:15.280]   and more detail. You realize that the lesson being that if I draw this figure completely
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:21.360]   realistically, this can only be this one person, but somewhere in the middle, I'm giving you just
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:27.200]   enough detail that you are filling in the blanks in your own mind and you're picking a face of
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.840]   someone that you know and that you're aware of and that you're acquainted with. And that makes this
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.960]   character a lot more real to you, even though you don't know how that's happening. Just like
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:42.080]   when you have like Bugs Bunny is a more intense personality because he doesn't, Bugs Bunny does
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:48.160]   not look like any person you know, but he will remind you of this really sarcastic uncle you had
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:54.640]   and you will emotionally invest. And that's just like one page. And as in the 90s, I remember like
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:59.600]   reading that and then just like looking up in the middle distance and then just going, "Wow."
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:06.480]   And there's page after page about that. It's used as a textbook in so many college course where
[01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:11.360]   because it is an absolute classic. He did a couple of follow-ups, but this is for anyone who's
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:16.400]   thinking about getting into comics, not that you need to have required reading to have the user
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:21.200]   manual to how comics work, but it will really expand your awareness of how we communicate to
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:26.640]   each other and how art works. Nice. I will buy it right now. Does he tell me what order to read the
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:31.280]   text and pictures? He actually will. No, again, he will show you. He will show you. Here's how a
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:36.400]   comic page works and he will you will understand why you will understand a better version of that
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:41.120]   question and you will understand how to read comics a lot better. I am already disappointed
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:45.600]   by the iBooks version. I'm going to un recommend it for watchmen because unlike
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:54.160]   comicsology, it's just page by page like a book and you can zoom in, but it's pops back. It's not
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:59.040]   ideal. So comicsology. You got to get comics. Don't buy anything outside of comicsology because
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:03.920]   they have a reader that is even 1.0 was much better than iBooks and they've had 10 years of
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:09.360]   experience now and how do you... Where were you while he was buying it on Apple Books just now?
[01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:13.360]   Well, I didn't know and I bought it and I'm just going to save everybody.
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:19.760]   It's all right. It's only $17. I'll download comicsology. You want to buy it as many
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.680]   copies as you can. Apparently I am. I have the hardcover. I have the iBooks now have the
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:30.480]   comicsology. Now, do I get the deluxe version, the 2019 version or the... You want the bonus
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.840]   material because it's fascinating to read. He did so much background work. Oh, okay.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:40.240]   I will only argue that I think you should buy the paperback, the cheap version that you can
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:43.840]   carry around with you later. You already have the hardcover. Okay, but the hardcover is nice.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:49.840]   Neil Gaiman's Sandman comics are a lot like this too where you might buy... You start off by buying
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.000]   one or two issues and they're great digitally and then maybe you'll buy a trade paperback and
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.280]   then there's actually an oversized hardcover collection that has the paper art in much better
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.640]   forms. There are some comics where here's the entire issue as the original art that you full-size.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.400]   So yeah, there are a lot of comics that are like the white album where you wind up buying four,
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:13.360]   five or six copies before they put you in your grave. Yeah, too late. Then you're looking on eBay
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:18.720]   for the first printing. I got the absolute version. I'm very happy. I had the graffiti design one and
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:23.680]   then I lost it anyway, but I got the absolute version. It sounds like they recolored it. So
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:30.320]   that might be worse. Yeah, well, that... I'm sorry about going to half hour to answer, but yes,
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:35.680]   digital coloring today. There are a lot of old comics that don't really look good in digital
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:41.120]   because they were colored as with newsprint like flat color and they really weren't intended to
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:48.080]   be looked to be read in crisp, perfect detail. And so sometimes they will pay for it. I'm sorry.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:54.320]   Next next year, thank you, Andy and I co for your fine recommendation.
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:59.280]   Lori Gill, pick of the week. That's me. All right. I hope so. And sticking with my tradition of
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:06.080]   themed things, we are at the holiday season. And so my pick of the week this week is Rare
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:14.240]   Experts, A Christmas Tale. This is a Finnish movie that came out in 2010 and it is my favorite
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:21.840]   Christmas movie, definitely, to come out in the last 20 years. It is adorable. It's sort of a
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:26.960]   horror tale. So you don't want the kids watching this. There's actually some full frontal nudity
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:37.760]   in it too. But it is just absolutely endearing. It's about Santa Claus, but it's this sort of idea
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:43.200]   that Santa is actually... Well, it sort of has that... It combines that Krampus kind of ideology of...
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:48.960]   I love Krampus. I love Krampus. Yeah, it's similar to that only in this Finnish tale,
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:55.360]   Santa Claus is the bad guy and always has been. And that we forgot that Santa was actually this
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:00.960]   bad guy who was going around kidnapping children who were bad. There was never any presence involved
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:08.480]   in this particular version of this ancient tale of Santa. And I don't want to give away too much,
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:15.200]   but it actually becomes this coming of age story for this boy and his father who are...
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:23.040]   It's just the two of them and the dad is trying to protect his young son but is also kind of
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:29.680]   disappointed that he's not tougher. And there's this boy who still needs protection from his dad,
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:36.960]   but is trying to prove that he's a man. So it's just this great, beautiful and
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:42.000]   daring story that you definitely should be older than 13 to watch. Well, I think Christmas
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.240]   with full-frontal nudity's got my interest. I think it must be the only one. What's it called?
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:56.400]   It's called Rare Exports. Rare Exports. And you can actually watch it on Hulu, on Amazon Prime.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:02.080]   You might be able to watch it on Netflix. You can rent it on iTunes. It's widely available,
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:09.280]   so it's very easy to see it. And it really is. 89% on Rotten Tomatoes. Pretty high score. That's good.
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:14.000]   Yeah. Oh, I think I want to watch that. You should watch it for sure.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.680]   Wait a minute. Now there's a Watchman annotated edition. Should I get that?
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:26.720]   The annotated Watchman. Don't get distracted by annotations yet.
[01:48:26.720 --> 01:48:33.440]   Enjoy the story. Ideally, I think you should read it the way I and most other people read it at the
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.400]   time. Well, not only not just... I read it as a graphic novel, but most importantly,
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:44.000]   have the book on the floor of your bedroom and lie face down on your bed with your head hanging
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:50.720]   over the edge of it. So my thing with that comic that's so memorable is that I was reading it as
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:55.200]   it came out. And I read the end of 11 and could not believe what had happened. And then it was a
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:49:04.080]   magnificently long delay. Where did she number 12? Like forever. This is why I have the shot timer
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:08.640]   on this one. I just thought I'm about to express. Don't worry about it. But yeah, there's a lot of
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.800]   people who think that they absolutely hate the ending. And I think it's the difference between
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:18.640]   the people who've read it like month by month by month, who had to wait so long to see the ending.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:23.200]   And they build this up in their minds. It didn't reach what they thought was going to happen
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:27.680]   versus people of me who read it all at once for which this is like, okay, and turn the page and
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:32.400]   see what happened. So yeah. But it never has been like it before. It was transformational.
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:39.280]   Yeah. Renee Richie, you got to pick for us. Sorry, I got to stop doing comic break weekly.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.200]   No, I really want to. I mean, I'm very interested because I'm watching the TV show and I feel
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:48.560]   right. I need to know what this is. It's all about. I understand. I think you, you, you, me,
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:50.720]   conference, we have to do a comic book podcast. Okay.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:58.320]   So my pick is call me when you do because I need somebody who goes, what the hell's going on?
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:04.800]   I'll be that guy. Go ahead, Renee. So James, Kuda and Savage interact over some of my favorite
[01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:09.760]   developers and they make procreate and they just shipped procreate five. And it's not like the
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:13.520]   biggest update in the world, but it has a few things that people have been really waiting for,
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:19.040]   including cyan, magenta, yellow, black support, which is really nice. Also, it supports Photoshop
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:22.880]   brushes. And I don't want to be the person who like gives you a paper cut and then ports lemon
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:28.640]   juice on it. But that's something that that Photoshop or iPad doesn't yet support. So it's just, it's
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:33.920]   one of these beautifully crafted, incredibly well considered. Everybody I know who's like a
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:39.200]   storyboard artist or an illustrator, like you can see Jim Lee who co-runs DC Comics just putting
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:46.320]   up these images on Instagram or Rob McCullum, who does the the Star Trek Discovery storyboards.
[01:50:46.320 --> 01:50:50.560]   And most of the time they're using procreate and they're just doing such unbelievable work.
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:56.880]   And other people don't realize this, but if you've been like me, I went to a design in an art school
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:01.040]   where they yelled at you if you'd like you had a pencil with an eraser on it. Like you had to have
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:05.440]   like your gumber racer and your white eraser. And there was a third kind that you could like that.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:09.520]   He was like serious business. So I've always been trained to draw with one hand to race with the
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:14.080]   other hand. And this lets you do that like it's not it is a program that if you have ever worked
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:19.440]   in the design or illustration or drawing industry, it just feels like you've come home. And now
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:23.280]   it's got these extra features and it just automatically you don't have to figure out how to export
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:29.680]   one of these. I just does it for you. It is so smart and it they're always when Apple announces
[01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:34.080]   new technologies like metal or they are like already it's not like they're first in line.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:38.160]   It's like they managed to get in the back door and be ready for it as soon as they're legally
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:43.440]   allowed to release it. So I spent a ton of time in this app just doodling and drawing.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:49.200]   And I don't use it to a third of its capabilities, but those capabilities have just gotten way
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:54.720]   better. What I'm happy with it. What I think is amazing is my this is my daughter's probably the
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:52:02.560]   most used app on her eye. Really? And how old is she? She's she's like 10. She's she loves she
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:06.880]   and she just makes amazing drawings on it. But what's amazing is is that as a 10 year old,
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:10.880]   she's probably spends more time on it than anything else. And then one of the best design artists that
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:14.960]   I know is Coley Wertz. He posted on I don't know if he posted everywhere, but he posted like on
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:19.520]   LinkedIn and he'll be like, I did this on my iPhone and procreate with my finger. And you'll
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:23.360]   look at it. You'll just be like, you could you could literally frame it and put it on your on
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:30.640]   your wall, you know, and and so it's both sides are are well, you know, well taken care of.
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:37.120]   I've been going to a figure draw open studio figure drawing for like 10 15 years and the number
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:43.600]   the number of iPads that I now see like I've mixed in with like the the actual actual tangible
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:48.000]   art materials is like now I think we're getting really close to the point where it will be kind
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.320]   of unusual to find someone coming in with a sketchpad. Right. Well, it's just so different.
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:55.920]   Like back in the day when when we were drawing like you would erase and it would wear through
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:00.880]   you have to patch the back of the paper and you have to use half tone and line it up and and
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:05.200]   like stencil it through. And now it's all that stuff. It was like, I've never erased my way
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:09.120]   through an iPad. It's amazing. Yeah. You make mistakes and not to start over. You don't have to trace
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:13.120]   that or not to be like, there's a light table anymore. I can I can just sit there and there was
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:17.520]   this great line from Oak Felder when he was talking about the MacBook Pros where he said that,
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:20.960]   you know, for a long time technology got on your way, you had an idea and you had to fight
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:25.120]   your way through all these layers of technology, if everything from pen to paper and we're getting
[01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:29.440]   to the point where a lot of the stuff is finally becoming like almost no space between the idea
[01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:32.960]   and the expression of it. And that's where it gets really exciting. And that's where I love apps
[01:53:32.960 --> 01:53:37.600]   like Procreate because there's no there's no weirdness in between. I have I want to draw a
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:41.680]   Batman like this. I don't have to worry about the paper, the ink running out, the pencil being
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:45.520]   none of that stuff. I can just take that Batman from my head and put it on the screen and it's
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:51.360]   a wonderful feeling. So name name name and price again because I forgot after all this.
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:56.720]   Procreate five. I forget what it is because this is like the nine bucks but they all the updates
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:01.680]   have been free so far. So I haven't seen a price in like five years. Ten bucks. I mean, that's insane.
[01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:06.800]   It's it's it's one of those apps where occasions I wish there were button to say, look, just let
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:11.760]   me give you some more money here because I'm enjoying and using this too much. So it's like
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:19.200]   $30 worth of software for sure. We were talking about Apple's awards and of course,
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:25.520]   this year the Moloske Knee Flow their kind of drawing app got the best award for 2019.
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:32.240]   Probably because it's new but honestly for for that price get Procreate, right? I mean,
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:38.960]   why would you get? Well, they're they're definitely different types of programs.
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:46.320]   Sort of. Yeah, Procreate is definitely it. The Moloske one is more like how you start your ideas.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:52.000]   It's meant as like a sketching down kind of thing, just some quick sketches and then you move to Procreate
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.200]   to actually make that. So you could have both. It won't be unreasonable. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:05.440]   fair enough. Let's see who's left and Andy did one and Renee and Lori. So I think it's only going
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:12.880]   to be Alex Lindsey and the most expensive one of all. It's not it's not, you know, it's so I
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:18.400]   are a mutual friend, Emory Wells. I love Emory. Had an issue with, you know,
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:23.920]   getting feedback for a lot of the big of commercials he worked on and so on and so forth and he put
[01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:30.240]   together this little thing called Frame.io and I O I O. It's all work. What's exciting about Frame.io
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:36.720]   today is that it is released for the iPad. So up until up until yesterday, when you opened up the
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:40.880]   iPad version, it was basically the iPhone version, which was like tiny on your screen and barely,
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:44.080]   you know, it was very frustrating to work. So no one did it. So what they've done is they've
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:49.040]   updated it so that so that you can now use Frame.io with all of its, you know, would pretty much
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:54.320]   all its power and in a lot of ways more power on your iPad. So what Frame.io is for those of you
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:59.120]   don't use it and pretty much everybody that I know that works in post production uses it.
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:04.800]   And basically what you do is you, you know, you're working on an edit or you're working on a
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:09.840]   commercial and you upload it and you can literally export it straight out of Final Cut or Premiere
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:14.480]   or whatever. And basically it pops in and you can very quickly just go through and add,
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.520]   you know, basically on the timeline, you can sit there and add all your comments. Everybody
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:24.720]   can just go in and just comment, comment, comment, comment, comment. And it will, and it's very tightly
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:30.160]   tied into the post production tools that we're using. And you can draw on things which is where
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:35.840]   it actually is better on the iPad. Like I would definitely prefer to review things now in Frame.io
[01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:41.840]   on the iPad as opposed to my computer because I got a pen. And so I mean, I have a whack-up tablet
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:45.600]   but it's, you know, it's not as easy as just sitting here and just drawing on the screen. And so,
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:50.640]   so I think that this is going to be much easier for folks. And literally I've worked on stuff for
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:56.560]   my dad and my dad, I sent my dad like, here's the login. And my comments started popping up for my
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:02.240]   parents, you know, about the videos I was working on. So it is, it's super easy to get started,
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:07.680]   super easy to use and now even easier to use on your iPad. And so I would, if you haven't,
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:15.200]   if you're doing working with a team and, you know, work, you need to get feedback. This is the
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:20.560]   platform to do it on. And I tried to give someone feedback on a video last week. They sent it to me
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:24.480]   to look at it. I was going to try to type it and because they just sent me the video on Dropbox.
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:28.160]   And I was like, I'm just going to upload this to Frame.io and send them a link. You know, I can't,
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:35.120]   I can't like process the, the, you get used to it. You can't process not doing it that way. So,
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:40.240]   but what's new today is the iPad version. It's, it's amazing. And the, again, the platform is
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:45.280]   pretty much the way to go. It really is a very much of a Mac. I mean, it runs on
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:51.360]   Windows as well, but it's very much of a, if you're a Mac user, you know, Emory is super touchy about
[01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:56.800]   every little way that the interface works and how it flows and how it feels when you use it and
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:01.840]   just makes it, it's a very Mac like, or Apple like experience when you're working with it.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:04.720]   Congratulations. Emory is doing well. I know.
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:07.520]   Two plus weeks. He raised a cool 50 million.
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:12.560]   50 million on top of the, I believe on top of, I don't know whether it's not, it's the total or
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:18.080]   whether it's a new raise on top of the 30 some million. It's a series series. So yeah, yeah.
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:22.000]   So he's twice before. So yeah, he's, look at all those people.
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:28.640]   Yeah, it's, I've been to the office in New York and it's, it's not since the last raise. So I'm
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:33.040]   sure that it's, so he was just like, I mean, what was he doing when he was back in the
[01:58:33.040 --> 01:58:37.600]   post production artist? So this, this is a classic example of someone scratching their own itch.
[01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:42.000]   You know, like he had, this is a problem he had in post production. So he was doing color
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:47.600]   correction and doing, you know, tons of high end work and just saw that he couldn't find a good way
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:55.200]   to solve this. Right. So, so anyway, so it, it, and it just turned into, it's been years
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:59:01.840]   where it kind of ballooned into where it's at. Very nice. Ladies and gentlemen, it is the end,
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:06.560]   but not the end of the end, the beginning of the beginning of the end. There you go.
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:09.840]   Of the end, because for the next five hours, we're going to talk about Watchmen.
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:18.640]   Okay, I bought the annotated big mistake. It's just annotations with black and white frames so
[01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:22.640]   that you could see what they're annotating. So now I have to go back and buy another copy.
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:27.440]   It's only four copies of Watchmen.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:29.200]   You have to click on it. Watchmen books.
[01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:33.920]   One at a time, Leo, where if you just took a step back, the entire story would unveil itself.
[01:59:33.920 --> 01:59:37.600]   I think that's what I need to do. Yes. Yes. Whatever that means.
[01:59:37.600 --> 01:59:44.400]   Renee Richie is at imore.com. He's working right now on Vector. Any minute now, if you only had a
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:50.880]   Mac Pro, you probably could have had it done before the show. I put up a video on the iPhone Pro,
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:55.920]   Leo, three months later. So I didn't have that Pro, so I did a different Pro, but it's still Pro.
[01:59:55.920 --> 02:00:00.880]   It's still Pro, and you're the proist of the Pro's. Thank you. Thank you. It's always great to have
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:07.600]   you on. His partner in crime is the great Lori Gill. She's managing editor at imore.com,
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:13.280]   Apoholic. It's so great to see you. I mean, again, sorry, we missed you on Thursday, but we'll do
[02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:16.960]   it again, and you'll always have an invitation to come down here. If you're in the mood today.
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:19.200]   Yeah, I'm definitely going to make a special trip down here.
[02:00:19.200 --> 02:00:26.560]   You need to come down just so we can regale you with all the champagne. Anthony came in,
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:30.800]   made special drinks for everybody. He had one picked for you. We'll make it for you when you come.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:36.720]   He made me a smoky nogroni or something. It was in a bottle when you opened the
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:41.760]   thing. Smoke came out of it. It's the best drink I ever had. Wow. It was amazing. He put the
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:48.720]   Twit logo. He made Paul Thorett's wife, Stephanie, invented the Patch Tuesday, a special drink to
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:54.560]   drink every second Tuesday of every month. You get the Microsoft updates. It's like a foam. It's
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:59.520]   like a whiskey sour. He made the Twit logo in the top. I mean, this guy went on. He wasn't
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:04.400]   really well. So Anthony, thank you. I don't know what your drink was going to be, but I know he had
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:09.360]   something in mind. When you come down, Lori, we'll arrange to have a special beverage prepared for
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:14.880]   you, which means you'll have to get your hotel as well because you're pretty strong. Alex Lindsey,
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:22.240]   he is at the Twitter at Alex L-I-N-D-S-A-Y and of course, pixelcore.com. It's always a pleasure.
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:26.960]   Anything coming up that you want to tell people about? I am slowly working through
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:32.400]   releasing some new videos. I have a little building this little home studio and it looks kind of
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:36.320]   a mess at the moment. You've got to give us a tour of the home studio at some point.
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:42.080]   Well, I'm not going to get a tour of the one that's in the current state, but it's mostly a
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:46.800]   function of I have a... I decided I wanted to be able to build something in my home office,
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:52.480]   which has got a lot of hardwood and hard walls. So there's lots of moving blankets laying around
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:57.120]   and things and bits and pieces. But you will see pieces of the studio as I start to shoot because
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:02.000]   I'm going to talk about a lot of it's just trying to figure out little things that people
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:08.160]   that we are constantly telling people to do or showing people how to do. So some of it will be
[02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:14.480]   video, some of it will be literally how to build SDI cables and stuff like that. So we're going to
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:21.120]   a little mixture of analog and digital that I'm doing mostly for fun right now. Always fun.
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:27.280]   And how are the Steelers doing? They're doing great. They're doing great. Well, we'll see...
[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:31.280]   This weekend is going to be hard. We might see you in the Super Bowl. Would that be fun?
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:36.400]   A Niners Steelers Super Bowl? The fact that if we end up... Is that possible? It is possible.
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:41.600]   The fact that if we make it to the Super Bowl, the fact that we had a guy who literally
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:47.360]   walked on to the... Was a walk on and is now the starting quarterback. Isn't that amazing?
[02:02:47.360 --> 02:02:51.040]   And he's doing great. Ben got hurt. And Ben got hurt. And then we went to our
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:55.600]   number two guy and he didn't turn out as well. So we went to this guy that literally just kind
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:59.920]   of walked on. And he's doing... What's his name? His name... Why don't I know him as Duck?
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:05.920]   It's not Turbiscus. He's known as the Duck. What is... And I can't think of his name at the moment.
[02:03:05.920 --> 02:03:23.080]   No one knows. I don't know if he's a
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:28.720]   Delvin Hodges. So I'm embarrassed as a Steelers fan that I don't know him as Delvin.
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:35.440]   He actually... If I'm ever Delvin, I'd call myself the Duck too. But I think my brother... There's a
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:44.400]   place called Geodontos down in San Francisco that is all Steelers fans on Sunday. So I think
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:50.080]   we're going to go down in... Turbiscus the Bears. That's right. I confuse these East Coast big
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:57.040]   shoulder industrial city teams. Alliance the Bears and the Steelers. The only thing that was
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:00.240]   fun about the last game is that there were almost as many Steelers fans or possibly more
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:08.160]   Steelers fans than there were in the stadium. And Phoenix and the problem is that what people
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:12.080]   understand is that Steelers, you can't go to a Steelers game in Pittsburgh because it's all
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:16.640]   season tickets and takes 10 years to get a season ticket. So people literally fly to all these other
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:23.200]   games because they can't see them at home and they get pretty excited. It's been a good season for
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:31.760]   us to up here in the... Yeah. Shablis sipping Northern California-ish. Andy Renee. Alex Prosecco.
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:36.640]   Laurie, thanks so much for being here. Thanks to all of you guys for watching. We do Mac
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.000]   Break Weekly. We try to do it. It's supposed to be at 11 a.m. But God, I always today is just getting
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:48.160]   longer and longer and longer. What we're going to work on that, I've made a vow to get in here
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:53.760]   early and get the show off so we can get on at 11 a.m. Hey man, San Francisco is supposed to be
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:58.160]   mellow. Hey, Leo, if only you play through. If Mac Break is not early in Mac Break,
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:06.240]   it'll happen. Let's flip them. Finally, I finally have the Watchman in color on my iPad.
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:14.000]   Oh my God, it took a while. I'm excited. I've never read it before, you know? Yeah. So this is
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.840]   very exciting. And with Comixology, you double tap and then you get the guided thing, right?
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:24.400]   That's the idea. Or you can just squeeze and pinch and easily end all the way in, all the way in,
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:27.760]   all the way in. This is much better. You're so right. You're all optimized. Yeah. So much easier to
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:31.040]   read than it was on the end. Yeah, absolutely. I'm going to go tweet Andy from 12 years ago.
[02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:37.600]   We do this show. As I was trying to say, Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time,
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:42.640]   that's 1800 UTC. Stop by and watch us live. You know what? It's an apple all morning. So just,
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:48.080]   you know, come by, Twitter TV slash live, audio and video available in the live stream.
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:55.840]   Chatroom is always fun, always engaged, family friendly at IRC dot twit.tv. If you can't watch live,
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:59.600]   and I know you got a life, you can always get on demand versions of the show, audio and video,
[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:06.000]   both at our website, Twitter TV slash MBW. Best thing to do, subscribe, and then you'll get it.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:11.040]   The minute it's available, we really appreciate it. If you subscribe, it helps us and it'll help you.
[02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:16.880]   So that's about it for Mac break weekly. Now it's time to say get back to work when you're
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:27.120]   beautiful Mac Pro with its XDR display, Jonathan. Because break time is over. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:39.520]   Bye.
