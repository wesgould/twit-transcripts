[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.080]   We're going to try to figure out what Apple might announce in the next couple of months,
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.360]   what they're going to announce in the June time frame and what they're going to announce in the
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.720]   fall. Our peerless prognosticators will give you their predictions in just a little bit.
[00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.680]   The story of the air tag that uncovered a secret German intelligence division.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.200]   And what's gone wrong with iCloud's sync? It's all coming up next.

[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.040]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we talk about the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:07.200]   The news is next with Andy and I go from WGBH Boston and Ploits and Point East. Hello Andrew.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.800]   Hello Leo. He's stockpiling COVID tests.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.560]   Not for sale profiteering. I'm only exchanging them for favors. That's a totally different thing.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:28.400]   Okay. I don't know if favors means what you think it means. Anyway,
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.920]   no, no, it's exactly what you think it means. It means that when I call an electrician to say,
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.240]   you know, maybe he'll come over, maybe he'll say, well gosh, maybe you would like an extra
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.160]   COVID to rapid test to take home with you. It's like cigarettes in prison. I mean,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.640]   this is the currency of the age. It's good to have. Renee Richie also here, youtube.com/Renee Richie.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.600]   Hello, Sam. I'm not doing as well as Don Andy of you bag of COVID tests.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   Don Andy.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.560]   Don Andy.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.400]   Bag of COVID tests.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.680]   Oh, it's on my mind because I went in for a rapid test this morning because Michael,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.080]   our son has it, but he's on the...
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.040]   I hope he's feeling better.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.120]   He's feeling, well, not much better. He sounds like he has a cold. He's talking like this.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.640]   It's like I caught everyone at the last minute. All my friends on Twitter at the last minute,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.160]   they're like, oh, we almost made it. It's close. Alex Lindsey is also quarantined at home,
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.200]   but everybody comes to him with office hours.global. Hello, Alex.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.320]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.040]   Good to see you.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.000]   Good to be here.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.680]   You got the world in your studio, basically. They come to you.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.320]   You know, it's just it's really well set up and it's nice.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.400]   It's the future.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.200]   Yeah, it really is. You're like, you're like JT and Blade Runner. You just got like all your little
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.120]   friends.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.720]   You know, they did.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.280]   When you come in your studio, this office hours wake up and go, good morning. Good morning,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.280]   Alex.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.080]   It is pretty much like I go, I get up early. I kind of read the news a little bit and
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.960]   somewhere between five and five thirty in the morning, I just turn on. People are already in
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.880]   conversation. They're all like, and I just like, and sometimes I just listen for a while and I'm
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   like, I'll just listen because I don't want to interrupt anything. I just kind of sit in the back
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.160]   and then when it gets quiet, I'm like, hi, everybody. And then we start talking and the whole
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.360]   thing's the whole thing goes until nine. It's a lot of fun. That's really cool.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.240]   Yeah, it's very relaxed.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.200]   Yeah, it's good. Alex, do you ever wonder that maybe you've got a fight club thing going on here
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.120]   where there's actually part of your personality that's running the show when you think that you're
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.520]   quote a sleep? It's quite.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.920]   I have to say, I've gone in there and Alex is always there. Something called Alex.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.560]   Or they're calling it Tyler for some reason. Tyler Durden.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.800]   It was funny. I leave it on like radio. So I just listen a lot of the time. So I'll be working
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.720]   and I just listen because office hours runs, of course, after hours runs 21 hours a day, the
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.640]   time that office hours isn't running. And so I just listen to after hours. Like anytime I'm not
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.480]   in a meeting and I'm just working on things, like I just play it in the background and then I can
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.160]   just jump in and say something. It's like listening to really cool radio by really smart people
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.800]   where you can actually contribute if it makes sense. And then you can go back to what you're doing.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.920]   Sometimes it's only a couple words.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:15.520]   I poor Mike, a sergeant, our producer and a host of iOS today has been putting in extra hours
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.720]   trying to find anything, anything to talk about our top story this week.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.480]   How to clean the polishing cloth.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:30.160]   No, no. I can't know. No. You got to.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.240]   That's the only thing I can say.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   Wait, wait, wait. That's how big they are.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.680]   This is how big they are. They're tiny for 19 shucks.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   But they're so nice. These were only 10. These were only 950.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.440]   Oh, no. These are the official apple ones.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.040]   No, these are them. These are the official ones.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.880]   Do they have the little apple embossed on it?
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.560]   Yeah, right there.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.800]   That's how big they are.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.680]   So what happened was is that I ordered like, I don't know what happened, but I ordered these.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.640]   I was like, I have to know what this is like. You know, like, I have to have a
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.120]   understanding of this. I can't be left out of the club here.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.480]   So I ordered one and Apple the next day said, there's something wrong with your shipment.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.280]   We're going to say you know the one.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.160]   Oh, nice.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.960]   We'll say you another one.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.760]   Then they both showed up.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.240]   Nice.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.400]   So there, you know, so anyway, so I've got extra one.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.640]   I'm not sure.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.040]   They are.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.920]   I will say.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.520]   Are you sure they're not 19 dollars?
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.200]   Because that's what there's the list price is.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.680]   Maybe you got it.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.080]   They are.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.600]   I bought one and they threw some kind of shipping air.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.640]   Apple just immediately.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.360]   You got a bo-go.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.680]   It was like, yeah, it was like Apple. The app store.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.040]   I got to tell you, the Apple store, they've really figured this out.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.040]   I mean, I ordered a Mac mini and it showed up at my house in an hour and a half.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.040]   It took you longer to drive to quarter-minute air on the back.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.360]   Career, air-a-ring, career-a-ring them.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.560]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.520]   Anyway, so just so you know, hand wash the polishing cloth with dish soap and water,
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.120]   rinse thoroughly, then allow it to air dry for 24 hours.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.240]   Says, so right here.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.240]   So there you go.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.120]   Make sure you do that.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.840]   Doing a little ASMR.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.960]   This is how you know those are twice the performance of Android Cloth.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.040]   The funniest thing is, I'm open to wipe my mouth with it if I want to.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.600]   But if you listen, so here's the microfiber.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.360]   Sounds like a rodent.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   I think it must be different.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.920]   These were hand skinned by Johnny Ive in a forest, okay,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.200]   in a rubber oil wonderland.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.720]   I'm honestly perturbed that they're that small.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.760]   That's how you handle them, Leo.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.960]   Did the ones that come with the XDR display, are they that small as well?
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.040]   Didn't the MacBooks used to come with big like 8 by 8 cloths or you know?
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.760]   Those were un-ra-ed.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.640]   These are all you need.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.320]   Smaller is all you need.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.880]   I mean, you only use like a corner of it at a time.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.440]   I guess it's using for oven mitts, Andy.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.800]   Sorry, Alex, use them for oven mitts.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.000]   No, I've not used them as oven mitts because then I would have to wash them by hand again.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.520]   They don't beat the office.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.280]   It's kind of like baseball gum.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.600]   Baseball cards used to come with a big stick of gum.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.160]   And over the years it got smaller and smaller and smaller.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.120]   They called it the cards.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.760]   They called it gum.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.840]   I'm not the only one that was the card.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.240]   And what we call, we got, you got, you got, but you still got the retro NFTs,
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.520]   otherwise known as the cards.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.800]   Yeah, you did get the retro, the, in the retro NFTs.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.640]   All right, well, that's our top story.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.440]   Thank you everybody.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.480]   Thanks everybody.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.480]   Alex Lindsey, buy one, get one.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.880]   Apple polishing cloths.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.280]   There is of course from Mark Gurman and you know, you always say this Renee,
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.600]   so I'll save you the trouble.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:31.440]   This is Mark's speculation, not based on information.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.240]   Is that that?
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.360]   The non-Blueberg, the stuff that Bloomberg wouldn't put in the article.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.640]   You can put it as newsletter.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.480]   Yeah, he deserves a platform.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.920]   Blueberg is super stringent.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.000]   Mark on 9 to 5 was so much fun.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.440]   Mark on Bloomberg is very blue.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.360]   It's very like big journal.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.120]   So I like that he has some fun on the newsletter.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.840]   Well, ever since Bloomberg announced that,
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:59.040]   a hostile nation had already embedded invisible tracking chips
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:03.920]   in every piece of communication equipment that nobody in America was able to find,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.360]   even though they were looking for it.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.040]   I believe they pursued a once burned twice what, twice burned.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.720]   Yeah, the new, the new, the new, the new, the new, Jason Bloomberg.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.520]   So some of this, I think is rumor.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.960]   Some of it is speculation.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:27.440]   Apple's big event, actually, first of all, he says, and this is he thinks this is going to be
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.320]   the biggest year for new products, you know, and ages for Apple 2022.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.480]   A lot of this won't be out in the spring, but there is, I think, widespread belief,
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.520]   for good reason that Apple will have a spring event.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.760]   There was no spring event in 2020 because of the pandemic, but they did release.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.560]   Yeah, it got canceled.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.920]   They did release MacBook Airs and iPads in the March of that year,
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.040]   second generation iPhone SE in April and a 13 inch MacBook Pro update in May.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.160]   Magic keyboard.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:10:01.520]   Last spring, they did have an event, April 20th, Earth Day, remember, it was AirTags,
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.200]   M1, the first M1 products, including iPad Pro.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.840]   No, no, this wasn't the first one.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.040]   It was the second generation, the iMac, the colorful iMacs.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.720]   So,
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.920]   horrible iPhones, AirTags.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:21.840]   R's Technica has put together a list of past years, April 20th, March 25th,
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.600]   March 27th, March 21st.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.320]   I'm thinking we should see something in March, right, Renee?
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   I mean, the sooner the better for me, I just want to get this year started already.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.120]   And I say that is like 2020 was so slow.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.280]   2021 and 2022 feel like the weeping angels from Dr. Who, where we have my blink, a month
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.000]   gets closer.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.240]   And if I blink again, the month gets even closer.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.440]   So, I'm hesitant about it going past going on too fast.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.080]   But I like that something will get going again.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.320]   And these are not the most challenging of products, VR headsets and things like that
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.840]   are way more dubious or way more challenging.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.800]   And iPhone SE with 5G, they can ship that, right?
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.800]   And there are, besides speculation on the Gurbins part, there seems to be some
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.480]   reliable reports about an iPhone 5G SE.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.640]   So, the Russian registry has leaked.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.800]   Russian iPhones and IPOs.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.640]   And the European Economic Commission, their radio and telephone telegraph,
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.200]   still telegraphs.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.240]   The Radio and Telegraph Commission says a bunch of new iPad models, we think, are on the way.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:36.080]   I have Apple also, I think, in this spring one, sometimes it often thinks about education,
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.720]   you know, in that area because this is when people are making their final purchasing
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.000]   decisions for the fall.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.520]   And so, we could see, you know, iPads that are kind of leaning towards that.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.240]   I think we could possibly see some movement in the USDZ process.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.120]   That, you know, Apple is slowly rolling the USDZ out to everything.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.160]   This would be the best time if they want schools to think about it to release it for,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.400]   you know, something like keynote and pages and stuff like that.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:04.960]   So, it'll be interesting to see if they do anything in the USDZ/photogrammetry route.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:09.920]   But they usually want to get educators excited as well as part for this specific event.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.080]   Ours points out the iPad Air has been updated since late 2020.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.440]   Unusual for the Air last year.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.520]   Yeah, it comes to the pro typically the leader in this.
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.520]   The pro was every 18 months until last year when it was 12 months,
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.720]   but it feels like it's going to go back to 18 months, like towards the end of the year when M2
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:34.560]   is ready. But the iPad Air and the iPad Mini have been, you know, two years here, two and a half
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.680]   years there. The iPad Mini, I think was the most egregious recently.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.680]   The baby iPad, the iPad, I forgot they call it now, the ninth generation,
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.640]   eighth generation, those have been every 12 months. Every September they've had one
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.200]   for the last four years is just the middle range.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.240]   Is it tied to the chip?
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:57.120]   Like when they have a new chip, do they have an A15 in the pros and the Mini has an A15?
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.640]   Yeah, and it's in the Mini and it's going to go into the Air this market role.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.600]   So that's kind of the laggard. So if you were to see where the chips were,
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.000]   and then who's got them and then who doesn't, then that would be the next one, which is, well,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.400]   I think like the Mini was really popular for a while and then like it led iPhone,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.920]   iPad sales for a while enough that it actually destabilized the larger iPads.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.760]   But then when the phone's got bigger, people started choosing bigger phones over smaller
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.680]   iPads and going back to the larger size iPads and we got the pros and the movement went back
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.880]   in that direction. And I think the Mini was just on the back burner like Apple.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.720]   Apple has a small teams approach where they have limited bandwidth for a certain amount of products
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.520]   every year and the Mini just fell lower and lower on that list.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.280]   Like with the Mac Mini does unfortunately so often it's not the most, it's one of the least
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.440]   popular of those products. Geez, you think the Mac Mini would be more popular, honestly.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:49.120]   I think that the M1 has changed the Mac. The M1 has changed the Mac Mini completely.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.520]   Like it is a different machine. It is essentially could be I mean with a high end M1 with an M1 Max
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.680]   could be the real. See, I mean it's a very powerful desktop with the M1 Max.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   Right. It's just the desktops aren't that popular. Apple's that's the problem.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:07.600]   Yeah, it's the problem. Consumer, mainstream consumer laptops, especially the air.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:13.520]   When the Mac Mini was first announced, it was the idea was if you're a developer and you're in
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:19.680]   Windows, you could kind of inexpensively because it was about 500 bucks test and develop for the
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:23.360]   Mac. You just put it in place. In fact, I think they even like showed it sitting on a PC tower.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:29.760]   Like it would be very easy for you to just have that. That's those days, nobody's doing that or
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:32.800]   is it supposed to get the pro version of that this spring too, like we're supposed to get
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.240]   a Mac Mini with the M1 Max. That's what the one I'm trying for.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.880]   Which would be a hell of a machine. Yeah. I mean, I'm doing, I'm it used to be, we used to, I mean,
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.960]   I've had at any given time had a lot of Mac Mini's because we use them for glue. Like,
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.040]   oh, I need a little thing to do this or I need a little thing to do that. I'm now using them for
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:53.600]   playback systems, resolve, cinema, 4D, final cut motion, like all of those things are working on the
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.520]   Mac Mini because I have the M1 and that's even with 8 gigs or 16.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.760]   Does that late lower and M1 have the pro riz playback chip? No, no, no. So the hardest part for me
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.080]   has been waiting for that because I don't need a laptop anymore. I don't travel enough to make
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:12.080]   that worth it. And so so I have a I have lots of laptops, but I don't need a new one in the
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.760]   other direction. Yeah. Do you think that's a lot of the large? Yeah. A lot of us. There's just more
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.600]   and more people. I mean, that are going to work virtually there, working for, you know, they're
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:27.840]   working on those things. So why have a laptop or, you know, maybe have an air MacBook Air and have
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:33.680]   something more powerful at the desktop? It's just the price. It's so inexpensive and so powerful that
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:40.240]   if we get if we get a Mac Mac Mini with a max that's at $9.99, it would be, you know, you just get so
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:48.480]   much power and so much connectivity in the back end. You have ethernet cables, HDMI and USB-C's and
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.920]   USB-A's and all of those things are all there for you. And then it's a nice compact, you know,
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.560]   it doesn't take up your desk space, you know, as well. So well, let me ask just an amazing little
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.560]   ball. All three of you are peerless prognosticators. Mac Mini this spring, iMac 30 inch this spring
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.840]   or this fall, Renee, Springer fall. What are you? I'm putting on the end of the car neck.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:18.160]   I think we'll get the iPhone SE. We'll get the iPad Air. We'll get the Mac Mini. And then
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.880]   I would love to get I think a 27 inch iMac is what they've fallen on. But it's and the latest
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:28.800]   rumor that it's going to have a 12 core version of the M1 Mac chip set available at the ultra high end
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.360]   instead of a two-die version. It'll just have extra extra performance cores, which will help,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.120]   you know, help some pro workloads. But it sounds like that is less certain. Like whether that'll
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.160]   be ready in time is less certain. So I'm going to leave that as my bonus round.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.320]   This chip shortage somewhat of an issue still. Does it make it somewhat unbridgable?
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.800]   Not so much a shortage is that there's only the shortage is always on the legacy nodes.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.000]   It's like that's why cars are such a trouble. It's like on the big nanometer processes.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.880]   Apple pays so much money and buys so much in advance that it's just and they're the only they
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:02.320]   ship more premium devices than the next three or four big companies combined. So they have unlimited
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.720]   unlimited use of that node, but just that node itself is limited and Apple has to prioritize.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.600]   Like iPhones are getting chips first. Right. And then when like things fall down and stack behind
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.120]   the iPhone. Well, good news because I'm not causing a big plant in Ohio in a couple of years,
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:19.520]   they'll be making apple chips and TSMC though. They're going all in on TSM. So they do that.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.520]   So they're going to make TSMC even bigger to compete with and an up with yours. Yeah,
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.800]   we'll talk about that. I read bed Thompson's article. It was very interesting.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.120]   Andy and I co-pierless prognosticator.
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.240]   Sprague. I would I'd be shocked if there weren't a new Mac mini in the next couple of months.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.320]   Oh good. Because one of the things that we're looking at is that remember that Apple said that
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.280]   the transition to M1, the transition to Apple Silicon would be complete in two years.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:48.480]   So that means that by the end of this year, they should at least announce new Mac pros.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:54.640]   We haven't heard anything about what a new Mac pro with Apple Silicon is going to look like.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.800]   So you would think that you'd see we would've heard something by now if they were going to be
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.600]   doing something in March or April and it would make sense for them to say all the people who are
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.640]   kind of hot and bothered to get a Mac mini. Let's get their money first and then let's but let's not.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:18.320]   Don't you know the Mac pro release with a mini. Yeah, exactly. And so it would be awesome if the
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:25.040]   idea of a if it were difficult to choose between a high end Mac mini with Apple Silicon and a low
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.880]   end Mac pro with Apple Silicon. But that's the reason why I'm going to wait until the end of the
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.880]   year before. I mean, desktop purchase. Yeah, Mac mini, I think for sure. Because that little cheese
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.760]   grater looks so cute. Well, you want the PCIE slots, right? I mean, that's going to be the big
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:43.360]   hopefully that'll be the big. You know, I think I think they're going to go for a hybrid design
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:48.320]   between like the cylindrical tower and the cheese grater is going to be the pepper grinder Mac pro.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:57.760]   Okay, and Mac pro I think we renamed mention this last week, but it seems like they might
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.640]   preview that in June for releasing the end of the year. Yeah, that we might see some details.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.480]   Anyway, but the last two they've got to because we're, you know, developers need this, Leo,
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.680]   they need this. We've been along three years. We need this Alex Lindsey, your peerless
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:20.080]   prognostication. I think that the SE and the iPad have a lot of possibilities and then
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:27.760]   those are pretty core. Do they put the Mac mini out in the spring or in June, I think is the question
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:32.560]   or you know, they may roll out a lot of hardware in June and not as much in the spring. So that
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.600]   that might be one thing to kind of track. And then the other things that we're going to be
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.400]   tracking and what are they talking about with education education is explosive right now,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.160]   just because there's so much movement. So there's a lot of a lot of people paying attention to
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.720]   education at the moment from from a business perspective. And then the other thing is whether
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.560]   unity shows up on the, you know, on stage. So, you know, unity is finished. It's purchase of
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.120]   Weta. They just bought some more stuff this week. And it'll be interesting to see if Apple
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.880]   includes them as and that would be kind of the solution. The final movement from Epic
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:10.080]   into something new is unity actually being on stage. And that's going to be, you know, a lot of,
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.600]   I think a lot of folks in my world are paying attention to whether Apple really starts to
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.240]   embrace unity or whether they just stay neutral and we'll find out in a monster.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:22.720]   They're not exactly neutral because they're not but what we haven't seen,
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.160]   we've seen them not get along with unity. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.800]   Yeah. We haven't seen a lot of unity on on stage. And that's that's the thing is that, but unity
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:37.520]   now what Weta Digital, you know, they really ought to buy up their unity's buying up a lot
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.320]   technology. I think it's a dubbed up thing. But I, but they for a while they were showing Epic
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:47.360]   every single show every single keynote Epic was showing up. So the fact that they're not, I think,
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.680]   it's been I think that nothing that showing up is a is a function of Apple re gearing.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:58.320]   They show show an Epic game every every every time and Pokemon go uses unity so they could just
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.200]   go back to that. It's interesting because the gaming world is now rapidly changing thanks to
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:11.040]   Microsoft's intended acquisition of Activision Blizzard putting them really in a sweet spot,
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:16.400]   also for mobile gaming because there's Call of Duty mobile and they got they get king with that,
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:22.400]   which is Candy Crush. And I wonder if Apple is going to ignore it and say, okay, fine,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.040]   we're doing fine. We don't need to worry about it. Or if they're going to try to push back.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.280]   Well, I think the question now Leo, that's court apples business. Yeah.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.640]   I think it's an alley for Apple. Is it? Yeah. I think that's the way you push makes so much money.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.960]   I think that's why Microsoft paid so much money. Part of the reason many, many reasons to do it,
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.560]   but getting into mobile in a strong way is good for Microsoft. Go ahead.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:50.800]   Also, getting into NFTs and that type of thing. These games all have things that are digital assets
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.480]   that people are paying attention to. Yeah. In-game purchases, something that I think a lot of people
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.480]   are really interested in. I think that there's a lot of reasons why this makes sense if we wanted
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:05.280]   to talk about it. e-sports, cloud, I mean, on and on and on. In fact, it's good for Mac.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:12.560]   It's good for Mac. I guess iOS in some ways too because of Microsoft's game pass and cloud-based
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.920]   gaming business. You'll be able to play in Safari. It's good for that too.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:24.480]   If you look at Microsoft's purchasing over the last five years or five years or so, it's been amazing.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:34.000]   Their acquisition, very smart, big purchases, big buys. They've linked in.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.320]   Just so many things that are really putting together are very complex.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.520]   It's something that I think that is one of Apple's weaknesses is that they don't acquire more.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.400]   They don't do a lot of... They do do. They do do. They still do large ones.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.200]   It's difficult culturally for them. Yeah, that's why they do big ones. They do act with buyers more.
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:58.720]   When they do a lot of acquisitions in the sub-500 million, there's a lot that happens down there.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.760]   They don't get into the very few. Once you go over a billion dollars, there's very few that Apple
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:12.400]   acquires. This Microsoft's acquisition is nearly 70 billion. If you can ignore 1.3 billion...
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.440]   Yeah, the kids won at 69. We know that was the best number that this one would be skipped.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.440]   I mean, but this is a game of deal. Huge, huge.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.960]   We're charging most people 72, but we're going to 79.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:29.120]   The fact that as big as that is, biggest acquisition ever, a month's worth of revenue for
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.960]   Microsoft, half of their cash position. It still looks like a good business deal.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.160]   It tells great business. I think it is good. And is there happy to tell regulators are still
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:42.400]   smaller than Sony? And they're still number three after 10-cent and Sony.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:51.440]   All right, so I think there seems some consensus that we will see some very interesting things
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.440]   March, April. We may see you're a pixleo. We need your pun.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.440]   You didn't ask me. I'm not a peerless prognostic. I'm asking you. I'm merely your host.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:05.120]   I can tell you what I hope. The sooner the better for a Mac mini, because I would love to see a
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:12.080]   high-end M1 Mac's Mac mini with 32 gigs or better even 64 gigs of RAM. That would be a one.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.680]   You're not going to buy one. I don't need one. I'm not buying one. Exactly.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.640]   Yeah, that's so excited. I got a 55-inch OLED display just waiting to plug into it.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:25.840]   You know, that's that that's hits the head of the Mac mini. It's not so it's not even all about
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.640]   the power. It's about the be the ability to use the accessories you want, have the layout you want.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:35.520]   Exactly. For me, it really is about I want to I want a triple screen setup. I want three identical
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:41.440]   screens. And like and if I in the near future, I buy a huge like Samsung curved display,
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.680]   which is I keep lusting after. Like that's that's the sort of thing I want to be able to do. I don't
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:51.760]   want to hit these limitations of this was designed to be sort of a laptop in a box. So you can hit
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:58.320]   one or two screens with it and try not to get more than this much of Ethernet traffic because it
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.160]   doesn't like that. This is the sort of stuff we want. This is this is this is what we'll define
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.200]   the difference between again, entry level Mac Pro, super super maxed out Mac mini.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.720]   Are we just weird because you just said Alex and I think you're right, nobody buys desktops
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.760]   anymore at all four of us. Maybe not you. Well, no, not we're all looking at desktops again.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:21.360]   I'm not normal. We're not normal. Yeah, we're peeling. I'll just I'll just I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:29.280]   Oops. No, please go ahead. I want to say is that good. Good. Good. Good. I think I think that
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:33.040]   because I have something very quick to say said, I do think that that that's one of the things
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.600]   that delineates the differences between the Mac market and the PC market that the PC market is
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.240]   heavily, heavily, heavily desktops. Whereas the Mac market, it's nice. It's a big chunk of it,
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.880]   but it doesn't define the space. So I think that that's that doesn't that doesn't define
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.360]   a worldwide trend. It defines one of the differences between Mac markets and PC markets.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:57.040]   I think we'll definitely see an A15 iPhone SE 5G. That's pretty obvious. That's in March.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:01.120]   iPad Air. That's pretty obvious. That's in March. I agree with all you guys.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.600]   The real question the only real question mark is what are we going to see with them one?
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.080]   What we see something in March, I'm thinking not. I'm thinking now they're going to hold off
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:15.280]   till June do the well, but then they don't want the mini to overlap it anyway,
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.640]   even with a preview of the Mac Pro. So the mini I think comes out this. I'm going to move the
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.760]   Mac Pro gets previewed. I'm trying to suppress the Mac Pro are different and kind. So those
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.320]   can like they've done that before 2017, we got the the iMac Pro and then we got them.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:33.120]   You know, it's just it works. It works. Leo, I'm just trying to suppress my
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.680]   not mingle my desire for a mini to come out in March or April, March.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.480]   I think with with the actual facts of the matter. I think the Mac Pro is going to I don't think
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:49.600]   we're going to hear about it until October. Really not even a preview and well, I don't think so.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:53.200]   They have so much to release. They have so much to release. They have so much to release.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.640]   They have so much to release. They have so many things that to release. There's no reason to
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.600]   do it. I'm back to announce something that's not going to come out. I'm Mac Pro in June.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:06.080]   Mac mini in a how about this March Mac mini iMac Pro June October.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:10.240]   Let us work on it. Yeah, we should let us do it. We'll do it. Yeah, we'll put it together.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.400]   Big piece we're missing is we have no idea where any of these products stand whether they're ready.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.080]   Yes, they can get the chips. We have details. Where's they're going to present from? I mean,
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.760]   are they going to do it from San Diego or are they going to do it from Monterey or are they going to
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.600]   they were wrote to then they didn't they stop in the last one they didn't I was really hoping they'd
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.200]   like do the world next. You know, they're pretty committed to California.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.160]   Depends how long this all goes on. Oh, it's only a matter of time before the Great Wall.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.120]   The pandemic lasts another two years. They'll be on the Great Wall so fast.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.960]   Nio!
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:44.320]   It just adds a little bit of context to this. I was having a conversation once with one of the people
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:49.040]   on Apple's teams and talking about external displays because I really want Apple to go back to
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:54.960]   making an affordable external display. And just like the numbers I got for how many like if I ask
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.080]   on Twitter, 95% of people will say like external displays and external display support is the
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:05.040]   biggest thing that they want in iPadOS. They're on the Mac mini all of these things. The amount
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:10.960]   of people who actually use external displays on iOS is low single digits and on MacOS it's like
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:16.400]   mid teens. So like the difference between like our tech world and what mainstream people do who
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.200]   just open up their MacBook Air and type in the coffee shop vastly different worlds. And I think
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.800]   we get shuffled in behind those big products. So they have like their Apple for the year.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.040]   I'm down to seven. I mean, I'm down to seven screens. So I feel very proud.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:35.520]   Lisa, so Lisa's iMac superannuated. It's really time to get at home. It's time to get a new one.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:41.280]   And she has it paired with that screen that you want, Andy, the 49 inch curved wide screen.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.160]   It's really kind of ungainly as she that's how she likes to do it though. And I'm and I just told her
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:54.080]   we get you a mini. You can have two 49 inches. Yeah, go all the way around you. You could have
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:00.400]   NASA like. Yeah. I saw I saw someone with a setup where it was two of those screens stacked on top
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:06.400]   of each other with a webcam in the middle. And I'm like aspiration. That's basically what I have.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.800]   Samsung ones with the 55 inches to 49 stack. But there's no bezel. It's just it's the size of
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.640]   two four nines one on top of the other. It's great. You don't have the big curved gamer display.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.840]   I don't have it. I don't have a curve. It's like a giant TV. I'm a big fan of 24s because I just
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:28.000]   put more of them up. Yeah. Like a little modular system. It's like I have feelings because it
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.760]   enables help with organization. Because with that big display that's just windows everywhere floating
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.680]   around. I think that's that. Yeah, I mean, for me, it's like with synergy. I'm just like, I just
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.160]   drag my mouse over. Oh, you have different computers and all those displays. Oh, yeah. I have like,
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:46.560]   I have a bunch of different. I have like, you know, four four computers and his app.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:51.760]   Is that synergy? Not out, right? I have it on. I'm using synergy now. No, no, the apple version.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.400]   Universal control. Oh, no, but but the problem for me is that I'm universal control. I think is really,
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:01.440]   it's it's a mix. You're matching a lot of stuff so that it's not you want you want windows and
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.800]   yeah. Yeah. No, I've used synergy for years. Yeah, I know I learned from you.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.960]   This is not what they still make it. I mean, I feel like it's kind of it's gotten better and
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:16.560]   better. Actually, yeah, it's really smooth. Yeah. It's going over the network, which is
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:27.360]   yeah, really weird. Yeah, no, I actually have like four identical like Dell mid range monitors
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.440]   because 24 inch monitors. I'm with you, Alex. The only thing is I just don't want to look like
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:37.360]   a damn day trader when people come in. You say diamond hands, diamond hands,
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.280]   stock to the moon to the moon to the moon. They're buying themselves. So they're selling
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:48.080]   to buy by synergies from now from sim less S Y M L E S S dot common. The nice thing is this
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.880]   cross platform. I didn't see this works on a Raspberry Pi to so you could have one of those
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:58.080]   screens could be, you know, you could move it over to the little pie screen. So yeah, that's a,
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:03.600]   it's a really good solution. I agree with you, Alex. I'm glad to know it's still working for you.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.040]   I still have a, I still have a KVM just in case every once in a while,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.560]   soon as he comes up and it doesn't really sink right and you have to go in and touch something.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.200]   So I still have the KVM in the system, but, but I, but I just generally,
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:20.480]   all right. Now I'm going to throw monkey wrench into all of our carefully laid prognostications.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:27.120]   What about because at some point this year, Apple is supposed to announce a VR headset.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.680]   What are they? Where do they sustain?
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.200]   I really thought about it. I think, I think we may be a little early. I think it may be a year
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.320]   early, year, 15 months early. I think, I mean, I think that, I think it might take more time.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:43.200]   It could come out, it'll come out at WWDC. So it'll either, we'll either see it in June or we'll see
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:48.240]   it the next June. I think that it's definitely within one, you know, within this year or next year,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.000]   but I'm not sure if they're, if they're really ready to do it. There's a bunch of things, again,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.040]   there's a bunch of parts of that runway that they still need to construct like a wider solution.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.920]   So one of the problems with AR is not just the AR, it's creating the content for AR.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.960]   And a lot of us deal with this of all the, it's still a pretty rough system to build the content
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.160]   that you will see. It's fine for people to buy all these things, but they have to have something
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:19.680]   to do with them. And so, and right now, most of the 3D software programs don't really do USDZ
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:25.040]   very well. And that's a core piece of AR working. And so, I think that there could be a chance that,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:29.280]   in addition to hardware and other things that they're sorting out, that having a little bit more
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.640]   runway into 2023 would allow them to kind of fill out that. And really where that would happen again
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:39.600]   is putting USDZ into the office apps, because what it'll do is it'll drive demand for the,
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.800]   for the geometry. And then that builds this huge area. All that stuff will be available.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.440]   With millions of models will be available in 15 months if they put it into keynote.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:58.080]   Yeah. I think that I agree. I wouldn't necessarily say that I wouldn't put money on them not releasing
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.560]   something or showing off something in 2022. But I don't think it's imminent. I don't think there's
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:07.600]   any rush for Apple to get involved in this. I think that the earliest we would see something is a
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.960]   developer announcement at WWDC and not availability to consumers for quite a while after that. I
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:20.160]   keep thinking that I can't see this happening other than Apple releases a super expensive
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:26.800]   headset that is really attended just for developers and just for researchers to lay the ground.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:33.280]   Because this is, remember, they are not, they're going to go for something a lot more ambitious
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:38.720]   than what Oculus is doing right now. Meaning, here is a blank canvas developers, by all means,
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.040]   put your games, put your VR experiences here. I really think that they are going to want to come
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:48.000]   up with a paradigm for virtual reality computing. And this is going to be a lot like how, what is
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.840]   the language going to be? What is the interface going to be? How do you switch between apps without
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.600]   making people feel as though they're being thrown into a ditch? And I think that that's going to
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:02.000]   take a lot of time. And they might even go as far as to make, to do sort of an OS 10 sort of release.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.400]   If you remember how that one rolled out where they, it was a public thing, they couldn't hide it.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:11.760]   It was a public beta first. And then it was three, four, five editions before, yes, you could print,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:17.520]   yes, you could access, you could access file volumes. Yes, it was basically stable. Yes, we're,
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:24.960]   we're done missing around with the interface. Now, Mac OS 10.4 or 10.5, maybe this is finally,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.320]   we had to build this thing from the ground up. And now we're done building it took us two or three
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:34.480]   years. So yeah, I hope that Apple is looking forward to creating like the next $30 billion of
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:40.080]   App Store revenue. They're not just trying to sell hardware that really, it's like, it's like
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.480]   an Oculus only 10 times more expensive, but you get a much better, much better frame rate,
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.120]   much better resolution. They really need to, if they really need to wait until they can
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:53.600]   emphatically create an Apple device, not just an also ran device.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:59.760]   I think they, I think there's a clear understanding of why it's taking so long is that there's a
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.640]   clear understanding that it has to come, the launch has to go perfectly. Yeah,
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.640]   because everyone's already failed so many times. And so I think that that is going to be a real
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:13.120]   key piece. And if they really do hit 60 or 120 frames per second at 8K per eye, it's going to be,
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:18.240]   I mean, it, that those kinds of frame rates and resolutions are completely different
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:22.240]   experience than anyone has seen by any other headset. So it'll be really interesting to see if
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:26.480]   they're able to actually pull that off. It's still going to be very difficult though,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.600]   because I, Apple, I think has done one of my biggest complaints about Apple historically is
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.960]   almost inoperative at this point, where they used to, as late as five years ago, their motto
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.840]   seemed to be, go, go be poor someplace else, that it would be, it would be a missed opportunity
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:47.120]   if they decided to create an aspirational piece of technology at brand new paradigm for people who
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:54.560]   can afford to spend $3,000 on a pair of Miracle Goggles. The, I think the Apple Watch, the
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.800]   biggest thing they ever did with it was to figure out a way to manufacture it. So that's
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:06.000]   competitive not just with other, other, other watches, but other fitness level things, not just,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:15.440]   here's a, here's Garmin's $500 GPS driven, a smartwatch. Here is a $100 band, here's a $150
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:19.680]   band, here's a $180 band with a color screen, and Apple is competing very, very well with that.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.160]   They're making phones that compete extremely well with Android Space, which is a hell of a
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.200]   thing, a hell of an accomplishment. So I would be, I would be very, I would be very pleased to see
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.880]   them come out with first a version of AR VR that really, really works well and emphatically states
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:40.320]   here's why this thing is not just a mindless gadget. I would be not completely satisfied until
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   two or three years later, when they come out with the version, the air, the $400, $500 version,
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:53.520]   where it is conceiving that most exactly. I think that the problem is to do it the way at the resolution
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:37:01.200]   and the market for reasonably good headset is pretty saturated at $300. And so the issue is,
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:06.880]   is that with the Quest and with, and those are really good, it's really hard for them to distinguish
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:10.480]   themselves there. I think that the, my guess is the first headset will be somewhere between two
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:15.840]   and $3,000. And if they, if Apple makes a headset under $1,000, I'd be blown away. I just don't think
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:20.000]   that they can distinguish themselves from the, the stuff that's already there. And I think that
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.680]   that's what they're going to want to do. And so I think that this is, that's my guess is that it's
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:27.120]   not going to ever go below a thousand. You know, I'd be blown away if they did. I mean,
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:31.200]   that'd be kudos to them. But I think that they're not going to be able to do the low frame rate or
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   the, I mean, and so I think it's going to be one to 3,000 is probably the range forever.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:41.440]   You got, I am a guest. I'm sorry very quickly. You got, you got me thinking about how in the
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:47.840]   lead up for the launch of the iPad, nobody thought, Oh, $999 cheapest. And then when they broke that
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.600]   by $400, that was the gasp in the room. So always prepared to be surprised.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.000]   Yeah, go ahead, Renee. Yeah, I was just going to add that Apple typically introduces products that
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.920]   they that are higher, more the premium category, because that lets them put technology in the
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.680]   market. They couldn't afford to otherwise and then pay it down. And as they pay it down,
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:07.920]   they push it down to lower end products. But there was a great vice article. I think it was
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.680]   today or yesterday that was showing Apple compared to Android phones. And when you look at an
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.840]   iPhone, even a thousand dollar iPhone, that gets software updates for five years has a chipset
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.440]   that can last five years. The cost of owning it ends up being like a hundred and something
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.080]   bucks a year where the cost of much cheaper phones can be 200, $300 a year because they only
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.960]   last you three years. So I think that's how they get, they provide value to the premium market,
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.720]   but then also use that as a way to drive costs down to have a more mainstream product,
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.720]   because they won't make money just selling premium headsets. That's not a scalable business for them.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.760]   And I think it's less about recouping. I think there were some articles that it might have been
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.240]   from Mr. German about them trying to recoup all their R&D. And I don't think that's really the
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.720]   point. I think that for Apple, the rejection rate is so high on Apple products.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:53.520]   There was some point, so that what happens is when it first comes out,
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:59.360]   they're just trying to figure out how to actually produce it. And so it gets really expensive
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:04.320]   because they're actually throwing it, throwing it, recycling all of these parts that aren't coming
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:10.640]   out as good to the level at what Apple expects. And so I think I heard there was a point where
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:16.720]   the new trackpad that Apple had designed, the return rate in the factory was 40%.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:25.200]   And so those are the kind of things that I think that's why these start pretty expensive,
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.400]   is just that they're so inefficient about it. And then they get more efficient.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:34.320]   Gervitz, a piece last week in Bloomberg said it would be delayed probably even as
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:42.240]   long as into next year. It was originally targeted for WWDC in June, followed by a release later in
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   the year. But development challenges, I'm quoting German's Bloomberg piece, but development
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.040]   challenges related to overheating cameras and software have made it harder to stay on tracks
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:55.440]   at the people who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. That could push
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:01.040]   the announcement until the end of 2022 or later with the products hitting the shelves by 23.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:06.000]   I don't see any if we don't see it in June, we're not going to see it until the next June.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.440]   You have to release it for developers at the developer conference.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:16.240]   And there's no hurry. Let's get it right. Absolutely. When the Apple Watch was first announced,
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:21.040]   before it came out, again, none of this happened with the iPhone. Nothing was like,
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.880]   "Oh, there's a fierce battle between P1 and P2. Steve scratched the screen. All this drama
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:30.560]   happened, but it just wasn't widely reported." But by the time of the Apple Watch, it started to
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.000]   be and it was like, "Oh, the battery life isn't long enough. Apple's not able to do it. They're not
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.080]   meeting their deadlines on this." And then Apple announced it and it was, they announced it in
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.960]   September and it came out the following March and that gave them six months of sort of buffer
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.800]   to get it out. And I'm sure they're going to have reports like this up until they announced it.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.320]   And then after that, we're going to see the first version is not going to be good. It's not going
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.080]   to be great. It's going to be like the original iPad, the original Apple Watch. And then version
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.960]   two is going to be way, way better the way the iPhone 3G was, iPad 2 was, and the second Apple
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:06.320]   Watch was. I think they're going to have to really manage expectations. If I'm right in my,
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:11.440]   what I see as the roadmap for this product and that they decide that we're going to have it,
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.400]   we're not going to care so much about the expense. We're going to be putting this in the hands of
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.720]   people who want to write software for the next generation of stuff. So long as they say that,
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:25.280]   look, we are not pretending that this is going to be a classroom full of 20 to 30 students,
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:30.080]   each with an Apple VR headset on that we are this is the first generation of stuff. It's still
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:34.640]   experimental. They even if they were to say, this is a hardware beta, you are participating in a
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:40.240]   program, you have to be a registered Apple developer in order to even order these. It's not so much
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:46.560]   that it would give them extra room for making mistakes, but it would also tamp down expectations.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.880]   So people would see all these YouTube videos of these wonderful experiences and people would have
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.840]   these hands on experiences one on one with these things, but they would not be thinking, oh my God,
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:02.560]   $3,000, $3,000. And I can't even like sideload my own MP4 files to watch my own movies on the
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:08.800]   thing. What are they even thinking? Well, and I do think that the at $3,000, they'll sell as many
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:14.000]   as they can make. It'll just be as many as they can push out though people will buy and they'll
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.760]   become developers just to buy and be kind of man. Apple fan cast with them. The other thing is
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.000]   that this is not a, this is like an Apple TV and the glasses are going to be like an Apple watch.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.480]   Neither of these are an iPhone or a Mac. They're not going to be large scale developer platforms.
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:32.240]   Like they're going to be very focused, like the VR is going to be very focused on entertainment
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.840]   and experiences. The same way the Apple TV is and the glasses are going to be very focused on
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:39.680]   convenience and notification and glassable data the way the watch is. And neither of those are
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.720]   anywhere nearly the size of the developer platforms that the iPhone or the Mac is.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.120]   Yeah, it's there's not been a lot of apps developed exclusively for the watch.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:52.880]   Yeah, because the watch is like a two second experience. Yeah, like you, and it's hard to develop
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:59.040]   for two second experience. And we can't design the watch face like the watch face would be a huge
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.640]   market and right. We're not allowed to design for the watch face. You like it. You still stuck
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.120]   in watch kit. Yeah. And Apple users you like it. So let's take a little break. And glass is going
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.160]   to be worse. They're not going to let you have you like on the glasses. You think they are.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:16.960]   I got it because I'm a glass. Yeah. Yeah. Or glasses repair kit because you can buy those
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:19.440]   at the grocery store on the way out. I noticed that. All right.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:25.280]   Exactly. Take a break. I'm getting punchy now, obviously. Are shutting it right to you by
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:35.200]   IT Pro TV. Oh, yes. Are you an IT pro? Would you like to be? IT Pro TV has something for both
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.120]   of you. IT pros, of course, you need to keep your skills up to date. You need to learn new
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:44.800]   skills. You need to recertify all of that. IT pros are a great place to do. And if you are
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:52.080]   looking to get an IT now is the time, man, this is a great growth market for IT professionals in
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:56.960]   all areas of IT. Maybe you're not sure where to get started. Well, you don't have to worry
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:02.400]   where to start. You can go straight to IT Pro TV. They have the knowledge, the certificates you
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.880]   need to break into the IT world. In fact, this month is a great month because January theme
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:12.240]   at IT Pro TV is all about getting started in IT. So you'll have a great start to the new year.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.480]   If you want to dip your toes into IT, check out the following courses to get started. CompT
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:23.040]   is ITF plus and A plus certs. Parenthetically, I might mention IT Pro TV is the official video
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:29.520]   partner for CompT. So you're getting the official training there. A plus the desktop support cert,
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:35.600]   Linux Essentials, who doesn't want to know that these days, Microsoft 365 MS900 cert.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:40.720]   And this is one thing I like about IT Pro TV. They keep up with the times. They're always
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:45.440]   recording new material in their studios. They've got seven of them in their Gainesville studio.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:51.600]   That facility complex, I guess it is now, which means they can record a lot of content every
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.640]   single day, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. So when new certs come out, like the,
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:45:02.000]   you know, Microsoft replaced MCSE with a bunch of new certs, they're ready with them. Hands-on
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.640]   PC build. Another one you might want to start with getting started in IT. That's in there from
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   the bench series. Cisco CCT routing and switching. That's 100-490. Oh, and I know you want to become
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:20.720]   an Apple certified or support professional, ACSP. That's a great cert too. And of course,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:25.840]   they're all the way up to date. This covers Mac OS 11, of course. Now, if you're worried that
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.680]   maybe it might be dull, it might be boring. In fact, you might have that had that experience
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:37.200]   at other IT training places. No, not with IT Pro TV. They've got the bed. Look how nice those people
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:42.160]   are. Those are their edutainers they call them professionals in the field so they know their
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:46.400]   business, but they also know how to make it fun. They're very enthusiastic. They love this stuff.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:51.920]   All the courses are chunked up in the 20 to 30 minute increments so you can watch them at lunch
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.920]   whenever you got a moment. I kind of like that. That's how I work a little bit at a time. But if
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:01.040]   you want to binge, you could binge for a while. Seven studios, as I mentioned,
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.240]   content goes from the studio in 24 hours. So they're the most up to date. I think that's
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.800]   another thing. Sometimes you'll get a book and it's out of date or you'll go to a class. The
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:17.920]   teacher doesn't know anything from today. IT Pro TV is absolutely O-coron't. They're with it.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:24.560]   They're hip. They're now, man. If you're thinking about getting into IT, get the introduction you need

[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:20.240]   unfortunate backlash over air tags. They have now launched a new personal safety
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:27.200]   user guide. What you need to know about device and data access when your personal safety is at risk.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:34.080]   If you have time to read this before you get mugged, good.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:39.920]   But keep it. Well, one of the other, I mean, we've heard a lot about the stocking issues with air
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.560]   tags. And I'll once again just point out on Pissant that people are discovering these because of
[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:49.840]   Apple system. Like the other effects are the dumbest way to track somebody. Use a Galaxy tag,
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:54.320]   use a tile, use a GPS kit. But the other problem that people have is like, there's some people who
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:58.480]   are really angry that the theft protection is in stronger. And that was a deliberate choice by
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.280]   Apple. Like these are not, these are supposed to be find my lost stuff, not, not track somebody,
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:08.240]   not stock somebody, but also not track down your stolen stuff. There is a huge problem and it's not
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.960]   new of these hero complexes where people get something stolen and then they track them down.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:17.360]   Well, if you killed or hurt in a secondary encounter, when they would have been just like,
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:23.120]   it's just stuff. It's your wallet is just like we saw like, there's headlines this week too about
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:28.080]   people using it to recover trucks and recover other stuff. Leave that to the professionals, please.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.680]   Yeah. Like your life is way more important than any bubble that you might have attached to their
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.280]   test. It's unfortunate that Apple's gotten so much attention because as you as you point out,
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:39.680]   the reason people know they have air taxes because of all the safety features, Apple's put into it.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:47.200]   There have always been ways to track you better than more accurate, more invisible than what
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:52.000]   an air tag is. So I don't think this is a new problem and I don't think it's a problem unique to Apple
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.200]   by any means. But good on them, the personal safety guide actually is timely because it's
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:04.000]   much more than just air tags. It is safety and privacy tools, how not to get fished,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:12.160]   some really important stuff that I know no one will read, set up two-factor authentication,
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:19.120]   set up an account recovery contact, block calls and messages. It'd be nice if you could just
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:24.560]   get everybody in your family to read this before they bug you. You have an Apple privacy
[00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:28.480]   clippy that pops up on your device and walks you through app and stuff because it's so non-obvious
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:34.080]   most of these features. Yeah. Just read the whole darn thing. They do at the end, which is good.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:40.320]   They have checklists so you can kind of maybe that's a good way to get people into it.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.520]   What to do if you think someone may have access to your device or accounts? I get a call almost
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:54.880]   every week, usually from a woman with a bad axe who's being stalked. Maybe he got into their phone
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.680]   and is still in their phone, things like that. This is really good advice. I guess now I have
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.720]   somewhere I can send people. How to stop sharing your location with people and apps you previously
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:11.440]   shared with down the same lines, I think. How to stop sharing with somebody, let's see, that's
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.960]   the same one, isn't it, women? How to stop sharing your location with people and apps you
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.480]   previously shared with and then how to stop sharing with someone you previously shared with,
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:27.360]   I guess, sharing other stuff. I hope they beef this up. You can download as a PDF,
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.800]   but it's also an Apple support page. I think if you search for personal safety user guide,
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.720]   user guide, Apple, you'd find pretty quickly. Good idea, Apple. Let's enhance it though. There
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:44.240]   should be more here and send it to all your friends and family. That should be a living
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:49.360]   document. It'd be nice if it were even part of a, if it were available on iBooks,
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.360]   ask something you could just download. There's a PDF. So you could download it and put it in
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:59.760]   iBooks, absolutely. That's a good idea. They offer a direct link to a PDF.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:07.040]   Apparently, there's a problem with cloud syncing. There has been since day one,
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.880]   since Mobile Me, since--
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.800]   Mobile Me and Steve Jobs flamethrower.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.920]   Steve Jobs flamethrower.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:20.560]   This is from yesterday's nine to five Mac. iCloud syncing issues are plaguing third-party apps
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.120]   as Apple stays silent.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.800]   This is a--
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.840]   Can I pitch you on something, Leo?
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.080]   Yes.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:26.800]   I have this idea.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:34.400]   So I spent any amount of time that you spend on slash r/android or slash r/apple is too much
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:39.440]   in many, many ways. But I was just going over the list of persistent bugs that exist in Android
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:44.880]   and iOS, things that like dacks on pixels and iCloud syncing issues, things that just go on
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.680]   and on and on for like an unbelievable amount of time. We need a project zero for annoying
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.920]   persistent iOS and Android bugs. Like just some-- someone at Google who goes through and
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:58.160]   documents these. And if you don't fix them in 30 days, they nasty blog you all over the internet.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:04.640]   There's a regular post on slash r/android and slash r/pixel 6 saying,
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:09.760]   "Guys, Google may not be reading this. You probably should put it on their bug tracker."
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.400]   They have a place to tell Google about this stuff, not Reddit.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.360]   I keep filing. I keep filing every week. I just file away.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.840]   But I agree that there's a-- they call it responsible disclosure. There's a clock that
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:26.480]   starts ticking when you disclose a security vulnerability. Why isn't there a clock that
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:30.960]   starts ticking when you disclose a show stop and bug? We're even just doing a noise.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:33.920]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. It's just like frustrations.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.840]   Like, frustrations are the thousand cuts. Like, yes, a crasher is bad but Apple and Google are
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.360]   really good at checking their metrics on crashers. They check all the time. But the
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:46.720]   frustrators are the ones that really wear you down over time. Like, you try to search for an app
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.760]   in Spotlight. You don't get the-- and you know the app is there and it doesn't show up. And
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.200]   Spotlight's been around since, like, what, iOS 3 or something? It's just not--
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.960]   Well, and CloudKit has been around forever and ever. And I even remember in the early days of CloudKit
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:03.120]   many developers saying, "Oh, don't-- whatever you do, do your own sinking. Don't rely on CloudKit
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.280]   because it's unreliable." It seems to have gotten better there, but maybe not. Good
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:14.240]   notes just posted as an example. This support article, "Why does my CloudSync show a request
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:22.320]   failed with a status code 503 error?" Apparently, we're getting many reports, they say, of the error
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:28.000]   lingering on causing sink failures. The issue is not apparent to us and we've escalated the case to
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:33.840]   Apple technical support. It seems it's happening to other apps as well. In fact, there's a big long
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:43.440]   thread on CloudKit service unavailable error 503. So if you're getting it, don't blame the dev,
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:51.600]   don't blame the app, I guess. File a bug report, I guess. I don't know.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:59.520]   RIP radar. Yeah. Do we know what this is about? Do we know why this is happening?
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.480]   Doesn't seem to be universal. I've had every comment.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:10.880]   I did get somebody calling the other day saying, "My iCloud,
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.200]   maybe this is related. It keeps asking for my password." He said, "I brought my phone to the Apple
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:26.800]   store." The genius said, "Yeah, your iCloud's corrupt. Bye." He said, "He didn't try to fix it.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:31.200]   He didn't help you fix it." No. He just told me what he just said. That's not good. That's not bad.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.160]   Bad genius. Subgenius.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:47.200]   Yeah. I wonder, I don't know, the Cloud, the Cloud. There was this interesting bug I'm having where
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:54.160]   Safari no longer supports drag and drop in the YouTube customizer. If you want to go and move
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.400]   around your YouTube homepage, it just selects the text and graphics instead, which is super
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.680]   annoying. Works fine in Chromium, does not work in WebKit. I filed a bug with Chrome team. I filed
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:10.960]   a bug with radar. Google is like, "We just don't care that much about Safari. I appreciate your
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:15.120]   Frankness, but that's the only browser that everybody on iOS uses. That's not an insignificant
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:20.000]   platform." Apple is like, "We don't have anything to do with YouTube. I appreciate your Frankness,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.840]   but YouTube is still a website you're responsible for rendering. That's just the world we live in."
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:29.520]   I'm like, "You guys have users. You just get this stuff fixed."
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:38.080]   I guess nothing much to say about this is just, it is. It is what it is. But just be aware of it.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.160]   Complain. Yeah.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.440]   Get more cast to tweet about it.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:42.320]   And then the whole thing's all right.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:49.440]   ScooterX says, "The latest tweet bot for iOS added an iCloud sync status page,
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:54.240]   just rather than them saying, 'We know, we know, we can't do anything about it. We're sorry.'
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:59.680]   They actually put a page up this. Here's the status. It's not just you.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:08.960]   A number of countries now, as we mentioned last week, are pushing Apple to offer third-party
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:15.680]   app store payments. A Dutch regulator has responded to Apple's attempts to solve this,
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:21.520]   saying, "It's not enough. Apple has failed to satisfy the requirements set by the Netherlands
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:27.040]   Authority for Consumer and Markets regarding payment systems. This is following an investigation
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:32.160]   due to Apple's statements of January 15th. Apple now has to pay ACM the first
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:37.840]   penalty payment of five million euros. This is the dating apps."
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:43.120]   The Dutch need to date. The dating apps.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.280]   And this is stopping reproductive repur-
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:49.200]   I think it's because the dating app provides a few more than the date.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.720]   They're the ones that complain. So ACM, the authority for consumers and markets.
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.960]   There was an amazing tweet yesterday about this saying, "Apple has failed to satisfy the
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:02.000]   very obscure requirements of a company. You won't tell them what they need to do to
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.720]   actually fix the situation and just demand that they do it immediately."
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:10.960]   According to the ACM, the most important failure on Apple's part is it's failed to adjust its
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:16.720]   conditions as a result of which, see if you can follow this, dating app providers are still
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:22.160]   unable to use other payment systems. At the moment, dating app providers can merely express
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.480]   their interest. In other words, any other implement it, they just said,
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:31.120]   "Hey, let us know if you'd like to." That's like a very short timeline to implement all of each other.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:35.920]   In additional, Apple has raised several barriers for dating app providers to the use of third-party
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:41.680]   payment systems that, too, is at odds with ACM's requirements. For example, Apple seemingly forces
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:47.520]   app providers to make a choice. Either refer to payment systems outside the app or to an
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:52.320]   alternative payment system. That is not allowed providers must be able to choose both options.
[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:58.560]   Apple's informed, ACM has informed Apple that statements do not satisfy the requirements.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:04.080]   They're still obligated to respond. If they fail to do so, they'll have to pay,
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:09.760]   get ready for this, five million euros a week up to a maximum of 50 million euros.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.440]   Tim Cook's Coffee by Jet. Come on.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:11.760]   I know.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:16.960]   It's like a day in the Amsterdam store.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:24.080]   So you think they're not ignoring it, obviously. It's just not happening as fast as...
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.320]   Are they going to pull dating apps from the Netherlands as their response?
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:27.840]   Are they going to just take their ball and go home?
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:30.560]   That would be interesting, wouldn't it? What a response that would be.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:36.720]   I mean, then I guess what will happen is some other Apple come along and say,
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:39.600]   "Well, it's us too." And then the whole thing begins again.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:44.640]   Well, they had no video games in Brazil for a while because they couldn't adequately address
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:49.040]   Brazil's requirements for rating systems for video games. That caused huge amounts of piracy,
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:51.440]   but they just effectively could not have video games in Brazil.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:58.960]   The internet was this big international thing, Leo. We had all these companies for a while
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:02.800]   that were just working completely internationally. We all had the exact same features in every country
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:06.720]   and our regionalism is going to make nobody know exactly what service or goods they can
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.840]   actually get anywhere, ever again.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:14.000]   Yeah. Okay. But it's... All right. I don't want to get this conversation.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.480]   No, like, Apple should just solve this internationally. They're going to play like games in Japan or
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:25.360]   Korea. All a country can do. All it can do is say, "We have a problem. There's no global
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:30.240]   mechanism. I guess there kind of is, but there's not much of a global mechanism for doing this."
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:35.600]   So all a nation can do is say, "Hey, you got to fix this. We're going to find you."
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:44.080]   I just seem to remember more than once Apple waving away a certain PR problems by saying,
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.880]   "We obey whatever the local laws are in the countries in which we operate
[00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:53.760]   unless it costs us money." Unless we don't like it. Unless it's the hot...
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.680]   It's the Dutch. And I purchased this. If it's the Dutch, well, hell.
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.920]   Erickson is suing Apple in three German courts. The Netherlands and Brazil,
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:09.760]   this is a 5G patent issue. Erickson says, "We have the patent to this technology."
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:16.480]   And Apple's found a counter complaint with the ITC, the international. So there's the international
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:21.520]   there. The International Trade Commission over three patents. And all of a sudden declared
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:27.440]   itself a big fan of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.440]   Aren't they using Qualcomm modems? I don't understand why this is an Apple thing.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.720]   They finally moved to bog standard Qualcomm X60 and X55 modems.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.120]   Isn't Erickson's beef with Qualcomm? I'm very confused.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:44.240]   I don't know. Are they franned? I think they're trying to go up the food chain.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.400]   You know, like they're not getting... Get money from Apple.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.960]   Is it Qualcomm? Yeah. Well, they're trying to get Qualcomm,
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.200]   to give them what they want to buy going through Apple.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.640]   Going through Apple. I think so. I don't know.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:58.240]   Erickson, according to Fos patents, would have no benefit whatsoever
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.760]   from disrupting Apple's business through injunctions. It just wants to be paid
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:07.360]   reasonable royalties on its patent portfolio, taking into account what others are already
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:13.200]   paying Erickson. Apple, by contrast, pays only a very small amount of patent royalties on each
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.400]   iPhone. It sells with Qualcomm, getting far more than anybody else through it, though its patent
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:24.400]   portfolio is not even battle tested. So I don't know if this is through Qualcomm.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.080]   Remember, Fran? But I think this was part of that
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.280]   the other lawsuits with Qualcomm that did end up limiting what Qualcomm got. So I think this is a
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.480]   chain reaction from Apple's victories with Qualcomm.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:43.200]   Yeah. They're also suing in the Western... Erickson is also suing in the Western District.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:48.800]   But Apple likes the Eastern District. It'd be nice if we had these companies that we...
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.920]   Like the whole idea of Fran was that you have technologies that we can choose to use to make
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:58.400]   the infrastructure of the entire global communications network. But in so doing, you've got to make
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:02.000]   them available to everybody else. If we choose you, it comes with responsibility and it was like,
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.560]   "Yeah, yeah, yeah, choose us. It'll be great. We promise. It'll be fine."
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.560]   And then they just... The minute they get chosen, they sue everybody.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.320]   Yeah. I almost don't even want to report on it, but I guess we have to.
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.720]   Yeah. Good nationalized. Internationalized the patents.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:20.320]   I refer you to fosspatence.com if you really want the... We'll get to give you check-ins
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:24.400]   every couple months for the next three years. Oh, god. Yeah. At least through it.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:29.600]   Another speed bump for Apple's self-driving car project?
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:37.120]   It's a deep within Mark Gurman's newsletter, which I don't subscribe to, so I'll just have to...
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:44.720]   It's a paraphrase. If you subscribe, you only get the peasant version. You have to also
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:50.720]   subscribe to Bloomberg to get the secret. I know. I get the peasant version in the other direction.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:59.360]   So, yeah, I don't know. I have so many subscriptions. Here it is.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:07.520]   "Dayjavu, Apple loses another car team manager. Joe Bass was head of the software engineering
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:13.920]   program for Apple's car team until recently with Bass's departure, writes Gurman nearly the entire
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:22.000]   Apple car management team in place just one year ago is gone." Of course, Doug Field, the best known
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.200]   and Lynch took over for a Doug. Bass had reported to Field before moving under Kevin Lynch.
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:36.880]   Whereas Bass heading Facebook, I'm sorry, meta platforms along with more than 100 of his ex-apple
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.120]   peers over the past several months. That's why Apple's putting out those stock bonuses,
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:48.160]   trying to keep people from departing. Yeah. Goodness gracious. I think one of the
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.400]   largest, most powerful vectors for Covid in the Silicon Valley is just engineers being
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:58.000]   coached from company to company on a different AI project. If you poach them properly, Covid is
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.640]   killed, I believe. You got to hold them at 165 degrees for at least 10 minutes. It's the old
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.480]   sous vide ticket. So, Gurman writes, "What does this mean for Apple's car project?" Well,
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:16.480]   it cements my theory that 2022 is a make or break year. If the company is set on unveiling its
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:22.480]   plans for a fully autonomous car by 2025, they're going to need to get the ball rolling with few
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.800]   additional mishaps or departures. That makes sense, right? Takes three years. They still have
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:32.320]   Dan Dodge Leo. Okay. I don't know what that means, but I'll take you. The founder of QNX,
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.600]   he went there to work on real-time software for the Apple car. So, they still have Dan Dodge.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.960]   It sounds like a star. I'll be honest, it sounds like a Star Wars reference, that's all.
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:47.200]   They still have Rub's leg. So, Dan Dodge was the founder and president of QNX. Blackberry
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:51.040]   bought them. He went to Apple to work on the car. His vice president Sebastian Moreno-Mess
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:54.960]   went to Apple, worked on security, and now he's doing device intelligence. You know, really,
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:57.680]   really good. He's like, "You're far too much about this stuff, obviously."
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:04.800]   Well, I also think that the future of self-driving cars keeps moving too. So, I think that you're
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:09.280]   kind of going through... We think that this is there. I think that the consensus is starting to
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.440]   really build around the fact that Google was way out ahead of everybody is that you're not going to
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:18.960]   really want a driving space. You just want a sitting space or a hanging out space and not really
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:25.040]   having a... Google's been talking about that for a long time. And everyone thought they were crazy,
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.120]   but it's starting to become more and more like, do people who want self-driving cars really want
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.760]   actually get behind the wheel? Is that the... Because you've got to throw the ball to where the
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:40.880]   receiver is going to be five years from now. So, it's a complicated and very expensive
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.120]   endeavor. So, it's going to be really interesting to see. And I think that as they move through that,
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.440]   and also as you change the upper part of a management system, like putting Lynch in,
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:55.600]   what happens after that is oftentimes a fallout of the folks below because they weren't put that
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:00.560]   in that position or they just don't like the direction that the new leader is taking it.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   [chuckles]
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:08.720]   [sings]
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:14.080]   It's kind of a light week this week. Let's take a break and then we'll talk about Amy Klobuchar.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:21.120]   How about that? I need a refresher before we talk about anti-trust action because the bill is now
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:27.360]   headed and I'll give you time to look up what comes next after it's voted out of the Judiciary
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:30.240]   Committee. It's one of the bills, right? Not both of them. It's one of the bills. It's
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:36.560]   the Senate bill has now been approved by committee. So, what's next? I don't know. I think what has
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.800]   to happen is Senate leadership has to bring it to the floor for a vote to debate them vote.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.720]   Googling how the bill becomes a law. Will you please?
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:49.440]   Basically, it got the committee marked it up and now moves it forward to the whole Senate
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:55.840]   toward leadership has to approve it. Exactly. The fact that it made it out committee means that,
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:02.480]   okay, this is serious. It's sort of like, okay, the DA has formally charged you. Now,
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.560]   we actually have to go forward with this and decide whether this is a good idea or not.
[01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:12.800]   This is the law. This is the one that says companies cannot favor their own stuff over other
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.080]   companies, competing companies, and this particularly would affect Apple's App Store.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:22.080]   Yeah, there are seven, I think seven specific callouts in the bill and each one of them seems to
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:28.400]   have like seems to be specifically directed at. There's Amazon. Here's what we want you to knock
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:35.280]   off Apple knock off this Google. This crap with prioritizing like, prioritizing your own products
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.440]   and search over others is gonna stop. So yeah, this is bad for everybody. This is this is why
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:44.240]   it's being so heavily lobbied. This is why for God's for God's sake, Ted Cruz got 40 minutes
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.040]   with Tim Cook. He'd harangued on the phone. The day before he harangued him for 40 minutes.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:56.080]   40 minutes with Tim Cook. What are you? By the way, a CEO's time is very, very valuable.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:02.000]   I don't know how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in time that is, but what was he saying?
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.400]   Ted, you can't, Ted, you can't vote for anywhere. 16 to six. I think Ted did vote for it. The American
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:15.360]   Innovation and Choice Online Act now moves to the Senate floor where it will probably die
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:20.560]   in ignominious death with all the other bills that's set on floor. But we'll see. We'll see.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.600]   Israel Democracy was so over. This one has bipartisan support for various reasons, but it has some
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.400]   support. So this is this is the spanking. Got a lot of money. A lot of money behind it.
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:37.520]   Yeah, it's the spanking of the tech industry is what it is. It's the big tech. The fleecing of
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:43.040]   the tech industry is what I would call it. So you got to get you got to campaign. You're coming up.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.920]   You got to got to fill those coffers. Oh, you think that's what it's all about?
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.560]   Oh, yeah. Don't it? Yeah. By my vote. They're all buying. They're all all the votes are bought.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.720]   Yeah. So I might be in this case. I mean, because if we were talking about things now,
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.880]   right? If we were talking about things that actually affected people, the cable companies would
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:06.160]   be up there. Like, because it is they are functionally slowing the entire country down. Like,
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.880]   literally during COVID, people can't go to school. They can't go to work. They can't, and why?
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.320]   Because of the cable companies. But what are we talking about? Something that doesn't affect the
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:20.720]   average person. Like, you know, the people behind it. Small tech companies like Proton,
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:27.520]   Yale, and Sonos, who small or smaller, not small. Yeah, yeah, not, yeah, but small.
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:32.880]   He's not Lamborghini. You know, Yelp says Google favors. It's, uh, it's recommendations.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.600]   But these aren't small companies. These aren't like mom. When people think small,
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.000]   they think small shops. These are still hundreds of millions or billions of dollars a company.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.360]   You know, this is this is this is a complaint from people, you know, this is like, you know,
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.000]   actors and baseball players wanting to get paid more, not like union workers at the
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.680]   where the warehouse. Yeah. Yeah. The only difference is that the FCC already has regulatory authority,
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:57.120]   and they're already basically have, they've made the same announcements that Klubuchar has been
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.320]   making right as head of antitrust. So it's not quite as imperative. And there is a lot of motion
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.600]   to get make sure this gets done before midterms, because if all I got it, if five or six seats
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:13.200]   move one way or another, the ability to get an agenda item moved to the forefront or
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:19.600]   banished to the land of ghosts and winds permanently could flip in a second. So I don't think it's
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:24.720]   quite as quite like that, but it's there is a lot of impetus on both sides to get this done.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:30.240]   There's no love for big tech. Any company that makes more than $500 million is worth more than
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:34.080]   $500 million. There's not a whole lot of love for it in Congress right now. That's the people
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:39.040]   who are complaining about it too. The people who are trying to get in are the $500 million.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:45.200]   The legislation as marked up, because they did modify this, applies to companies with a market
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:51.920]   cap greater than $550 billion and more than 50 million monthly active users. Yeah. And any
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.760]   determination that they basically own a platform that they control a dominant platform. So it's not,
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:03.840]   you really have to be in the golden double diamond tier in order to be
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:11.920]   subject to this. Thursday, there was a modification that appeared to respond to Apple's concern about,
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.880]   you know, Apple has been telling the senators, hey, look, you're going to, we have this very
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.440]   popular feature where people turn off ad tracking, you're going to make it impossible for us to do
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:27.040]   that. So they marked it up in the modified, there's a new provision that says platforms are not
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:33.440]   liable for requiring consent before allowing access to user data. That's, and that makes sense.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:41.120]   Why should a platform be liable for requiring consent before allowing access to my data?
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:46.640]   They should always ask that anyway. Another one exempts a fee for service subscription,
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:53.040]   like Amazon Prime or presumably Apple one. Further hearings on the bills should have been held
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:57.600]   before the vote said several senators that measure would require changes to secure their
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:03.040]   support on the Senate floor. So it's not, it's not a done deal. Support is the bill met with
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:08.480]   White House officials Wednesday to get support there, but the Biden administration has not yet
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.800]   taken a position on the matter. Speaking of government, Biden just signed an executive order
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:18.080]   supporting right to repair. Not sure what the weight or force of that is, but
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:23.200]   is his hearts in the right place. He signed it with a Pentelope screwdriver.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:34.560]   Okay. Okay. Let's take a little break. Come back with more. Our show today brought to you by
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:40.480]   our food box every Thursday. I love it. Oh, I love it. It's imperfect foods. I actually look
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:46.000]   forward to coming home. There it is on my porch, the imperfect foods box. By the way, we recycle
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.720]   that, which is nice. They're very good on packaging. That's one of the things that food boxes always
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:54.960]   may be nervous with all that packaging. This is so much better for the environment for so many
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:02.320]   reasons. First of all, it's food that would otherwise be thrown away or fed to animals.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:09.840]   Inperfect foods, the whole premise of it was to reduce food waste. You'll also save time on grocery
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:17.520]   shopping and you'll eat more fresh, delicious food. Here's a cringe-worthy stat. Every year, 35%,
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:26.240]   more than a third of the food supply goes unsold or uneaten in the US. Often because there's a blemish
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:31.120]   or that pomegranate, it's just a little too small. That artichoke is not the size of your head.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.960]   Imperfect foods is working to turn this around by sourcing foods that would otherwise
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:41.840]   just be unsold, destroyed. Combating climate change is tough. I think we all want to do
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:48.720]   something about it. This is one way to make an impact. What is it? It's a grocery delivery service
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:55.120]   offering a line, as you can see on the website, of a sustainable groceries, all kinds, including
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.960]   dairy products and meats that taste delicious. They reduce waste just by embracing the natural
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:09.440]   imperfections in food. Visit the website imperfectfoods.com and see if they deliver in your area.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:14.320]   What's nice is they take all the deliveries in a neighborhood and do them all on the same day.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:21.600]   By doing that, they produce 25 to 75% fewer emissions than people going to the grocery store.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.960]   It's good for the environment in a whole bunch of ways. You could personalize your order every week,
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:32.720]   choose from fresh seasonal produce. The produce is beautiful, by the way. I was expecting something,
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:38.640]   you know, a little bruised or bent or broken, but no, no, it's beautiful. It's gorgeous.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.320]   Which makes me really wonder, grocery stores are not selling this because what? That broccoli
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:51.120]   is too small. Give me a break. It tastes better. Pantry staples, yummy snacks too. Your order
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:55.440]   of rives in the same day every week, as I said, ours is Thursday. That's nice because we know
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:02.400]   our shopping is done. On average, imperfect foods customers save 6 to 8 pounds of food
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:11.280]   with every order. So lower emissions, lower waste, and say goodbye to packaging guilt.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.440]   Imperfect foods is the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:20.960]   your packaging after every order. So it comes in an ice cardboard box. I break it down. They take it
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:27.120]   back. We recycle that. There's not a lot. There's not a plastic bags in there or anything like that.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.920]   A lot of the produce is loose. I just really like it. It's just a great experience and
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:37.600]   great food. And you'll feel good. Imperfect foods is right now, they're offering our listeners

[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:22.240]   A little time to go back to the news, the news of the day. Epic Games is appealing. Surprise,
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:30.640]   surprise, surprise. They're very appealing. They're filing, they're filed with the United States
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:36.240]   Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Both Apple and Epic have decided to appeal.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:43.280]   Neither company was satisfied with the outcome, which tells me it was perfect, but okay. Epic Games
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.360]   wanted the court to force Apple to support 30-party app stores. That did not happen. Tim Sweeney,
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:55.760]   the CEO, said ruling wasn't a win for developers or for consumers. We knew they were going to appeal.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.840]   Epic Games asked where the Judge, Gonzales Rogers, had made mistakes with some of her findings,
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.960]   including the finding that Apple is not a monopoly. We shall.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:07.920]   They're more of a Candyland.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.520]   So the opening brief is out. If you want to read it, don't expect me to.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:21.360]   I just think that because whatever they thought that they were going to get out of this,
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:29.520]   no. The thing is that after the dust is settled, if Apple truly does partner up with Unity and as
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:36.480]   they go into the next platform, whatever they were going to get out of this lawsuit will be.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:43.920]   Even if they won five years from now, the billions that they lost in between probably won't make up
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:46.560]   for whatever they thought they were going to shave off. Yeah.
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:56.080]   I guess I'll do this. Michael put it in the list. I think it's interesting. What happened?
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:04.800]   This is in CNET, Andrew Hoyle writing, "When my M1 Max MacBook Pro met a $60,000 camera."
[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:12.960]   He's talking about the Phase 1, which is a medium format camera. He's a professional photographer.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:21.440]   So we bought one. I haven't heard yet. I bought this M1 Max loaded for Anthony.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:27.920]   Has he said anything yet? Has he even come to work yet? Is he gone? Is he moved to Montana? What's going on?
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:35.680]   He's probably still home with it. I don't blame him. Awesome selfies. Yeah.
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.960]   Alex sent them a photogrammetry project we never saw him again.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.760]   Well, that's kind of... I was like, "Don't come back until you finished it."
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:51.120]   That's kind of what Andrew did. So Hoyle took 28 full resolution images from his Phase 1, 11 gigabytes,
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:58.240]   and loaded them into Photoshop, each one with its own masking adjustments and other effects.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:05.280]   He behemoth of a Photoshop document. He wants to composite all of these images.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:12.000]   He said, "Working on the MacBook Pro felt swift. The camera was tethered over USB-C. Oh, he was
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:17.040]   taking it into that he was using Capture One to take it into. Capture One is nice because it's M1
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:24.560]   native, which is great. He says, "It was zippy with no noticeable lag, which is a big problem. I'll be
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:30.160]   honest with you and some software, especially with these big ros, when making adjustments to the
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:35.760]   images." Yeah, Adobe. Yeah, that's the one. Lightroom is so awful.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:41.040]   You'll have to say, the native Adobe stuff was really sweet. When flicking between the shots I'd
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:50.560]   taken, no noticeable lag. This alone was a relief. Initially, it exported 45 full resolution images
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:57.440]   in Phase 1's IIQ format into one image stack on Photoshop. Took two minutes, 44 seconds to load
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:06.720]   the images into the document. He did the same thing on a 13-inch M1 last year with 16 gigs of RAM.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:11.920]   It struggled, crashed multiple times before taking eventually almost exactly five minutes to load
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:20.320]   the stack. So slower, but also, struggling. He's tried the same import with the i9 MacBook Pro.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:27.920]   Took four minutes, 43 seconds. This is twice as fast, I guess.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.080]   But I saw that was really interesting too, is that Marquez famously was traveling around,
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.560]   MKVHD was traveling around with an iMac Pro in a suitcase to all the events because he just
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:41.680]   couldn't enter on a laptop. He's back to editing on a laptop, and that's AK Red Raw footage.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:48.720]   He's now more easily doing on a laptop than he was doing on an iMac Pro just two, three years ago.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:54.800]   "Ox, did you get any M1 Maxes?" You didn't. No, I'm still waiting for the... I just couldn't
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:01.360]   justify the cost for the amount of time I spend where I need to... This is also... I don't even
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:05.600]   take my... So all of my hardware, I have a lot of hardware, but all of it sits in one room in my
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.080]   house. And when I walk out, the only thing that leaves with me is potentially an iPad and maybe
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.120]   my iPhone. Or my iPhone always walks out with me, but the iPad is the only other thing that I
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:20.000]   really take out of the room. And the reason for that is also just from a lifestyle perspective,
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.920]   I just like to walk out, be able to walk out of the gear room and have it not be techie.
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:30.480]   So anyway, so I just don't need a laptop. There's just no reason for me to
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:34.880]   do that. And so I just couldn't justify buying it. I really want the Max chip,
[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:38.560]   and I've been really close, but I have other things to spend money on right now.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.640]   "Anthony, do you like it?"
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.440]   I'm telling you, I don't think I'm ever going to see him again.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:53.600]   But good, I'm glad... You know, it's awesome. It's awesome.
[01:21:53.600 --> 01:22:01.760]   Let's see. Just kind of the seeds and the stems at the bottom here.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:07.440]   Apple may use optical audio transmission from AR/VR headsets to AirPods.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.640]   At least they applied for a patent. They don't think a patent means anything.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.840]   Yeah. Well, a lot of them does. The Erickson...
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:14.640]   The 500,000.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:19.600]   The Erickson suit is a good reason why you just write... So if someone comes up with something
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:25.360]   and you go, "Hey, that might be a good idea. We don't know if we'll use it, and we'll give you,
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.600]   you know, the engineer gets a little bit of money, and so then we'll write the patent,
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:34.160]   you know, and you give it to lawyers. And I think hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of patents
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:39.040]   a year, maybe thousands of patents a year. But a lot of it's to protect yourself from ideas in
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:43.600]   the future and just to be able to say, "Pry art, pry art, pry art, pry art."
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:48.000]   Yeah, pry art. We thought of that. We already thought of that. I already thought of that.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:54.320]   It also blocks everybody else. Right. Yeah. The physicist Richard Feynman in his memoirs
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:00.720]   biography tells a great story about how he has like half dozen of the most basic patents on
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:07.520]   nuclear energy out of sarcasm. Because he was working on some government project and there was
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:12.000]   a memo that the directors went around saying, "Hey, if you have any ideas for how we could use this
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.160]   nuclear energy that we're theorizing about, you know, write them down because we'll get patents on
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:20.320]   it. Any person who ends up Feynman being young and being full of beans, oh, this is stupid. Like,
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:24.960]   there's just too many ideas. Like, "Oh, Eric, well, give me some examples." Like, "Okay, fine. Put a
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:30.960]   nuclear reactor in a submarine, use the heat to heat up water and make a jet in the back, boom,
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:36.240]   nuclear submarine. Okay, nuclear reactor heats up air and makes a, boom, you got a nuclear jet."
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:41.120]   And then he got a letter like three weeks later, "Okay, two of the eight ideas that came up with
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:47.200]   this argument patented, but the other six are yours." So out of sheer sarcasm, because like you said,
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:52.640]   at certain point, you just put in patent basic ideas if you're there first and it's not terribly
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.720]   obvious. Yeah, so this is why the looking at patent filings are always interesting but never
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:04.720]   definitive. I think Anthony likes to new Macbook. I'm not sure. He just responded to Discord. Yes,
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.920]   exclamation mark. I don't know what question he was answering.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:13.760]   I mean, you're being held hostage, Anthony. Yeah, Anthony, tug your ear if you're being held
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:19.520]   hostage. Okay. We'll get, we'll get, we'll get. I've never asked this, but when, when, when
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:23.680]   hardware comes into the office, you put like a barcode on it, some sort of a tracker just to
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:30.000]   make sure, you know, the little clipboard signing in and signing them out. No. Only in the equipment
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   rooms, not the laptops, John says, the laptops, you know. Here he comes. Do you like it, Anthony?
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.400]   Is it fast? Yes. Is it all you'd hoped it'd be? Very quiet. Also, very quiet. Fan doesn't come on,
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:47.760]   does it? No. But also, I haven't done a crazy project on it yet, but like even scrubbing through,
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:52.160]   you know, 10 big 4K footage graded, like it's just you scrub right through it. Scrub right through
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:59.760]   4K. Good. That's a, I just, I'm glad to see you. I thought you got it in Mexico. I wasn't sure.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:03.840]   I would have. I'm just saying I would have. That's if I had had the chance.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.720]   $4,200 laptop in hand.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:16.080]   I, the only, you know, I really love the four, I got the 14 inch M1 Pro, and it's really fast. The only
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:21.360]   hard stuff I've done with it though is like computer programming. I did a,
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:28.960]   actually I have a pretty good score on my, my path finding problem. We, we're all doing that
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:36.960]   add code thing. And I got like down to giant, like I can't remember it was thousands of cells,
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:41.920]   you know, a grid of a million cells or something. Two, two seconds. Just like that. It's really
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.240]   good. So very happy, very happy. It's fast. It doesn't make a whirl joke for a minute.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:48.560]   It's so it solves my whirl problem like that.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:53.840]   God, what, what I can't, I can't even think about what computer science students are,
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:57.840]   are going through and solving their, solving their assignments that there's so many things
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:02.240]   that like when I was going through computer science, you could not, of course, we,
[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:07.200]   we have possible to brute force this solution. So come up with an algorithm. So actually now
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.560]   on my phone, I could brute force it.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:10.160]   Smart. Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.520]   Might be clever.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:17.040]   Yeah. Yeah. This is, no, this, this runs pretty quick. So I'm, I'm, I'm happy with it.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:24.560]   Apple is, get your gentlemen, start your macros. Apple's looking for your best iPhone
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:31.840]   macro photos for Apple's shot on iPhone challenge. I think it's because we saw so many cat photos
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:37.360]   with the Pixel six on the subreddit that they've decided, holy cow, is that a pretty shot.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:43.600]   So the challenge starts today, runs through February 16th winners will be announced in April.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:49.040]   I think you get, do you get anything? Probably, you know, you have Peter McKinnon judging this
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:52.240]   year. Yeah. Oh, okay. hashtag.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:55.280]   Typically, I think people get paid for it. I mean, you know, if they, if they use them,
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:59.120]   yeah, they, yeah, they use them, they pay them for the winning photos to be celebrated.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:02.960]   Then gallery on Apple's newsroom, Apple Instagram and other official Apple accounts,
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.760]   probably if you get celebrated, you know, okay, anything, but if you appear in digital campaigns,
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.760]   Apple store locations, they'll be controversy a couple of years ago. They didn't announce payment
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   and people got really angry in Apple's like, of course, for pain, he paid them. Okay, good.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.920]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the whole shenanigans. They're, they're definitely paying everybody.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:25.920]   Yeah. Why not? And this is good for them. You can also share your favorite macro photos
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:32.560]   on Instagram and Twitter hashtag shot on iPhone and iPhone macro challenge. That's how you submit.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:39.920]   But don't those those sites crush those photos somewhat? Maybe not. Yeah, they make you cry,
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:46.960]   like Twitter is congressional. Yeah. This is a mushroom that looks like a celestial body.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:54.560]   That's less deal. Two centimeter focal length. Here are blueberries and cream.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:02.960]   Yeah. Nice. So yeah, a non-Varma National Geographic Explorer, a Peccha Mocker,
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:09.520]   commercial photographer, owner of the House of Pixels, Peter McKinnon,
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:16.080]   well-known filmmaker, YouTube creator, breakout YouTuber of the year in 2019.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:20.960]   But what have you done for me lately? And Patty Chow, these are all the judges,
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:27.760]   photographer specializes in capturing life's moments on iPhone and Yik Keat Lee,
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:31.840]   urban photographer from Singapore is a big list. Long list. Nice.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.880]   Bella Huff who runs Apple's photo program. She,
[01:28:34.880 --> 01:28:39.600]   all of the people who involved in Apple's camera technologies, they have Instagram accounts
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:43.760]   and they are some of the most fantastic photographers. I should follow her. Yeah.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:51.520]   John McCormick, they're all terrific. You can also post on YBO, but I would bet the people who
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:57.520]   really care about their image, it was an email of the highest resolution to shot on iPhone at apple.com.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:02.080]   But there's a whole big thing using the file format. First name underscore, last name underscore,
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:06.800]   macro underscore, iPhone model. Subjects must be shot on iPhone macro challenge submission,
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:12.400]   straight from the camera, edited through Apple's editing tools in the photos app or
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:18.800]   edited with third party software. Oh, so you are allowed to tweak it. You have to be 18 to participate,
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:24.480]   not open to Apple employees or their immediate families. I always enjoy those shot on iPhone
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:29.920]   shots. They're always amazing. Yeah. Especially when it's clear that the people who went, I'm
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:35.120]   glad it's open. Everybody could show the the prowess of the iPhone as a camera system. But I love it
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:40.400]   when it's just the description is no, I was just out for a walk. And that's what the first picture I
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:44.240]   took in like two weeks and it just came out really nice. And people said, Oh, you should you should
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:48.400]   enter it. You should enter it. Because it really does show you how good a picture can be with just
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:54.000]   somebody taking a walk with their phone in their pocket. Lilith Vittman is a German citizen who has
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:04.800]   used the Apple air tag to discover a hitherto unknown German spy agency. The Bundest service
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:11.360]   telecommuticacion is in German. So for those of you who don't speak German, including myself,
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.200]   I shall go to the Apple insider piece. She says she uncovered Germany's little known federal
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:24.000]   telecommunications services actually a camouflage authority for a secret intelligence agency.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:30.880]   In her blog post, she explains how she was able to do this with air tags.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:39.760]   It's a great story where she all she it's it was this is like the second part of like a two month
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:45.120]   like little like investigation where she all she was just like going through a list of government
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:49.840]   agencies looking for ones that seemed interesting that she'd never heard of. And she came across this
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:54.080]   one that just seemed like a harmless like telecommunications thing. Oh, well, yeah, I wonder where it is.
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:58.320]   And every time she tried to find out like where it is or where it was, whether she phones somebody
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.600]   or whatever, because came to come to dead ends or hi, remember we sent you a document, please get
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:07.520]   rid of it because it doesn't exist anymore or people like hardly hanging up the phone. So this
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:11.680]   was like the two month the second month of her investigation. She was trying to figure out if
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:18.640]   this agency was she suspected that it was sort of a part of an intelligence arm. The way she could
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:23.680]   prove it is if well, if I send a piece of mail to this innocuous communications division and it
[01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:28.160]   winds up in the building or the neighborhood where our big intelligence apparatus is,
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:32.560]   that would be an indication of something interesting, wouldn't it? And so she got a travel magazine
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:36.960]   hollowed out a core into it, dropped an air tag into it, mailed it off and sure enough it warmed
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:41.200]   up. It warmed up where she thought it was. She mailed them an air tag and appeared at the office
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:48.880]   for the protection of the Constitution in Cologne, which is kind of interesting name for what is
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:55.520]   apparently. That's a euphemism agency. Yeah. She says in her latest post, she says,
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:59.600]   the intelligence service can keep the air tag. I heard they're supposed to be very expensive.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:06.480]   Do we know if like if she actually tracked something or they just detected electronics and
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:10.240]   goes, Nope, nope, nope. We're sending this to the Federalis and then it got redirected for
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:16.480]   maybe that's possible. I guess I'm sure it's not a sexy historic. You never know what this
[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:22.160]   stuff is. You're thinking, you're doing your thinking. Apple music, the world's second most
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:33.120]   popular music streaming service. This is this is according to a meet M. I D. I. A media research
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:44.160]   post. Spotify 31%. Apple music 15% followed by Amazon 13 10 cent 13 YouTube eight. Netties six
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:52.960]   Deezer to Yandex to I'm sad about title. It doesn't even show up. Other 10% that divide among a lot
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:59.200]   of people. I actually paid for title just because I wanted to hear there. I was the press streaming,
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:04.400]   but I was excited. I got on title to listen to the spatial and the problem is that the
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:08.480]   registration was difficult. I couldn't get it working on Michael on my Apple TV and I was like,
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:13.280]   okay enough. Forget it. I did the free subs, you know, one month or whatever. I'll probably cancel.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:21.520]   Anyway, nobody obviously says how well they're doing, but this is this is Midia research is
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:30.880]   conclusion based on their research. That's for Q2 love last year. It's global, by the way.
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:37.200]   Pono player is still a fine product. I was listening to Neil Young this morning and I
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:45.760]   my Pono is now in the museum, but it's still. If you I like that he's still a hippie. I like
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:51.680]   that he's still trying to say. Spotify. You can't have any like didn't you say like this morning,
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:57.120]   like take everything off my off of Joe Rogan. You don't have me exactly. Yeah. Yeah. All right.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.160]   Mirror. Mirror Rogan. I like that. Meanwhile, I were clapped and saying we're all hypnotized
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:07.280]   to go get the shot. So you know, you could pick your rocker pick your rocker. Whatever you believe
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.480]   you pick the rocker that goes along. I'm on science. How about I don't pick anything. I just
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:17.760]   pick science. I just got my test results back. I am still negative. Yay. I've been tested. So our
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:25.440]   son 19 year old contracted COVID a week ago. It's been a week now and he's been sick poor kid. He's
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:29.120]   not dying or anything. It's like a really bad cold basically. He's sore throat. He's
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:34.000]   stuffed up. He's got a bad headache. So we locked him in his room and Lisa and I have
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.840]   immediately tested negative. But we're both boosted and of course so was he. But we're both
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:43.840]   boosted and we've been doing all the right things washing our hands feeding him through the door.
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:47.440]   That kind of thing. And a lot of cool things.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.120]   Tic Tocqueville. Yeah. I keep it as challenge. Not that son. The other one Michael.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.880]   I know Tic Tocqueville. He works through COVID. He's been he's had COVID twice now Henry has
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:01.920]   and he just he works right through it. He doesn't. He's a loport. He's a loport. He works through it.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:07.520]   But so Lisa and I keep getting tested and so far so good. Negative. I just tested this morning.
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:14.160]   So good news. It's possible to care for somebody with COVID if you're careful
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:19.440]   and you're willing to lock them in the room in their room. You need a special.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:24.720]   Unzled. The sealed room. Do you have like a hazmat suit? You don't have like a hazmat.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.520]   Like when you open the door. We wear masks and I don't put a face shield on but we wear masks.
[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.800]   Hasmat. Maybe you should have a hazmat suit. How many times do you have to
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.920]   get to buy a hazmat suit? That's all I'm saying. That's a good point.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:43.120]   You should I get one with an oxygen bottle attached. Oh Mandalorian armor Leo. This is
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:47.440]   your big chance for a full Mandalorian armor. Somebody's pointing out that that that
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:54.800]   pie chart does not have Pandora on it either. Wow. That means Pandora is under 2% of the total market.
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:36:00.080]   Globally. Yeah. Maybe Pandora is bigger in the US. Maybe it's not such a big global.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:04.560]   Well, some of them aren't available in in as many markets. They're very few. I think that's
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.600]   probably Apple music in like a hundred more 150 markets. I think that's what they
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:12.240]   mean. That's what it's unusual. Yeah. Apple. I don't know what this means. You're going to
[01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:19.040]   explain. Apple delays in app account deletion requirement extends IEP exception for group services.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:24.640]   In order to provide more time for you to update your apps, we've changed the following requirement
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:32.320]   deadline of June 30th. Yeah. Those are the app events that they announced that
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:40.320]   to make it easier to delete your account. Is that it? These are the requirements when updating
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:44.800]   your app. The account deletion option should be easy to find. It's insufficient to only provide
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:49.440]   the ability to temporarily disable or deactivate an account. People should be able to delete the
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:55.200]   account and their personal data. Apps in highly regulated industries may need to provide additional
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:00.160]   support flows to confirm and facilitate the account deletion process. Follow applicable legal
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:07.040]   requirements, etc. Etc. But they. Dark pattern provision. Ah, good. It was going to apply to
[01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:11.920]   all app submissions by the end of this month due to the complexity of implementing this requirement.
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.520]   We've extended the deadline to June 30th. That seems to happen a lot. It does. It doesn't.
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:20.320]   Much easier to say you have to do this than it is for the developers to actually do it.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:23.440]   Yeah. But I like that Apple puts a firm date down because if they didn't, it would take
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:28.240]   literally forever. It'll take as long as Apple gives them. Right? Yes. Yeah. Well,
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:32.080]   until a majority of important apps, I think that's the worst of barometer. Like no one wants to
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:36.320]   have to eject Instagram or something from their platform. So you give them as long as it takes
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:41.120]   the major apps to move over and then anyone else gets sort of cut off. Yeah. Historically,
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:47.520]   developer houses, it's a thing. Work to work that they do on an app to comply with app store
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:54.400]   regulations are always like less, lesser priority than work to do to fix problems that exist in the
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.600]   app and work to do to add features to the app that you're using or looking for. People are not
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:06.080]   looking for, hey, I, gee, I really love to use this to-do list manager, but I'm not sure if it
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:11.200]   works with the GDPR disclosure compliance regulations that were just updated in the
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:15.760]   EU last month. Like no, they said, I really want to be able to do multiple selections and then to
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:20.320]   be able to pass that on to ever, ever know quickly. So this is why you really do, they really do
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:24.560]   have to have their arms twisted in order to do these things that the user is never going to really
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:29.440]   appreciate, but it's going to take time away and money away from actually making the,
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.840]   the app visibly better. But I do love this because like there are so many places,
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:37.280]   especially traditional media outlets where it's one button to subscribe, take your cut-up
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:41.120]   cut information and start billing you and 18 phone calls to get against.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.880]   Yeah. Including a mandatory, like, talk with their, with their retention department,
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.840]   which tries to guilt you like a grandparent. Like why, why are you, why are you removing
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:56.640]   your support and the words? This is why I love buying things to the app store, why I'm so sensitive
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:00.800]   to it being fragmented out because right now I just go, oh, I don't want to subscribe to that
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.520]   anymore. Like I just don't, you know, like in, in the back end,
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.120]   completely agree with you. That is the single most valuable benefit of the app store.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:11.920]   Just nowhere else is it that easy to do to review what you've subscribed to?
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:16.960]   And, and, and, you know, that'll be gone. If we, if we do it third party, like it's, it's
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:20.880]   gonna, all of that will be gone and we'll be back to like, well, it's good to kind of stick with
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:24.800]   the app store and, you know, I mean, that's a big, well, what will happen is it's big,
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:27.920]   the big companies, these are not again, these aren't the small, these aren't, they're smaller
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:34.400]   than Apple, but still we're talking about people who want to go from the gold to platinum, you know,
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:41.680]   and so, so, but they will eventually only make their apps available on, you know, for these
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:46.640]   outside of this, outside of the realm. And so we as users will have to do that if we want
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:50.960]   Netflix or, or something like that, or they'll go outside of it and give, you know, say, well,
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:54.640]   it's less expensive, but eventually that outside price will go right back up to where it is right
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:59.600]   now in the Apple and then users will just pay 30% more. And so the, so the thing is, is that,
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.520]   is that, you know, that's, that's why, you know, there'll be a lot of one stars if, if I see,
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:09.360]   if we see it show up. So, and I've gotten a lot of followers based on that. So I think that it won't
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:15.680]   be just one. So anyway, I wish my name were Leo Day, because then I could get Leo dot day,
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:22.400]   Felicia dot got Felicia dot day. Felicia Day on the tason got tason dot da tason dot day. Today
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:30.080]   is the dot day. According to Google, Google apparently owns the dot d a y domain. They're launching that
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:38.160]   domain today, but you have to be in the early access program, which by the way, Felicia Day is.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:44.800]   So congratulations, Felicia Day has her actual name as a domain. That's awesome.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:52.240]   There's wedding dot day by the not valentines day dot day valentines dot day by F T D.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:55.600]   I think all those people who collected all those dot coms.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:02.880]   Yeah, whoops. I can just mint them. That'll be fine. Starting together, you can register your own
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.200]   dot day domain as part of our early access program for an additional one time fee.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.080]   The fee decreases according to a daily schedule through the end of January on February 1st
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:17.520]   at eight a.m. dot day domains will be publicly available at base annual price through your
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:22.320]   registrar choice. So Google holds on to yeah, I can get it at hover but not till February 1st.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:24.720]   And by then all the good days will be taken.
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:31.200]   Oh, I don't know. The good days are ahead of us Monday to kind of believe they all gone.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.680]   Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, payday, payday.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:39.680]   Oh, I like that. That'll be gone. That'll be gone. All the good ones will be gone.
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.120]   If you search Wertle on Google, I don't know if you saw that or not Leo, but if you just search
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:46.880]   for Wertle on Google, it's the best thing. Well, let me do it right now.
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:54.080]   I did play Wertle already this morning. Wertle. Okay. Just look to search for a lot.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:58.880]   Oh, look up at the top. It's doing Wertle. It's playing a little Wertle.
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:03.280]   Oh, that's so nice. That's nice. Did you try Googling Betty White?
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:10.320]   I did not. Shall we try? Let's have some. We should save all this for tomorrow. Betty White.
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:20.960]   Nothing. Anything. What did you get? What did you get? There's supposed to be, I got, I got like a
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:26.160]   rose petals tumbling down from the top of the screen, followed by, thank you for being a friend.
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:31.040]   Maybe maybe maybe maybe they probably stopped. They don't want to keep doing that. That's really
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:39.440]   sweet. Good for them. There's no Google doodle today. That's weird. It just says Google. Is that right?
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:45.760]   You know, it's opposite day. Maybe that's why. There's a YouTuber, Julie Nolke, who got famous
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:50.800]   for making this series called explaining the pandemic to my past self. And she basically goes
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:54.480]   back in time and tries to give her information about what's happening for the next six months.
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:58.080]   And this, the last weeks, once she comes and she goes, so Betty White was trending again,
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:03.760]   and then I just had to stop the video. I couldn't. Couldn't continue. That was just peak 2022 for me.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:11.680]   A couple more stories. NVIDIA looks like they're going to abandon their arm acquisition. $40 billion.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:17.920]   That was a complicated one. Yeah. A lot of conflicting,
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:25.440]   it's a lot of direct competitors using the same technology that they're buying. That's a rough one.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:31.200]   For those of us who still think Katie Cotton is Apple Head of PR, no. Tom Dowling is not there,
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:41.360]   either, right? Gone. Steve Dowling. Apple has a new head of PR. Stella Lowe, who served as
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:47.360]   Apple Head of Worldwide Corporate Communications since May, has now been replaced by Kristen.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:53.760]   We're going to have to learn how to pronounce this. Who, Guey? Who, Guey? Quail. I'm just going to
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:59.600]   call her KQ. She's legit. Awesome. You know her? Have you met her? Yeah. Well, I mean, I know
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:05.680]   her's also an Apple. She's a longtime company spokesperson. Phenomenal reputation. Everyone seems
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:12.080]   really happy with her. She's been with the companies. It seems like she's trying to go outside of
[01:44:12.080 --> 01:44:19.760]   Apple, like, Browett and Paper Maker and Stella Lowe. Six months later, they're like, no, no,
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:27.040]   we've just come out the culture. Yeah. Lowe came from Cisco. Yeah. Yeah. Her new gig starts immediately.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:30.240]   It came from CNBC, I think, and he worked out great. It's just not always the key. Oh, I remember
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:36.560]   that. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. She will report directly to Tim Cook. Her new gig starts immediately.
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:42.800]   It's interesting. Usually there's a little transition, maybe not. Stella, here's a charity they're working.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:47.040]   Like she was running. She knows her stuff. Right. She's ready. And that's the PR people that Tim
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.560]   deal, like Tim's not, well, I'm sure he deals with product PR, but like corporate comms is what
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:55.600]   he does all day. Yeah. Apple said Lowe is departing to spend more time with her family.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.840]   That's always that's always the, wow. You think they come up with something else?
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.640]   She tweeted that. But she tweeted that this morning. She said it's like, hashtag is part of
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.640]   my family time. And I don't know what my son has. I have got COVID now. So I guess that's how I can
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:13.120]   completely understand that. You know, if I could afford to spend more time with my family, actually,
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:18.560]   when it's, I don't want it's a politician, maybe not. Yeah. When it's a politician who got caught
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.920]   doing something that will affect donations for the campaign or support from their party. That's
[01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:29.360]   that's that's it. Yeah. But but somebody in a job like that, it's like, I could understand the idea
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:33.680]   of, wait a minute, I just I just remember how much money I have and that I don't have to do any
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:38.880]   of this right now. Yeah. I mean, you've been there. If you've been in an apple, it's a job. Yeah.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:42.800]   Yeah. It's it's a real I mean, most most I think, I mean, Apple is not definitely not the same.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.880]   It's a little heavier than what we hear than than than some of the other companies. And so,
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:52.880]   you know, you you get, you know, I think there's a lot of people working pretty hard there,
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:56.560]   especially when you get to that altitude. I think it's pretty, yeah, it's pretty rough.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:59.600]   Yeah. The teams are still so small comparatively. Yeah.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:07.760]   Let us take a break and then you you peerless bird mastercators can come up with your picks
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:11.920]   of the week picks next. But first a word from Melissa.
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:19.920]   Addresses change emails change names change people move. If your contact list is not constantly
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:26.240]   updated, it's getting out of date. Guess why it's a brand new year time to kind of look at your data,
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:33.680]   make sure it's okay. According to the postal service in 2020, 36 million address changes
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:42.400]   processed, 36 million address changes in one year. Melissa solves this problem. They can help you
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:47.440]   make sure your data is current and accurate. They've been doing it for over 35 years. That's why
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:54.240]   over 10,000 businesses think of Melissa as the address experts, a renewal rate of over 92%
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:02.160]   because 25% is the typical ROI for Melissa customers. That tells you a lot right there. It's well
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:08.080]   worth it. Verify addresses, emails, phone numbers and names in real time with Melissa if you need to.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:14.560]   Their global address verification services works for 240 plus countries and territories. It can
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.840]   even work at the point of entry. One of the things I love about Melissa is very flexible.
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:22.800]   You can get it on-prem. You can get a web service. They have an FTP site. You can upload and download
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:29.920]   from software as a service and the API, which a lot of people use to actually do it at point of entry
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:35.600]   because that's often where the first errors occur. If you're tired of duplicate customer
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:40.480]   information in your database, Melissa's data matching will help eliminate clutter and duplicates
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:45.280]   increasing the accuracy of your database while reducing postage and mailing costs.
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.800]   You could do batch address, cleaning process and entire address list for accuracy and completeness.
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:56.720]   You could do identity verification, which these days is really more just as much about security
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:48:02.480]   as anything else. Reduce risking, share compliance, keep customers happy. You can convert addresses
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:08.480]   into latitude and longitude coordinates if you want. That's kind of cool, geo-coding. There's also
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:15.200]   email verification, which works so well. It can remove up to 95% of bad email addresses from your
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:22.880]   database. Flexible deployment options will suit any preference and you can be assured that your
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:29.520]   data is secure because they go undergo independent security audits on a regular basis to reinforce
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:36.000]   their commitment to data security, privacy and of course compliance, their SOC 2 HIPAA GDPR compliant.
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.880]   You might want to check out the new lookups apps. iOS and Google both to search addresses, names and
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:47.600]   more at your fingertips from Melissa. And if you sign up for a service level agreement,

[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:44.400]   Just go to Melissa.com/twit. M-E-L-I-S-S-A. Melissa.com/twit.
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:49.040]   We thank Melissa so much for supporting the show. And we thank you for supporting the show by
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:56.400]   using that address. So they know you saw it here, Melissa.com/twit. Renee Richie, pick of the week, Renee.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:03.840]   So I've got two of them and they're both videos. Now one of them is incredibly long and I have to
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:08.560]   admit I have not been able to make it all the way through, but it just keeps getting recommended
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:13.680]   to me. And it's a video power problem. It's 18 minutes. And even then it doesn't address everything
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:19.680]   because it deals with NFTs and the problem surrounding NFTs. What solutions they provide,
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.000]   whether those solutions are new in novel, what difficulties or problems they introduce,
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.840]   it doesn't get into the legal ramifications, which are huge, which we saw things like,
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.120]   you know, we bought a Dune book with our DOA and now we're going to make a movie about it,
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:37.120]   which has tremendous legal ramifications beyond just the technology involved. And this, at least
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:41.120]   so far and based on everything that I've seen from everybody who's watched it to completion,
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:49.280]   is just an incredibly good, reasonable, thorough, balanced, same look at what the technology actually
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:54.800]   is, what the problem space it addresses is the realism surrounding it. And it was pointed to me
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:59.680]   because right now there's a part of my Twitter timeline that vehemently, adamantly believes that
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:05.680]   if you're not all in on NFTs and DOA, the AOs and blockchains and all this, that you are beyond a
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:11.360]   Luddite and you're being left behind. You know who says that? People who are speculating in
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:17.040]   crypto and NFTs who desperately need a market to exist. Totally. But they speculate. The other
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:24.960]   part of my timeline are people who are like, this is the worst techno, technophiliac pyramid scheme
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:28.640]   I've ever seen. And they both threaten to block each other all the time. My Twitter timeline has
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:35.040]   never been more hostile. Nobody argued about web2, like nobody argued about OAuth and CSS and
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:41.280]   Ajax the way that they argue about these technologies. But this again is just a very sane
[01:51:41.280 --> 01:51:47.200]   deliberation of the technologies. My personal belief is that these are going to be building blocks
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:51.360]   of future products. Mainstream people shouldn't care about them until they're actually
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:56.880]   embedded in apps. Nobody cared about Ajax before it became Google Maps and Instagram and Facebook
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:52:00.720]   and nobody cared about OAuth until it became sign in with Twitter or sign in with Google or all
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:06.480]   those things. So it really is just really fetishizing technology at this point. But it's really good
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:12.000]   to know and to understand it. And my second pick is another video called... Let me just give people
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:19.440]   the location for this. So the channel is folding ideas and it's on YouTube. Line goes up. I'm not
[01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:25.280]   sure what that means. The problem with NFTs should be easy to find 1.8 million views in the last five
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:30.160]   days. That's pretty good. For a more than two hour video, it's pretty good. Yeah.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:35.760]   Folding ideas is the channel. It looks like he's got a lot of other interesting content on there.
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:43.360]   All right. Part two. Part two is just a very adorable video called Finding X.
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:50.480]   And it's just because it's animated math videos, which I thought was an adorable concept.
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:54.240]   And it's just because everybody's always solving for X. But what about X, Leo? Do we ever stop
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:58.080]   to think about X? How does X feel about the whole thing? Yeah. Are you doing okay, X?
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:04.160]   Just a little health check. But it is so gloriously animated. And the YouTuber who did it,
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:08.720]   and I'm just blanking on her name right now, but it's just gorgeous, gorgeous work. It's
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.000]   the kind of thing that makes me smile in the morning and I need those smiles.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:18.400]   Very cool. Finding X. A mathematical short film by TBS or TBS.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:23.600]   Yes, that's it. Yes. Very cool. There's X on the beach.
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:30.880]   Oh, they found him 20%. Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:37.680]   Simple, but really, really useful app for the iPad and the iPhone called Visref. All it is.
[01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:45.120]   It's an infinite canvas sort of idea board where it's just, as it says, it's an infinite canvas where
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:51.840]   you can import, paste, take pictures, whatever, and basically drop these on this board wherever
[01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:55.440]   you want them to go. Your own personal interest.
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:02.720]   Yeah. Well, see, the idea is that oftentimes, when you have a collection of images, like in
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:08.480]   this case, every time I see an oil painting or something that I really like, I dump it into
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.680]   an album. And I have so many of them that now I kind of need to organize them.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:19.040]   I figure what do I duplicates of and what cases do I have
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:26.000]   artworks that are being done by the, not just by the same artist, but here's the same model that
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.680]   did both of them. And the ability to simply splat a peak, splat an image just anywhere you want to.
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:37.920]   And then just like, move it around wherever you want to. And then the vision board we're looking at.
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:44.160]   I wish this is because because these are all like really, really talented people that kind of
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:52.960]   inspire me. But I can't see that it's so good because it is so simple that the idea that, and
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:57.440]   every one of these is being imported like at full size. So if I even though this is like a little
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.240]   tiny thumbnail, if I double tap on it, it will just automatically zoom out to maximum size.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:08.160]   I've used this a lot like when either a organizing a whole bunch of images, there are times when
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:14.640]   I'm trying to write something, I need a whole bunch of different pieces of information,
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:19.440]   visual pieces of information that I don't know how to organize inside my head. And I don't want
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:24.320]   to take the time to simply take this chart that I grabbed from someplace and then I type it well.
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:29.600]   The trend, the hockey stick trend towards this is leaning towards 2023. It's much easier to simply
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:34.000]   say, look, I'm going to use this at some point. I'm just going to drop this here. I have tools that
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:38.560]   let me do that in other apps like Scrivener does that. And some note takers will let you import
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:44.480]   things as pictures. But this is just simply like you clear everything off your desk. You just put
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.880]   all these things down there. You keep sliding them around like someone in like a detective at a
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:56.160]   1993 nighttime cop drama on TV. Like there's got to be a connection between these three receipts and
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:02.160]   this security camera photo and these lab results. It's not for any one thing. It is one of my favorite
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:07.680]   classes of apps. It's an app that you have installed on your phone or on your on your iPad. And then
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:12.160]   at some point during life, you realize that, Oh, I'm doing this the really, really hardware by
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:16.480]   trying to organize this through Omni outliner. I can just dump these all dump all these pictures
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:20.400]   into this big canvas and then just drag them around until they make sense to me. Awesome.
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:24.880]   And it's not it's not expensive. It's like 399. There's a separate version for the iPhone.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:31.520]   There's a separate version for the iPad. And I got this a few weeks ago and you can create multiple
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:37.120]   of these of these image boards. And I now have like four or five and two of them are kind of important
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:45.120]   now. Very nice. And now that as a gentleman, I give us the most expensive guy in the show in
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:48.240]   this shop. I guess I guess it will be the most expensive today because everything else has been
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:54.000]   pretty expensive. And these are four bucks, dude. The others are free. What do you got? Yeah.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:58.880]   So what I'm recommending because I've been using it now for a long time and I'm pretty happy. I just
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:04.400]   got a second one is the Viva. This is a tablet mount. And I was going to show you how I use it.
[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:13.520]   This is wrong wrong button. Let's see here. There we go. So these are the these are the tablet
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:18.720]   mounts. And you can see two of them here. And you know what I can do is I have these on arms.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:22.560]   These are just monitor arms. So what these are is these are these are mounts that hold my this
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:26.880]   is a wackum tablet. So this is how I know what this is going to do. This is how I draw, you know,
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:32.400]   over top of things. And so but what I found was is that I needed. This is where I started with it
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:37.680]   is I needed to build a move it around. And so I didn't want it to just be sitting on my desk.
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:42.560]   It was taking up too much desk space. And then I need my iPad to go somewhere too. And so I put
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:46.880]   these on here. So what's nice is I can kind of move them in and out and get them to exactly,
[01:57:46.880 --> 01:57:52.000]   you know, where I want. That's not that's just a monitor. But anyway, so but what's really nice
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:57.120]   is that they they they act as a visa mountain. So any any arm that you have like this that that
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.920]   would have that would take a monitor, you can simply attach it to it. And then you can put
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:07.200]   tablets or wackum tablets or other things on them and kind of keep them all moving. And so
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:11.360]   a lot of my arms are kind of that way. They kind of ball. There's there's one waiting for a monitor
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:18.160]   right now. Anyway, so so anyways, it's just a really real I bought a lot of these over the last
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:21.840]   couple years. And this is the best one so far. I probably bought I don't know 15 of them.
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:25.840]   Not expensive, actually, not particularly expensive. Yeah, they're not.
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:30.400]   But of course, you have to have a visa arm to put it on, which which are like, yeah, the
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:33.600]   visa arms are going to be more expensive. I mean, you know, the the ones that I have are
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:38.960]   probably 80 bucks each. Yeah, and the but they can get up to be inexpensive if you really want
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:43.280]   nice ones. And so buying minor at least, almost the least expensive ones, but they're solid.
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:49.040]   Anyway, so but they're great. They're great little mounts. And if you're trying to figure out,
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:53.280]   like if you get some mobile mounts, like with arms that can move and then you start putting
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:59.600]   tablets or stuff on it, it's nice. So everything's on arms in your studio, I bet.
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:04.000]   Every thing, almost everything is on arms. Yeah, like, like I have, if you,
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:11.440]   you know, if you if you look at my my studio here, the, you know, these are, these are the two here.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.800]   This one, this one's on an arm. This one's this one's on an arm.
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:17.520]   This one's like even the speakers are on everything's on arms.
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:22.720]   It gives you flexibility as you go around, you go like, oh, I want to move this up here
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:26.240]   down there. And you have that. Even this is even my mic is on an arm. Yeah,
[01:59:26.240 --> 01:59:30.640]   fighter jet cockpit moment, where you sit down and then you swing everything in.
[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:35.520]   Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So it's it's it's good.
[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:39.520]   Is that a what tell me about your tin cup that looks like you're drinking? Oh, that's
[01:59:39.520 --> 01:59:43.840]   that's a I have two of these. Oh, it's an Ember. I didn't know that
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:48.640]   I mean metal embers. That's not my mom got them for me. And so I got two of them.
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:53.440]   I have a ceramic one. That's nice. This is the first hour. This is the second hour.
[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:59.440]   There's USB charged coffee mugs that keep your coffee warm. Yeah. And so they they sit over.
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:03.840]   I like to get two of them, folks. That's how I'm there for two hours. Like in for office hours,
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:08.560]   what's nice is that they stay warm. So I drink one and it's nice and warm. And then I get to
[02:00:08.560 --> 02:00:11.840]   the second hour. I don't have to stand up. I have a nice warm. Another one ready to
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:16.640]   warm. I have some more PG tips waiting for me right there. And good to go. Yeah. So.
[02:00:16.640 --> 02:00:20.880]   And just because somebody asked your microphone is a Neumann TLM.
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:28.880]   102. Yeah. The 102 is like six or seven hundred dollars. The 103 is like 1200 or $1300.
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:33.040]   Yeah. And by the way, since we're looking at this stuff, there's there's the rock collection.
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:35.280]   My daughter made me a couple new ones. I love those.
[02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:40.800]   Sarah, look at that. And she's good. Wow. She is. She's got some. Did she find the rock somewhere?
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:43.920]   Does she ship them in? They're outside in front of the house. Okay. She just she's good.
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:48.960]   We have a lot. Whoever owned the house before had a lot of thousands of round rocks. So she
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:51.840]   just goes out and picks the rocks that she needs and brings them back and they're called river
[02:00:51.840 --> 02:00:57.280]   cobbles and yeah. Yeah. And she's loaded with river cobbles. Yeah. They're she's 10 feet tall.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:01:05.200]   She got it. Thank you, Alex Lindsay, office hours.global. If you want to join that coffee,
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:13.280]   fueled extravaganza, it goes 24/7. But the morning is when the official office hours goes on.
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:19.040]   It's a lot of fun. I mean, it's still every every morning. It's just something new. Like we get to
[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.720]   talk about something new that's related to it. And so we were talking today, just about all the
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:26.240]   AV issues that you might have a week ago, by the way, when we're talking about NFTs,
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:34.640]   we had Elizabeth Strickler on from from from from. She's a specialist in she teaches classes.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:40.640]   Um, at, uh, you know, on NFTs and but she's not like someone really promoting it. She just
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:44.640]   answered our questions about this is what you want to think about when you're talking about it. And so
[02:01:44.640 --> 02:01:49.040]   it's good. But we can range everything from NFTs all the way through to like what kind of
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:55.440]   wiring should you use and and yeah. So in tomorrow and Thursday, we have a some great artists coming
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:59.840]   on. And so so there's just a lot of a lot of different things. So it's a lot of fun. And there's
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:06.560]   also Sabato Gigante with cooking and music and conversation. We're constantly figuring stuff out.
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.600]   You know, the what's what's really happening is somewhere in the primordial ooze of this of this
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:16.720]   or organization is coming out new ways of doing online events, you know, and new ways of doing
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:21.920]   broadcast. I mean, to have a something that you can imagine the chaos that would normally happen.
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:26.800]   But we have, you know, anywhere from 10 to 20 people on the panel, any given morning. So it's
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:32.000]   amazing. And it works seamlessly. It's a big just one big zoom call. You can find out more by going
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.560]   office hours dot global, including getting an invite. And of course, there's a YouTube channel
[02:02:36.560 --> 02:02:44.240]   as well. If you want to hire Alex, oh, nine, oh, dot media. That's his, that's his. I mostly
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:48.720]   specialize in especially if you have something that you think might work in live that has never
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.360]   been done before. That's kind of most of my job. He likes to do crazy stuff. I do mostly crazy.
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:59.920]   Crazy stuff. No, everybody says you can't do that. You can't do that. We help launch platforms.
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:03.520]   That's kind of what we nice. That's what I do anyway. And the company has lots of different
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:07.840]   streams, lots of different streams for, you know, Marvel and other folks, but you know,
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:14.960]   most of my focus is on the kind of bleeding edge stuff. Mr. Naco, WGBH next Thursday.
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:21.760]   Friday, the usual day, a little bit earlier, 11 40 AM, go to wgph news.org,
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:30.080]   distribute live or distribute later. And any, any information on the grand Naco project?
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:33.600]   Has it, is it coming along? I've had it's, it's coming along. As a matter of fact,
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:40.080]   I've accidentally kept gotten like a, a, gotten a, a extra motivation because on, on the radio
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:44.160]   last week. So, oh, a reader asked, oh, I understand you're working on something. I think, oh,
[02:03:44.160 --> 02:03:48.880]   and, and it was one of those, you're, you're, you're, you do ready to see, you know that like,
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:53.600]   when you drop, oh, by the way, we're, we're 30 seconds until commercial, but what was that like,
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:59.280]   I said, yeah, quick. I'm relaunching stuff. Stay tuned. It's nothing to announce yet. But yeah,
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:03.200]   definitely check back later. I'm like, oh, okay. So I guess, I guess I really do have to do this.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:08.240]   And then I'm, I'm a little bit of a regular timeline. Yeah, it's, it's great. It's great.
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:11.840]   When you just have this private thing that you're working on and that you don't, you're not going
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:16.640]   to take the reps of it. But at some point you do have to publish, I understand. So yeah, it's,
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:20.080]   it's coming along. It's coming along. Publish or perish Andrew.
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:23.440]   Good. Good artists. When it's a steep job.
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:29.360]   Shit. Good artists. Great artists. Actually, good artists ship. Great artists steel. No,
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:35.360]   no, that's something else. Commercial artists ship commercial, commercial artists subcontract.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:42.880]   There you go. Renee Richie, of course, has his own YouTube channel, youtube.com/ReneeRitchie,
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:47.520]   where he's working all the time to create great content for you. Anything else,
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:51.520]   anything coming up? But you got, you did the product shocker. We saw that.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:56.080]   Yeah, I've been working on my animations now because I want to do a better job explaining things.
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:00.480]   Oh, love that. Most recently I've been doing, and YouTube is interesting. I spent most of my
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:04.720]   day figuring out how to take educational videos and wrap them up in YouTube candy. So people will
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:09.520]   actually click on them and then give me a shot at explaining things. So I did like a big Bluetooth
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:14.960]   explainer and then I did a big lightning versus USB C versus MagSafe explainer. And then yesterday,
[02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:20.080]   I did my biggest one, I think ever, which was an OLED versus mini LED versus micro LED.
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:24.720]   The problems with all of them, but also like the technologies and hopes for the future and
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:29.520]   how you mitigate them and where they use them. And it was a lot of fun for me. Oh, that's cool.
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:33.920]   What do you use the animation? I'm actually doing them straight and final coach. I know it's
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:38.320]   going to make Alex so disappointed in me because I'm not even doing them in keynotes or in motion.
[02:05:38.320 --> 02:05:41.120]   I'm doing them straight and final cut because I'm an old timeline animator.
[02:05:41.120 --> 02:05:46.480]   But I like I have like, like you see, like the sub pixels I have like RGB stripe,
[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:52.880]   Apple's weird Apple watch version of stripe, Samsung's S stripe, the, what do they call them,
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:57.920]   the Pentile. You kind of need illustrations. You can't talk about that stuff. You have to
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:03.040]   actually show it. So this is a perfect place to do this. I do like really fake simulations of
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:07.760]   what it looks like when OLED pixels decay and the blue pixel decays faster, you know, or things
[02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:12.960]   bloom or white burn in happens. All those things. It's a lot of fun. And even labels on fake simulation.
[02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:19.360]   Super fake. So big. Thank you, Renee. Thank you, Andy. Thank you, Alex. We do,

[02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:46.720]   Once you get there, you'll also find a link to the YouTube channel, which is a great place to go to
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:54.000]   get the shows in video. All of our shows are there after the fact you can subscribe
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:08:02.160]   by going to our website or by just finding your favorite podcast application and subscribing
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:08.080]   in there. If you do have a podcast app, by the way, that supports reviews. I don't want to say
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:15.760]   anything, but a five star review would be much appreciated. There I said it. I'm just a review
[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:21.360]   grubber. Thank you everybody. Have a great week. We'll see you next time. Now get back to work
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:26.560]   because break time is over. Have you ever read a tech news story and thought to yourself, man,
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:30.720]   I would love to talk to the person who wrote this to find out more information. Well, that's
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:36.880]   exactly what Mike Asargent and I, Jason Howell, do each and every week on Tech News Weekly. We read
[02:08:36.880 --> 02:08:41.040]   the stories that matter to us. We reach out to the people making a break in the tech news and we
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:53.360]   invite them on to tell their story. And you can find it at twit.tv. Look for Tech News Weekly every Thursday.
