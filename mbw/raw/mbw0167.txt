[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.120]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers everything
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.560]   Apple.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.520]   And today we've got a special guest on the show.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.800]   Andy Inaco and Don McAllister will be joining us in a bit.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.120]   But right now, on the line with us, Paul Kent,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.720]   who is the organizer, the man behind Macworld Expo,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.200]   and has been for-- how many years,
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.480]   Paul, have you been doing this?
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.920]   Well, I've been to conferences only for about 10 years,
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.960]   and then I've been running the whole show for the last four
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.520]   years.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.800]   So that's a long time.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.760]   How old is Mac?
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.120]   Macworld, I mean--
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.640]   This year will be the 26th Macworld.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.640]   Wow.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.560]   Now you've got a bit of a challenge,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.440]   because this is the first year that Apple will not
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.320]   be coming to Macworld, San Francisco.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.080]   Yeah, it's going to be a very different show this year
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.280]   with that Apple participating.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.880]   But it's going to be an interesting show,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.200]   and I'll tell you why.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.680]   We ask attendees every year, why do you come to Macworld?
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.000]   And the number one reason they tell us every year
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.320]   is to discover new products.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.320]   And anyone who's ever been to Macworld knows that you come
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.800]   into the big hall, and you see a lot of the larger companies,
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.680]   and you get a lot of good information
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.080]   or find out about products.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.400]   But then you go out to the corners of Macworld,
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.680]   and there's tons of these innovative small companies
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.280]   that are doing great things, hardware companies,
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.560]   software companies.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.000]   Macworld this year really turns to be more about what you
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.280]   can do with your Apple products.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.280]   A lot more about cool software that you might not
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.600]   have discovered before, cool hardware
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.120]   that you might not have discovered before.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.480]   And that's really what Macworld becomes.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.200]   It becomes about how to enjoy your Apple products even more
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.840]   by discovering third-party products.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.120]   We're going to be there.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.160]   I'm excited to say doing Macworld life.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.080]   So David Pogue is being promoted to the big stage.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.840]   He's going to do what would have been the Steve Jobs keynote
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.000]   in years past or the Phil Schiller keynote.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.760]   And is that on the first day of the expo?
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.000]   Let me talk a little bit about the date.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   So we moved.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   We were traditionally--
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.320]   That's right.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.760]   --five years we were in January.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.520]   So it was sort of a tradition, but it was also a colossal pain
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.720]   in the behind for people to get ready to do Macworld the first
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.680]   week after the holidays.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.080]   So this was a good opportunity, as we're recasting the show
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.000]   to move it to a more convenient time.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.560]   Some space became available at the Moscone Center in San
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.200]   Francisco in February.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.960]   And so we moved the show to February 9th through 13th.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.520]   The 9th through 13th are all conference days.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.120]   The 11th through 13th are Expo days.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.200]   So February 11th, 12th, 13th.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.240]   David will be speaking on the morning of February 11th
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.560]   to kind of get us open.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.840]   And you will be speaking on Friday, the 12th.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.680]   And we're so happy to have you with us, Leo.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.160]   I think you picking up where David left off
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.920]   with this Macworld Live, this talk show.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.960]   It's a great format.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.520]   You're the perfect person to kind of take this to another level.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.840]   I know you're working on some great guest--
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.680]   And we're going to keep it a secret.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.720]   We haven't-- first of all, we haven't got the confirmation.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.080]   I want everybody to be disappointed.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.880]   But they will be geek icons.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.080]   Let's put it that way.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.080]   Geek icons it is.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.640]   [LAUGHS]
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.400]   But that's going to be exciting.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.520]   And now you're going to very kindly-- and this is unusual
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.840]   for conference-- let us stream that live as well.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.120]   But I--
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.000]   Absolutely.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.600]   I think it's safe to do because the truth is, as you said,
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.440]   the thing that really makes Macworld Expo so special
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.360]   is the gathering of the tribe, the getting together,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.880]   the seeing people, the parties being there.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.320]   So really, the stream is great for people
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.440]   who cannot be there for one reason or another.
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.120]   We're very excited to be a part of it.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.480]   It's going to be very, very cool to be doing a Macworld live.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.240]   Is registration up to Snuff at this point?
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.680]   Are you--
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.040]   Yeah, we're very excited about where we are.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.880]   So the update is we have about 150 exhibitors signed on now.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.040]   And the phone is ringing quite constantly
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.280]   with exhibits getting in.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.440]   It's been the economy where we see it as a lot of people
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.880]   who decided things earlier are really seeing things.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.320]   Q4, Q1 is when a lot of exhibitors are signing up.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.280]   But the exhibitors we have are really excited about it.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.800]   HP is there, Western Digital Fujitsu, Sennheiser.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.120]   So some of the big companies, big hardware companies.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.680]   And then we're really seeing the best
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.280]   debris of the small software developers,
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.640]   Rogue Amoeba, Mac Speech, IFI.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.360]   A lot of the really cool stuff that you
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.680]   can do with your Apple products.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.920]   And it's all Apple products too.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.720]   It's not just a Mac.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.920]   It's iPhones and iPods as well.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.280]   So it's really coming along.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.920]   28,000 people have pre-registered for the Expo, which is great.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.440]   Wow.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.160]   We're really psyched about that.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.080]   We've got three months to go.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.720]   That's really the kind of the big deal.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.120]   So we're in good shape.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.920]   And we're really looking forward to this first show,
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.440]   where we present Mac from this new way.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.440]   So I was saying before, David will
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.960]   be doing an opening feature presentation.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.480]   You'll be doing a presentation.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.320]   We announced last week that the filmmaker Kevin Smith,
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.280]   clerks chasing Amy.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.840]   Great, great, great presenter.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.000]   Hysterical, a little on the blue side.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.240]   So you've got to be prepared for that.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.280]   But Kevin will be one of our featured presenters as well.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.080]   And we still have, over the next three months,
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.640]   we'll be announcing several more.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.120]   These feature presentations, by the way,
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.800]   there is no charge once you're in the show.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.000]   Anybody can come to these things.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.600]   So it's not conference only.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.760]   It's if you come to the Expo, that you can go to any of these
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.360]   presentations.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.240]   So at the end here, I wanted to do a little giveaway
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.320]   for your listeners.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.000]   And so all the Leo fans can kind of come and enjoy what you're
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.640]   going to do for them.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.480]   Well, how do they do that?
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.640]   Tell me about that.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.800]   Well, let's do it now.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:43.040]   So the first 100 people to go to www.macworldxpo.com
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.160]   and register with the promo code Leo.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   OK.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.640]   We'll get a complimentary Expo pass.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.320]   This is really good.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.920]   The show floor.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.400]   So hopefully, I'll be able to come on a couple more times
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.240]   as we lead up to the show with more news.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.320]   And we may do a couple more if there's space allowing.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.760]   But for now, we want to get 100 good listeners to Macbreak
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.920]   and the week in tech and people who
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.080]   want to see what you're up to.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.640]   And these special guests that we can't wait
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:07.760]   to hear who they're going to be.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.840]   And that--
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.480]   You're going to love them.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.120]   --again there.
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.120]   I don't have to say Kevin Smith's pretty good.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.080]   You know, it's actually hard to limit the list.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.960]   There's so many people I'd like to have on stage.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.240]   And we're going to have music.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.880]   We're going to have a cool demonstration of something.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.080]   We're going to have a lot of fun.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.080]   So I'm looking to agree with that.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.600]   I hope everybody will come.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.040]   To Macworld Expo, it is coming up in February,
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.080]   the 9th through the 13th, the 9th, and the 10th
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.960]   is the conference.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.800]   And we shouldn't downplay that.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.840]   That's really important for people
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.720]   who need professional training or want to know more
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.920]   about how to use their Macs.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.040]   It's really valuable education.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.560]   Oh, I agree.
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.880]   And we've been doing the conferences for a long time.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.080]   They're very broad.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.760]   The breadth of them.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.120]   We have everything from stuff for people
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.240]   who just want to become power users with their Mac
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.640]   to hardcore enterprise IT content.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.240]   We have a whole conference about 30 sessions of content
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   just for IT professionals.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.360]   We have stuff for small business people.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.400]   We have conference sessions for creative professionals,
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.160]   photographers, musicians, videographers.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.120]   So the conferences are fantastic.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.840]   I would love for people to take a look at it.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.920]   They're always very crowded.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   It's a big part of what Macworld has become.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.400]   And it is.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.840]   It's that professional development opportunity
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.520]   and a lot of social and business networking
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.440]   gets done in the conference.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.480]   So it's kind of an event within the event.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.800]   And that's how the conference is run.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.880]   That's the 9th and the 10th.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.000]   The 11th David Pogue speaks the 12th.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.480]   I speak.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.240]   Expo is the 11th, 12th, and 13th.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.920]   There's a Saturday.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.080]   So if you can't get away from work, you can go on Saturday.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.160]   And again, to be one of the people
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.880]   gets one of the first 100 to get a free Macworld registration
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.680]   for the Expo, go to macworldexpo.com
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.760]   and use my name Leo as the coupon code.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.680]   Very generous of you, Paul.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.840]   We will have you back.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.040]   I want to have you back several times
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.960]   between now and the end of the year
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.240]   just to kind of fill us in on updates.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.800]   Because obviously new things are happening all the time.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.400]   All the time.
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.960]   The exhibitor list is growing every day.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.400]   And there's really cool things.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:05.040]   And like I said, there's several more of these feature
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.760]   presentations.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.640]   These kind of like big name presenters
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.840]   who will be open to everybody.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.360]   So we'll have more announcements about that stuff
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.160]   as we go along.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.200]   For now, David, Leo, and Kevin Smith is a pretty good--
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:15.720]   That's a good start.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.360]   --number one, two, three.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:21.160]   That's Derek Jeter, Johnny Damon, and Arah, I guess.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.120]   I'm pretty happy to be in the middle of that one.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.720]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.600]   Can't good luck.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.360]   I know you're going to be working hard through February.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.200]   Well, I can't wait to see you in San Francisco,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.960]   Moscone Center February 9 through 13th for Macworld Expo.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.520]   Thanks so much.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.320]   So I'll hang out in the chat room if that's OK if anybody
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.840]   has any questions.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   Right.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.760]   What's your handle in the chat room?
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.840]   Macworld 2010.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.160]   Macworld 2010 in the chat room.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.040]   Go say hi to Paul.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.080]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.560]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.320]   Thank you.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.160]   Very quickly, before we get to our regular panel in Macbreak,
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.640]   weekly, Don McAllister and Andy Enocho will be joining us
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.960]   to talk about the latest Mac news.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:57.160]   I want to mention my sweet ride.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.200]   It's not really about the ride, although I do like my lovely little
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.120]   Mustang.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.720]   It's about what's in the car.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.720]   It's about the Ford Sync inside.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.000]   Have you heard about Ford Sync?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.400]   It is the amazing new voice activated, hands-free calling,
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.640]   music search, turn-by-turn navigation.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.920]   It's available exclusively on Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.520]   vehicles.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.840]   This is simply the nicest car stereo system I've ever used.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.920]   Because I can talk to it.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.720]   For instance, I'm reading an audiobook by Jerry Parnell
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.160]   on David Niven, Larry Niven, called Lucifer's Hammer.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.800]   And I stopped it and I had been listening on the iPod
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.720]   and the other as I walked around.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.720]   So I got back in the car, plugged the iPod in.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.480]   By the way, it has a USB jack.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.080]   So I have the iPod cable in there.
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.040]   So I plugged the iPod in and it starts charging immediately.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.160]   The first time you plug in the iPod, index is all the files.
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.440]   So it already had done that.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.800]   There weren't any changes.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.400]   So then I go to the USB.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.360]   And I can do that all, by the way, as I'm driving.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.760]   Because I press the button on the steering wheel, it goes,
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.720]   bunk.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.520]   And I say audio, bunk, sync, bunk.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.840]   And then I say play Lucifer's Hammer.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.600]   And it starts-- it knows what's on the iPod
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.040]   and it starts playing it.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.840]   You can say play an artist, play a track.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.560]   You can say play similar, play next, play previous.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.400]   I don't even know all the commands yet, actually.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.360]   You can get it to list all the commands if you want.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.560]   You can ask for help.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.720]   So many things that could do a 411 business search,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.240]   personalized news, sports, and whether it reads you
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.800]   the weather for your local weather, your local traffic.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.680]   In fact, it even knows your routes.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.720]   It'll give you traffic reports or reroute you,
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.520]   depending on the traffic conditions.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.680]   This is smarter than a lot of GPS's.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.800]   Thing is, it's a GPS built into the car,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.320]   but it's not the expensive screen.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.360]   It's talking to you.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.480]   So you can say directions and then give the name--
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.720]   I actually used it the other day.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.520]   I pressed the button, dunk.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.520]   I said directions, dunk, Apple Store.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.280]   And it found the nearest Apple Store.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.840]   And it drove me there.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.600]   Well, the car didn't.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.440]   I had to do the driving.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.960]   But it walked me through it.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.240]   Pretty amazing.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.320]   The Ford Sync, it has 911 assist if the airbags deployed
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.160]   automatically calls 911.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.720]   As a vehicle health report, you can have--
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.240]   I have it set every 5,000 miles,
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.760]   but you can do it at any time.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.800]   I can go on and on, but I really want you to try it.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.400]   First of all, you can go to a website,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.920]   SyncMyRidePodcasts.com and learn more.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.520]   SyncMyRidePodcast.com.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.960]   They spell Sync-S-Y-N-C.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.760]   It's all caps.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.320]   I think it must be an acronym for something.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.840]   I don't have to find out.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.400]   SyncMyRidePodcast.com.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.000]   Or-- and by the way, when you go there,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.120]   you can find out how to win a NANO or a ZUN.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.680]   They're giving away 15 between now and December 8.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.520]   Or you can just tweet, listen in the Mac break weekly
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.160]   with Don and Andy talking about Macworld Expo
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.240]   and then put the hashtag #Pounds SyncMyRidePodcast.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.200]   And you'll be editing the drawing automatically.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.120]   Tweet anything you like.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.400]   Just put #Pounds SyncMyRidePodcast.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.520]   And that enters you for the drawing for the free NANO
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.960]   or ZUN through December 8 every a day, another giveaway.
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.120]   SyncMyRidePodcast.com.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.160]   We thank Ford and the Ford Sync so much for supporting
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.080]   Mac break weekly.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.880]   Now let's get our friends on the line, Don McAllister,
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   from Liverpool, our favorite Liverpool-Liver-Pudlian.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.320]   And Andy and Akko from Boston.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.680]   Let's see if I can get Andy on.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.720]   So Andy and Akko is a MIA right now.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.960]   And we'll keep trying to get him.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.720]   But Don McAllister is here from Screencast Online
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.640]   and Liverpool.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.600]   And we were just saying off the year,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.200]   there used to be a big Ford factory in Liverpool.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.320]   Yes, down in Hellwood, which is--
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.200]   it's not too far.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.680]   We've actually drive past it every day,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.280]   take my daughter to theater school.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.880]   So yeah, it was quite a big employer in Merseyside.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.800]   And they've been taken over by Jaguar,
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.640]   so I think they still make Jaguar's there.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.240]   I'm not too sure.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.800]   They might have moved on to something else.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.480]   But yeah, no Ford was big round Merseyside.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.680]   Last time I was in England, there were a lot of fiestas.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.600]   Ford fiestas.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.880]   Ford fiestas, oh, yes.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.760]   They still drive those?
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.080]   Or what is it?
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.880]   Yeah, no, they've modernized them.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.960]   Probably when you were over there.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.520]   Yeah, that was been a long time.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.600]   I used to have Ford fiestas myself.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600]   I just did what I wanted to do.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.600]   There you go.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.440]   There you go.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.280]   And it's the drive.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.120]   What was it?
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.520]   About 60 miles every day up and down the motoring there.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.360]   Little Ford fiestas.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.040]   It was pretty ropy.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.840]   But it got me there and back.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.040]   We out here in the countryside, it's all Ford trucks.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.160]   Everybody's got a Ford truck.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.000]   That's the truck of choice.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.080]   Sometimes I'll look--
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.520]   because you know I drive a Mustang, which
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.800]   is a very distinctive sound on the engine.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.480]   And I'll think, oh, I'm hearing a Mustang.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.280]   And I'll look up and it's an F-150 truck.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.160]   I go, oh, no, I guess not.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.000]   So is that a new Mustang or--
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.120]   Yeah, I bought a brand new one.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.960]   But you know, I have to say, for a while,
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   the styling of the Mustangs was kind of pedestrian.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.400]   And this one really looks like the old--
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.520]   it's modern looking.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.520]   It looks like a muscle car.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.720]   It's got a-- it's just gorgeous.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.080]   I kind of blown away by it.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.160]   Just fantastic.
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.080]   So I wasn't going to buy a Mustang.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.080]   When I went to the dealer, I was going to learn about Ford's
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:15.840]   sink.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.160]   And I left with a new car.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.960]   But I kind of needed one anyway.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:26.040]   So hey, you're doing a series right now on Launch Bar.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.880]   And I'm kind of intrigued by that because as you know,
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.360]   and maybe some listening know, Al Gore, who wrote "Quick
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.720]   Silver" has gone to work at Google
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.680]   and is working on a kind of a Google launch application that's
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.480]   not nearly as good as "Quick Silver."
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.200]   And it hasn't really updated "Quick Silver."
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.560]   It's gone open source, is that right?
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.080]   That's right.
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.520]   Yeah, there's been a few--
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.440]   I've seen lots of complaints that people--
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.960]   I mean, people are still using "Quick Silver."
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.520]   But there's not been many updates, I don't think, for a while.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.080]   I mean, I've played with it in the past.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.120]   And I've never really sort of taken to "Quick Silver."
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.960]   But I've launched-- I've used Launch Bar pretty much inside.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.280]   So it's over to the Mac.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.920]   And each release, they brought more functionality to it.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.760]   People think of it as just an application switcher.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.120]   But it's so much more than that.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.640]   It's quite a-- I mean, it's one of those packages
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.200]   that once you've used it, that's it, then.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.280]   You sort of hooked on it for good.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.360]   And it really makes use in the Mac.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.240]   It makes you become more productive using the Mac,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.640]   because there's so many shortcuts you can do.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.960]   That's how I thought with "Quick Silver."
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.760]   Like, when I'd sit down in the Mac,
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.880]   and I wouldn't be able to use it, I would say, well, how do you--
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.520]   oh, you have to dig through folders?
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.560]   What are you talking about?
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.720]   I just type a few letters.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.480]   And in fact, I think that that influenced Microsoft
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.680]   a little bit, because starting in Windows Vista now in Windows 7,
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.280]   all you do is you hit the Windows key,
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.320]   and you type the first few letters of your application.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.440]   And it starts a search, and you can hit return.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.920]   So it's very similar now to that LaunchFire,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.960]   "Quick Silver" way of doing things.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.840]   There is a program called "Launchy" that's almost a clone,
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.560]   but you don't really need it.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.280]   Well, I know a lot of people say, well, why don't you just
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.080]   use "Spotlights," because "Spotlights embedded in every Mac."
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.200]   But it's "Spotlight" really-- although you can't use it
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.000]   in application launcher, and they have smarted it up
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   with-- well, since Leopard, really.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.720]   The thing is with that is you can't use an abbreviation.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.680]   You have to type the first few characters of the application
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.280]   name.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.840]   So if you want to text edit, you'd have to type "TEX."
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.680]   But with LaunchFire, you can actually teach your abbreviations.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.360]   So instead of "TEX," you just type "TEX," a very good example.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.520]   But if I had to go pro, I could just type "FCP."
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   FCP, right.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.720]   But also, if I wanted to, if I used Final Cut Pro a lot,
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.080]   I could just hit "F," and then return.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:33.920]   But it gets better than that.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.120]   You can just type "F" and hold the "F" down,
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.680]   and that will kick off the application for you.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:43.120]   So it's multi-layered how easy you want to make it work for you.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.800]   But they can't align laterally to single presses.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.960]   Hey, Andy, it's--
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:48.960]   I'm amazing.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:56.840]   I hear the-- I'm having trouble with Skype sound.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.320]   No.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:01.480]   Well, see, part of it was my fault, because my AMAC--
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.480]   what my AMAC was doing, that sort of thing, where it says,
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.160]   you know, I'm doing the best that I can for you
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.640]   with this gammy leg of mine.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.560]   But I'd really like to have this mended if I could.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.600]   And then when we said-- then when it was 10 minutes,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.560]   and it was still a little late, I said, OK, tell you what,
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.120]   I'll click that button, install the updates, and do a restart.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.400]   And then it took me quite a long time to get Skype to--
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.280]   Why do you--
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.880]   --be a non-dom whatever.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.800]   Anyway, hi.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.800]   So like I was saying, the Mark of Prex and all days
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.800]   ask you, well, I think it's very, very flabby at the moment.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:32.720]   We were talking actually about launch bar of all things,
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.000]   because Don just did a very well-received screencast online
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.920]   about launch bars.
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.160]   He's got a second one coming out this weekend.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.600]   You-- but it's funny, because Andy and Alex never
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.240]   use Quicksilver.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   Right?
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.600]   That's true.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.040]   It's just a matter of principle.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.800]   I don't like to use application enhancers, where unless I have--
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.600]   I like it so much, and I rely on it so much that unless this
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.880]   is on every Mac that I ever encounter,
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.200]   I'll be using a friends Mac or someone else's office.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.680]   And suddenly I'm lost, because all of a sudden command
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.200]   option shift control, tilde, escape, L,
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.320]   doesn't relaunch everything and answer on my email for me.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   See, I think that that's like punishing yourself
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.880]   for the times that you won't have access to this.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.200]   I couldn't live without it.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.160]   And I've switched from Quicksilver to launch bar.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.320]   You can still use Quicksilver.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.040]   It's just not getting updated as much.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.360]   And there are some things launch bar won't do,
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.040]   but I have to say it's pretty good.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.640]   And it does that text thing we were talking before the show.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.520]   Yeah, you can select the-- well, you can select text or files,
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.200]   and then use a thing called Instant Send,
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.680]   where you can then send that selection to interlaunch bar,
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.560]   and then do an action.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.360]   So the action could be--
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.040]   the some simple actions are already built in,
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.240]   such as change the color label of the file to a certain color,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.440]   or you can--
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   one I like is to select a piece of text, which is a URL.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:51.240]   It's not formed properly.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.000]   And then send that to launch bar.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.280]   Just hit the option key.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.280]   And it will send that interlaunch bar, hit the return key,
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.800]   and it will actually load it into Safari
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.000]   and treat it as a proper URL, and then take it to the website.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.200]   So there's lots of real simple integration with Safari
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.680]   and with web services that--
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.600]   that's the bit that I really like, to be honest.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.920]   It speeds up browsing considerably.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.800]   Yeah, I know you like services, Andy, and Snow Leopard.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.080]   And it does support service integration, right?
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   Yeah, you can search for-- again, you
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.720]   can send a file or a piece of text interlaunch bar,
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.080]   and then you can hit an action key to bring these services down.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.120]   Yeah, and you can search for services and do things like that.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.480]   So yeah, it's got service integration.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.320]   It's got integration with iTunes integration with iPhoto.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.160]   So it really exposes all the data on your Mac
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.960]   and gives you very simple keystrokes that enable you
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.480]   to access them very, very easily.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.120]   The thing that made Quicksilver so great
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.960]   is that this plugin architecture was, I guess,
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.800]   fairly easy to write a plugin for your application.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.120]   So there were dozens and dozens of plugins.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.640]   And launch bar, it's kind of--
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.360]   I mean, but you can do Apple scripting.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:54.880]   So--
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.240]   Yeah, yeah, you can do Apple Script.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.520]   And there's a section on the forum
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.320]   where people have submitted scripts.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.360]   So the scripts for time is the scripts for integration
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.280]   with Twitter.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.160]   If you want to do tweets directly from launch bar,
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.840]   that's very simple to do.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.360]   All sorts of scripts in there.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.240]   Of course, you can write your own scripts as well,
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.000]   if you're quite inclined.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.500]   Right.
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.160]   So I like that.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:12.440]   There you go.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.400]   I like scriptability.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.320]   Top of the news, we talked last week
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.600]   about the iPhone Rick role, the Australian only iPhone
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.280]   hack that required that you jailbreak your phone,
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.040]   that you install SSH, that you neglect to change the SSH.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.840]   The root password.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.160]   And then you would get a Rick Astley wallpaper.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.720]   Well, according to the download squad,
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.360]   the exploit used by this worm called the IKE worm
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.200]   is being used now to steal personal data
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.520]   from effective devices.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.240]   So it's got a little bit more serious.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.040]   Bad guys, I guess, got a hold of the technique.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.160]   Best thing to do is simply type--
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.960]   if you've installed SSH on a jailbroken iPhone
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.520]   type SSH from your computer, you could do this,
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.680]   if the iPhone's on the network.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:10.240]   SSH root at the iPhone's IP address, root at iPhone's IP
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.720]   address.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.680]   The default password is Alpine.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.440]   I think with the capital A, but try both.
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.200]   And once you're connected, type password, P-A-S-S-W-D.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.240]   No OR, type P-A-S-S-W-D.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.800]   And it'll prompt you for a new password.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.280]   And that's the one you remember.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.920]   And the hack doesn't work anymore.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.200]   It can't be too widespread given.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.000]   Yeah, I mean, it reminded me of--
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.200]   there's a joke from the "King of the Hills" show
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.800]   where these two guys have this big disagreement.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.160]   And the more violent of the two says,
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.360]   I challenge you to a fight.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.960]   Hold my left arm like this.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.640]   Hold my right wrist like that.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.360]   And hold your left leg slightly backward.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.240]   But you got to hold me by the risk or the thing I'm
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.280]   going to do to you won't work.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.520]   It's like pull my finger.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.680]   I mean, it's like you have to be a nitwit to fall for the thing.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.080]   It is lowercase Alpine.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.720]   OK, lowercase Alpine.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.240]   Anyway.
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.520]   But the only real danger here is that if this exploit is out
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.960]   there, the only thing that is keeping it from becoming
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.240]   a real problem for the rest of the community
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.160]   is that one LEGO piece that requires the volunteer effort
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.320]   of the owner of the iPhone.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.160]   So if they were able to figure out, well,
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.840]   how do we get root access without requiring a jailbroken phone?
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.280]   Because remember that password is still default pretty much
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:31.800]   everywhere.
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:34.080]   It's OK for it to be default because you can't access it
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.400]   unless you've broken the phone.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.840]   But maybe for all we know, there's
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.080]   a scheme out there to secretly jailbreak a phone
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:43.320]   without the owner's note.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.880]   So--
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.400]   I don't have to do that though.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.400]   I would have thought.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.600]   Is it still seeing Mr. jailbreak?
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.000]   I haven't got to bring a phone for a while.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.360]   It's easy to do if you have the right software
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.280]   and the intent to do it.
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:59.480]   It's-- I don't see how it could be circumvented though.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.440]   I don't see how it could be done to your phone
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.640]   by the way that the only way that this sort of thing could
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.880]   work, where a Trojan horse, where there's a 99 cent
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.800]   or for free application, that secretly jailbreak's
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.240]   your phone installs SSH and starts to do mischief.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.840]   I mean, this is such a non-story.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.800]   It's an end of the news segment.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.600]   And on the lighter side, it looks like Rick Rule.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.480]   Well, speaking of the lighter side--
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.400]   I was more amused by--
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.080]   there was a tech segment that I saw a few days ago in which they
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.600]   had a stock image of the iPhone, like a consumer space.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.840]   Purchases were really in digital cameras.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.000]   Oh, and high tech things like consumer cameras.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.240]   And of course, you see the smile of the art director
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.120]   because the screenshot on the iPhone
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.920]   is of the iTunes application, and it's
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.120]   playing a Rick Astley album.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   Oh.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:51.880]   Oh.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.360]   Very subtle.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:53.880]   No comment.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   No, nothing.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:55.880]   It was a joke that nobody there got.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.800]   Subtle Rick Rowling.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:02.440]   I think that could be the new daytime sport.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.880]   See how sneakily you can get Rick Astley in.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.960]   I wonder if I can get a Rick Astley into this week's screen
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.640]   cast online.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.120]   Make it an Easter egg.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.920]   Look, can you see Rick Astley in the latest screen cast online?
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.040]   Well, I was going to do an Easter egg for the ground control
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.800]   to make you dance from last week when
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.000]   we had the problems with the Skype.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.880]   So I was going to put a David Babbel track in,
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.880]   but I might not mention the fact that ground control to me,
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.280]   Jadon.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.360]   That was kind of funny.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:37.000]   Microsoft stores-- thanks to fake Steve at fakesteve.net,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.600]   the fake Steve blog for passing along.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.200]   This fabulous video of Microsoft store employees
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.680]   breaking out into song.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:51.200]   I am a snorner, juicy, not the bad.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.880]   This is so sad.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:58.760]   Apparently, this is something that they stage
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.200]   on a regular basis.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.720]   Oh, dear.
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.200]   Trying to get that Apple feeling.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:04.920]   Oh, look at--
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.920]   Oh, god.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:05.920]   Oh, god.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.200]   They even got a dance.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:19.360]   They really should have used Rick Astley.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.360]   Oh.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.200]   Talk about getting hired away some of the managers
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.680]   from the Apple store program.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.000]   It looks like they hired away some of the managers from Ben
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.360]   again.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:30.360]   This guy has a lot of flair on.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.840]   Exactly.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   He can get written up.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.200]   He's only got four pieces of flair.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.640]   Oh, dear.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.320]   Oh, no.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.600]   Oh, this is-- oh, dear.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.520]   Oh, dear.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.880]   Fake Steve has a few messages for these fellows.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.160]   First, Mr. Blue, the guy in the blue shirt.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.000]   Some people in the store need to move up
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.520]   to a larger shirt size.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.600]   M. Mr. Yellow did on the shirt size,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.680]   but also trying not to look like you're being forced
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.200]   to do this at gunpoint.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:27:00.520]   It's supposed to be spontaneous expression of pure glee.
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.600]   Remember what we talked about in rehearsal?
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.280]   And then finally, Best Buy is hiring.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.000]   They don't make you dance.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.200]   Think about it.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.080]   Oh, dear.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.160]   Oh, I kind of have to feel for this.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.520]   They're tweeting--
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.080]   it reminds me of a galaxy quest, the film,
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.760]   where the alien and the human are making out,
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.640]   and the guy goes, stop right.
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.480]   That's just not right.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.960]   That's not right.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.840]   It's clearly they're trying to-- oh, now they're
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.440]   going back to work.
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.640]   It was just like a flash mob, isn't that funny?
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.560]   Isn't that so amusing?
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.120]   Thank you.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.160]   I had to have this fix on my lunch hour,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.520]   and I wasted five minutes.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:38.840]   Now I have to go to the bank.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.520]   Thank you.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.000]   They're still going.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.120]   This is four minutes and 44 seconds of pure pain.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.480]   There's just no atmosphere, is that?
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.840]   There's just no--
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.120]   it looks that.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.320]   It looks really--
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.280]   They're really trying to get the Apple store
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.800]   spontaneous excitement going.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.560]   Some companies should not be allowed to have whiteboards
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.160]   because they brainstorm.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.520]   They write ideas like this on it,
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.000]   and the longer it stays up on the board,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.840]   the more sense it seems to make.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.160]   It's like a play.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.200]   The gun on the wall and the first act
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.560]   has to go off by the third act.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.840]   Well, it really did make me--
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.080]   I was at a play once where there was the big dramatic,
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.200]   like, encore of the final number.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.480]   Like, the play is over.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.480]   It was a musical.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.040]   And so they'd say, when they were rehearsing,
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.480]   obviously, they thought, as a big treat for the audience,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.680]   we'll reprieve the big number from the show,
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.280]   because they're going to want more.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.720]   They're going to want more.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.040]   And then so we're--
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.560]   imagine, like, 600 people in this theater just saying,
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.040]   oh, I suppose it would be rude to leave, so OK.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.600]   We want to sing it.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.480]   We have to watch this again one more time.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:48.960]   Take it.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.160]   There is music playing there.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:50.680]   There's music.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   Oh, there.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.680]   You know, this is what happens when you're
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.000]   compelled to whistle Windows 7 day in, day out.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.280]   That's a brainstem injury.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:04.960]   That's not--
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.200]   Well, it goes on too long.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.400]   I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.320]   And notice the people in the store are clearly painfully
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.160]   embarrassed by it.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.160]   I mean, it's--
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:12.920]   Exactly.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.960]   The customers are actually turning away.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:17.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.280]   They just-- oh, god, this is so bad.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:20.880]   There's no glee.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.640]   There's no joy.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.600]   There's no excitement.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.160]   It's just--
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.040]   Dead soulless eyes of the damned.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.840]   Oh, dear.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.880]   I shouldn't have eaten that pork sandwich on Friday.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.560]   Somebody saw a video of a flash mob
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.200]   and said, wouldn't it be fun to do this with the employees
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.560]   in the Microsoft store?
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.360]   And now you see the result.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.800]   If you go to fakesteve.net, you two can watch this yourself.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.200]   I don't need this kind of edgy out of the box thinking.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.240]   Because, you know, we can't market the way
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.640]   that your dad might have marketed, sir.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.000]   It's a new world out there.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.960]   We have to take advantage of social networking.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:03.800]   Damn, I got a Russian new Microsoft store soon.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.320]   Look at all the fun.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.120]   See, the next thing should be like, if we should have,
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.960]   like, lookouts there, just--
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.440]   we could crowdsource this.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.880]   I bet they have-- you know that this isn't spontaneous,
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.160]   that it's like, today, we'll be doing it at 107, 225.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.560]   So we need to be able to get people out there timing these
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.000]   to predict when it's going to happen.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.360]   Everybody just basically just be there as normal people.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.440]   Then when they start dancing, take out little ping pong
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.120]   of all shaguns.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.800]   It's like, start shooting at them.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.000]   Like, duck shooting.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.760]   Just-- no, just-- no, no one will get hurt.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.520]   But, you know, if they want to try to amuse us,
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.720]   let them amuse us.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.680]   Web 1205 says, stop bashing Microsoft.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.800]   They are still the market leader.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.760]   No, they're not.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.840]   They're-- they're-- they're--
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.720]   this is-- there has to be some sort of a Bernie made off thing
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.800]   happening that we don't know about,
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.960]   because this is not the act of a confident company that thinks
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.880]   that they have their future in their own hands.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.440]   This is--
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.560]   Oh, dear.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.800]   Have they opened any most stores yet?
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.560]   Or is that still just the only one?
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.760]   That's a good question.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.120]   They have--
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.320]   They're not being very aggressive opening stores.
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:08.720]   Meanwhile, Apple says they're going
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:14.440]   to open dozens of stores next year, 50 new stores.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.560]   The retail strategy-- you know, and I say this every time,
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.160]   I was very skeptical when Apple said we're going to do stores.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:21.920]   The gateway stores had just closed,
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.840]   and Sony was struggling with his Metron store here
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.160]   in San Francisco.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.040]   And it's been huge for them.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.080]   They sold a lot of product.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.040]   It's brought new people in.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.920]   They've opened four stores now in Manhattan.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.560]   They just opened a new one on the Upper West Side.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.760]   They have six stores in Arizona.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.440]   They have two shops in Shanghai.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.000]   They have London and Paris and 50 new stores coming.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:47.680]   I heard that there's about 25 stores in the UK alone now,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.600]   which is incredible.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   I just--
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.160]   Is there one in the--
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.680]   Is there one in the--
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.200]   Yes, there is one in the-- and then you
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.480]   retail complex called Liverpool One.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.120]   And we have, I think, two in Manchester.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.600]   So, you know, there's quite a few--
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.920]   Most of the large cities now are starting to get Apple stores.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.560]   So it sounds--
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.080]   That's great.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:04.960]   That's good.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.040]   Very aggressive over here.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:10.760]   I want to talk-- I just opened yesterday and installed
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.200]   in a 27-inch iMac.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.320]   And I have a little mini review to give you
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.960]   also some early benchmark numbers
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.640]   from the unofficial Apple web blog.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.720]   But before we do that, I do want to talk about our friends
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.280]   that go to meeting.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:26.640]   The Citrix folks work so hard to create a great product for you.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.200]   And they're asking, why?
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.320]   Why haven't you tried this?
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.400]   We're working so hard here to create the ultimate online
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.200]   meeting software.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.360]   We all have meetings.
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.680]   I mean, surely you have meetings that you have to go to.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.040]   You don't want to jump in your car
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.000]   and drive two hours for 15-minute meeting.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.520]   You don't want to fly across the country,
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.320]   as I did last year, for a one-hour meeting.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.640]   That's nuts.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.320]   When you can have meetings right from your desk
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.800]   using go to meeting.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.680]   It's just as if you're in the room with the people
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.600]   you're meeting with.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.440]   It saves you time.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.120]   It saves you money.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.000]   You'll get more done.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.160]   And it's so easy to use.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.840]   In fact, I want you to try it free right now.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.600]   For the next 30 days, unlimited meetings free,
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.080]   go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.160]   This works on the Mac and the PC.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.200]   Your Metis can be using either platform.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.560]   Works really, really well.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.560]   There's a quick little stub you download.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.200]   This is important.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.680]   You can't make-- if you're going to meet with a client,
[00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.640]   for instance, pitch on something, you can't make them jump
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.080]   through hoops to meet with you.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.600]   They're doing you a favor.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.960]   So in fact, this is very easy for them.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.600]   You could send them an invitation ahead of time.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.480]   It's integrated without look on Windows.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.760]   I don't think there's integration with entourage on the Mac.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:36.600]   But it's very easy.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.160]   Just get a link and you send it.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.880]   Get a meeting ID and you send it.
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.040]   Or actually, yeah, you can do it from the website.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.360]   Or you can do it while you're on the phone with them.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.600]   And this comes, by the way, with free phone
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.200]   conferencing, free voice over the internet.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.760]   So you're on the phone with them.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.680]   And you say, look, I want you to go to meeting.com, say,
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.320]   join a meeting.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.200]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:55.880]   And now they're seeing your screen.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.040]   I mean, it's really fast, really easy.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.440]   Great for sales, great for product demos, for training,
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.360]   collaboration.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.280]   And for $49 a month, as many meetings as you want,
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.040]   as long as you want, including phone and voice over the internet.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.160]   Try it right now for 30 days, absolutely free.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:16.000]   Go to go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.600]   These poor guys have been slaving.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.720]   They've been working so hard to make go to meeting better.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.760]   And you still haven't tried it.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:24.920]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.640]   Do you think the guilt will work?
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:30.680]   This will pass on the guilt.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.840]   So I opened the 27-inch.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.760]   I ordered it.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.200]   I ordered this was the top of the line.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   The i7, I put eight gigs of RAM in this.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.480]   I put a terabyte hard drive in it.
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.840]   It still was only around $2,000.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.960]   It was very reasonably priced.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.520]   And this thing is spectacular.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:54.000]   Now I have a 30-inch screen, but there's something about a 27-inch iMac.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:54.960]   Have you guys seen it yet?
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.320]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.960]   Yes, I had a look in the store.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.440]   So I've had a bit of a play with it.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.920]   But they do look really nice.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.080]   They look fantastic.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.760]   The thing I'm waiting for though is the 27-inch monitors.
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.600]   Come on.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.200]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:09.680]   No kidding.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:14.280]   I got the i7 processor in it, which is a quad core with--
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.480]   hyperthreaded, so it's eight processors.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.480]   It's a donation to the high school
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.880]   that we're building a podcast studio.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.400]   And they want to use logic.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.920]   And they want to have-- record as many as 16 tracks.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.360]   So I wanted the horsepower, so it wouldn't bog down.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.560]   And I probably overdid it a little bit.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.760]   In fact, I'm looking now at the benchmarks from Mac rumors,
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.280]   I guess.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.520]   And boy, is this thing-- this is as fast, pretty much as the Mac
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.600]   Pro.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.280]   Just spectacular.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.800]   They ran it through Geekbench.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:54.320]   And if you look at the i5--
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.160]   this is the blue bar, if you look at on the video, is the i5.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.840]   Then the green bar is the i7.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.280]   Then a core 2 iMac.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.800]   And the core-- you see how much faster the i7 is?
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.080]   That's 64.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.760]   Yeah, big jump, even over the i5.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:18.680]   The Mac Pro in the Geekbench 2 benchmark result, 64-bit.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:22.520]   The Xeon-based Mac Pro with two CPUs, 8 cores, plus hyper
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:29.960]   threading, is getting 16,985 compared to 9,638
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.720]   for the i7 iMac.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.320]   So still, if you get the top of the line,
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.480]   fastest Mac Pro, you're going to beat it.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.400]   But interestingly, if you don't get the top of the line,
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.320]   if you get the single CPU Xeon Mac Pro,
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.920]   it's almost exactly the same as the i7.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.440]   So you're getting-- this is a fast machine.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.600]   And beautiful.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.120]   Just the design is gorgeous.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.640]   I played with the magic mouse.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.920]   What do you guys think of the magic mouse?
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.440]   Well, unfortunately, with me, the honeymoon is over.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.040]   I'm afraid.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.640]   You are raving over it.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.160]   Are you?
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.000]   I know, I know.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.280]   But I used it for a week or so.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.720]   I mean, don't get me wrong.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.320]   It's a beautiful, beautiful mouse.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.120]   The scrolling is the thing that sold me on it originally,
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.280]   because I came from the MX Revolution.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.240]   And the weighted scrolling is something I really wanted.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.520]   And it works fantastically on the magic mouse.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.960]   But I had a few issues.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.280]   Tracking starts to do the thing.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.600]   Just to describe it, it's just like the iPhone.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.920]   And the mouse itself is kind of squarish.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.360]   And so it has a surface.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.880]   And you can scroll by single finger stroking the surface.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.680]   And you say, wait it.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.520]   It has momentum.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.080]   It's ballistic just like the iPhone.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.400]   And that works fantastically.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.280]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.680]   No issues with that.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.880]   There's also the two finger sideways swipe as well,
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.600]   so that you can scroll backwards and forwards.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.720]   And you can also use the downward scroll
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.680]   with the control key to zoom into the screen.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.560]   And that side of it, the touch side works fantastically.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.160]   But I started to have lots of people
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.760]   having problems with tracking.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.360]   And they wouldn't track fast enough.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.240]   So with large monitor, you couldn't track right
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.560]   across the screen.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.640]   Now, I didn't have that problem.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.120]   But I transpired that I'd been using Steer Mouse, which
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.220]   is a third-party mouse utility with my other mouse,
[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.380]   and that solved that problem for me.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.020]   But other people have started to use, I think,
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.380]   called Mouse Zoom, or MZoom to get on the tracking problem.
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.940]   Because even with the Magic Mouse,
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.740]   with its maximum tracking speed, it still
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.820]   wouldn't traverse across a large monitor in one go.
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.180]   People were--
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.500]   That's frustrating.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.060]   So there was that issue.
[00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:32.620]   But that didn't really affect me.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:34.700]   But I did start to have a few problems of it skipping
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.980]   and jumping and not being as accurate as it had been originally.
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.380]   And then it was then I discovered
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.420]   that there was some debris actually
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:44.660]   had become caught in the lens underneath.
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.300]   So I was able to resolve that by cleaning the lens.
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:51.580]   But that was only after a lesson, a week's worth of use.
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.540]   And then the thing that really put me off
[00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.980]   was I started to have drop connections on my Mac Pro.
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.820]   The day after I had the tracking problems,
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:01.620]   it dropped the connection, the Bluetooth connection,
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.940]   four times.
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.460]   And the battery was 60%.
[00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.460]   So it wasn't a low battery at all.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.820]   And that really spooked it for me.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.780]   So I started to look at alternatives.
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:15.420]   In fact, someone suggested an alternative
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.580]   to me, which was to use one of these bamboo track pads.
[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.620]   I even raving about the bamboo now.
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.980]   This is the new thing from Intuos.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:24.540]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.940]   Well, the funny thing was when I first got the Magic Mouse,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:29.180]   I sort of did do a blog post or I've tweeted
[00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.900]   that I wished that the top, the mouse itself,
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.100]   was actually a trackpad.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:36.220]   Because I'm so used to the trackpad on my Mac Pro,
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.260]   that it would be nice to use it as a proper trackpad
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.980]   and not just as a mouse and never thought anything of it.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.060]   And then when I sort of mentioned my problems
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.940]   with the Magic Mouse, someone said,
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.980]   well, why don't you check out these bamboo?
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:53.180]   They do a touch and pen version of the Wacam bamboo touch pads
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.340]   now.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.820]   So not only are they sort of pen driven,
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.300]   the traditional pen driven tablets,
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.100]   but they also have touch features now.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.260]   So you can actually use them as a mouse replacement
[00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.300]   and just use swipes and scrolls and pinches
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.540]   to replace a mouse.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:12.380]   And yeah, I got one and I've been very impressed with it.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:15.220]   Yeah, I was a little surprised that the Magic Mouse didn't do
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.060]   the pinching.
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.300]   Yeah, I don't know if there's still going to be--
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.940]   there's obviously a scope for firmware updates.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.620]   So it could just be a software thing.
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:25.100]   Possibly.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.700]   But the thing is, with the mouse,
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.500]   because you're always continually touching it,
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:31.300]   I think it might be difficult to have a multi-touch gesture
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:31.820]   in the mouse.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.500]   Because when you put your hand on it,
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.220]   if you put three fingers down, you're
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.780]   going to invoke a gesture.
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.980]   So not too sure.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.940]   It's probably something they could do in the firmware.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.140]   But whether or not they will actually go down that route,
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.060]   I wouldn't put it in to begin with.
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.460]   I mean, they didn't with the touch pads.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.860]   They gradually brought on additional gestures
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:52.180]   as they updated the touch pad models in the MacBooks.
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:54.660]   Have you tried-- Andy, have you tried the Magic Mouse?
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.420]   Do you have a opinion on that?
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.700]   Only briefly, Apple hasn't sent me one,
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.580]   and they haven't found time to actually email and ask for one.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.220]   I was going to buy one until I tried it,
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.620]   and then I thought, no.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:07.980]   I went to the Apple Store, and so all I can relate
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:09.460]   is first impressions.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:12.580]   And it's that, once again, a mouse
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:15.740]   has to be the most simple, absolutely rock-steady thing
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.340]   that to you, the point of advice that you have,
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:22.140]   that you like the idea of innovation.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.460]   You like the idea of pushing things forward.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:27.980]   But in the end, it has to be a nonexistent interface
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:29.860]   between your brain and the mouse pointer.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.620]   Yeah, I'm with you.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:34.020]   I'm not sure that the Magic Mouse is it.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.100]   But again, that's only after 20 minutes worth it.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.780]   Another thing has changed is--
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.860]   and I don't think I ordered--
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.020]   I think I ordered a stock.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.020]   It comes the littlest keyboard you heard.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:46.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.340]   Is that the-- it's Bluetooth, and it doesn't
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.620]   have the numeric keypad.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:55.060]   So it's essentially the thin aluminum keyboard
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:56.780]   that Apple's been doing all along.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.020]   Cut off the keypad and all that stuff.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.500]   I don't know.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.020]   There you go.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:01.740]   That's the one there.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:02.340]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:03.180]   It's so tiny.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.180]   It's teeny-weeny.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.700]   It's little.
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.020]   Oh, that's a good name.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:07.380]   There we go.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:07.900]   That's it.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:08.420]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.300]   It's just a-- it's very much like the laptop keyboard.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.860]   It's, in fact, it feels like the laptop keyboard just
[00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.260]   in a separate--
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:17.340]   I don't even even need closure.
[00:42:17.340 --> 00:42:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.940]   I like the keyboard a lot.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.860]   I bought the USB version a while ago, just as a travel
[00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:24.180]   keyboard for when I want.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.340]   I'm with a notebook, and I just want something--
[00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:27.940]   a notebook or a netbook, and I just
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.340]   want something with full stroke.
[00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.820]   Or if I'm giving a presentation,
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.580]   and I can't necessarily be standing
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.060]   at the dead center behind the screen,
[00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:35.740]   it's a lovely travel keyboard.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.140]   It really is.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.940]   It's a-- I was kind of shocked.
[00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:43.100]   It took me a little while to get used to it,
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.940]   going from a full-size Apple keyboard.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:46.660]   I kept hitting the wrong keys.
[00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.620]   But it is-- for what I was doing,
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.780]   it was actually a great little studio keyboard.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:53.020]   And because it was wireless, you have this big screen,
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.740]   and you could put it over to the side,
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.740]   and you have a little-- and then sit in front of the mixer
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.660]   with a little wireless keyboard.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.420]   It actually was a perfect design.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.300]   Is that going to be--
[00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.140]   is that the standard Apple keyboard going forward now?
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.380]   I think so, yeah.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.140]   I think so.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:07.980]   Just looking against the MacBook Pro,
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:11.500]   it is actually the exact match to the MacBook Pro.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.660]   And I've actually started to use this on my MacBook Pro,
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.620]   so that I'm trying to learn different key combinations.
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.340]   So I use the small keyboard on the MacBook Pro,
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:21.580]   and it matches exactly the MacBook Pro as well.
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:24.900]   So once I've retrained a few muscle memory,
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.740]   especially the function key down in the bottom left-hand
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.140]   corner is a bit of a pain.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:31.940]   But I'm trying to coax myself to stop using that
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.900]   as a control key, and to unset on that, it should be fine.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.860]   So if you get it wired, and you can still get it wired,
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.860]   you can get it full-sized wired.
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.700]   Yeah, this is the wired one.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.140]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.980]   So they have a little wired one.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.700]   Yeah, this is USB-wide.
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.180]   Yeah, USB mini keyboard.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.620]   Wow.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.620]   Yeah, it was kind of-- especially with a 27-inch Mac,
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:51.820]   which is so huge.
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.380]   This is a little teeny keyboard.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.420]   It really does.
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:56.900]   You can practically mount that on that strip of space
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.980]   underneath the screen, and turn it to a sort of like a touch
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:01.580]   computer.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.340]   Oh, it's just beautiful.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:06.180]   And that size is almost too big.
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:06.820]   I mean, it's--
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.820]   Yeah, that's enormous.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.380]   I'm sorry to say that now I'm sort of like overcome
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.220]   with the idea of getting that iMac.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:16.860]   It would work even with this iMac 20-inch iMac here.
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.740]   Put, again, this Velcro, the mini keyboard
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.860]   underneath the screen on one side.
[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:21.700]   So you dabble it.
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:24.500]   And bamboo touch on the other side, and just like, hang on the wall.
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.780]   Just walk up to it just to do--
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:29.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:31.700]   Well, that is the one, isn't it, that's the TV
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:35.700]   with the mini DisplayPort in.
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:38.180]   I wonder if John Iave has looked into Velcro
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:41.140]   as a designer study.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.460]   So both of you sound like you're familiar with the bamboo.
[00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.780]   And I saw Don's tweets, and I thought, maybe I should get it.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.860]   Is it smaller than the old graph fire?
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:50.140]   I mean, is it--
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:52.300]   They do two different sizes.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.660]   They do a small one, which is just the bamboo
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:56.500]   touch and pen.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.180]   And then they do the bamboo touch and pen fun, which
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.060]   is in two sizes, which is a small one and a medium size one.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.020]   Let's see if I can drag this across without breaking everything.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.860]   But this is the fun one that I got.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.580]   I know people on the podcast can't hear it.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:15.220]   But it's roughly slightly longer than the mini keyboard.
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.900]   It's got an enormous trackpad on the front.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:17.780]   So if you see that--
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:20.740]   It does take up some space.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:21.580]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.620]   But again, another reason for using the mini keyboard,
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.900]   because it just sits right next to the mini keyboard
[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.260]   and really doesn't take much more space.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.500]   So the two together is probably, yeah, it's probably kind of sort of--
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.380]   And do you use this instead of a mouse now,
[00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:34.500]   or do you still use a mouse?
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.180]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:36.100]   And that's too fair.
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.140]   I've only been using it for a couple of days.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.300]   But yeah, I've sort of switched off the magic.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.500]   I've been trying to use this completely as a mouse
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.260]   replacement.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.620]   The only thing I can see might be a problem for me--
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:48.900]   actually, I did blog post about this today,
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.300]   but you have to get used to a different ergonomic setup,
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.380]   because with the mouse, your hand is always
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.500]   rested on the mouse.
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.940]   But as you use the touch, you can use certain hovers
[00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:00.980]   above the touchpad.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.100]   So if you're going to be doing that for a long time,
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:04.100]   that's a good thing.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:06.300]   Yeah, it just needs to rest my hand a bit more than I normally
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.340]   would, perhaps.
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.500]   But functionality works really well.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.700]   Had one slide that issue with accuracy
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.380]   when selecting text.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:15.540]   Then I started to use the pen.
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.460]   I used to use the pen ages ago, but it never properly
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:20.260]   matched my monitor setup at the time.
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:23.020]   But this particular one does my monitor setup perfectly,
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.340]   so I can actually use the pens one to go across.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:26.500]   I have three monitors.
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.020]   I can go right across all three monitors
[00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.380]   with a single pen stroke.
[00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:30.060]   That's really good.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:34.580]   I wonder why Apple hasn't put out a--
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.780]   and there are a number of aftermarket keyboards
[00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.340]   that have a little touchpad.
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.580]   But wouldn't it be nice if they put the glass touchpad that
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:44.300]   comes on the MacBook Pro at the bottom of a keyboard?
[00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.740]   You wouldn't need a mouse.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:47.620]   And I like the touch interface.
[00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.420]   And I like the glass feeling, actually.
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.980]   I've really come to like that clickpad on the MacBook Pro.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:56.620]   Maybe they should make a combined device that does that.
[00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.860]   Yeah, I would think that it'd be for a place to see the--
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:00.700]   you might add.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:01.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.540]   Sorry, Andy.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.260]   Oh, no.
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.060]   I was just going to say that it makes
[00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:07.180]   me-- my reaction to the glass touchpad
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.860]   makes me a little bit humble about my initial reaction
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.980]   to the Magic Mouse, because I absolutely hated it at first.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.580]   Because the trackpad with a mechanical button underneath it
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.740]   was so hardwired into my system software
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.420]   that it was so hard to get around it.
[00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.860]   But as soon as I made that logical break and moved on,
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.620]   it became so natural.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.140]   I'm not sure what it would do, though,
[00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.220]   to the balance and the size of the keyboard.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:36.420]   I mean, we're used to things like this Logitech keyboard,
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.100]   where you really don't have much room at the bottom
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.020]   to play with.
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:42.460]   And so what happens when you set up your desk so
[00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.580]   that you have this--
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:45.100]   instead of being this long, now it's
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.460]   going to have to be this long.
[00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:49.020]   And then if you have the trackpad here,
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.900]   where do you put your palm?
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:53.780]   The last thing is that I do regularly
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.140]   get emails from readers and friends who
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.660]   think that their Mac is acting up.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:03.260]   I keep turning on expose, but it keeps getting in and out of it.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.740]   Well, no, it's not broken.
[00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.060]   It's just that your hand keeps touching the trackpad somewhere.
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.580]   How do I turn that off?
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.260]   What version of the US do you have?
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:11.340]   Oh, you really can't.
[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:14.500]   Well, you can switch some of it off, and not all of it.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:15.940]   That one's frustrating.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.900]   That was another thing with the bamboo in that--
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:19.700]   so you don't have a separate button.
[00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.580]   So I had the bottom corner of the screen for Expo Day,
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:26.180]   but with the bamboo, there's four programmable keys down the side.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.940]   So you can program with the exposé or for spaces or whatever.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:31.620]   So that works out pretty well.
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.500]   And there's also the whole area of the technology within OS 10,
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.020]   which I've never really explored properly.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.020]   So now that I've got the pen device,
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.220]   I could have an experiment with some of the technologies
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:42.980]   in there as well.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:44.220]   You know, I love the--
[00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:47.060]   I love the-- just now, I mean, I'm preparing something.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.980]   I'm going to be on TV on this weekend,
[00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:51.580]   so I'm trying to get loans of certain products
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.340]   at the last minute.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.900]   So if you saw me like a minute ago,
[00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.180]   sort of like looking down, looking down, looking down,
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.980]   it's because I'm trying to get this loan agreement signed
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:48:58.780]   and sent off.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:01.100]   And of course, as usual, I had to print this out,
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.300]   and then--
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.620]   Oh, there are two sheets.
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.620]   --then find it.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:08.020]   And then, whereas if I don't really need a graphics tablet,
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:09.860]   because I don't edit graphics that way,
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.580]   but I would love to have just a simple tablet where
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:13.980]   if I just need to do a signature or just need
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.580]   to check off some boxes or write a note,
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:17.180]   I would be up for that so quickly.
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.540]   That would be great with a maybe preview interface
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.700]   so that you could use preview, you could click the boxes.
[00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:25.980]   You can make Adobe--
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.460]   Distiller will let you make forms that you can do that with.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.220]   I don't think-- I don't know if Preview supports it.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.500]   You know, I just have--
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.140]   don't tell anybody-- a TIFF file with my signature
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.420]   that I did once on a tablet.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.260]   And I just paste that onto forms all the time,
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:40.700]   and nobody says anything.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:42.700]   I'm pretty terrified of that sort of thing.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.980]   Your signature's so perfect every time, exactly the same.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.220]   One other thing I saw when I was in the Apple store--
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.220]   Thanks for cosigning that car alone, by the way.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.020]   I'm enjoying my new SQL aid.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.940]   You know, it's true.
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.900]   I mean, that's probably-- I should be encrypting that file,
[00:49:58.900 --> 00:49:59.620]   shouldn't I?
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.100]   Oh, well.
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.540]   One other thing I saw when I was in the Apple store yesterday,
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.820]   they finally did get rid of those handheld--
[00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:09.660]   I don't know if they were Windows CE or Windows Mobile
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.620]   devices.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:13.060]   But now, when we talked about this a couple of weeks ago,
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.260]   they've moved to the iPod Touch.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.820]   They did it a couple of days ago.
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:17.980]   It has a little extra holder.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:23.300]   It looks like one of, in fact, one of those FastMac battery
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:26.300]   cases for the iPod Touch.
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:27.140]   That's thicker.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.820]   It's got a card scanner, card reader in it.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:32.340]   And it's got a little barcode thing on it.
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:36.180]   So they took the software, and they point the iPod touch at it
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:36.900]   and scan it.
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.420]   It's got a little red light comes out.
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:39.220]   They do the whole thing.
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:42.540]   It looks like a standard iPhone application,
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.100]   all the stuff's in there.
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.700]   And then they had a little bit of an issue,
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.420]   because, of course, the iPod Touch has a capacitance screen,
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.580]   and they need me to sign, right?
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.580]   So he gives me this stylus.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:55.100]   It's a very strange looking stylus.
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.140]   At one end is the normal tip.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.700]   And at the other end, it looks like there's
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.060]   like a little puff ball at the other end.
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:03.500]   And so I try to sign with a tip.
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.100]   And of course, it doesn't sign, because it's
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.420]   a capacitance screen.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.980]   You have to use your fingertip, right?
[00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:09.420]   He says, no, use the other end.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.180]   He says, sign with a puff ball.
[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.660]   He said, yeah, it's like this black puff ball.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.220]   And it signs perfectly.
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:16.780]   It's a conductive--
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:21.140]   I think it's aluminum little ball at the end of this aluminum
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:21.740]   stylus.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:25.740]   So it's capacitive.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.900]   So you can actually sign with it.
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.820]   So they had some interesting engineering problems.
[00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.540]   They had a sign, but it works beautifully.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:31.780]   Well, that's a standard product.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:33.220]   There are a couple of different companies
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.700]   that make pens like that.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.420]   The touch interface is great, but people quickly realize
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.180]   that if you're using an outdoors in the winter,
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.020]   you have to take off a glove in order to make it work.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:42.520]   Right.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.540]   On my counter right now, there's
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.460]   two different-- it's coming up to winter,
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.060]   so different companies have sent me
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:49.020]   different sets of special gloves that
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.740]   will work with the iPhone and touch-based capacitance,
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.740]   touch-screen devices.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.340]   In fact, it looks like one of our chatroom people
[00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:02.060]   said, Pogo Sketch from 10oneDesign.com,
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.260]   T-E-N-O-N-E Design.com.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.660]   It's $15, and it's exactly what it looked like.
[00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.660]   The guy handed me.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:13.060]   It's got this little funny little capacitive puff ball on it.
[00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:14.060]   See, it just shows you.
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.300]   I guess I'm out of touch.
[00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:16.660]   But that's--
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:19.620]   Hey, I enjoy the feel.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:20.420]   Get it.
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:21.220]   Get it.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:21.660]   I got it.
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:22.300]   I appreciate it.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:22.780]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:23.740]   I'm glad somebody got it.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:24.300]   All right.
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.060]   Another thing Apple's doing, supposedly-- and this is a rumor--
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:31.980]   is releasing their concierge app from the Genius Bar.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:35.300]   That's the things that you use to sign up
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.340]   for your appointment at the Genius Bar.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.460]   Apple Insider is reporting Apple released the app
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:46.460]   so that you can use your iPhone, or I guess your Wi-Fi
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.620]   enabled iPod Touch, to schedule your appointments
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.580]   with the Genius Bar and one-to-one, monitor your place
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.380]   in line.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.500]   They ought to make that-- I would presume they would make that free.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.900]   That's kind of neat.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.740]   Wonder what that will do to the weights at the Genius Bar
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:05.220]   is, though, because if you make it that easy to make
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.420]   an appointment, is someone going to say, ah, dang it?
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:08.940]   Why is it-- why is it?
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:10.620]   Why am I looking at the spinning beach ball cursor?
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:12.060]   All this making an appointment for later today.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.740]   Open up fixed, and then not really think about, oh, I should
[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:16.980]   go back on and turn that off.
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:18.140]   That'd be interesting.
[00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:20.580]   Did you know about this one-to-one, this new thing where
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:23.180]   they give you one-to-one training set up?
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:23.660]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.100]   That's cool.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.940]   That's in the Apple stores.
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:31.860]   See, again, no dancing.
[00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.580]   Mind you, I have heard that although it's one-to-one,
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:36.220]   sometimes I did one many.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:36.660]   Oh, really?
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:38.580]   The one-to-one can you think?
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:41.500]   It can be for 3P there as well.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:47.540]   Apple has apparently leaked, or the leak somewhere
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.940]   according to Boyjournis report.
[00:53:48.940 --> 00:53:51.420]   They're really getting good at getting these--
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:53.700]   picking up these leaks.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.500]   The Boyjournis report says, "Apple's Black Friday
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.340]   Deals Are Out."
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.180]   It's an image that somebody sent BGR.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:04.180]   It says, "One of our connects just hit us up
[00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:06.260]   with some intriguing Apple information.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:10.700]   This is a shot of Apple's yearly Black Friday deals."
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:11.900]   Have you looked at it?
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.420]   I have to say, it does not look like a fake Photoshop.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:17.780]   It looks pretty accurate.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:21.060]   And it's got an Apple swirling in the snow.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:26.300]   And the prices, which it says are good only on Friday,
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.220]   November 27.
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:29.500]   This would be in the US, Don, because you don't have Thanksgiving,
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.220]   I guess.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:31.980]   You don't have Black Friday.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:39.180]   Up to 30% off all iPods, up to 25% off all Macs,
[00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:42.740]   up to 15% off all accessories, Apple software,
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:43.740]   and Apple hardware.
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.260]   That's pretty good discounting.
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:50.740]   I don't remember them doing this kind of discounting before.
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:51.460]   You don't believe it?
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.900]   You don't buy it?
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:55.140]   I'm not actively disbelieving it,
[00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:58.540]   but that's pretty aggressive and unprecedented.
[00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:04.620]   I guess the word up to is the pregnant one,
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:06.380]   where if they simply say, "Here are two models
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:07.300]   that aren't moving.
[00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:08.900]   We'll do 30% off this one, and it'll
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:12.100]   be just a very conservative 5% off of everything else."
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.260]   I can sort of believe that.
[00:55:14.260 --> 00:55:18.140]   Also, I'm not sure that this is--
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.780]   there's something about the design of the ad
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.940]   that doesn't scream to me, this is an Apple design.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.380]   Does it look like Apple do you?
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:25.420]   It looks like a very, very good design.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.420]   There's something about the aesthetic of this
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:28.940]   that doesn't say this was in-house,
[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:30.340]   but that's just a guess.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:32.220]   I honestly have no idea.
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.580]   And when I say that I don't necessarily believe it,
[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:35.980]   it's not that I disbelieve it.
[00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.500]   It's that there's nothing--
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.700]   there's no slam dunk here.
[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:40.540]   Right.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.180]   There are huge discounts.
[00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.100]   Up to is a unfortunate fudge word,
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:46.900]   because it means it could be nothing.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:50.340]   But the fact that you can get 25% off any Mac,
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.980]   unless they have few e-Macs.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.780]   (laughs)
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:58.780]   Up to 25% off all Macs is really kind of inconsistent.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:02.140]   Right?
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:02.980]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:07.100]   And maybe it means if you buy $2,000 worth of Macs.
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:08.300]   I don't know.
[00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:09.740]   Yeah, it's suspicious.
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:10.580]   No.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.420]   But even though we don't have Black Friday,
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.580]   they did actually do a date sale.
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.580]   I seem to remember last year after Black Friday,
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:16.940]   because we don't have it in the UK.
[00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.100]   I think they did do a special day.
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:19.940]   Don't know what they called it,
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.940]   or what justification they used for it.
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:23.780]   But it was pretty soon after Black Friday
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:25.940]   that it's something similar over here in the UK,
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:26.940]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.980]   You also notice that they're excluding the iPhone
[00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:33.500]   and the iPod shuffle from 3% off all iPods.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:34.780]   Yeah, which is weird.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:36.380]   So even though they could just simply say,
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:39.820]   okay, how about, we'll take two bucks off of a shuffle.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.300]   It's interesting because there are local state
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:45.380]   consumer laws that define how you can define an item
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.700]   as being on sale that actually sets a certain minimum.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.900]   There was one of my favorite stories
[00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:55.900]   of consumer vigilance was a new governor fired at the end.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.780]   It was very, very pro-business, shall we say,
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.860]   and fired all of the consumer watchdogs
[00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.180]   that worked for the state to enforce all the laws.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:04.380]   And so I think with Circuit City,
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.500]   had an advertisement saying,
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:08.220]   every single item is on sale this week.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.260]   And if it's not on sale, you get it free.
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.900]   And so this guy who'd recently been laid off,
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:15.820]   who knew every single Massachusetts law inside and out,
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:17.740]   went through there with a little pocket calculator
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:18.740]   and went through and said,
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:20.980]   okay, I'll take that big screen TV
[00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:23.020]   and that new $2,000 camcorder
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:25.500]   and that $800 digital camera and this and this,
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.780]   $10,000 for the stuff,
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.460]   maxed out his credit card, made the purchase,
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:31.180]   took the receipt, put it in his pocket,
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.180]   and said, okay, I'd like to see your manager.
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.660]   There will be no charge on any of these
[00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:38.220]   because the discounts do not need the legal minimum
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:39.740]   defined by the master of the state law.
[00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:40.820]   None of these things were on sale,
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.060]   so therefore I'm getting them for free
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:43.260]   and they had to give them to them for free.
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:44.540]   - Wow, good deal.
[00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:47.180]   If that happens again.
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:50.020]   - So that might be why we're seeing a little bit
[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.900]   of the dodginess in this language here.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.340]   Because if this is real,
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:56.780]   it would be to cover the idea that they don't know
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:00.820]   that Nebraska, they can't advertise every iPod on sale
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:04.100]   unless they can guarantee a 10% or a 5%.
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.500]   - Yeah, that would make sense.
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:06.340]   - Well, we'll just have to--
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.340]   - In-store gift wrapping, what do you think
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:08.940]   the wrapping paper they're gonna use is?
[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:10.740]   And would the Junius Bar include,
[00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:13.060]   like if I bring a scarf for my on,
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.900]   they wrap it like an apple gift wrapping paper?
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:18.540]   - I don't think so.
[00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:23.980]   - All right, well anyway, that would,
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.060]   it's Hope Springs Eternal in the human heart.
[00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.540]   Of course, since I did just buy a new iMac,
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.940]   it's gonna make a good time for Apple
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.420]   to do pretty big discounts.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:33.260]   - There you go.
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:34.700]   (laughing)
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:36.620]   - You know, why not save 25%?
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.180]   Why not, you know?
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.980]   'Cause I just bought something.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.460]   - You leave the ports national subsidy.
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:43.300]   - Yeah.
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:44.460]   (laughing)
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:46.540]   We're so fat off of a little little reports,
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.340]   Mike, that we're gonna give some of it back to everybody else.
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.180]   - There you go.
[00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:52.460]   Leo keeps spending money like he's going insane.
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.700]   Hey, let's take a little bit of a break
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.540]   when we come back.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.380]   Our picks of the week,
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.340]   but right now our audio book pick of the week,
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:59.940]   our friends at Audible sponsor the show,
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:02.660]   and they have for many, many years now
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:03.940]   since we first started the show
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.100]   on the right after the Great War.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:09.860]   And we still have many books to talk about.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.460]   In fact, somebody asked me,
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:13.020]   do you read every book you recommend?
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.300]   And I said, well, I have been reading Audible books
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:16.780]   since 2001.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.100]   I have read well over 300 books,
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:21.900]   but we recommend so many books on the show
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.660]   that we long ago ran out of stuff that I've read.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:27.020]   So I often recommend books that I haven't read
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:29.020]   or I am about to read.
[00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.660]   Although I have to say there's some great stuff in here
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:33.980]   that I can't wait to read.
[00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.900]   Maybe I'll, let me see what Andy Inako has up his sleeve
[00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.060]   'cause he usually has a pretty good recommendation or two.
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:40.580]   What do you got for us this week?
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:42.140]   - Well, I'm still listening to
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:43.700]   the Sammy Davis Jr. biography.
[00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:44.540]   So I'm not quite through exactly.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:45.940]   - That's really long.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.140]   - That's really, really long.
[00:59:47.140 --> 00:59:49.620]   But I have picked out the next book
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:53.020]   that I am so totally going to have to be
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.180]   getting as audio book.
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.020]   - Okay.
[00:59:55.020 --> 00:59:58.580]   - And I think rather than simply brought it out the name,
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.580]   there's actually a line of description on this book,
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:05.140]   the title page for this book in audible.com.
[01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:07.260]   But I think we'll just basically sell you on this,
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:09.580]   especially if I do it in the movie trailer voice.
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.100]   (laughing)
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.580]   - Throughout history,
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.700]   from the bone crushing age of antiquity
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.020]   to the sack tearing modern era,
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.140]   there have been larger than life ass kickers
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:23.700]   with a natural talent for unleashing their epic bloodlust
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:25.620]   on anyone who crossed them.
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:28.780]   They built empires, smashed armies,
[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:32.140]   and ravaged civilizations for wealth, glory,
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.220]   and ultimate supremacy.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.620]   Sometimes villains, sometimes heroes,
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.660]   sometimes criminally insane.
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:42.060]   They all had one thing in common.
[01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:44.860]   They were all badass.
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.180]   - Baddas.
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.860]   - Doo doo doo doo.
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:50.060]   That's the name of the book, The Baddas.
[01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.900]   - I'm Ben Thompson.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.300]   It is a collection of stories
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.740]   of some of the biggest Baddas' from history.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.660]   - That's unbelievable.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.740]   Peter Francisco, an unsung hero of the American Revolution,
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.340]   this powerful giant battled a British
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:04.820]   with a massive five foot long broadsword.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.980]   (laughing)
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.860]   A couple of fearless Gurka who won the Victoria Cross
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.860]   by clearing out six Japanese foxholes
[01:01:11.860 --> 01:01:13.180]   with nothing more than grenades,
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:15.100]   a bayonet and a knife from Jagzland
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.580]   to the great to George S. Patton
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.220]   from Genghis Conde Bruce Lee.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.300]   This pantheon of ass kicking awesome lists
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:22.500]   should inspire you to quit your stupid job
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.060]   and time head first into a new career
[01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:27.100]   as a professional badass.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.380]   - What a great book.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.220]   How did you find such a great book?
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.300]   - Directed by Melvin Van People.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.140]   Sorry.
[01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:35.380]   (laughing)
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:37.380]   - This looks really fun, bad.
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.620]   And obviously, you know, told with a little bit of a sense
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.900]   of humor, I mean, I'm just curious.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:43.300]   I might listen to a little bit of the audio.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.620]   - I listened to the audio and it delivers.
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:47.020]   - It's bad.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:47.860]   Let me see.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.180]   This is one of the nice things about audio.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.540]   - Genghis Conde.
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.060]   1162 to 1227.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:57.100]   The greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy,
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.500]   to drive him before you,
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.940]   to see his cities reduced to ashes,
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.740]   to see those who love him shrouded in tears
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.020]   and to gather into your bosom, his wives and daughters.
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:10.020]   First came the refugees.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:10.860]   - Oh dear.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.700]   (laughing)
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.460]   - I think that if you're going in for your annual
[01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.940]   like performance review, like you want to ask for raids,
[01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:17.940]   just sit in the car for an hour and listen to this.
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.020]   - At ass.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:19.980]   (laughing)
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.820]   - This is great.
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:22.700]   And, you know, I just love Audible
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:23.860]   'cause you can listen ahead of time.
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.380]   You can get an idea what the book sounds like.
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.580]   They have the best narrators.
[01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.060]   They are great at books like this one.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.940]   Just came out a couple of days ago.
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.060]   It is normally 1995.
[01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:36.580]   You can get it absolutely free by going to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.780]   You'll sign up for the gold account,
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:39.780]   which is really the best, great deal.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:42.020]   You know, you pay a monthly subscription,
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:43.260]   you get a book a month,
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.380]   always greatly discounted from the retail prices.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.020]   And it's just, I tell you, it's wonderful.
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:51.980]   Highly recommended.
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.500]   But even if you decide not to stick around,
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:54.860]   you get to keep badass.
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:55.700]   (laughing)
[01:02:55.700 --> 01:02:58.860]   Free, because we wouldn't, we really are too afraid
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.660]   to take it away from you actually.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.660]   Go to audible.com/macbreak, sign up today.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.140]   By the way, it's a great partner with Ford Sync
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:08.900]   because when I'm listening to my book,
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.900]   I get in the car and I can listen to my book,
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.420]   I get out of the car, it remembers where I was.
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:14.460]   I mean, it's just wonderful.
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:19.460]   AudibleAUDIBLE.com/macbreak.
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:21.500]   I know you've heard us talk about it before.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.980]   Maybe that was the time to give Audible a try.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:27.700]   Now it's time for our picks of the week.
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:30.980]   And I'm gonna start, I think with you, Mr. Don McAllister.
[01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:32.900]   You're the friendly visitor.
[01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:34.580]   - Please, it's really gonna be that.
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.820]   I'm gonna start, so go on then, there you go.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:40.220]   - No, no, I haven't started in many, many moons.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.380]   - And you know why I'm a gent, I'm a good host.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:46.340]   In case any of you pick a thing that I was gonna pick,
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.380]   I wanna be able to go to Plan B.
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:49.940]   - Right, fair enough.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.620]   Well, this week I'm gonna do an iPhone application.
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.660]   I don't think I've ever done an iPhone application.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.300]   And full disclosure, I actually know the guy
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.540]   who developed this application,
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:00.580]   but that's not only bearing on why I'm doing it as a pick.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.700]   I was quite impressed with its novelty value.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.980]   It's an application called Bloons.
[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:06.820]   I don't know if you've seen it.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:08.860]   I thought it was featured as a staff favorite
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.580]   on the iTunes store today or yesterday.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.740]   It's a very simple concept.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:15.980]   What it is, it's a fun thing, it's for entertainment.
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.460]   And it allows you to publish,
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:22.340]   run the publish, to launch Bloons from your iPhone.
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:23.900]   - What is Bloons?
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.300]   - And yeah, Bloons, hedoninbloons,
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.180]   Bloons, the float in the-- - Oh, Bloons.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.460]   - Bloons, sorry, is that my accent?
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.700]   - No, no, no, I just wasn't, I thought you said Bloons.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.860]   Bloons, ah.
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:38.580]   Well, how could you launch Bloons from an iPhone?
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.740]   - Well, what happens is it's a very cartoon,
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.420]   really nicely animated application
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:46.140]   with clouds and skies and things.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:48.540]   And what happens is you launch a Bloon.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.500]   And that then goes off into the ether
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.900]   once you've launched a Bloon.
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.820]   And when you launch a Bloon, you can type a message,
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.180]   you can attach a message to the Bloon
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.260]   and also a photo.
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.100]   So you can take a photo with your iPhone camera.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.300]   - Is this it, 'cause there's two Bloons games?
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.500]   - It's, BloonsApp.com is the actual website.
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:06.980]   - All right, just go to the website.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:09.180]   So this is a different one, all right, let me find it.
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.900]   - Yeah, so you attach your message,
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.780]   you attach your photo, you launch your Bloon
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.780]   and it goes off into the ether
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:15.420]   and then you just leave it for a couple of hours,
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:16.740]   and then you can go back.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.500]   And you can track your Bloon to see where it's gone
[01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.020]   and who's actually picked it up.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.300]   'Cause as well as launching Bloons,
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.300]   you can also catch Bloons.
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:25.820]   So you can catch Bloons from people
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.540]   at some Bloons from other places.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:28.980]   - So they're going over the network,
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.340]   they're not the virtual Bloons.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:31.500]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, the virtual Bloons
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.140]   going out into cyberspace.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.060]   So you can catch a Bloon and when you catch a Bloon,
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:37.260]   you can see the original message
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.100]   and the original photo that was posted.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.260]   But then you can also see other people
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.540]   who've picked up the Bloon as well.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:44.140]   So they add additional messages and additional photos.
[01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:46.980]   And so they can go from the UK to Germany to Holland
[01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:49.860]   and back again and over to the States.
[01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:52.540]   And people are starting to do themed Bloon launches.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:55.340]   So they'll might take a photo of the Cuddly Toy
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:58.100]   and the next person who gets the Bloon
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:00.820]   will then add a message with a message
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:02.300]   and a photo of the Cuddly Toy.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.940]   And eventually you get a string of messages
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:05.860]   that you can flick through and see where it's been
[01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:07.300]   and what people have written.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.300]   And it's, when I first heard of it,
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.460]   I thought, okay, you know, that's slightly unusual.
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.380]   But it's quite addictive once you actually do start
[01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:16.260]   using it and it's really well put together.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.060]   It's very simple, very elegantly put together.
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.620]   And it's just a fun really.
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:22.180]   So you can, if you've got a spare five minutes,
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.540]   you can go and catch a few Bloons,
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.420]   have a look at the messages,
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.100]   send messages back off to people.
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:29.980]   And it's a little bit like Twitter,
[01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.420]   but sort of more fun.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.100]   It's more, it's more lightweight.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.140]   - And it's not public, right?
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.260]   I mean, it's just one on one.
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:37.740]   - Well, anyone, it depends.
[01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:39.460]   It's random when you pick up a Bloon,
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.940]   it can be from anyone.
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:45.380]   So it's algorithms that they've built into the application
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.860]   and the backend servers that sort of group things together.
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.780]   So there's someone catches it in Germany.
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:53.020]   The next Bloon catch will actually be in, you know,
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:53.860]   somewhere near to that,
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:56.500]   depending on the time it was from when it was last over.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.020]   - Oh, so you can see how many others have caught it.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:06:59.860]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:01.220]   So you can, there you go.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:02.580]   See that's a demonstration on this way.
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.140]   It's flicking through the different messages
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:05.900]   and seeing the different pictures.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:07.340]   So it's- - Well, that was really neat.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:10.780]   - It's surprisingly addictive.
[01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.900]   You know, it's not meant to be a serious application.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.380]   - Now I see there's a light version and a full version.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:16.700]   What is the difference?
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.260]   - Right, not too sure, to be honest,
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:19.980]   because I just went with the full version.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.460]   So presumably the light version,
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.940]   does it say on the website?
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.260]   Does it give you some feet-
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:25.100]   - Yeah, it does, let's see.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:25.940]   - The Bloon launches or something, yeah.
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:29.020]   - Let's see, one moment please, launching the store.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.340]   Okay, the application,
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:36.980]   Bloon's light, scan the sky.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:40.220]   Bloon's doesn't say what, you know,
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.860]   they should be more clear on what you get
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.860]   when you buy more.
[01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.700]   I don't know.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:49.540]   So you can either be for free.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.180]   - Yeah, so it's probably just a trial.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.700]   - Yeah, or you can be professional balloons, which is $2.99.
[01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:58.900]   I don't know why.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.820]   Let's see, maybe it'll say here.
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:02.420]   - Yeah, different system balloons.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:04.660]   - The full version of balloons has a balloon tracker,
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.940]   which allows you to see where each one of your balloons,
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.180]   has flown to, who has caught them,
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:10.780]   and what photos and messages they've left.
[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:12.420]   Well, say you would want that.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:15.460]   More balloon types, including cuddly animal balloons.
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:16.540]   - Yeah, so you can pick your balloons
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:17.700]   when you actually launch a balloon.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:18.940]   - And no advertisements.
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:20.500]   - Right, so there's that version there as well.
[01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.340]   - Yeah.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.340]   - Oh, I think spend the $2.99.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.340]   (laughing)
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:27.020]   - It really is interesting, yeah.
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.340]   - Yes.
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.180]   - It was very strange.
[01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:31.420]   The first Bloon sort of trial I caught
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.300]   was obviously people were trying it in front of the TV.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.980]   So the first Bloon to the trial
[01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:37.860]   was lots of photos of people's feet while it was.
[01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.140]   (laughing)
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:42.140]   Someone took a photo of their foot and sent off a balloon,
[01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:43.860]   and then the next person was obviously sitting
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:45.420]   in front of the TV and did the same thing.
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:47.900]   So we're gonna do it with like five or six
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.500]   pictures of people's feet.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.020]   Now eventually the Bloon does burst or gets popped,
[01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.860]   but there's no limit to the number of balloons
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:55.180]   you can send out or the number of balloons
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:56.500]   that you catch as well.
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:57.860]   And you can track your own balloons.
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.900]   So once you've launched a balloon,
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:01.580]   you can then keep an eye and see where it goes
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.420]   to the time it gets.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.860]   - If you buy the full version.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.340]   - If you buy the full version.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.180]   - Yeah.
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:07.020]   - Well I'm gonna buy it right now,
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.900]   but there's no way I could send you a balloon.
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:10.580]   - No, it's random.
[01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:11.780]   So it just goes off.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.220]   Because when you launch a balloon,
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.740]   you've got no control over where it goes.
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.540]   - It's like a real balloon.
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:18.380]   - Yeah.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:19.220]   - Wow.
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:20.060]   - Neat.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:20.900]   Great pick.
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:21.980]   Thank you very much, Don McAllister.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:24.540]   Andy and Naco, your pick of the week.
[01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:27.020]   - My pick of the week is a book.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:30.660]   One of my favorite web comics and has nothing to do
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:33.300]   with the fact that's Mac related is Apple Geeks,
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:36.060]   which you can get to at applegeeks.com.
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.460]   Really great, fantastic artwork.
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:41.540]   Every week there's gonna be some sort of image in that strip
[01:09:41.540 --> 01:09:44.380]   that you just can't believe is done as a web comic.
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:47.340]   That's what, if you look at the screencast right now,
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:50.300]   the team, the writing in our team
[01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:52.820]   does two sort of parallel strips.
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:55.620]   The Apple Geeks light, which is like black and white
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.140]   four panel strip, but then on the right hand side,
[01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.740]   you'll see like full color, full painted comic pages.
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:04.460]   And so Apple Geeks is going to give this away.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.300]   I mean, that's incredible.
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.940]   - Yeah, I mean, it's the first time I came across it,
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.180]   I thought, okay, so they worked together
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:11.580]   and produced a 22-page comic
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.980]   and they never were able to sell it,
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.420]   but it's a good portfolio piece.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:16.540]   So they just simply post a different page every day
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.260]   from this comic that they did for once,
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:19.860]   but no, it's an ongoing thing.
[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:21.820]   It's so much work and so well done.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.980]   - Look at this, yeah.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.580]   - The page you're seeing there is atypical
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:27.900]   because it's a, but it demonstrates part of what I like
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.900]   about it.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.820]   The guy in the black bandana, his name is Hawk,
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:34.260]   and he is such an Apple fan zombie.
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.220]   You would not believe it.
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.660]   There's an Apple Geeks volume two,
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.660]   there's a whole sequence in which they're in line
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.900]   to go to the Apple store to buy a tiger on the first day.
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.620]   And they make Hawk go and they make,
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.620]   they'll let Hawk come,
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:49.060]   but only if he walks around in a giant hamster ball
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.980]   so that he can't just like buy everything
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.900]   and interfere with everything
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:54.740]   'cause he's just gonna be drooling against the plastic.
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:56.580]   And he's also, he's also a super genius
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:59.620]   and he builds himself an android by the name of Eve
[01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:00.860]   because he's such an Apple fan.
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.700]   Eve runs Macintosh system software
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.580]   and uses Apple technology.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.820]   And so now they've just set her up with spam filters.
[01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:10.980]   And so she sees the world in terms of it.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.580]   There's a door-to-door salesman
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:15.180]   and she blocks the spam in a very aggressive way
[01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:16.860]   that is quite amusing to anybody.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:19.300]   - This is great, I'm really enjoying this.
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.860]   - It's great stuff.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.260]   It's the second volume.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:24.220]   It's much better than the first only
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.460]   because they've been at it for so much longer.
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.020]   They have a much tighter handle
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.780]   on who all these characters are.
[01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:32.060]   And they're much more tight
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.740]   into the rhythm of producing this comic.
[01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:38.180]   And my copy came about three or four weeks ago
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.140]   and it was, oh, okay, clear out.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.820]   I guess this column will not be done in the next three hours
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:47.220]   because as much as you enjoy these pages coming in
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.500]   on the schedule that come in,
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.660]   of course, when you get to sit down
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:52.300]   and just read the entire story in sequence
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:53.980]   in one sitting, it's that much better.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:57.300]   And again, the artwork really speaks for itself.
[01:11:57.300 --> 01:11:58.860]   The writing's fantastic too.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.100]   The first thing you notice is the artwork
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:03.860]   and you can't believe that this is what you normally,
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.180]   you normally associate web comics
[01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:07.900]   with not that level of quality and it's just fantastic.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:09.140]   - Really great.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.500]   That's applegeeks.com.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:15.100]   My pick is actually something that you could use
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.020]   on Windows or even Linux should you desire it.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:20.420]   I was looking at this, it came
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.420]   because I was on my Windows machine
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.900]   and I was looking for something that was the equivalent
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:28.100]   of the incredible CODA from Panic Software,
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:30.700]   which is a really fantastic,
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:35.700]   it's web editing tool that has FTP built in
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:40.220]   and understands CSS and understands a lot of languages
[01:12:40.220 --> 01:12:42.300]   and it's really sweet but there's nothing
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.980]   that I could find where I was looking for something similar
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:46.340]   to it on the Windows side.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:51.340]   And I found a Aptana, APTANA Studio for Windows
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:54.500]   but it turns out it's not just for Windows
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.580]   because it's written in Java, it is for Mac and Linux as well.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:00.180]   And in fact, it works a little bit better, I must say,
[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:02.900]   on the Macintosh than it does on Windows.
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:05.220]   I've had a little trouble getting it to work on Windows
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:08.380]   but it's absolutely free, which I kind of like.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.940]   So if you're looking for an alternative to CODA,
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:14.940]   which is not free, Aptana.org
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:20.420]   and it's kind of the classic IDE for editing a website.
[01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.220]   It understands JavaScript, understands PHP,
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:25.780]   you can modify the text, you can upload it,
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:30.780]   it's got built in FTP, SFTP, SSH,
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:34.980]   it supports Ruby on Rails, you can use it in Eclipse
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:37.460]   if you want but you can also use it,
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.900]   stay in alone and that's how I'm using it.
[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:44.660]   Lots of plugins available, it's a really impressive program
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:48.420]   and absolutely free and I presume open source as well.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.660]   Aptana, APTANA Studio, it'd be for anybody
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:55.500]   who's doing web design, it supports JavaScript,
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:58.100]   for instance, it supports Ruby on Rails
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.460]   and these things are hard to do because usually
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:02.460]   you need a web server running to kind of see
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.100]   what your code's gonna do but it also is handy
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.220]   for people like me who just, I just wanted to go to my website
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.020]   and change some of the text in the HTML pages
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.660]   and I didn't want to open up something like Dreamweaver.
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:16.540]   This is really fantastic.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.860]   Really, I would say very close to Dreamweaver actually,
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:22.420]   Aptana.org.
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:25.460]   And a gentleman that concludes this edition
[01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:27.460]   of Mac Break Weekly, we are,
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:29.180]   are we nominated in the podcast awards?
[01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:30.940]   I don't think so.
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.780]   I think that was an oversight by the,
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.740]   I bought that gown for nothing.
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:35.820]   (laughing)
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.180]   You're not going to be aware of it again this time.
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.300]   - Already sweated into it, they can't return it.
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:42.500]   - But there are quite, I don't want to know
[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:43.820]   how you sweated into it.
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:44.940]   There are quite a few,
[01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:49.020]   that's what shows in the voting for people's choice
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:52.100]   for technology, even for comedy with Daily Giz was.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.300]   So I do encourage you to go and vote for your favorite
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.420]   podcasts, whatever they may be, at podcastawards.com
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:58.620]   we're not hurt.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.020]   It's okay, we can take it.
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:02.860]   We'll survive.
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.120]   (laughing)
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.500]   Of course there is a great podcast which was nominated.
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.340]   You were nominated, right?
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.900]   Screencast's online.
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.460]   - No, I was last year but I asked a bit,
[01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:14.380]   I didn't remind anybody.
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.740]   - You have to tell people about it.
[01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:17.620]   - Yeah, I think you do, yes.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:18.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.820]   - But as you say, I'll survive.
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.740]   We can both cry together.
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:23.900]   - Last year's nominee.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:26.220]   Still worth going to see, especially if you're interested
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.140]   in launch bar, the new screencast for launch bar,
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:31.220]   it's at Don McAllister's Screencast's online,
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:34.020]   at screencastsonline.com.
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.220]   Thank you so much for being here, Don.
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.060]   We really appreciate it.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:38.140]   - No, I thank you for inviting me anytime.
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:39.140]   Oh, just one of the things as well,
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.820]   there's a new YouTube channel as well.
[01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:44.460]   So I've started to move some of my screencasts across to YouTube.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:47.100]   So if you want to see some shorter screencasts,
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:51.540]   if they go to YouTube.com/screencastsonline,
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:53.620]   you can see some stuff over there as well.
[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.460]   - So you'd never put them on YouTube before?
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:58.740]   - I put, well, the problem is some of the,
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:00.380]   some of the older stuff's gone on to YouTube,
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.740]   but the problem with screencast is
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:04.580]   you really need a high definition.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:06.260]   It needs to be, you know.
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:07.100]   - Of course.
[01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.340]   - So what I've done, you can see there,
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:09.420]   there are three players now.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.020]   I've done some video comments up there,
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.380]   and then I'm doing some screencasts,
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:16.940]   which are in full 720p high definition.
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:19.660]   - You know, they're going to start doing 1080p too.
[01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:20.820]   - Oh, they are, yeah.
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:21.660]   - Yeah.
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.460]   - Some trailers, but there's also mini clips,
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:24.300]   what I call mini clips.
[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.660]   I think there's only about three or four of them now,
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:27.780]   but I'll be putting more up over the coming weeks
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.860]   and free to download them.
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:31.380]   But they're in high definition,
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:32.540]   which is the important thing.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.660]   - Well, I just subscribe so I can see them.
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.500]   - Thank you very much.
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:36.340]   - That's great.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:39.140]   That's YouTube.com/screencastsonline.
[01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:40.180]   - Thank you for being here, Don.
[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.180]   I really appreciate it.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.180]   - Anytime, Leo, anytime.
[01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:43.260]   - Thank you, Andy Inaco.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.380]   He's in the Chicago Sun Times Technology Bureau,
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.940]   and also his website, cwob.com,
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:52.260]   joins us every week for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:54.820]   Hope all is well in the Notco household.
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:58.060]   - All is Skittles and beer.
[01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.220]   - That sounds good to me.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:01.500]   We'll see you next time, Andy and Don.
[01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:04.980]   And thanks also to Paul Kent from Macworld Expo,
[01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:06.500]   who joins us at the beginning of the show.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.460]   Don't forget, you're going to come
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:10.580]   to Macworld Expo right Don?
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.940]   - Oh yeah, I'm speaking at Macworld this year.
[01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:12.780]   - Can't miss that.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:13.820]   - Yeah, so I'll be there.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:14.660]   - Yeah.
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.580]   - I'm sure Andy, you're going to be there, right?
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:17.420]   - It's going to be there.
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:19.140]   We're going to fly out if you're not.
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.140]   And we'll be there, Bob, I'll be talking to you.
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:22.140]   - I said, I'm not going to be there.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:22.980]   - No.
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.620]   (laughing)
[01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:25.460]   - Damn it.
