[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.440]   Sort of from Apple.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.240]   Hey, Alex Lindsay from the office hours dot global, 090 media.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.680]   It is 18th hour of broadcasting today alone.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.160]   You missed it.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.960]   This morning we had we had Paul Terpstra from from Clover on and they make the
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.320]   parabolic mics that you that you see in football games.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.920]   Oh, it was an hour discussion about parabolic mics and how they work and what
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.840]   they do and how he got into it.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.000]   And it was it's it's something like this.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.840]   It's not like satellite dishes, but they're very directional, right?
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.640]   So they pick up a crowd noise or the crack of helmets against helmets, things like that.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.880]   Well, it's kind of the the the funny part of the story is is that there's most of
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.160]   the ones that you used to see were perfect, you know, parts of a sphere, a hemisphere, right?
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.400]   And they focused it, but they didn't focus very well.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.640]   You know, mathematically, they didn't, you know, and so Fox asked for for somebody
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.800]   to he talked about it, but Fox asked they said, Kate, someone that figured out
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.400]   if you make it parabolic, it'll focus more on the mic.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.240]   And they went to the mic owner and the people who make the thing called big years
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.080]   and they were like, no, we don't want to make him.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.520]   You know, the hemisphere works great.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.800]   And then he was like, I'll make one.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.000]   So he's good.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.960]   He's got a parabolic polar pattern plot for Sennheiser versus his own company, Clover.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.040]   Clearly, Clover is better.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.040]   No, just different.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.440]   It's just it's just showing that he was showing how, you know, what different
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.960]   frequencies those those plots are different.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.040]   And he said, most of those plots are like 16, you know, 16 kilohertz.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.280]   He goes, unless you're looking for birds, it doesn't really affect you.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.080]   So he's showing the different patterns in that area.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.640]   And he's actually doing his own his he's building his own patterns, like doing
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.160]   the check to figure it out.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.040]   That's cool.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.000]   That's how that's how nerdy it gets on office hours, office hours to global.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.800]   Andy and I coz here from WGBH in Boston.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.360]   Hey, Andy. Hello.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.520]   Now, Alex, I'm I realized I was looking at those polar plots
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.360]   by via thumbnail, but I really thought that the plot on the left was Squidward.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.040]   So maybe I'm just
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.640]   yes, Squidward.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.080]   It does look like Squidward.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.760]   I come to think of it.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.200]   OK, very good.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.440]   That's a that's a SpongeBob reference.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   That's good.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.680]   Also, thank you for the receipt.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.560]   OK, I don't know why I know that either to come to think of it.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.680]   Also with us, he's back after a two week absence.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.360]   Week one, he was playing show for a week two.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.920]   He was getting briefed week three.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   Renee Richie comes bearing gifts from YouTube.com/Renee Richie.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.800]   He's a streamer. I'm back, baby.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   Oh, my God.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.920]   He's got iPhones.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.760]   You tell you said the Apple sent you all four of them.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.440]   Yes, I have those.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.920]   That's the pro and the unless you think we're being bad, the embargo was lifted hours ago.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.960]   Right. So all the received one to reopen for for us here.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.560]   Oh, which one is that?
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.680]   That's the pro.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.840]   So this is the pro and there's no plastic this year.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.800]   So I don't know what all the ASMR people are going to do because there's no
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.440]   sprinkling.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.760]   But so the packaging is even more minimal.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.480]   You do get this.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.440]   You get there's of course there's no power adapter.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.680]   There's just the it's very scary cable.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.360]   And they do USB C instead of USB A because they figure everyone has USB A,
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.920]   but they might not have USB C.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.920]   I know some people are grumpy about that, but that was a logic.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.560]   Then you just have this giant sticker on the front that you can protect the glass.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.760]   We had our very own unboxing here on the show.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.400]   So that's the one you haven't played with, but I presume you've you've been messing
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.080]   with all the rest.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.120]   Yes. Well, I had to I had to do I had to do shoot video of it.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.720]   So I did take it out and like shoot a bunch of video and then I put it back
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.640]   because I still have to shoot an unboxing because it works and it works backwards.
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.000]   Sometimes.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.720]   Yeah, because yeah, that's right because all on the same YouTube video,
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.760]   you have to show the unboxing and beauty shots in slow mo.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.560]   Well, this year I ended up not showing the I this is really inside baseball,
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.880]   but I shot and edited a role for a 45 minute deep dive video.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.160]   Same as last year.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.320]   And then I had a very brief but very lovely chat with with Walt Mossberg.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.240]   And I channeled my Indiana my inner Andy and not code.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.360]   And I'm like, you could do a little bit more human this year, Renee.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.440]   If you put your nerdy glasses aside and think of the people,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.320]   you could actually do something that is a better service to them.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.080]   And then I scrapped it and I read it the whole thing.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.200]   That's that's what Walt Mossberg did.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.440]   And look what happened to him.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.720]   You know, I mean, consider who's bigger.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.600]   Mike has Brownlee or Walt Mossberg.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.520]   The fact that I force one of the one of the one of the one the busiest people I
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.360]   know into actually spending more time.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.000]   Perfect. You know, it was just you know,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.320]   I was well, I was probably putting new things through my new toaster oven
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.800]   just to see how good it would make cinnamon rolls.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.280]   I know I know I know Andy has a new toaster oven because he posted a picture
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.880]   of the sticker from the toaster oven put on his screen and said his five year old
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.840]   did it, which certainly got my attention.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.760]   There is no five year old inner five year old.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.920]   I had it's like it does your brain work this way?
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.000]   I'm not saying it should.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.680]   I'm just saying that I feel like it's the sticker,
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.920]   the display sticker that has like here's everything on the panel that would be
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.880]   lit the time timer baking modes.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.320]   So it's a cling sticker.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.720]   I peel it off and then my brain says, oh, you know, it'd be funny if we put this
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.440]   like on the screen of our laptop.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.680]   So yeah, that would be funny.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.480]   So like so what?
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.800]   So we're going to do that so we don't have no, no, let's do that.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.760]   And it's like I cannot move forward until I clear that that flag for my operating
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.320]   system that says we have done this stupid thing that just occurred to us.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.400]   And oh, well, it was the five year old within, however, Andrew just not have.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   If to be fair, it did look really cool.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.080]   And I'm kind of wishing that like that were an actual feature.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.200]   Like if they're if they were like if they were like Wi-Fi integration,
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.600]   there should be just like an actual hovering thing.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.120]   What you would be saying, I want to see, you know, toast, bagel, waffle, dual cook,
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.360]   bake, all these things.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.040]   I want to see them like in a dial format.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.000]   Come on, Apple.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Why isn't the MacBook Air toast bagels?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.040]   Come on.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:09.800]   And you know what?
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.760]   It's not as you can see, it was on my Chromebook.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:17.000]   So it's quite a part that it has has a has a cookie setting.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.280]   All right.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:18.920]   All right.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.400]   That's not that's not Apple related for
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.040]   news.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.960]   So yes, you're right.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.320]   At least I tried to make it.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:31.640]   Pointful, but I'm going to say right up front that after having I haven't seen the
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.680]   reviews yet because they just started coming out.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.160]   But after having looked at the specs of the iPhone and getting over the reality
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.640]   of the distortion field of last Tuesday's event, I elected not to buy one.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.040]   I just don't feel like it's I feel perfectly fine with my 12 pro max.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:56.000]   And I don't feel any inclination to can I say quickly that Brian Chen won the one
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.560]   the review competition today with the headline.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.640]   This is the most incremental upgrade ever.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.040]   I think that's fair.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.640]   I hated that review.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.440]   All right.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:04.840]   All right.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.880]   That's that's that's here for somebody who actually has.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.480]   I mean, I think if you see Neil, I trashing another review for being too
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.640]   cynical, then you know something's really going on there.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.640]   It is very incremental.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.640]   You can't deny that.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.320]   I mean, we're such peak iPhone or actually smartphone at this point.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.440]   There's not I mean, it's not like you could do a revolutionary new camera
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.720]   technology, right?
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:27.920]   No, I mean, there's a lot going on there.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.760]   Like they are.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.080]   Yeah, they're not early adopter.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.240]   They're not like racing parts of technology anymore.
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.840]   It's not like huge jumps every year.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.600]   They've become instead of like these amazing sci-fi things of our dreams,
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   they become utilities and tools, but the sort of upgrades that are going.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.720]   And I'll say this about Samsung too, because people people don't come
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.400]   on Netflix.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.840]   It's not exclusively Apple's prop.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.320]   And I've pushed back on that for everybody because I still think like
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.680]   we live in an age of wonders and we sort of take what we have for granted now.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.440]   But if you're just doing most people don't upgrade every year,
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.760]   they upgrade every three to four years.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.880]   So they get the sum total of all the upgrades.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.040]   And it's like a bakery where you might not buy French fresh bread every day,
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.520]   but you go in there, they just have to have fresh bread for you.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.480]   So Apple has to have a fresh phone every year because somebody's going to buy it.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.080]   But more than that, the stuff they're focusing on is like I even gave it to like
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.560]   Georgia is way more cynical than I am.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.720]   And she helped me with my video very kind of like every year.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.960]   And she's like, oh, it looks the same.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.440]   And then she's like, oh my God, macro photography.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.640]   And she just spent literally like an hour and a half.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.240]   I had to beg her to stop doing like macro video photos and slow mo.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.080]   And for some other people, it's the 120 Hertz refresh rate.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.600]   And I saw Peter McKinnon's video about the cinema,
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.640]   the cinematic mode where it does the rack focusing and he was just,
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.160]   he looked like a three year old just pressing the different buttons and watching
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.040]   the watching the camera rack focus between him and the person shooting with him
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.840]   where they did a pool game.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.680]   And so there are features that if you have very specific needs,
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.040]   requirements or just delight buttons that it'll absolutely hit for you.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.960]   Brian says the Apple iPhone 13 review, the most incremental upgrade ever.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.560]   The new iPhone 10 is 10% faster than the last one.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.440]   And the photos are slightly better in a word.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.080]   But I agree with you.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.360]   You can't play Apple Apple.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.160]   Apple's going to have to do it.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.040]   Well, he points out that the success was 70% faster than its predecessor.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.440]   So there've been years where they're big, big, big, but it's hard to do that now.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.880]   I would say that actually, I think the biggest you tell me,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.440]   but to me, the biggest selling point of this is battery life.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.040]   That it is. Yes.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.400]   Yeah. The battery.
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.840]   I didn't quite get it because I'm testing it and I'm playing a lot of Pokemon
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.920]   go, but like, and I'll lease the super interested in this part, but I'm still
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.200]   playing like two thirds of what they said.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.520]   And if I'm not playing Pokemon go or doing testing, I think I'm going to get two to
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.000]   three hours more just because I don't do a lot of I don't game a lot besides.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.480]   And that's on the on the max.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.000]   Yeah. So the one point, the one that needed it was the mini.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.480]   The one that really needed it was the mini because I have not I have never felt
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   like I didn't have enough battery life on the 12.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.840]   So like on mixed workloads, including 5G, you'll get about an hour and a half
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.080]   longer on the mini and on the pro and about it.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.800]   Two and a half hours on the regular 12 and the 12 pro, sorry, the regular 13
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.440]   and the 13 pro max, which is huge because the max already went more than a day for
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.840]   me. What's the sacrifice?
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.720]   It's a little bit heavier.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   Is it thicker?
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.440]   It's a little bit heavier.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:16.040]   A lot of people think they just made the battery bigger, which is really hard
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.560]   because batteries are heavy.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.120]   They're insulating and they mess with RF signals.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.320]   So you can't just pour unlimited battery in there because you just make a bigger
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.280]   battery to waste.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.440]   So a lot of it is the is the A15.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.400]   I know some people were upset.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.040]   It's 10. It's 10% faster.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.720]   But it's 10% faster with enormously more efficiency, especially in all the video
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.480]   pipelines, and then they also did a bunch of they do a lot of AI to try to figure
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.800]   out what you're going to do before you do it.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.880]   So there's a lot of software optimization.
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:48.160]   If you're going to spin this, the spin is Apple now controls the silicon that they
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.720]   have forever on the iPhone, but they control the silicon so they can make those
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.560]   kinds of decisions.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.760]   This year we're going to improve the speed.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.880]   I've never seen anybody complain about the speed of their iPhone, even a really,
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.720]   old iPhone.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.040]   We're going to improve the speed a little.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.720]   You know what people really like more battery life?
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.240]   We can we can optimize for that.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.920]   And I think that that's a real virtue.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.240]   The processor, the overhead is important because like this year, the iPhone SE
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.000]   and the iPhone 6S are still getting updates.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.800]   So you want a processor that's not just like if it's barely scrolling, OK, this year,
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.600]   it's probably not going to be great in three years.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.720]   But if it's doing all this heavy lifting now, like future, future,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.120]   definitely.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.600]   It's really close.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.120]   Yeah, it's a lot of future proofing.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.360]   But also we've seen with Intel that when you just goose frequencies,
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.640]   regardless of the thermal envelope, you can have a device that basically shuts
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:36.400]   down and Apple increased frequency while significantly increasing battery life,
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.440]   which is not normal in most devices.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.760]   And I think I think that if you had a I bought one,
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:44.680]   well, we knew you were going to buy one.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.480]   But but the but the camera, you know,
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.200]   actually because I want to review cinematic.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:55.400]   I'm going to wait for a while now because it's I waited 45 minutes,
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.920]   literally, I forgot it was that day and we were in after hours, you know,
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.280]   and I was and someone was like, I just I just went through this trouble.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.480]   I ordered it and they're all talking about their date.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.320]   Pacific and you had already done some.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.080]   You were already in after hours.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.760]   I was in that way because after I was runs 21 hours a day.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.120]   So so I go in, I go in and I go in about five.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.880]   I'm not allowed to talk and my house doesn't isn't very well insulated for sound.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.000]   And so you can hear my voice all over the house if I talk.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.760]   So I have an agreement not to talk until five thirty.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.360]   So so the so anyway, so the guy's.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360]   I might.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.480]   Everyone was everyone was buying buying them together on after hours at five.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:32.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.280]   Because there's people all over the world.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.760]   So there's some that wasn't early for the folks in the UK.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.880]   And so anyway, so people were talking about it.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.640]   And they're all talking about the fact that, you know, the store still has this
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.640]   problem where right in the first 10 minutes, it's just constant.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.840]   Like you get part way through and you get part way through and you get part way
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.920]   through anyway.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.480]   So they were talking about that and I was like, it's today.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.600]   I thought it was a week from now.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:59.480]   And then I quickly picked it up and 45 minutes in and I'm now like October six
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.160]   to 10, like that really in 45 minutes.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:02.880]   It was amazing.
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:08.080]   I ordered about 40 minutes in for Lisa and I was able to get delivery this Friday.
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.480]   But I did notice there were some apple pay issues.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.840]   It didn't at first take my apple pay and then it seems right.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.520]   And it might have been the one I got to because I got the like the max with the
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.640]   terabyte and you know, a thing and a thing.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.560]   I only got her five 12 gigs because the apple card bank fell down right.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.680]   I think that's what the problem was apple card because I said I bought it on apple
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.960]   pay and it spun and spun and spun it and backed out.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.440]   Then I did it again and said you've already bought it and it was very was not it.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.400]   But that's OK.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.880]   And yeah, and a lot of people trying to use this thing.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.200]   And for me, I'm constantly trying to figure out, you know, how far can we push
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   the cameras and how far what are we doing?
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.960]   So it's usually an easy, easy thing for me to look at.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.160]   I'm interested in the cinematic mode.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.240]   I don't think it's like a they talk about like filmmakers are going to like
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.680]   portrait, which is all done in software you pointed that out last week.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.400]   Yeah, you can see a little bit of softness, but getting that data, go ahead, go ahead.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.840]   No, I was going to say the there there's very little.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.600]   There's portrait mode just in terms of how it does the effect after it's not an
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.760]   optical rack focus. No, it's not optical, but it's it's really interesting.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.880]   What they're doing is as the frames come in, it's running the same sort of
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.000]   computational analysis you do for portrait mode.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.600]   So it's making the depth map.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.040]   It's making the segmentation filters, but it doesn't want the bouquet to change
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:19.920]   between frames.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.360]   So it also looks at the nearest neighbor frame so that it's doing all of this
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.120]   on multiple frames of video as it's ingesting them and they had to make a new
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.240]   just a whole new pipeline to be able to keep that speed up even at 1080p.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.600]   People do all that and a new storage controller to write that data fast enough
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   for this and ProRes to get it all on disk without missing frames.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.920]   I'm really interested.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.360]   I'm really interested in the fact that it's writing the depth map.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.800]   As a visual effects person, I'm like, I'm super interested in that part.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.920]   So so I'm and and and do and Renee, do we know what what flavor of ProRes it saves?
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.040]   4.2.2, but I'm not sure if it's LT or not yet because I haven't seen the actual
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   version. OK, let's even then.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.120]   4.2.2. That's good.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.040]   I was 4.2 even LT would be great.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.360]   Yeah, we talk to you last week.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.920]   It's ProRes means a lot of things.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.160]   But proxy proxy is mostly like it's really proxy, like it's not something you can use.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.240]   And so if it's 4.2 to any flavor of 4.2 to on a phone would be amazing.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.480]   What's LT? What does that? What does that mean?
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.960]   It's light. It's so it's about I think 30 percent lighter than 4.2.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.080]   And so you have you have more procces, which is like I don't care about you.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:37.440]   And then and then there is there's LT 4.2 HQ 4.4 4.4 4.4 X Q right in a perfect
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.640]   world like what we hope to see in a future one would be 4.2 to HQ.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:48.640]   And the reason for that is it's a lot bigger, but it would carry the 10 bit data
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.280]   you know that you need for HDR, which is now three gigabytes a minute is what
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.160]   it's going to be storing, which to me makes me cry for a lightning.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.120]   Oh, OK. Three gigabytes per minute.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.400]   Yeah, I think that's what it's going to be.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.480]   OK, let me do some math.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.880]   I'll tell you what it is.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.920]   That's why you can't do it on the low storage iPhone.
[00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.360]   They said that it just goes up too fast.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.760]   The other point is you can't do 4K 60 frames.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.760]   Pro or they can't process it fast enough.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.120]   That's too much.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.400]   So you're doing 4K or 1080.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.640]   What are you doing? 4K 30 or 1080 4K 30.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.840]   OK, you would be fine.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.360]   It's 10.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.800]   There are 1080 30. Yeah.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.840]   So it's not 24, but they've never done 30.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.360]   They've never done 24 at 1080p.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.760]   They think that's a television resolution.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.480]   It's always done 30, but they're working.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.720]   I'm guessing towards 24 for 4K.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.320]   So I'm for some miles.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.280]   I really think that the interesting point here is that Apple, at this point now,
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:53.320]   with their silicon, I'd expect to see this to happen in the iPad and the Mac as well,
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.040]   is doing more than saying we want more speed, more general.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.800]   Yes. We don't want to improve our geek bench score.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.440]   What we want to do is optimize this processor for the things we want to do.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.120]   In this case, ProRes 422.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.600]   Maybe rack focus.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.720]   Maybe they needed to do it for cinematic mode and for battery life.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.000]   And I think that's very interesting because it means where Apple's going to go in future.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.720]   And it makes perfect sense.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.960]   It's not necessarily linear.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.760]   Next year, it might be faster.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.000]   It's going to be features.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.080]   It's not big cores, post-big core world.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.000]   They're doing silicon features specifically for the what and they work three years out.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.200]   They make the silicon like the encoders are specific, are new this year.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.320]   They've got specific ProRes and code decode blocks just for ProRes to be able to handle it on a phone.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.360]   And they've got a whole new pipeline to move all that data again to the storage to the collector.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.560]   I'm just I'm sad.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.320]   I filmed my whole a role for that video.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.480]   I didn't use all of it, but I filmed my whole a role in cinematic mode.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.800]   And it was large and it was really hard to get off an iPhone.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.360]   So like I just I just going to keep up the pressure for Thunderbolt.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.920]   I can't even use USB anymore.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.360]   I need Thunderbolt for ProRes.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.080]   Well, and for somebody like me who's not going to be, you know,
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.960]   I was all excited about Dolby Vision in the 12 and I never ended up doing anything with it.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.520]   So for somebody like me who's just taking family photos video, you know, just using it as a camera,
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.560]   it's probably not going to be a dramatic improvement over the 12.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.280]   It's in low light. It's good.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.040]   Yeah. Oh, so is it noticeable in low light?
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.960]   No, it's because it's so much bigger.
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.000]   Like it's just drinking in so much more light that yeah, sorry, Andy.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   I was I was just going to say this is where I think we we've often talked about how the apples
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:41.600]   definition of the word pro tends to be really, really malleable from one product line to another.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.840]   But I really like how absolutely distinct they are in the in the iPhone line where I think it's very,
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:54.000]   very clear that if you're shopping for an iPhone, try to convince yourself that I'm saying try to convince
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.320]   yourself that the that you need the iPhone Pro.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.800]   You're probably going to be so happy with the iPhone 13, particularly if you take the extra money.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:05.200]   I'm sorry, but based on the reviews that I've read, obviously, I haven't put my hands on one yet.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.600]   But I'm saying that if it's if it's like the iPhone 12 and previous designations where they've done the iPhone Pro,
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.440]   for most people, if you've got a budget of $1,100, $1,200 to spend on a phone,
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.880]   there is a very, very good argument to be made that get the non pro version,
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:25.480]   but use that extra money to get as much storage as you possibly can or as double what you think that you're
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:32.320]   going to need. Whereas there are people for whom the pro features of the iPhone Pro are truly groundbreaking.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.800]   And they are truly the difference between, you know what, I'm sure that I'm sure that my iPhone can take
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.560]   the pictures I need or take the video that I need, but I'm going to take my pocket,
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:48.640]   nice camera instead, in addition, just in case and saying that after after having one after testing the hell out of it
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.880]   during it two week during the period, which you can return it, being able to say, you know what,
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.240]   it's actually muscular enough for the things I actually do that I will see a big,
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.720]   big difference and it is definitely worth the extra money.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:05.840]   So this is this is why I'm not I did I did highlight how much I like Brian Chen's headline
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.600]   and also a couple of points that he made that thought were very, very well addressed.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.840]   Again, I have not put my hands on one, so I'm only commenting on his review and how it's the well,
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.840]   the musicality of that line and the headline I thought was very, very well.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.400]   But as I said at the end of the at the Apple event when we did the show right afterward,
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.680]   that there's absolutely nothing out of line.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.280]   There's absolutely nothing embarrassing about taking an exceptional phone and just making it a little bit better
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.760]   or looking at specific pain points that they think that they can finish a little bit better than they did with the iPhone 12.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.920]   That is not something that anybody should complain about at all.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.720]   That is the sign that they have been doing 12 13 out iterations of just making things better and better and better.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.360]   That's not something that Apple should be dinged for.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.560]   And also, Renee's point is very well taken.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:58.760]   People don't if you're buying a new phone every year, what Brian said later on in the later on in the in the review,
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:09.200]   saying that it's it's it's a performative demonstration of really, really bad consumerism to have to think you have to buy a new $1,200 phone each and every year.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.440]   But for people like me who have not bought an iPhone in a few years, in my case,
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.440]   which from the iPhone, a number of years ago, this is the sort of thing that gets me interested.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:26.360]   And when I have that $1,000 tape to the bottom of my desk, I'm tending to buy like a high end phone sometime this year or next.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.400]   This is the sort of thing that makes me think, Gee, if Google looks like they're going to be
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:41.440]   revolutionizing the pixel phone with a pixel six, maybe that just means that their huge revolution will only put them one step behind this very, very mature iPhone 13,
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.760]   which is never a line that has never stepped a foot wrong in the past three or four steps that they've taken.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.960]   Let me read Brian Chin's.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.360]   I think I disagree with this paragraph, the one you referred to any.
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:56.280]   This is all to say the annual phone upgrade, which companies like Apple and Samsung
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:04.720]   tap with enormous marketing events and ad campaigns to gin up sales for the holiday shopping season has become a mirage of tech innovation.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.880]   In reality, the upgrades are now a celebration of capitalism in the form of ruthless incrementalism.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.480]   I think that's going a little bit a little bit far.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.760]   I agree with the second.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.000]   I agree with the second half.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:25.440]   But I think Renee's point is excellent, which is that regardless, Apple's got to do a new phone every year for people who are three phones or four phones old and I think it's the primary program.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.160]   Some people lease like companies lease.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.600]   I think imagine the howl if they didn't do a new phone every year.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.080]   I think this is part of the deal.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:37.320]   And especially if you're subscribing, you know, if you're if you're if you're regular payment, you just get a new phone.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.400]   You're going to want to see a new phone.
[00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:48.080]   So and then and then I do think that the primary market when people ask me, like, should I get when I have an iPhone 12, I'm always like, wow, and you got there's got to be a feature there that really pulls you forward.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.000]   Or you're what you have here.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.640]   And Brian did a good job.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.080]   I think of illustrating the night if you do shoot a lot in the dark, I think this is an important upgrade.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.000]   So here is a nighttime Photoshop with a tennis, which didn't have night mode of his corgi.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.920]   You can barely see it.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.680]   It's just a murky blob.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:12.480]   And then on the left, the iPhone 12, but really the iPhone 13 is appreciably better, even than the iPhone 12.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.600]   And of course, a lot better than the 10.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.040]   So right.
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.560]   And so if you come if you're coming, if you if you have a 10 or an 11, which there's, you know, hundreds of millions.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:29.080]   Yeah, have, you know, that that that it makes sense to not necessarily buying the the very new one, the one to replace the one you just had.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.360]   But coming from it, you've been hanging on in 12 for a while.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:34.320]   It's going to be a huge jump for 10% increase in performance.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:40.920]   I didn't even I don't have a problem with the performance of the 12 and a minor incremental increase in this night shot cinematic mode.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.880]   It's the first time I've not bought an iPhone.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.200]   So I guess I have to in my mind just justify it.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.200]   Lisa's bought one.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:53.160]   So she said you have to play with mine before you all like they know, Apple knows like when you talk to them, they know that it's changed.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.160]   Like they there's it's three to five years now.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.840]   And they know that they're appealing to iPhone 7 customers who have a good camera.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.160]   iPhone eight or iPhone 10 customers.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.800]   Those are the ones that they have to convince.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.960]   And that's the sum total of three or four years of updates.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.480]   So it's it's not insignificant when you look at those that those.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.600]   And if you're if you're on iPhone 10, it's like late years, like, you know, so we look at it one year.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.720]   It's being incremental, but three years back.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:20.320]   It the camera has come so far in three years.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:32.960]   And then, you know, and again, for many of these things to get someone to buy something, you don't have to, you know, you know, they say that this is a probably bad joke, but they say that, you know, if you're being chased by if you're if you're with your friend in the woods, if you're being chased by a bear, you don't
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   be faster than the bear.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.320]   You just be faster than your friend.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:50.160]   And so so the thing is, is that is that the in that sense, they don't have to create this incredible thing every single year that pulls way, way out because that takes it also takes an enormous amount of investment per per piece.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.160]   And you do have to have some kind of progression.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:52.840]   We're going to do this.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:27:00.000]   One of the hardest things for hardware and software companies is to make make certain that they know what's going to happen next.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.840]   And there's a lot of places where you're not putting everything you could think of into this version.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:11.600]   And it's really frustrating when I was when we had a piece of software, actually, that we sold for that we sold the plug in for Final Cut.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:17.560]   I knew what three versions out was going to look like, you know, like I knew what that looked like.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   And I knew that I couldn't do release right now with that version.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.360]   So we had to like release this version.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.560]   And by the time you release it, you feel like it's old news because you've been working on it for the last couple of months.
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.400]   And you were excited about the next one.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.760]   And it's really hard not to talk about the one that's in front of that.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.640]   But you had from a business perspective, you have to release them at a regular rate.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.320]   And if we keep on adding every idea into every new version, you don't get it.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.520]   You know, you can't it's not it's an unsustainable inflation of expectations.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.960]   So you know, the tennis was a 2018 model.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:58.680]   So this is three years later, a dramatically improved night shot, dramatically improved battery life, a bigger screen, probably a better screen.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.280]   I think that if your three if your iPhone is three years old, it might be time to look at it.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.720]   It's a little harder if it's only two years old.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.040]   I don't feel any inclination with a one year old iPhone, but that's completely reasonable.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:12.760]   People keep their phones for two at least.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.240]   I would have done it.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:14.320]   I haven't done it.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.600]   You can see all the time.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.840]   Yeah, ridiculous.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:21.040]   Yeah, it's the first time I've not done this, but I don't I don't actually feel any.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:28.640]   Your point was really good to Leo like because like they're they're going to be hard physical limits that everyone is going to hit because like, yes, TSMC is
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.880]   going to go down to three nanometers.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.680]   They're going to call something one nanometer.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.200]   They're going to hit quantum reality really quickly there.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.400]   There's also a limit to the physical size of a phone like the thermal envelope.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.680]   There are limits to how fast you can spike or you can do frequency because you'll brown out the batteries.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.600]   I just all these hard physical realities.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.360]   And I think like you said, the age of big cores are over it.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.880]   You're never going to be able to make those as fast as you could like on a Mac Pro or something.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.720]   So starting the architecture, silicon for the specific features you want to deliver makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:29:01.040]   And because they do it in house, they can target those features three years out and say we want to be able to do live text.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:08.280]   We want to be able to do cinematic mode and we want to be able to do the pro rest off and then just build for that.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:12.160]   And that at least to me keeps silicon interesting again, it keeps these phones interesting.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.880]   Yeah, I'm actually I think, you know, it's funny.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.320]   Brian X.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.160]   Jenna is reviewing the New York Times didn't even mention improved battery life.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.960]   You just even mentioned it is so much better, which is a huge thing.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   And it's something I know people have been bugged about for a long time that their battery life isn't better.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:31.280]   It's the number one feature consumers care about on every survey you look at.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.640]   Like me, not us makes you think.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:41.080]   And I really think the most important point, as you said, Renee, the most important point is Apple can now optimize for what it thinks people want.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.680]   Notice, by the way, with the departure of Johnny I've nothing about sin anymore.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.240]   Make the camera bump bumpier if it makes it better for better care.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.480]   Or more lenses like you can do more lenses.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:54.680]   Yes.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.240]   So it's all I'm saying, like six, eight.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.960]   I want a periscope so badly.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.280]   Well, I want I want that.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.280]   I have to point out the company.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:00.880]   Remember light?
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.160]   The light camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera, the camera.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.560]   So not like light.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.200]   Oh, like, it looked like it's right.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.440]   Right.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:07.840]   Remember that?
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.000]   And it looked like a bug.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.480]   It had all those.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:10.760]   That cell.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.160]   Nokia had one point out though.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.040]   Yeah, but they weren't Apple.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:13.880]   But they weren't Apple.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.760]   But it did take better pictures.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.840]   That's all that matters.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.400]   All I want to point out is that is that interocular distance can be on the back of the phone so
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:23.720]   that you can shoot 3D videos.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   You shoot 3D videos.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.200]   Someday.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:25.720]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.200]   It's pretty good.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.120]   What about those of us with really big heads Alex?
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.120]   What happens for us?
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   We're going to be forgotten.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.960]   Like, it's like you're still big enough.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.960]   It's still big enough.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.480]   Mark has.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.480]   You have every interocular distance.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.200]   It turns out it only it only varies by about five millimeters.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:44.360]   Mark has Bradley in his video review did point out a bug I think in macro mode and maybe
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.960]   Renee, you can confirm this.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.720]   He said he can't manually switch out of it.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.760]   He could switch into it, but he can't switch out of it.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.720]   New setting will be added in software update this fall says Apple to turn off automatic
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.200]   camera switching.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.320]   Some people complained about like to me the beauty of macro mode is that it wasn't a
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.320]   mode.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.880]   If as you got close, it would just switch to the camera that does macro.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.200]   But some people didn't like that because they wanted to get less close and still shoot
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.160]   with a different camera, which I totally get.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.880]   You always have this battle between like some people like night mode being automatic.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.400]   People want a separate mode the way Google does it on a pixel.
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.000]   Like you can't please everybody.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.800]   This will be a setting so you can choose.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.920]   I just love the fact that I could push in on something, not have to worry about a button
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:23.920]   or a setting.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.840]   And then suddenly it's a macro and I'm shooting it.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:32.400]   I have to say Apple seems like they're always going to air on the side of automatic rather
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.120]   than well and we also have simplicity simplicity.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.560]   Maybe a better way to put it.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.840]   And we also have to remember that these features are potentially available to developers.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.080]   And so you have companies like Filmic Pro, you have companies like Halide that are going
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:49.120]   to have, they're going to get access to the tools that Apple put in there so that they
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.520]   can take advantage of it and give people who want that manual control, the manual control
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.520]   of the phone.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.960]   I actually find that there are too many modes within the current Apple phone.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.280]   Like I got into a photo mode the other day.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.280]   I couldn't get to video.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.000]   I don't understand.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.560]   And so there's so many things you hit the wrong button on.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:12.840]   I think that the phone on the Apple camera has gotten too complex in my opinion.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.840]   You should leave that.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.760]   If I open something up and I want to take a video, I don't want like a thousand different
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   versions of that.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.760]   I just want to be able to take the video.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.920]   If I want something more complex, I want to open up.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.800]   So you're when I open up Filmic, I'm ready.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.360]   You're voting for Apple's way of doing it.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:25.360]   Make it simple.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.760]   At least in the basic camera app.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.360]   And then if you want more, you got Filmic or Halide or something else and you can get all
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.360]   those.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.360]   Exactly.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.440]   But the phone that's built in, you open up should just work.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.760]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.720]   I'll agree and I'll say that I think that's true across many different phone camera platforms.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:44.040]   The number of times when I'm testing a phone, whether it's the iPhone, whether it's a Samsung
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.000]   phone, where it's like, "Oh wow, that's cool.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.120]   I really want to take a picture of that."
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.120]   I say, "Oh, okay.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:53.200]   I seem to be in panorama mode for some reason because my thumb kind of smudged a little
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.320]   bit while I was pressing the starter button.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   Okay.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   Well, that was fun.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.720]   I'll try to describe to people what that little bird looked like.
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.200]   That would be almost just as good.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.880]   But one thing that really irks me though is that there's no, you can press a button to
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.800]   change between 4K and 1080p.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.880]   You can tap a little icon to change between 30, 60 and 24 frames per second.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.360]   There is no indication if you're in HDR mode or not.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.040]   There is no toggle for it in the camera.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.560]   You have to spelunk deep into the settings to change it.
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:23.080]   And also when you airdrop, even though it saves an HDR tone map and an SDR tone map,
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:24.840]   you can't choose between them.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:29.400]   If you want to get that off, you have to either airdrop it to a device that can't accept
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   HDR like an old iPad or open it up an eye movie and export it from there like an animal.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:37.280]   And that sort of thing is it's a completely different workflow.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.080]   So depending on what you're doing, filming in the wrong mode, it's going to be really
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   annoying to you.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:44.160]   So I find it's like a little bit more complexity.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.880]   But the thing that really impressed me about all this stuff is that Apple's continued desire
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.880]   to do almost everything they can in real time and with instant shutter.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.600]   And you think that's trivial until you shoot on phones that don't have it and things get
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.200]   applied as after effects.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.160]   Or like I was doing side by side shooting with a pixel and with an iPhone to try out night
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.000]   mode and George's brother came and put his arm around her.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.440]   And in the iPhone photo, he's not there in the pixel photo.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.640]   He's got his arm around her and it's just the difference in when they actually take
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.680]   the photo.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:17.720]   And I'm just so used to using like a camera camera that the real time stuff is just it's
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   part of my workflow.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:21.200]   And I like the fact that it feels like a camera to me.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.520]   It's another thing that we forgot about is shutter lag, which used to be a huge problem.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.000]   And Apple's just solved it.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.520]   And probably that comes with a better processor.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.920]   The telephoto is 77 millimeters now, which I'm not sure I like because I love 50 millimeters.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.480]   The old one was 52.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.880]   Last year was 65 on the max.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.480]   Now it's 77 on both.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:44.000]   But it went from F2.0 to F2.8.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.280]   But the single processor is so good.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.520]   It's hard to find any additional noise in it.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.920]   Yeah, just on paper, I like 77.
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.000]   That's a portrait length.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.440]   I wish that the wide was more toward 50 because I agree with you.
[00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.600]   You should have a normal lens.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   So you really have two.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.960]   It's 35 millimeter equivalent wide angle lenses and one kind of medium telephoto.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.960]   Be nice to have a normal.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.240]   You've got 13, 20, and 77 on this one.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.800]   13 is very wide, isn't it?
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.400]   I'm sure that their metric was.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:23.000]   Wide screen, wide mode is defined as your friends at a restaurant table mode.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.400]   Telephoto mode is really, really good portrait with that light mode.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.560]   So this is why I love Apple's.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:34.400]   I think that Google and Apple both have separate but wonderful philosophies on how they approach
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.680]   photography.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.600]   And Apple's really is, I don't care what the focal length of this lens is going to be,
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:47.120]   is that give me a solution for taking pictures where you hand the photo to a waiter and you
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.920]   have to make sure that that waiter is going to push the button that looks like a shutter
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.120]   button and they're going to wind up with a good picture without being told to tap some
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.200]  place else.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.440]   And also that will the lens be both wide enough and light sensitive enough to get the entire
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:03.320]   really happy shot of your bowling league after coming in just third in the quarterly
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:06.320]   championships.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.200]   I have to also point out that there's another is an ulterior motive to not buy the new iPhone
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:16.000]   as I mentioned, I bought the iPad mini and I'm thinking that might be my new phone.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.280]   It's a foldable, it doesn't fold.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.880]   If it would only fold, I think I'd be in happy.
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.840]   It's foldable, it doesn't unfold again.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840]   Sorry.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   You should hop.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.840]   Good.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:31.640]   For whatever reason, the cell phone coverage around my house isn't very good.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.800]   So it's constantly breaking up.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.800]   You're always on a live sky.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.480]   I've just gotten used to now just calling on FaceTime audio.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   Just hold down on something, you know, go to their info.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   That's what I'm going to do.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.480]   FaceTime.
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.480]   Yep.
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   And I've gotten used to that now and I'm so used to the quality of it.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.320]   That it's so much higher quality that I that I that now even when I'm traveling and I'm
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:53.160]   on one, you know, on LTE or whatever, I'm just constantly just using my face on audio.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.800]   So that's so this is the experiment.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.080]   Can you call landlines with it, right?
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.080]   I know.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   Ah.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.360]   So if I have to, I don't know why I would call anybody with a landline, but if I had to,
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:05.880]   I guess I just Google voice.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.360]   There are other things like that.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.360]   There's other things you can use.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.360]   Other other.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.360]   Skype works.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.240]   I actually have a phone number on my Skype.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.720]   So I don't know if I have any.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   I don't know.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:15.720]   I don't know anybody.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.480]   I guess if I called the government or something, I called the government.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.480]   Yeah, call the government.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.680]   When you caught the funny days, hey, government.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680]   Oh, that's right.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.000]   You don't have any echo or Google devices.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   So I do.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   I do have.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   Well, I only have I have Siri.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   See, I don't think the government's listening.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Speak Siri.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.040]   So yeah, it'll be an it's an experiment.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.200]   I'm not thinking I'll carry an eight inch phone around, but you know, my, you know, my
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.800]   you know, again, I think I think I talked about this a week, a week or two ago, but I found
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:48.040]   that the radios in the iPad Pro are much better than the phone.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:52.400]   And so I've gotten to the habit of with that one, I call out and then I, or I jump on zoom
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.960]   or whatever and I just set it in the middle of the house and just wander all over with
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.720]   my AirPods pros and they work.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.040]   My phone doesn't work that way.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.480]   It'll it'll break up on the edge.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:04.200]   Speaking of which the 12 had Wi-Fi six does this have six E in it Renee or is it just
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.200]   still six?
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.200]   It does not.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.200]   Which I'm sad about because I've been waiting.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.000]   Oh, like the other way I did the best of the bunch.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.400]   Yeah, I did the math.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   It's Apple Pro as LT.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.560]   It is LT based on three.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   It's a five.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.560]   Which is great.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.560]   I'm still one gigabyte.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:23.200]   It's one gigabyte per minute is that is is is LT if they had gone up, it would have been.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.440]   Well, he said it's three gig.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.200]   Oh, three gigs an hour.
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.000]   No, no, what is the Renee?
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Three gigs.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Three gigs.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   I believe you said three gigs.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   It's not finally yet.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   So it is a.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   It's not LT.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   It's not LT.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   That's not LT.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Hold on.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Go ahead.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   I'm going to go ahead and out again.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I misunderstood.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.720]   Hold on.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:48.960]   And now we dub in the montage from Goodwill Huntie of kind of chalkboard math floating
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.520]   in and out over Alka's head.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.520]   Yeah, I know.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.920]   I need like the little account.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.200]   Hey, while you're doing the math, let me take a break and we'll come back because I
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.520]   want some people to do some math.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.520]   So you know what I got?
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:01.520]   Look at this.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.600]   Lisa, remember Lisa said she had a black card?
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.720]   I just told stole her black card.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.000]   But notice there's a little funny little logo on that black card.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.040]   How would you like to have a Visa signature card that earns you Bitcoin on every qualifying
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:16.800]   purchase you make?
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   That's this.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.640]   It's called, it's a block-fi card.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:25.480]   Whether you're a crypto pro or a total beginner, you could finally earn Bitcoin the easy way,
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.840]   unlimited Bitcoin, and every qualifying purchase.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.920]   It's a real credit card.
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.960]   It's a Visa signature, which is actually a very good credit card.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:39.080]   So buy groceries, get Bitcoin, pay your bills, get Bitcoin, fill up at the gas station, get
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   Bitcoin.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.200]   Every time I go to dinner, I got Bitcoin, baby.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:47.440]   You're in one and a half percent back on Bitcoin on all qualifying purchases.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.680]   There are no reward limits.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.800]   There's no annual fee.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.560]   There's no foreign transaction fees.
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.520]   It's a really good credit card.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.320]   No, let me say that again.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.640]   No annual fee, no foreign transaction fees, and you get Bitcoin one and a half percent
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.920]   back on every single qualifying purchase.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.520]   If you've been wondering, "Hey, I'd like to get in this crypto thing."
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:09.920]   Now's the time to start and ramp up your Bitcoin portfolio.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:16.000]   I mean, I don't have to tell you Bitcoin's been going up quite a bit.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.200]   But the other thing, you can convert this later to other forms of crypto as well.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.400]   Turns out Bitcoin was the best performing asset of the last decade, outperforming the
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.800]   NASDAQ 100 by 10 times, according to Yahoo Finance.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   Wow.

[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.920]   You don't have to read that real fast.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   I love it.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.560]   I love the...
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.120]   When Lisa uses this, this is so cool.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.800]   People go, "Wait, is this a Bitcoin card?"
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.560]   I'm earning Bitcoin, baby.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:03.000]   Thank you, blockfi for supporting Macbreak weekly.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.480]   Did you get the new iPad, Ray?
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.520]   Or no, just the phones?
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.520]   I have no knowledge of iPads.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.520]   Oh!
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.840]   embargo not lifted.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.880]   I'm talking to Andy's puppy at the moment.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:25.600]   It's funny because I was shocked because when we were doing the event, Mike said, "You
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   can buy it now."
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600]   I said, "Now?"
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.600]   I thought, "Pre-order now."
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   No, no, you could buy it now.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.280]   So I'm going to get it on Friday.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:33.040]   I think it's an interesting experiment.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.040]   We shall see.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   We shall see.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   The Mac looks up the height.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.040]   Tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch-tch.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.120]   Yes, he's done the math.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:43.160]   So are you updating that to confirm with Renee?
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:47.840]   We're talking 1080-30 frames a second, right?
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.400]   I believe so, yes.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   Okay.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:57.280]   If it's 3 gigabytes per minute at 1080p 30.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.280]   Yes.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.480]   And we're looking for one minute.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.480]   Yes.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.480]   It's Apple ProRes 4444.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.480]   No!
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.480]   It's like 4444.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:06.480]   They said 4222, so it can't be 4444.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:07.480]   Okay.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.480]   They did say for sure it's 4444.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.280]   No, it sounds like it's better than life.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.400]   Maybe it's 4K, but I'll double check.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.120]   It could be 4K or it could be ProRes.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:23.120]   It's not available now.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.880]   Renee, didn't they say it's coming?
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.480]   It's coming, which is why it's a little confusing.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.240]   We don't know yet because we haven't used it.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.240]   Right.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.240]   You can't try it.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:34.680]   If it was HQ, HQ would make more sense in a lot of ways.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:40.480]   4222, then 4222, because it was 10-bit and Apple's already doing HDR, which now you
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.920]   have a phone that does 10-bit HDR would be amazing.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.960]   You might want to get 2-terabyte version is what you're saying.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:51.720]   No, it's one of those things like if you're shooting that way, you know that I might have
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   to offload the phone.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   So that would be fine.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.400]   That would be fine.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.040]   I shot a 30...
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.960]   You'd be able to shoot up for 30 minutes, by the way.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.680]   This is probably the conversation Catherine Bigelow was having about two years ago or
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:10.720]   a year ago, whenever she started shooting with the iPhone 13.
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:13.160]   You're telling me what?
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.480]   So I would be very surprised.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.040]   Oh, 4K 30.
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.040]   It does 4K 30.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.040]   It is 4K 30.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:20.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   Yeah, now it's going to be...
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.400]   Yeah, it's only 1080p 30 on 128k.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.640]   Should I do another ad so you can do the math again?
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:26.640]   No, I can do the math.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   It's also new fun to me right now.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   I mentioned one other...
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.120]   You just divide it by 4, right?
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.600]   Because it's 4 times the bits.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:34.760]   Oh, now it's...
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:35.760]   If it's 4K...
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:36.760]   Oh, I have 4K 60.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.760]   Hold on.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   Oh, that's too much.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.760]   Okay, 30.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.760]   4K 30.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   I think that it's...
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   I now think it's LT.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.760]   Yeah, I think it's LT.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.760]   It's LT.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.760]   Okay.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   4K 30.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   4K 30.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.200]   3 gigabits per minute would be ProRes 4 to LM.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:57.440]   It shows up as a little less than that, but it's like 52 seconds or whatever at 3 gigs.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:59.760]   But you had some wow and flutter there.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.200]   I'm curious if they're absolutely maxing the pipeline with that or if there's some overhead
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.200]   left for a future upgrade.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.360]   If they're being a little bit conservative with the data rates right now to make sure
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.520]   that when they're promising people that you can get...
[00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:17.080]   You are probably going to be charging money for a lot of the video they shoot or the
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.240]   smell that no, no, no, this will not screw up.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:23.360]   But then after it's been battle tested and hardened, they will say, "Okay, guess what?
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.800]   We've had another..."
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:32.120]   The other possibility is some new version of ProRes that is like an HLG, like an HLG
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.640]   ProRes with some metadata for vision or...
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.680]   There's a whole bunch of things that they could do there that are out of the box thinking
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:40.680]   about that.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.600]   So it could be its own new version, so we don't know until we...
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.320]   And they are storing SDR and HDR tone maps for everything that you shoot so you can get
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.320]   both off the same video.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:52.360]   Oh, I should have just pulled up this chart that Anthony Nielsen sent us.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.680]   I wasn't paying attention.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.480]   Here's all of the different bit rates of the different things.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.920]   Well, you'll be talking about 4096 by 2160.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.440]   That's 4K.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.840]   Now this is 25 frames.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:14.200]   162 megabits, 365 megabits, 524 megabits.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:19.120]   Now I have to go 3 gigabits per minute.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.600]   How many megabits per second is that?
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.040]   It's way easier if you just use the AJA calculator.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.040]   AJ makes a...
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:30.440]   What I'm doing is I got a calculator and I just type in, "This is my target bit rate.
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.840]   How much time do I have?"
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:32.840]   So it's little...
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.280]   LT is about what, 50% of the...
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.560]   It's good for a phone.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.560]   It's good for a phone.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:40.400]   Well, and to be clear.
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.520]   Is the format the most important thing really so that you can just import it right into
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   final cutter?
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.520]   Well, it's less compressed.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.560]   It'll be a lot less compressed than HEVC.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.640]   So one of the things that you'll...
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:53.000]   If you just take a...
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.760]   Set to 4K 60 or so and just point out some flowing trees and then zoom in on that.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.000]   And what you're seeing is little fractal patterns.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.640]   It's not leaves anymore.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:13.160]   So LT will hold that leaf data and find details so much better than HEVC or HE264.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:19.640]   And so LT will be much better from just a clarity perspective.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.120]   And then it's also way easier to edit.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   You don't have to...
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.280]   You can just bring it in and it's a better format to edit.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:29.760]   But what it really is going to do is hang on to a lot more of the detail that you're
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.440]   throwing away right now when you shoot with HEVC.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:38.440]   Can I ask one question that has been on my mind for a long time as the new iPhones for
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:42.200]   the past couple of years have been adding these super, super high-end pro features.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.120]   And as during the keynote they've been saying, "And we've had this Oscar-winning director
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:50.360]   direct their short film to show how good it is."
[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.280]   Are we talking about something that ordinary people are going to appreciate?
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:59.000]   Or is this like the difference between, "Well, yes, you could buy the $35 frying pan that
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.440]   the wire cutter recommends."
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.880]   Or you could buy the $480 one that's made out of a best-car steel.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.000]   Are these things that are going to be appreciated by most people?
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.960]   Or is it a really tiny segment of pro users that are going to say, "Maybe this is a reason
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:18.120]   why I can use this as a B camera or why I can set this phone up on a tripod in the
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:21.280]   choir loft of a wedding and use that to shoot part of the wedding with?"
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.680]   I think that I just want to say for the record that the best-car steel pan nine-inch is a
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.080]   lot more expensive than $480 and it's great.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.440]   But the heating on that grilled cheese.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:33.440]   It's amazing.
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:37.880]   Well, the big thing about a system, the best-car gives you a much more even flow of heat across
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.360]   the entire base of it because it's, you know, anyway, so it's not a story.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   So anyway, so the...
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.880]   Well, I tozed off for a minute and I think I lost track of what...
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.440]   Are we talking grilled cheese?
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.440]   Grilled cheese and best-car.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.440]   Okay.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.080]   It's a Mandalorian cheese.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.200]   There's the problem.
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.920]   I miss all Mandalorian references.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.080]   I don't get it.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.960]   So anyway, so the...
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.600]   So here's the thing is what's happening is there's this...
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.760]   You're starting to see stuff that sure you're not gonna...
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.960]   It's weird thing right now is that customers are not all gonna see the difference.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:18.240]   Pros are probably not many of them will actually want to use it.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.160]   But what's happening is you're starting to see better and better image quality that's
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.800]   coming out of the camera and what happens is you look at other stuff and you're like,
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.600]   "You know, like, so if you watch...
[00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:29.320]   If you take the videos that you...
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:34.880]   That for me, when I take videos with the 12 that are shot in HDR and I put them up on
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.000]   a TV and then you go back to the...
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.360]   To the SDR stuff that I've had in the past, it's a real bummer.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:45.000]   You know, like you just go, "Oh, I really wish I had had this for these movies before."
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.080]   Because it's so much...
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.840]   There's so much more vibrance.
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.320]   There's so much more detail in the highlights in the dark areas.
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.240]   And so you get into this thing where you get used to watching it.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.920]   And this is where Apple really has this ability to keep moving things forward because as
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:06.320]   they move towards high dynamic range and spatial and 120 frames per second, there's
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.080]   going to be a point where they're gonna be able to shoot 120 frames a second and you
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:12.080]   play it back.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:16.520]   So your home movies are gonna have this very real feel to them.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.520]   Maybe that's not good for film.
[00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.640]   Maybe we do 23.98, but home movies at 120 frames per second will make it feel like you're
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:22.640]   there.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.280]   And it will be something that people like.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.760]   And what it will do is have people start getting frustrated with other frame rates.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:34.280]   And frustrated with things that aren't as vibrant as what they're used to.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:40.760]   And so the thing is that HDR, the higher quality, and you can...
[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:45.320]   The reality is there's a lot of people making stuff for YouTube and all kinds of other things
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:50.560]   that this kind of stuff makes it easier for them to make something look great.
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.600]   When I do my training videos now, I do them all on my iPhone.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.440]   You know, like little training videos for internally or for clients or whatever.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.200]   Just way easier for me to do them on my iPhone than it is to pull out even a Blackmagic 6K.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.760]   You know, it's gonna be like a thing and I gotta hold it and I gotta figure things
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   out.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   And then consider normal people.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:11.440]   No, but like Lisa wanted to do some sales training videos, explain our sales system
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.240]   to new salespeople.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:16.000]   And the easiest thing was the iPhone.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   Totally would use an iPhone.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   It was great.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.080]   And the fact that you get to that level where you can...
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.200]   And now with the cinematic mode, you can really make it look nice.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:29.080]   And we have to look at the practicality of corporate communication, of nonprofits, of
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:30.880]   school communications, all those things.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.880]   You're doing this all the time.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.880]   All the time.
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:33.880]   It can really, really, really nice.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:37.080]   Three words that we haven't gotten to yet and that's just rack focus TikTok.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.360]   I am dreading rack focus TikTok.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.680]   I'll be friend, I'll be honest.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   It's gonna be trending.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:44.720]   Have you played with it Renee at all?
[00:51:44.720 --> 00:51:49.720]   I mean, do you know how quick it is, how good it is, how accurate the AI is?
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.880]   Yeah, so I have a couple segments in my video and it's both incredibly...
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.280]   It's really good but also disappointing at the same time.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.680]   The best analogy I can give you is the first year of portrait mode where, you know, like,
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:04.840]   I've never seen a phone do this before, but ah, my glasses and the edges of my ears.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.680]   And that's very much what it's like here.
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.840]   It's like I did it with George N4 family members and it did a pretty good job but sometimes
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:11.840]   it missed.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:15.920]   It's not terrible because you can manually tap it whenever you want and then it's...
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.240]   Sorry, excuse me.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.240]   And then it's great.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.640]   Like tap the focus of the person and you really can't believe a phone camera is doing
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.640]   that.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.800]   You're used to doing that with like a Cine camera or just like a good lens on it.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.960]   So for me it's like early days but it's a really important step that we need to get
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:30.960]   to.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.080]   Like almost every phone does great portrait mode photography now but there were a couple
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.960]   of years there that we had to get through first and this reminds me of that.
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:42.280]   The ability to do and especially the ability to do it in post that it saves all this data
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.840]   and then you can go in and change it.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:48.320]   You can change the depth, you can change the focal point all in post production as well.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.320]   It's pretty smooth.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.480]   I have to say I'm just looking at your video.
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   It's really smooth.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:57.160]   And they do, they're doing kind of a dissolve between the different focal lengths which
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.240]   makes it so it's kind of nice.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.240]   It's kind of...
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.800]   Very 90s music video here.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   It's a nice effect.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.640]   And by the way, George has a lovely family.
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   Yes.
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.720]   What about the scenes I saw you playing with that a little bit too?
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.680]   Do you like the scenes stuff?
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.680]   So yes and no.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:18.920]   I think it's really good that Apple managed to do the styles with...
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.520]   They don't mess up faces, they don't mess up skies.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:27.480]   So if you apply cool or warm or high contrast, it doesn't look like a person's a pumpkin
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.840]   or an ice cube or anything.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.760]   It adds a mood but it doesn't distort it.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.680]   But Apple decided to treat them as film stock.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.520]   It's their homage to the old Fuji film stocks.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.360]   And so it's like you're shooting on film, they're baked in.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:45.160]   You can't go afterwards and change them or undo them like you would with the filters
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:48.840]   which don't account for faces or skies or anything like that.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.000]   So it was a real mixed bag.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.200]   Like on one hand I appreciate the hipster energy of it.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:54.920]   But on the other hand, it's digital.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:56.440]   I want a safety net.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:03.840]   Anything else before we move on, anything else to say since you're the one who's got
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:10.000]   them, any surprises, anything that didn't work, anything that was exceptional.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.520]   No, everything worked.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.240]   A lot of stuff is just a matter of opinion.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.520]   Again, like the macro thing I liked that it was automatic.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.400]   Obviously a couple people didn't like that it was automatic and they're going to make
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.400]   the thing for it.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.800]   So all he has to do is he gets close up to shoot something.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.840]   To turn it off, you go up and look at something in distance.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.840]   Backwards again.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.800]   And it will go back.
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:28.800]   So come on.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.280]   But they want to shoot close without that lens.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.600]   Yeah, some people just don't.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:35.640]   So the thing for me is like, yeah, a camera isn't making three cameras.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:39.120]   They're making a camera system that intelligently shows cameras depending on what you want
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   to shoot.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:44.800]   It'll move away from the telephoto to the wide angle and crop if it needs more light.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.280]   And you can force it with halite to use a telephoto and low light if you want.
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:50.360]   But Apple just wants to give you a good picture.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.360]   That's all they want.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   So they're like a happy puppy.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.200]   They want to give you your happy photograph.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:56.400]   And they don't want you to care about the implementation details.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.920]   This is what we were talking about, which is it does what it thinks most people are
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:03.640]   going to want without having them to do anything special about it.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.800]   Without making it another job to manage everything.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.560]   Everything that Apple does, you always have to go through the filter of what will 90%
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.920]   of people want to do at the time.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.520]   And that's going to be what they're going to aim for.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:17.400]   And unfortunately, the complainers are in the small 1%.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.800]   So you'll hear a lot about things like that.
[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:20.800]   They're very vocal.
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.720]   Yeah, well, they have the 1% of needs.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.000]   It's just that they have unusual needs.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.760]   And they're the ones who are going to speak up.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:31.680]   The people who say, oh, yeah, that just works, are going to be saying, hey, this is great.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.680]   It just works.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.680]   Everybody pay attention.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.520]   They're not the vocal.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.760]   And a lot of times I think that we talk about this a lot internally when we're working
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.440]   on shows is that it's not what people notice or complain about.
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.920]   It's how they feel.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:48.680]   And that's a really complicated thing to think about is that--
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.440]   And it's actually more almost insidious than what you notice.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:55.640]   It's the stuff that you feel like this is a better thing because of it.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.000]   And you don't know why.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.040]   But all those little things that work just a little bit better, that are just a little
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:01.680]   bit smoother.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.800]   It took us a little while, for instance, to figure out why keynote just looks better
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:05.800]   than PowerPoint.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.720]   It's current and anti-aliasing.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.960]   Yes, little subtle things.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.000]   It's a super weird little thing that they do that just looks better.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.400]   And you can't figure it out.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.720]   You just know that, oh, that looks nicer.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:20.520]   If our premise is correct that Apple is now using their magical powers with silicon to
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:27.400]   do custom A15s for the iPhone, what does this mean about the M1X, which will be--
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:31.600]   I'm just making up a name, the A15 in the Mac world.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.720]   They're not going to obviously optimize for cinematic mode.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   They're going to optimize for other things.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:45.240]   Well, you see the idea between the iPhone chips and the Mac chips.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:49.400]   I think the thing that makes Apple really good at silicon, the biggest problem in silicon
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.640]   is having multiple clients.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   Qualcomm will tell you that.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:55.560]   If they have to support DirectX for Windows, OpenGL for Linux, and they have a bunch of
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:56.560]   different requirements--
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.560]   It's hard.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:01.480]   And that was a danger that Apple could have fallen into when the watch becomes a client,
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.360]   the iPhone becomes a client, the iPad.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:07.560]   So they created what they call a scalable systems architecture where it's the same basic
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:12.360]   core design and IP, but not like the M1 in the iPad.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.080]   It's the same as the one in the Mac.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:20.880]   It just doesn't need the x86 reordering blocks that it uses.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.160]   It just ignores those.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.160]   And the iPad--
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.160]   So how do they do that?
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.840]   They don't screen a whole new chip.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.000]   No, it's not feasible.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.160]   They get money on it.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.440]   Their whole thing is they buy so much of the same thing that they get incredible at its
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.440]   scale.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:35.440]   They turn off scale.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:36.440]   How do they do that is the question.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.440]   They just don't hit it.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   There's just no software that requests that.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.440]   Software is a request.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.440]   Same thing like the--
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.440]   Okay.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.440]   So they do think that the M1X has the same--
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:50.920]   the M1X will be identical again, or will they start making separate screens for the two?
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.160]   It'll be that-- there's two-- there's three things that they can change.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.280]   And you can see this with the A14 in the air and in the iPhone is that there's not as
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.720]   much photography on the iPad.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:03.360]   So it doesn't hit everything in the image signal processor.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.880]   Like it doesn't care about a lot of those things.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:06.040]   So it just ignores it.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.480]   But people tend to use bigger, more powerful apps.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:12.200]   So it hits the GPU and some of the Enco Deco blocks a lot harder.
[00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:13.800]   And I think it's going to be the same thing with this.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.960]   They're just going to keep building that silicon.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:19.000]   And then the frequencies might be different given the thermal envelopes.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.600]   Like they'll be able to increase frequencies a little bit on the bigger chassis devices.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:28.960]   And they'll be able to ignore or-- like the iPad Mini uses Smart HDR 3, not Smart HDR 4.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.800]   And I think it's because the iPad Mini just can't take the level of photographs that the
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.960]   iPhone can.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.800]   So they can just pick the features that they want for every device rather than making bespoke
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   chips for every device.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.160]   They don't have to sense your work.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.720]   So they don't have to do that.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.720]   It's a little disappointing.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.960]   But I guess I understand why they don't want it, especially given the chip shortage.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:50.160]   They don't want to go to TSMC and say, I want four different SKUs.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.800]   They want to make it simple.
[00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:52.800]   And it makes it easier.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.160]   It destroys their economies.
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:55.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.680]   And it just makes everything easier to develop for.
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:59.680]   It makes it easier for them to build them.
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.640]   As they keep on doing this, they just become more and more efficient.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   It's why you don't need catalyst anymore.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   Right?
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   Because, yeah, it is--
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   And it's crazy.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.880]   We have this app that we use called Nix Effect Pro to run our switchers to do graphics and
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.120]   stuff like that.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.840]   And we realized-- so I'm brought it up there.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.040]   Like, why are you using the iPad?
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.040]   It's an iPad app.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.840]   And they're like, why are you using the iPad when you could just use it on a Mac mini?
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:19.840]   And I was like, oh, right.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.840]   Like, I can just move this app now over to the Mac mini and run it.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:23.840]   That's pretty cool, isn't it?
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:24.840]   And have it just in rack mounted in there.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:25.840]   And I have to think about it.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.840]   It's just amazing.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:34.080]   Speculation about the next Apple event, October Macintosh.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.080]   Or November.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.080]   Or November?
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.720]   Either way.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:38.720]   Maybe not so soon.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.720]   Hands on when they're ready.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.720]   Yep.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:41.720]   We don't know.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:46.240]   Well, let's talk about iOS 15 because that also came out.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:50.480]   And somebody's pointing out that Mac Stories has a 25 page review of iOS 15.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.720]   There's a lot to say.
[00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:00.280]   You know, I mean, we'll see if we get it in five minutes, 25 minutes maybe.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:01.280]   Anything--
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:05.520]   To me, the star of the show is the productivity enhancements in iPadOS.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:10.200]   I've been playing-- I've been sort of-- I had an old iPad that had a beta on it that
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200]   I barely used.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:18.000]   But for the past 24 hours, I've been trying to use my new iPad as much as possible in replacement
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.120]   for my desktop back.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:27.640]   And my goodness, it was-- multitasking has gone from-- we figured out a way to shoehorn
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:32.140]   multitasking features into an operating system that was absolutely, obviously never
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:36.840]   intended to do more than one thing at a time.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:42.120]   And it's now not the best-- not the very, very best multitasking system in the world, but
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.600]   it is light years ahead of where it was.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.520]   And it kind of gets me more interested in using the iPad as a productivity machine from
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.520]   now on.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:54.480]   They just addressed so many pain points from the get-go.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:59.120]   The minimum being that just the idea of deciding that, oh, that's right.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.920]   In the middle of this document, now I really want to have a Twitter window or I really
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.640]   want to have an outline window right next door to it and say, oh, well, I guess I forgot
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.760]   to put Omni-Outliner in the system doc.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.920]   So it's going to be almost impossible to do.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.960]   Oh, well, I better forget about that then.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.280]   To really, no matter-- you don't have to plan ahead what you want your workspace to look
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:19.280]   like.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.760]   You can dynamically decide how you want to use your workspace, what apps you want side-by-side,
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.920]   when you want to slide something in, when you want to slide something out.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.920]   It really is.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:33.200]   One of the reasons why I spent so much money on the iPad Pro was because of what I was
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.400]   hearing about this new version of iPadOS that there was going to be a huge investment
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.400]   in multitasking.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:45.040]   And I feel as though that investment paid off, I'm really happy with it.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.720]   I like the focus, the new focus feature.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:53.720]   They did a very extensive conversation about it earlier today on iOS today.
[01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:56.520]   I'm going to make a Sargent or Rosemary Orchard, and I think you should watch because it's
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.320]   short cut enabled, automated enabled.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.800]   It looks like it's going to have some real capabilities.
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.680]   I'm using it now, so the phone won't ring when I go to work.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.680]   Which focus are you in?
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   I am in work focus.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680]   Nice.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.360]   Well, it's funny because last night, Lisa and I both upgraded to 15, she said, "Where's
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.360]   do not disturb?"
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.400]   I said, "Oh, go to focus."
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:18.560]   And now it's more stuff, but I think it's more fine-tuned.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.520]   I think it's going to be pretty good.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.760]   Lisa make a workout focus immediately with all her workout apps.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.760]   Exactly.
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   Exactly.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:26.760]   The communication.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.760]   I don't know yet, but she will.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.760]   I have a feeling exactly.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.520]   It's really, I think it's going to be a nice feature.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.360]   In a way, it solves the complexity of the iPhone by simplified.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.760]   Custom home screens are nice.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.640]   You can set different apps and different home screens for different focuses.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:45.640]   What else do we like in iOS?
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:50.360]   LiveText is, Andy and I have been questioning this for a while, but I was just, I was looking
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   at it, I wrote it myself on a whiteboard, held up the camera, I didn't have to take
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.880]   a photo, I just selected the text that I wanted, I pasted it to where I wanted it.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:58.880]   It's been transformed.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.560]   Like I said, I can't even tell when I'm in photos anymore because I just select text or
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:06.360]   I go to hit a link and it takes me there and then I forget, oh, I wasn't in Safari.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.040]   It's really brain bending.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:15.560]   I've had OS, I've been playing with the beta of it, so I didn't see a lot of features,
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:20.040]   but a little point to note if you were in the beta of either, you'll want to remove the
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.280]   profile, the beta profile, if you want to stick with the release version.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:27.760]   In fact, with iPadOS, I actually had to download a new release version of iOS 15, even though
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.800]   I kept the betas up to date.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.800]   So it's probably worth it.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800]   New betas too.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800]   So if you don't get it.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.800]   Yeah, do it now.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:37.600]   Otherwise you're on the new beta track.
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.400]   Somebody in the chat room saying quick notes is great.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.400]   I agree.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.400]   I've been using that on the iPad.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.560]   How do you invoke it on the iPhone?
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.920]   Is it have quick notes on the iPhone?
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.280]   No, they just go into notes.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.280]   Oh, nuts.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.920]   But the Mac will have it, which is going to be great.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.920]   I would like some limited multi-windowing.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.280]   I like picture in picture and something like why would you ever want picture in picture?
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.320]   Because I take notes when I watch videos.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:02.800]   Like videos is a job for me.
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800]   I watch a video.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.600]   I take notes on retention on camera techniques, and I couldn't use to do that on an iPhone.
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.840]   Now I can put the picture in picture there and use it, but I would love to be able to
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.160]   do like have a notes window open on top of other windows sometimes or two notes windows
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.800]   so I can read something and write something.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:21.280]   Give it to me now.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:27.040]   Did they ever get the mask unlock with the watch working?
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:28.040]   It works great for me.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:29.040]   I use it every day.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.040]   Okay.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:31.040]   Because it's very annoying.
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.040]   There's a new watch in the West too.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.360]   It doesn't work for me either.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.400]   But the lack of touch ID still bothers me on the iPhone.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.400]   I really would.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.240]   We've had two of the worst years ever and we've been so considerate to go back.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:41.240]   It's so annoying.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.440]   I'm in the doctor's office yesterday.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.200]   It's masked in the lobby.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.240]   I have to lift the mask, do this, and put it down.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.000]   I'm hoping nobody notices so that I can do face ID.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.880]   The roadblock for most people is the first time you try to unlock with your watch you
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:56.880]   have to put in the passcode.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.320]   The first thing you put your mask on, it'll fail and ask for your passcode.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.160]   You put that in and then it will just open with your watch again after that.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   Okay.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.640]   I'll have to try that.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:08.360]   I didn't work initially, right?
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:09.600]   And then it did work.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.520]   There's another reason why my new phone is my iPad Mini because it has touch ID.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:17.120]   I love it.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.120]   What else?
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.920]   What are their new features in iOS 15?
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.520]   It seems like a no show stoppers.
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:23.520]   I'm didn't ship.
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:24.520]   Sorry?
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.800]   They postponed a bunch of features instead of shipping with any.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.160]   Oh, let's talk about that.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   Shareplay, we knew that.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.320]   What else was postponed?
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.320]   I have a list.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.040]   I haven't been postponed or not yet, but we don't have some of them at this point.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.320]   I have a list from nine to five Mac of delayed, not postponed.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.320]   Pardon me.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320]   Yes.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:48.400]   ID cards, support for the ID cards in the wallet app.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.360]   Not yet in iOS 15.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.720]   It doesn't matter.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:52.800]   I don't live in Georgia.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.960]   I don't live in one of the two states, but if you did, you would probably be disappointed.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:59.880]   I was doing like these monolithic updates and just say, this is a roadmap for the next
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:00.880]   year.
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.360]   I'm going to have a bunch of new features in the fall, a bunch more in the spring, bunch
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   more in the summer.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:06.880]   Look forward to them and we'll get them out to you in perfect working order.
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:10.560]   The app privacy report still to come.
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.080]   Let's see, custom email domains.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.080]   Not yet.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.080]   C-Sam, luckily.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.520]   C-Sam was delayed or postponed or put off forever, maybe.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.520]   Or reevaluated?
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.920]   The three evaluated in short 30.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.320]   Legacy contacts.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:30.120]   Universal control is quite a few features they've talked about that just...
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.600]   I don't know if universal control is delayed because I don't think Mac...
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:35.000]   As a release version of Mac of this kind of...
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.200]   You need Monterey, right?
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.200]   I don't know if...
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:39.200]   So maybe when Monterey comes out.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.200]   I was...
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:42.840]   Did any word about Monterey do we know?
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:45.160]   It'll probably come out when they announce new Macs, right?
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.160]   Or no?
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160]   It's usually a little bit...
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.160]   They try to get it fairly close because sometimes there's compatibility.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.840]   Like you can't use the new notes on iOS without the new notes, but it's almost always been
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.640]   a little bit after.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:55.640]   Okay.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.080]   And since we don't know when the new Macs are going to be announced, we don't know when
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.240]   Monterey will be...
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.600]   I want them now.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.520]   I want both of them now.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.560]   You probably have the beta of Monterey.
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.800]   How many betas do we have?
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.280]   Where are we now in the beta?
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.280]   Do you know?
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:11.200]   Oh, I don't even know anymore because I thought it was not on my product.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.240]   I'm Alex Lindsay about my production machine.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.680]   As you should be.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.320]   Now that you're a YouTube star, you can't...
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.520]   Yeah, Final Cut doesn't launch.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.520]   It's not very much.
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:23.720]   Beta 7 came out today.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.480]   So that means we're pretty far along.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.160]   It's pretty close to complete, right?
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:37.560]   There's no magic number, but Beta 7 seems like we're getting close to release.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.560]   But nothing.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:39.560]   Nothing.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.560]   No one...
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.560]   No, nobody knows.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.560]   Nobody knows anything.
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:45.080]   And if they did, they couldn't say.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.080]   How's that doggy?
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.080]   Is he sweet?
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:51.960]   Is he a nice puppy to bat?
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:59.840]   There was a bit of a kerfuffle over the swipe keyboard appearing in the new Apple Watch.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:06.880]   And I have to say, I feel pretty bad for Costa Alethariu who was the developer of Flicktype,
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:14.720]   which was pretty much exactly the same Apple Watch swipe keyboard.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:24.960]   His story is in January of 2019, he received a message from Apple.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.960]   Let's see.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:31.560]   In January 2019, he demo...
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:36.080]   January 24th, he demoed it for the Apple Watch team.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.680]   January 24th, 2019.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.000]   A senior, he says, a senior engineer gushed about it.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.320]   Apple's head of keyboards sent a message saying, "Apple should buy this from you.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.200]   It could be a key feature for the watch."
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.240]   That's two and a half years ago.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:09:01.760]   That evening on January 24th, 2019, he received a message from Apple saying that they were
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.640]   pulling it from the store.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.800]   Specifically, the app is a keyboard for Apple Watch.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:11.560]   For this reason, your Apple will be removed from sale on the Apple store.
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.080]   We reported it at the time.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.960]   People were upset, but, you know, okay.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:21.160]   This Tuesday, of course, last Tuesday, Apple revealed his swipe keyboard.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:26.680]   Costa tweeted, "So now we know, C and court."
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:32.640]   And now he is suing Apple for being Sherlock, and actually has a pretty strong complaint.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.440]   And actually, he sued in March.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:39.400]   So it sounds like exactly...
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:45.480]   We don't know the truth behind this until, once again, as with Epic, that Apple is forced
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.360]   to give up documents and forced to give up internal communications.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.320]   And that's one of the reasons why it's important that they have this out.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:58.520]   Because the accusations that developers are making are pretty darn horrible.
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.520]   This isn't as bad.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.000]   Oh, well, gosh, you think that Apple would never have come up with the idea of having
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.480]   a keyboard on the Apple Watch if you hadn't given them the idea?
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   Come on.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.160]   But no, that's not the allegation he's making.
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:16.320]   He's making that the engineer in charge of mobile keyboards was gushing over this app,
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.120]   loved it, say, "Please demo it for us.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.760]   Maybe we should even buy it from you."
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:24.280]   And then, as soon as that big demo happened, he's alleging Domino's immediately started
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.280]   falling.
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.440]   And almost, by the time his takeout order from lunch was cold, he was told, "Oh, no,
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.200]   we've suddenly decided that because your app is a keyboard app for the watch, it can't
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:39.320]   be in the app store anymore, so we're removing it immediately."
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:43.360]   And then he was saying that he did nothing when other developers stole the idea and put
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.400]   that on the app store as well.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.840]   So this is a lot of stuff that, again, it's unknown how much of this is true, unknown
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.680]   who has the right side of this.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:57.240]   But this is the sort of thing where, as people who hope that Apple acts positively in as
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:01.960]   many of their interactions as possible, it's going to be very, very important for them
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:02.960]   to put forth.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.600]   No, this absolutely did not happen.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:10.000]   And when you hand over, when we hand over internal communications, you're going to see
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   that that was not the tone of the conversations we were having internally.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.440]   So let me get the timeline correct because it's a...
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.320]   I'm myself confused.
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.080]   January of 2019 shows it to them, they pull it from the store.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.560]   Apple says, "Oh, it was a mistake.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.560]   We put it back."
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.560]   Well, that took a year.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.400]   January 2020, flick type was returned to the Apple store.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.480]   In fact, became one of the number one paid app in the entire store.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.760]   It made $130,000 in the first month.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:39.280]   It was one of Apple's top paid apps in 2020.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:42.320]   He sued in March saying, "That year cost me."
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.960]   Well, you can see it's kind of...
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:49.960]   Might it cost me as much as a million dollars and lost revenue that I would have had.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:57.160]   And now he expects because of Apple putting that functionality into the watch, it's the
[01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:59.360]   end of the line for flick type.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.360]   No.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:05.080]   So what I wasn't clear about reading the article was whether the rule existed before or after
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.080]   he showed a tap-o.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:12.720]   Was there a rule that said you can't have a keyboard on a watch before he showed it?
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.800]   Because what it sounds like is what will be interesting to see is the engineer goes,
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.800]   "Wow, this is great."
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.600]   He goes to his supervisor, "Hey, you're not allowed to do that."
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600]   You can't do that.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.520]   That's against the rule that already exists.
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:24.520]   So that might have been...
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.520]   There's often like...
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.520]   That's how that happens real quick.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.520]   Go ahead.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.520]   There's usually this issue.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.160]   They keep the rules ambiguous because they want some wiggle room because what Steve Jobs
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.560]   said was unexpected cause.
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:36.200]   They never want to say there's no rule preventing this.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.560]   So suddenly there's porn all over the store.
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.000]   So they keep it unnecessarily ambiguous.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.280]   But also they have very conflicting goals internally.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:47.840]   Many years they'll have a new app that's approved by the review team and plastered all over
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:52.720]   the app stores like a shining example of what is possible with a new operating system.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:56.880]   And because app review or some other faction in Apple is super busy at release time, they
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.880]   don't even see it.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.680]   Then they go back two weeks later to go, "No, we just generally don't think this is going
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:01.680]   to be a good experience.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.680]   We don't want this to be encouraged.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:05.480]   So we're going to reject the app and then people will know we don't want it anymore."
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.400]   And that's like the worst way, the most evil way to deal with people who are working so
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.800]   hard on your platform.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.080]   And I'm reminded always of James Thompson who Apple internally said, "Yeah, we're making
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.400]   these new widgets but there's no way anybody could fit anything active in there."
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.640]   And James Thompson was like, "Oh, I can't.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.840]   I can put a whole calculator in there."
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.560]   And then it got approved, it got showcased, highlighted, look at the amazing widgets.
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.560]   And then they saw they go, "Oh, but we don't want to encourage people putting apps in widgets.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:31.120]   We'll reject it and then people will learn.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.280]   They're not supposed to put it."
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.680]   And again, it is just the worst way to interact with developers.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:38.200]   But it happens over and over again.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.400]   And my guess is that this will be a double tragedy because I'm sure someone in Apple
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:42.800]   loved this keyboard.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:47.680]   Someone else said, "We don't want to encourage this on the watch just as a blanket BS philosophical
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:48.680]   thing."
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.320]   And then someone else said, "Oh my God, this is so good.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.320]   I'm going to make it."
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.520]   And none of them talk to each other.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:55.160]   And now thanks to Apple Legal, they can't talk to anybody.
[01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:59.200]   And it'll be a whole withdrawn out legal process when it should have just been someone
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.200]   at Apple going, "Oh, this is amazing.
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.040]   Can we buy it from you, please?"
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.800]   Hey, speaking of James Thompson, are you in regular touch with him?
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.520]   Because I'm a little worried about him.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:11.000]   Did you read his blog post?
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.080]   I saw him tweeting, though, and I said him a lot of his blog, "Three Letter Acronom."
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:19.680]   It's a TLA.systems.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:20.760]   It talks about burnout.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.360]   And he sounds severely burnout.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:31.160]   I didn't realize he's had chronic neuropathy for 20 years, which means unspecified pain
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:36.360]   that they can't find and cause for a treat.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:41.080]   And then he's losing his vision and his eye, and I'm starting to feel really bad for him.
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.720]   He says, "I'm not trying to ask for pity.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:50.640]   He's just saying we should all be, we're all a bit broken right now.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:56.400]   And pretending to each other everything is fine is not actually helping anybody.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.000]   Life is not normal."
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.080]   So James, we love you.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.120]   We love what you do.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:05.040]   And I hope everything's going to be okay.
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.360]   And if there's anything we can do, let us know.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:13.760]   And everybody should go out, run out and buy peak elk, which is his bread and butter.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.680]   But he's always day in date.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.200]   Anytime a new thing, we joked, "Oh, you're going to have the first Calcutta on the TV."
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.200]   And he's like, "I am."
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:24.720]   Well, that's one of the reasons he says that he hasn't been doing a lot this year.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.120]   You haven't seen the regular updates that you'd normally see.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.840]   So I'm actually glad you wrote about it.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.240]   He wasn't asking for sympathy or pity.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:35.160]   He was saying, "Look, we got to all speak up because we're all suffering a little bit."
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:40.000]   And I have to say, the return of the pandemic has not been a well.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.320]   2020 junior has not been fine.
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:45.080]   2020 plus one.
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:48.320]   So anyway, James, take care.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.280]   And if any of you are in touch with them, please give him our best.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.800]   You are your own most successful and beloved product.
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.800]   Everything else is just bonus.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:58.800]   I agree.
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:15:59.800]   I agree.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:00.800]   There are panda.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.680]   It's a very, very important part of the Apple community.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.600]   And not just as a developer, but as a person.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:08.600]   So.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.080]   Telling him right now.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.080]   Good.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:17.240]   When I read that blog post, I was like, "I had no idea because you wouldn't know."
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.240]   And you talked to him.
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.240]   You wouldn't know.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240]   I had no idea.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240]   I had no idea.
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:26.360]   Can I just say as an aside that this is one of the fundamental precepts of human interaction,
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:32.720]   particularly online, that people who you think are doing just great oftentimes are not.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.000]   They're just really great at making you think they're doing great because that's part of
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.600]   what, how they're coping with.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.600]   They're not great situation.
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.560]   I tell my kids that all the time.
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.640]   Don't judge your insides by other people's outsides.
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:48.840]   What you see on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok is the presentation.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.640]   We talk about it a lot.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.640]   You don't know.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.760]   They could be having the worst day of their life when they say like, even if they say something
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.760]   mean to you on Twitter.
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.520]   It might be literally the worst day of their life.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.800]   I always keep that in mind.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.600]   When people are mean, I have to remind myself, it's about what's going on with them, not
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.080]   what's going on with me.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.080]   That's hard.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.080]   It's very hard.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.560]   That's why I totally turn off whenever someone says, "Oh, wait till you see this total Karen
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.160]   have a total meltdown."
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:13.160]   Okay.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:19.040]   Again, maybe she is being extremely mean and unfair to this employee somewhere, but you
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:24.480]   don't know what kind of email, what kind of text messages they just got from her ex-wife
[01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:26.840]   about what's happening with the divorce proceedings.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.200]   That happened right after being shouted down in seven different meetings at work.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:37.120]   We try to be at our best every time, but sometimes it's like we have exactly one gallon
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.200]   of coping in the tank.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:45.080]   Oh boy, if you tell me that the dry cleaning that was going to be picked up at 4pm won't
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:51.280]   be ready till 4.20 and I just got one milliliter of this stuff left, bad things can happen.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.280]   That's understandable.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.280]   Great break.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.280]   We have lots more to talk about.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.280]   Renee Ricci is here.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.280]   YouTube.com/Renee Ricci.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.720]   He has a very good, very detailed video reviewing the new iPhones.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.720]   Awesome.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.080]   And maybe someday he'll have something to say about the new iPad mini.
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.320]   If he doesn't, I will because I'm getting it Friday.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.320]   Good.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.320]   I can't wait.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:12.960]   I want to see you do that.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:17.120]   And I am not under an embargo of any kind as you will know.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.560]   Of course, as a result, it caused me a lot of money.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.560]   I buy this stuff.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.040]   Andy and Echo, he's here.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:28.840]   And Andy, you and I, I have to say, I am going to buy the Pixel 6, I'm pretty sure.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:34.200]   So you know, yeah, that may be that may be what I'm saving money for.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:35.200]   It'll be again.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.200]   Or the Pixel Fold.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.600]   Yeah, there's a very strong rumor that they have a folding phone.
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:40.600]   They'll announce it.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.120]   Looking forward to that next month is like their software better than Samsung's.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.120]   And I want to.
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.840]   Well, I'm bummed because I bought the flip phone.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:54.880]   Okay, can I say that I love the vibrant environment we have in flexibility tomorrow?
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:01.160]   It looks like Microsoft will almost certainly reveal like the next edition of their Surface
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:07.520]   Duo, which last year, if you're talking about wanting to like use a try to use an iPad mini
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.520]   as a phone.
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:11.160]   Now, some of these some of these seems less ridiculous.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:15.320]   If how about an iPad me with a hint like an actual hinge in the middle and two screens
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.320]   that flop down.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.320]   I just got to take my eyes.
[01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:22.120]   I bought it when it came out and returned it within the time frame because it was $1,500.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.680]   And also not really.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:27.640]   I loved the hardware, but the software didn't live up to it.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.000]   I love the idea if developers absolutely embraced and got on board the same way that
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.320]   they got on board development for multi touch full screen apps on the iPhone.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.200]   It could be really, really something.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:43.640]   It's not going to tempt me in my again mythical envelope filled with money that's taped to
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.320]   the bottom of my desk for waiting to buy the next.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:49.080]   My next top to my Lisa's credit card.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.480]   I'm just saying.
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:56.920]   I mean, you know, just saying actually, you know, her billing address.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.080]   This is always a very.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.200]   I've always thought the Lisa was wonderful.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.120]   I've always said such wonderful things about her and everything she does.
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.760]   Can I just add one quick thing?
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:12.120]   So I was watching Linus, Linus Sebastian, Linus Tech Tips video about the different Samsung
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:16.360]   flip phones and how YouTube creator studio was completely broken in different ways on
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:19.840]   every single one of them, including the amount of menu options you get for incredibly
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.840]   bog standard things.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:24.920]   And he was just saying, but then like every year when there's a new iPhone before the
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.200]   embargo, Instagram is broken.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.880]   Like you can't use the search box.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.520]   The things are way too.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:31.520]   This is on iOS.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:36.400]   I think it's so easy for you to have apps and the screen size doesn't even change like
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.960]   year to year, almost years.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:43.480]   You have one manufacturer, you know, making all the hardware and the software.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.520]   Well, and Instagram is still broken.
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:51.960]   It's a lot of it has to do with people writing their own libraries.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:56.280]   So that's so when you see it and I'm getting broken, you're it's because they decided I
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280]   want to stop way.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.280]   They want to do it.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280]   I want to do it my way rather than making it.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.600]   Also, hard code devices, which means that it doesn't understand it.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.600]   It's the exact same screen.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:08.880]   It's all designed to handle that.
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:13.040]   It can, but there's things like I'm working on anyway.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.760]   I've worked on projects where you do have to hard code things because you just can't
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.000]   get it to work.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.600]   Like it's not doing what you wanted to do.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:22.400]   And you're going, okay, I'm just going to freeze this right here and make this work.
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.120]   And so, so the thing is, is that the hard coding is sometimes because you're trying to
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:32.200]   do something that the system just won't do in its automatic mode.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.320]   And so there is a reason to do that, but it does every time you do that, you're putting
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:38.640]   a string that something's going to get pulled and it's going to rip apart something on the
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.240]   other side of the door.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:41.400]   And so you have to be very careful.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:45.080]   We try to lean towards off the shelf.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:52.520]   I mean, like Apple's libraries stepping away from that is like last resort.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.160]   Like I can't, we can't figure out how to do this.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.840]   We're just going to make it and do it this way.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.480]   But a lot of people get creative and they think, oh, I can do it better.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:03.360]   And so they start doing that, but can you do it better with every update is the question.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:04.360]   Right.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360]   And so you.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.360]   And they have a safe zone.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.920]   Like they did their own safe zone for the notch and it doesn't work.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:10.520]   It's like all, they're the pictures going underneath the bar.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.520]   Oh, look at that.
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.520]   And it's, oh, things are too nice to run.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.520]   That's why I'm writing their own libraries.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:19.520]   You know, the search bar is underneath the notch on either writing their own libraries
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.960]   are hard coding, hard coding dimensions.
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:24.960]   It's more likely to me.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.400]   And I think that's really ridiculous.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.000]   And I know you're trying to get commercial, I will let you do that.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.160]   But I couldn't leave without mentioning that as I've been talking about iPad, iPadOS, even
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:39.120]   there, even Apple is having those kinds of problems where when you have a couple of different
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:43.800]   apps side by side, the tops are not, they don't match.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:47.640]   Like they both, they both, they both have the same like, you know, a triple dot navigation
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.120]   thing that's new in iPad in the new iPadOS.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:54.200]   But it's like one app, they decided to color all the way to the top of the edge of the
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.200]   screen.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:59.040]   And the other one decided that they're going to like honor the, whatever the background
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.800]   color of the, of the menu bar or the, the, the hardware dingle bar is supposed to be.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.920]   And it's like, oh, Apple can't even get this is one reason I love.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.080]   Can't control developers.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:16.280]   I love Reddit because every OCD person in the world posts on Reddit, you know, this
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.360]   dot should be over by two million people.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.360]   It's hysterical.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.360]   I love it, especially, especially like me.
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:25.960]   For a really big company is just different teams with different opinions about how, how
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.960]   much of you execute it.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:31.360]   Also, if you're not in the Apple world, if you're a programmer in general, these are,
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.640]   these are things every programmer deals with all the time on everything.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:37.040]   So there's, you know, there's incompatible libraries.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.400]   This is something that this is a battle programmers are fighting all the time.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:45.120]   So they don't, you know, sometimes it's just easier to hard to go to mention.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.520]   They fixed some of that.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.760]   I mean, it's a, it's born to trouble.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   Just as sure.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:53.640]   We're precisely andy-in-a-co with words of wisdom.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:57.280]   Also here, Alex Lindsay from 090 dot media.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.680]   We should give them a plug.
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:02.520]   Your day job, which is fun things for two minutes.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:03.520]   Usually streaming.
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:10.000]   We, you know, we, it's fun because it's, I mean, you know, office hours is a, is this
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.440]   incredible connection with all these people all over the world.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.000]   And we're talking about production and everything else.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.840]   And then, you know, and I know, you know, mostly what I get to do is I'm going to do
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:19.240]   streams that no one's ever done before.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:24.120]   You apply most of you don't get to see the very information and then bring it back.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:29.760]   And so we, we really are out on the bleeding edge of, you know, quality and streams.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:34.360]   Actually, that's really a great reason to go to office hours and stay up on the cutting
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   edge.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.000]   That's where I find everybody now.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.440]   Like, like I just, I, the first place I'm like, okay, so we, we, we will staff through
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:43.800]   office hours and when we can't find someone, then we hire someone outside of office hours,
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:46.680]   but it's become kind of my parabolic mic man.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.240]   Where could I go to find?
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.080]   Well, well, and what's funny is that there's just people that have been doing this for
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.080]   20 years.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.080]   It's not like me training everybody.
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.080]   No, no, no.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.360]   You're showing up that, that have 30 years experience or 20 years experience.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.080]   And, and I just get to find them.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:02.040]   You know, like it's, that's the hardest part is, is being able to, when you're doing the
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:04.840]   kind of work that I do, finding a specialist, I don't care where they are in the world,
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:06.280]   I just need to know where they are.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:11.400]   So office hours gives me that it's the modern version of that book that used to come out
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:12.400]   every year.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.400]   My production pub.
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.200]   That would have everybody's name in it.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.960]   This is a much more modern version of that.
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.400]   And I actually know them.
[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:23.560]   Like, the thing is, they're not, they're not a list of like a person in LA.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.560]   It's like, I know that person.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:25.560]   I know.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.560]   I hang out with them and after hours all the time.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:28.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:30.560]   Exactly.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.560]   It's kind of cool.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.560]   Actually.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:36.360]   Our show today brought to you by AT and T who reminds you, if they're friends and family,
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.000]   you haven't talked to it a while.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.320]   Don't worry.
[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:45.440]   It's never too late to reconnect to help AT&T is offering deals on the latest smartphones.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.660]   That's not complicated.
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:48.300]   "Everyone deserves something new."
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:54.280]   So AT&T is giving new and existing customers their best deals on every smartphone, even
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.360]   the latest ones.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:56.880]   Restrictions and exceptions may apply.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:59.980]   Visit att.com for details.
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:05.100]   We thank AT&T for supporting Mac break weekly.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.100]   Right on.
[01:26:06.100 --> 01:26:07.100]   Right on.
[01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:08.100]   Right on.
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.100]   Right on.
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:15.240]   The got Andy and I have offline been going back and forth about the employee unrest going
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.760]   on at Apple.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:23.320]   And it's always been my contention that it's hard to know what the real story is because
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:26.520]   employees or ex-employees are not constrained.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:27.520]   They can talk.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:28.520]   They can tweet.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.320]   But HR and companies can't.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:35.360]   And having been in some situations, similar situations myself, I'm always aware of the
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.400]   fact that we don't know the whole story.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:44.640]   But it does seem like Tim Cook is facing more and more unrest from employees.
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.040]   There's an #AppleTo movement.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:53.000]   There are employees, activist employees who asked him at an all hands meeting on Friday
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.560]   what he was going to do about pay equity because there's concern that women and people
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:04.720]   of color are not getting paid equally to white men.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:10.120]   Andy I'm going to let you speak about this because I think now it really has become a
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.120]   story.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:18.640]   Once the New York Times devotes a very well done story that has also has information about
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:23.200]   all hands and all hands webcast that Tim Cook has done.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.880]   We should give credit to questions.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:28.040]   Jack Nicass and Kellen Browning the authors of that story.
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.040]   And you are absolutely true.
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:36.480]   There have been a couple of very high profile stories over the past several months.
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:42.040]   And as you say, it's hard to know who's right, who's wrong or what's in the middle.
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:47.000]   And that's why you're kind of grateful when these stories come out and they decide that
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:54.080]   they're going to file a suit with the or a complaint with the National Labor Board because
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:59.240]   then you have an independent government investigation that gets to the root of this.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:05.640]   And my difficulty with a lot of this is that a lot of the complaints seem to follow a roadmap
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:10.320]   that's really, really been common at Google, at Facebook and other companies that have
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:16.360]   had more public complaints about these in the past where I'm not saying this is what
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.360]   Apple's doing.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.760]   I'm saying this is the roadmap that we've been seeing where an employee, usually female,
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:24.600]   makes a complaint to HR about something.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:29.480]   They keep complaining beyond the point at which this large company is interested in continuing
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:35.440]   to talk about it, at which point they are put on this conveyor belt that of recognizable
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.800]   step by step by step.
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:41.320]   Here's how we get you out of the company without saying we fired you for making complaints.
[01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:47.000]   And so these stories over the past year got my attention at Apple because the things that
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.320]   they've been reporting have been again this same playbook over and over again, which is
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.280]   why I've been eager to see an independent Labor Safety Labor Protection Board talk about
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:28:57.280]   this.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:02.160]   This complaint that seems to be very consistent, however, is not necessarily specific, oh,
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:06.480]   hey, equity, oh, they're not treating certain types of employees correctly, but that there
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:12.000]   is a culture of secrecy at Apple, no duh, but that this cultural secrecy is so deeply
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:17.200]   ingrained that it also intimidates workers into not complaining that it creates a culture
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.160]   of keep your re-app shut, be grateful, and keep your head down.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:24.280]   Yeah, that's where it becomes more of a story for us.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:30.240]   Less of a, I mean, Labor stories aren't really our bailiwick, but I'll read you the quote
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.400]   from Anikas and Keller's article in The New York Times.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:38.960]   A common theme is that Apple's secrecy has created a culture that discourages employees
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:43.600]   from speaking out about their workplace concerns, not with coworkers, not with the press, and
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.240]   not on social media.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:50.080]   Complaints about problematic managers or colleagues are frequently dismissed and workers are afraid
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.680]   to criticize how the company does business.
[01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:58.240]   Apple is a big company, 150,000 employees, any big company is going to have bad managers,
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:00.680]   is going to have problems.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:04.320]   It's more the culture, maybe, that is the problem at Apple that's--
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.480]   Of course, people who are good at managing up a terrible at managing down.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:08.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.760]   And that happens everywhere.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:17.160]   Look, who hasn't had a job with a manager who the boss loved, but his reports did not.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.000]   That happens all the time.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.760]   Yeah, and it does tie in with, I mean, I've been following Apple since, professionally
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:29.320]   since the '90s, and that involves friendships with people who've been working at Apple anywhere
[01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:32.280]   from a couple of years to a couple of decades.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:37.840]   And this is a constant theme that I keep hearing that they'll say, "Oh, how have you
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:40.280]   lasted at Apple so long?"
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:44.880]   And almost a direct quote is often thought, "Well, I try to make sure that my boss knows
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:49.720]   who I am, maybe my boss is boss knows who I am, but I work very, very hard to make sure
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:51.640]   that no one else knows who I am."
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:56.640]   Especially Steve, you never wanted Steve to know who you were.
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.040]   Well, it is one thing that--
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.640]   For me, elevator alone with Steve.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:06.400]   In the past 20 years, I've had a variety of partnership interactions and so on and so
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.640]   forth.
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:12.120]   And to that point, to what Andy just said, you always wanted to go with the folks that
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:17.640]   were in the trenches and try to stay away from the executives just because you just didn't--
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:19.360]   Once things went sideways--
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.280]   At every company, not just Apple.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.280]   At every company.
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:23.280]   It really is.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:31.520]   The fundamental thing is that it is a-- it's very common in corporate culture too, because
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.800]   there's always a joke in a variety of different corporations, so I think all things are the
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:41.760]   same as their own, which is that you can say whatever you want in the last day.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:49.160]   So, but in a lot of corporate cultures, once you start to-- like, whether it's a Google
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:55.400]   or Facebook or Apple or whatever, if you reach your head up and start complaining about things,
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:59.120]   you may still work there, but you've basically created a ceiling that you're going to live
[01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:01.000]   in under for the rest of your career there.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.600]   You're going to have to move somewhere else.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.920]   And they're going to have to not know.
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.640]   If you're going from one big corporation to another, they have to not know about your
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:13.440]   history for you to get to move up, because as soon as you complain in any of these corporations
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:21.200]   like that, you've set up-- you've poured some concrete above your head, and that's just
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.400]   the reality of it.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.400]   And that's every corporation.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:24.400]   That's human nature.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:27.120]   You've got to go along to get along.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.120]   That's really always--
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:36.240]   So long as we're identifying this as an absolute BS problem that exists among large corporations,
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.240]   it shouldn't happen.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.920]   That's what we need to do away with, and that we need to have higher expectations, particularly
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:45.800]   of a company like Apple that puts itself as sort of above other companies in terms of
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.800]   doing the right thing.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.800]   Well, there's also--
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:50.440]   But if we're saying that, oh, well, what do you expect?
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:56.440]   no, if you don't like having your office pump with radon, maybe you don't deserve
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:57.440]   to work it properly.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:58.440]   Right.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:01.920]   I think Apple has a unique problem here, because your greatest strength is often your
[01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:02.920]   greatest weakness.
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:06.080]   And I don't mean this to sound trite, but their culture has been incredibly valuable for
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:09.400]   them, but it also has an equal and opposite negative effect.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.640]   I remember back in the iPhone and 10 to 8 days, if you had a case on your phone, you
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:15.200]   were not case loyal to the company.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.200]   Right.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:20.200]   And that sounds ridiculous, but that's the sort of groupthink that comes into here.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:24.400]   And I think as a company, you've got to be especially careful when your culture is such
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:29.760]   a known, empowering force that the negative consequences are anticipated and specifically
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.760]   assigned to somebody to keep an eye out for and to fix.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:33.760]   I just want to clarify.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.760]   I miss so much.
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.800]   I want to clarify, I'm not saying that it should be that way.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:42.240]   I'm just saying that it's a really, it's a, it is a day, like the folks that get to the
[01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:46.160]   very top, if you're talking to those executives, they are masters of it.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:51.760]   Like they, you know, they have figured out a way to, you know, the facade of how they
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.080]   interact with things.
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.440]   If you're working with them, you have to be super sensitive to them closing their eye
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:33:59.440]   a little bit.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:00.440]   That might be them.
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.440]   That might be them upset.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:06.840]   You think it feels like Tim Cook would not be sense, would not be that.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:09.920]   I mean, it feels like he would be very sensitive to any of these issues.
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:12.080]   I think there's people on top of him.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:13.080]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.080]   It's not just Tim Cook.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:20.960]   But I think also there's, there is a, you, you, when you get into these, into these
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:25.440]   situations, I mean, I think the hard part is it's oftentimes there, he said, she said,
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.040]   there are people being, you know, upset about things.
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.680]   And so it just goes through its process.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:34.080]   I think that every, every company is trying to solve this in some way, shape, or form.
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:37.720]   It's not, it's just a lot of human beings around a lot of other human beings, you know,
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:40.200]   and so that's always going to be an issue.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.120]   You know, and so it's, it's, it definitely needs to be fixed, but we need to be clear
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:47.440]   that I mean, I had, I, you know, for a long time, I had a company with only 30 people
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.800]   and we had all kinds of problems.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:52.360]   And so I look at, I look at 100,000, I'm like, oh, I know, I know.
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.360]   I'm with you.
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:54.360]   Right there with you.
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:57.440]   I want to give some special thanks to Andy here because Andy is one of the people that
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.600]   like, Andy is my gold standard when it comes to journalism.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:02.920]   And whenever I have any question, he is so beyond generous in answering it for me and
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:03.920]   helping me.
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.480]   And my big concern here, which I spoke to Andy about and he was super helpful was that
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:10.920]   I worry about, like, I don't mind making fun of Epic, you know, Epic's a company.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:13.000]   They have billions of dollars.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.960]   Not just fun of like, I'm a kind of Apple and Epic, but when it's a giant company like
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:19.960]   Epic Apple against a specific human that I've put a phase to, I just feel like I have
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:23.800]   to be so careful, not because like, I'm, I'm worried about damaging a person who might
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:28.400]   be severely damaged already, just unintentionally, but also one person.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.320]   I think this is a problem with the companies.
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:31.720]   One person is easily dismissed.
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:33.600]   Like they could say, what's going on in your organization?
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.520]   Oh, that person has a history of being, you know, overly sensitive about this stuff.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:38.520]   Oh, okay.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.520]   It's fine.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.720]   But that's why I think it's so important that Apple does this writ large and like has vast
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.440]   probes of information about this because once it's a thousand people, it's very hard to
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.040]   dismiss, you know, 10,000 people impossible to dismiss.
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.040]   And that's when it, that's when it becomes an EC issue.
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:57.440]   And if I also think it's important for Apple to examine the whole, because I have to say
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:01.080]   there's parallels between this and how the app store is handled.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:03.600]   And so there's cultural, it might be hard.
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:07.160]   There might be some cultural dysfunction that Apple needs to really look at the dress to
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.840]   become a better company.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:14.360]   I wanted to compare it to how they work with, how they deal with contract labor in China,
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:19.280]   where I think Apple has an exceptional record in this regard where this is to the point
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:22.680]   of, oh, it's hard to run a company at this scale and not have these problems.
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.360]   That is absolutely true when you're trying to manufacture something at scale to make
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:30.760]   sure that every worker who handles something that goes into your phone is being treated
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:34.640]   fairly fairly is not being abused, is being paid exactly what they've been promised to
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:35.640]   be paid.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:38.280]   And their health and well being is being considered at every step.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:42.880]   That's a, that's a problem that no company is going to be be rid of.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.960]   Apple however did treat that like it was a very, very important priority.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.920]   And while it is still a problem because it is impossible to completely solve it, I do
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:54.720]   think they have deserved a very, very good record reputation for being, look, if you're
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:58.800]   a subcontractor, if you want to lose this contract with Apple, here's how you do it.
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:03.120]   You screw up these terms in the contract that are absolutely explicit and that will be followed
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.560]   up on point by point by point before this contract is renewed.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:11.600]   So that's why I think that Apple should be able to not solve these problems, but at least
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:16.480]   show that they have a more of an active interest than let's get rid of this troublemaker.
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:20.480]   And the other, and the other reason why this is a, I should mention that this is such a,
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:27.160]   this New York Times article is so valuable that it does, it is incredible that Tim Cook,
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.920]   Friday Tim Cook apples, you answered questions from workers and an all staff meeting for
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.920]   the first time since these concerns surface publicly.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:39.920]   Isn't it incredible that we are seeing in print description of an all hands meeting inside
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.120]   Apple just like the day that happened.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.520]   And one of the things that I thought, in other words, leaked by an employee.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.760]   I was like, how do you was live tweeting it until somebody yelled at her to stop, which
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:51.520]   is I've not seen that before.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:52.520]   Right.
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:55.840]   But what I want to get to that one of the topics that was brought to him is like, what,
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:59.440]   how are you going to deal with Apple employees who work in Texas who now have to deal with
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:02.760]   this incredible anti-abortion law.
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:09.880]   And he said that the company insurance coverage for the time being will cover travel
[01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:13.880]   expenses for people who can't get an abortion without leaving the state.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.000]   And I thought that that was exactly sort of pro act.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.560]   Look, you are a multi trillion dollar company.
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:22.280]   You actually, and you also have control over your own health insurance because of the way
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.480]   you've chosen to do it.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.720]   So you have the ability to say, guess what?
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:30.640]   If you, this, we, we think of this not as a legal issue or as a moral issue, but as
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.480]   appropriately as a woman's health issue.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.920]   And so if you, if you decide that this is a, this is a procedure you need, we are not
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.100]   going to let Texas law get in your way.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:44.280]   We will pay for you to travel to a state where this thing is accessible and safe.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.280]   So Google has had similar problems, Andy and.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.280]   Absolutely.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.280]   I think has fumbled it.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.280]   That's best I can tell.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:57.960]   I mean, this is again, most notably how they, I would still objectively say fire Dr. Tim
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:04.440]   Nick Iberu, they're, they're one of their two top ethical artificial intelligence research
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:08.880]   researchers that like this is why this, some of these stories come out of Apple concerned
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:13.840]   me because once again, it's a playbook where you have to, they realize that, okay, this
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:18.120]   is now this, this problem that we're having with us, one employee has is now above the
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:21.600]   surface of that which above which PR can contain.
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.240]   We are obviously going to fire her because we don't want her anymore, but we can't answer
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.200]   the question that, oh, well, we fired her because she was raising problems, raising questions
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:33.880]   about our ethical review of our own research.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:38.800]   We have to be able to say, oh, well, oh, it broke our hearts that she's tendered her resignation
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:44.280]   immediately, but we hate it to accept it, but we wish her well and oh, how hard?
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:46.640]   Well, no, that's not, and she's saying no, that's not what I said.
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.400]   I said that we have to talk about this.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.360]   We don't, we have to then talk about like what my exit is going to be.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:57.960]   Similarly, one of the reports is that someone was someone had requested and was received
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:04.800]   voluntary leave at the end of this, she was charged with disseminating internal product
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:07.600]   facing Apple secrets, and that's the reason.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.800]   And she refused to cooperate with an internal investigation upon her breach of security.
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.680]   And for this reason, oh, we were disappointed in her, but she was fired.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:22.720]   But her side of it is that, no, I responded to that email immediately saying that, hey,
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:27.920]   let's do this via email because now that I have a grievance filed with the end of the
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:31.240]   NLRB, I really want to have a record of this heard nothing back.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:35.040]   I said, well, because you refuse to talk to us about this, I'm afraid our interaction
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.040]   is determined.
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:38.160]   That's the sort of stuff that kind of gets you bothered.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.600]   And largely the other thing that even as the stuff was going down with Google and with
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:47.040]   other companies, it is notable that we have to be, we haven't been hearing these stories
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.600]   coming out of Apple.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:52.560]   And that means that either a what we're have will be hope is happening is happening, which
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.200]   is that Apple is not having these problems and certainly not at this scale because they
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:02.960]   are handling these issues in a much more positive way away that we would more approve of, or
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:08.320]   be they're just really, really good at either directly or indirectly intimidating people
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:14.400]   to keep your yap shut, except the resolution we have provided for you, which we have deemed
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:20.200]   to be an appropriate resolution to your complaint and enjoy the burritos in the lunchroom.
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:24.040]   So this is this is why it is a very positive thing to have these things come out.
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:30.080]   A, it shows that people are finding less feeling less intimidated by the process and that we
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:35.080]   will have objective third parties look at these complaints and find out is there a huge
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:40.400]   issue that we've been overlooking all along, or is this, as we've been talking about one
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.480]   possibility, this is a company with 150,000 employees, they're not going to handle every
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:50.720]   single issue as well as we would like simply by virtue of scale, but there is no endemic
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:54.240]   problem of employee abuse inside of Apple.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:59.080]   Meanwhile, Ted Lasso got seven, I'm sorry, eleven.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:01.080]   I'm sorry, one last thing.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.080]   Yes, please do.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.400]   All right, I was trying to try to move on.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:06.120]   This is just a general thing about tech.
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.280]   One of the issues, I don't want to call it a problem, one of the issues in tech in general
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:13.320]   is that these are all young feisty upstart companies.
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:14.720]   They do not have crisis PR.
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:16.000]   They don't have crisis advisors.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.360]   Some of them bring them in, but like companies like the auto industry, politics.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360]   Yeah, they've been through this a few times.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:24.520]   Big companies, they have teams, they have advisors, they have people who know how to handle all.
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:28.920]   These tech companies, it's left to product people basically to handle, and that's why
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:34.080]   I think we see so much more friction in tech media than we see in a lot of more established
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.080]   industries.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:38.080]   Yeah, I'll just one quick response.
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:41.600]   Apple was the last time they were doomed was the mid-90s, and they'd already been in
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.800]   business for 20 years before then.
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:46.320]   They are also, again, a more federal company.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:47.320]   They can't...
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:51.200]   They can't claim that, "Oh, well, what do you expect from us?
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:54.680]   We were only a two-trilling dollar company and we're only 50 years old.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:57.200]   We're still finding our feet in this.
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.840]   We're still just two slap-happy hippies in a garage from the crazy world.
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:02.840]   I'm not excusing it.
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:03.840]   I'm just saying it's not an mentality.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.840]   It's not an...
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:09.240]   There's another difference in the tech industry, which is there is...
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:14.120]   The engineers have a lot more power in the workplace than an auto worker on an assembly
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.120]   line.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:22.760]   Even though they haven't unionized at Google or Apple, the engineers have a huge amount
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:24.560]   of value to the company.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:25.560]   And as a result...
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.560]   And there's no unions.
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:27.560]   And there's no unions.
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:29.960]   And they have, as a result, a big voice.
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:36.120]   And so I think that it's very different from old line industrial...
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:37.120]   Absolutely.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.120]   Of course.
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:40.840]   This isn't like another story about labor at...
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:45.080]   I won't name the company, but it's one of the happier places on earth, apparently.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:50.360]   About consumer-facing employees who are on food stamps.
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.360]   Exactly.
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:53.400]   After all, after all, it really is.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:58.720]   And the workplace that they get paid so little and they're living because their place of
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:04.120]   work is a popular tourist destination, they have to live so far away in order to just find
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:09.160]   a place they can afford to stay in that a lot of them are on food stamps, a lot of them
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:16.200]   are... have times of where they can't feed themselves and they don't have homes.
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.400]   So this is the...
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.400]   Most of the worst...
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:21.400]   Exactly.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:26.080]   So I'm saying that these engineers, at least that they are being paid well, they can afford
[01:44:26.080 --> 01:44:27.080]   to live with their living.
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:32.200]   They can afford to feed their families, but that still doesn't mean that...
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:37.320]   And the handcuffs that are usually referred to here at the Golden Handcuffs, which are
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:38.320]   the 401ks.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:44.560]   And a lot of what keeps people from saying anything is that they're going to make millions
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:47.040]   if they don't rock the boat.
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:49.080]   And so that keeps a lot of people pretty quiet and pretty...
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:52.240]   It keeps their head down because literally you're there for...
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:53.240]   It's been a big...
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.240]   A lot of people have bought houses and cash with what they made at Apple by staying there
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:58.800]   long enough.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.000]   And so staying there long enough is part of the game.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.400]   And some people just don't do it, they just go, "Okay, I gotta go."
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:08.560]   It's usually not because they're being mistreated, it's just because it's a big corporation.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.320]   And it just works like a big corporation.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.320]   And so...
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:18.160]   But I think that a lot of times when you see people with any of these companies, the 401ks
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:21.320]   are significant.
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:28.680]   And people think about that a lot when they decide they're going to speak up.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:32.520]   My workers are being beaten with Hermes whips that's really quite luxurious.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:39.800]   I'm just saying that's why the calculations for a lot of people is just that there's
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.280]   a lot of...
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:46.560]   You know, not getting moved from level five to level six over your career, it's not so
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:48.400]   much you're going to get fired for saying something.
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:51.840]   It's that you're not going to go from whatever it is, level four to level five or level five
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:53.200]   to level six.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.880]   And that delta will cost you a million dollars.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:46:00.280]   You know, like that's not getting fired but just not moving up.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.640]   And so that's a deep calculation in that process.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:08.040]   Don't you think though that that leads to inherently to abuse by management saying that
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:12.720]   we can really push these people around a lot farther than we could if they had the wherewithal
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:13.960]   to leave immediately?
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.720]   I think you have a handful of...
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:19.600]   With 150,000 people, you have a lot of people that are going to be problematic, you know,
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:22.440]   both on the management side and on the employee side.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:23.440]   And so I think that there's...
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.080]   I mean, again, I had a very small version of that and it was a lot.
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:30.880]   And so I can't imagine it being multiplied.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.040]   And so the thing is that when we see tens or hundreds of people being upset, you know,
[01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.080]   I mean, maybe there's a lot more.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.600]   I don't know that.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:45.360]   But something under 1% I think is still an anomaly.
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.760]   Most of these companies when you are working inside of them, you know, the amount of care
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:55.120]   they take towards most of these things because they just look at every person complaining
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.320]   to a labor board is a huge liability for the corporation.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.840]   It's super expensive for them to have that happen.
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:09.080]   And so most people in these companies that are brazenly problematic as far as managers
[01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:12.840]   don't last very long, you know, unless they're really high performance, but most of them
[01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:15.360]   don't last very long in there because they just can't...
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:18.640]   People complaining internally is still too expensive for them to manage.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:20.120]   So I just don't think that...
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:21.120]   I don't think...
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:26.480]   I'm really surprised if we find out that it's endemic, you know, because most of these
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:31.280]   companies have a lot of procedures and a lot of places for you to put stuff in.
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:32.280]   So we'll see.
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:34.080]   Can we talk about TV now?
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:36.080]   Okay.
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.080]   After we...
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:41.040]   I forgot to ask Renee, are you buying the new Hermes Apple Watch Band that was sold?
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:45.040]   We haven't had a chance to ask you about that yet.
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:46.040]   Where's the...
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:47.040]   I mean...
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.040]   I don't think so.
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:52.280]   And there's an Hermes... do we talk about this as an Hermes Apple iPhone case that's available
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:53.280]   as well?
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:54.280]   Oh my God.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.720]   You have to get it from Hermes in North America.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.160]   It's only available in the Apple stores.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:47:59.160]   What is this?
[01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:00.160]   What is this thing?
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:01.320]   It looks like a pretzel.
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.320]   What is that?
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.600]   Coming off the Hermes Band.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.600]   It's like a...
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.600]   They have a name for it.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:06.600]   It's just...
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.600]   It's a single tour.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:08.600]   It's fashion.
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.760]   If you and I don't understand it, it costs twice as much.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:11.760]   The least you...
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:12.760]   The least you understand it...
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:13.760]   Are costs.
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:17.360]   It's the Gourmet Double Tour Band.
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.920]   By the way, I'm not mispronouncing Gourmet.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:24.400]   It's spelled E-T-T-E, Gourmet Double Tour Band.
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:25.400]   Pays homage.
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:27.400]   And this is why you're going to want...
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.400]   This is why you're going to want it.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.640]   It plays homage to the iconic Hermes dog collars from the 30s.
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:35.440]   Oh, you dog.
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:36.440]   Oh, you dog.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.000]   By the way, that's not a pretzel.
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.400]   It's supple, fovee, barreña, leather.
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.400]   It's caramel.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:42.400]   Oh my God.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:45.400]   It does look like a pretzel.
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:48.680]   How about this is the Double Tour?
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.680]   This is the...
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:51.760]   What does Renee have?
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:53.280]   What are you going to get?
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.160]   What is your going to be your new band?
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:59.320]   Oh, he can't talk about that either, probably.
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:00.320]   Nice boy.
[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:01.320]   Good boy.
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:02.320]   Nice puppy.
[01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:05.080]   All right.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.320]   Silence reigns.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:09.320]   Emmy Awards.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:14.800]   So congratulations to Apple TV+'s Ted Lasso, which nailed...
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.240]   Got a lot of nominations.
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.240]   Twenty nominations.
[01:49:18.240 --> 01:49:23.680]   Nailed seven Emmy Awards on Sunday night, including...
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:26.520]   Gosh, I can go on and on.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:28.920]   Jason Sudakis, lead actor.
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:37.080]   Hannah Waddingham, who's the team owner, and Brett Goldstein, supporting actors.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:40.720]   And if you think that sounds good, well, let's just keep working our way up the list.
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:43.680]   Disney+ won...
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:44.680]   14...
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.000]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]   It's seven trophies.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.720]   The Mandalorian scored seven trophies.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:56.760]   Marvel, WandaVision, three Emmys.
[01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:02.640]   And Disney+'s Hamilton won an Emmy for Best Pre-recorded Variety Special.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:03.800]   I shouldn't complain about that.
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.360]   I got an Emmy for being best of virtual reality character.
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:10.840]   It's nice to be in a smaller category.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:16.760]   I'm just saying, with less competition, I was competing against a sock puppet.
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:22.840]   But all of that pales, this really was the year of the streamers, two Netflix, which
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:25.360]   won 44 Emmys.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:28.520]   How many Emmys are there total?
[01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.520]   I don't know.
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:30.520]   There must be thousands.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:35.120]   I will say, you meet a lot of people in LA and they've got lots of Emmys behind them.
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:40.440]   And I'm always like, how did they really devalue the value of the Emmy?
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:48.280]   44 Emmys, the Crown 111 Emmys, Queen's Gambit 111 Emmys, Netflix tied a record for the
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:53.800]   most wins for a single platform set by CBS back in 1974.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:54.800]   HBO got 19.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:58.960]   Yeah, it sounds like there's thousands of them, doesn't it?
[01:50:58.960 --> 01:50:59.960]   Nevertheless.
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:02.400]   It's really good for the streamers.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.520]   They are now, there's no question.
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:08.440]   When Steven Spielberg a couple of years ago said streaming movies should not be allowed
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:18.680]   in the Oscars, I think that that is now obviously an out of date point of view.
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:20.440]   That's the number one network.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:25.080]   The number one broadcast network only got eight Emmys total, NBC.
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:26.080]   Right.
[01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:31.480]   And obviously COVID has pushed things forward in a decade, which just shifted the whole
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:32.480]   thing.
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:37.480]   And it's a classic disruption is that disruption is really when the market moves faster than
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:40.160]   the incumbents can keep up with, you have disruption.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:43.600]   And so in this case, usually it's some mover and shaker to do it.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:48.520]   In this case, it was a pandemic that just disrupted everything by just just moving this
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:52.960]   block over this block instead of there's just no clean direction there.
[01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:57.600]   And so I think that it's the future at this point.
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.320]   The die is cast.
[01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.600]   Meriv Easttown from HBO, which now is really HBO Max.
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:09.440]   It's just a streamer, one 10 of the 12 acting awards.
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:13.040]   I love that show because it's basically a BBC show airing on American television and
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:16.400]   people lose their minds where the British are like, this is every show.
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:17.400]   This is all of our shows.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.400]   All of our shows are just like this.
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:20.400]   Yes.
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:23.400]   It was broad church, right?
[01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:24.400]   Yeah, it was broad church.
[01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:25.840]   It was there for a very broad church.
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:29.800]   Except it with water with water.
[01:52:29.800 --> 01:52:30.800]   Water.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:31.800]   Water.
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:33.240]   I may destroy you.
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:40.280]   Meriv Easttown underground railroad, WandaVision, the boys, Bridgerton, the crown.
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:42.640]   Oh boy, all streaming.
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:43.640]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:47.640]   I'd like to point out how hard it is to find out how many Emmys there actually are.
[01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:48.640]   I'm looking.
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:51.400]   I have the list of all nominees.
[01:52:51.400 --> 01:52:55.080]   It's a lot of, there's a lot of them around trying to find where, where is their list
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:00.000]   of the roles and scrolls and scrolls and scrolls and scrolls and scrolls and scroll.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:06.440]   I went to the test stuff thinking they'll give me the stats and no, no, you can't have
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:07.440]   that.
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:08.760]   There's the final one.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:09.760]   Okay.
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:11.680]   Anyway, congratulations.
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:15.240]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:19.200]   I'm one of the few people who doesn't really enjoy Ted Lasso, but okay, I know you love
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:20.200]   it, Renee.
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:23.760]   There's a huge controversy this year because they came back and ordered two more episodes
[01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:24.920]   and they'd already finished writing it.
[01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:28.520]   So they made these two one-off episodes, the Christmas episode and another one and just
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:30.600]   randomly inserted them in the season.
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:33.080]   And people have lost their minds because it's out of continuity.
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:34.960]   The dates are on, the scores are wrong.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:35.960]   What a mess.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:37.800]   And they're like, what happened to the character development here?
[01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:40.520]   And they're just like, we had to add two episodes.
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:46.320]   We are right in that meat of that timeline where people love this show so much that as
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:51.040]   soon as they give them something that doesn't remind them of everything they've ever loved
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:55.400]   about this show, they're going to lose their minds and it's not going to be pretty fun.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:56.400]   Yes.
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:54:01.360]   I'm just saying if season seven and eight turn out badly, it's going to be a lot of trouble.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:03.480]   Like the final seasons of House, exactly.
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.480]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.480 --> 01:54:06.320]   All right, let's take a little time out.
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:11.400]   And when we come back, your picks of the week, if you don't mind, my friends, are showed
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:15.560]   they brought to you by Melissa, did you know?
[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:21.640]   Did you know that 36 million address changes were processed by the postal service last
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:22.640]   year?
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:24.200]   36 million.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:27.760]   It's not just mailing addresses.
[01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.280]   Emails change even more rapidly.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:35.280]   Phone numbers, having customer address data that's accurate is critical for the success
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.280]   of your business.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:38.960]   That's why people love Melissa.
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:44.300]   Melissa has a renewal rate of 92%, 92% year over year proof that people love Melissa and
[01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:45.560]   get value for their money.
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.560]   You'll love it too.
[01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:53.120]   Melissa's tools have helped businesses maintain fresh, fresh data for over 35 years.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:56.480]   10,000 businesses trust Melissa, the address experts.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.440]   I've been doing this a long time.
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:03.160]   You can verify addresses, of course, but also emails, phone numbers, names.
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:08.400]   You can get rid of duplicates with Melissa's data matching, duplicate entries, waste money
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:13.960]   use and multiple mailings to the same address, same people, it also annoys your customers.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:18.320]   You can get information to complete your customer profiles, customer demographic info, like marital
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:20.720]   status, social media handles.
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:25.640]   And what's great about Melissa is you can deploy it, however works best for you.
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:29.720]   Of course, there's an on-prem solution, but there's also a web service.
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:31.240]   There's even a secure FTP site.
[01:55:31.240 --> 01:55:35.400]   You can upload your address data to and then download a clean version instantly.
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:37.920]   There's software as a service.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:38.920]   They have APIs.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:41.560]   In fact, you can actually take a look at the APIs.
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:46.360]   They have new look-up apps now in iOS and Android that use the API and you can search
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:49.840]   addresses, names and more right in the app.
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:53.360]   Melissa is, of course, very careful with your data.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.880]   They understand privacy is job one.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:56:01.080]   They continually undergo independent security audits to reinforce that commitment, data
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:07.480]   security, data privacy, and maybe you care most about compliance, SOC2 compliant, HIPAA
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:09.920]   compliant, GDPR compliant.
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:13.360]   And man, if you sign up for that service level agreement because Melissa's Global Support
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:18.840]   Center has 24/7 world-renowned support, the best in the business, ask them about it because
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.400]   it's fantastic.
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:28.080]   COVID-19 is not over.
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:28.080]   Melissa still supports communities and qualifying essential workers with six months of free service,
[01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:30.040]   apply online at Melissa.com.
[01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:33.440]   And by the way, congratulations, Melissa, named a leader in address verification and

[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:39.600]   I can't even name anybody else.
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.440]   Melissa is the one.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:44.240]   240 plus countries and territories.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:49.320]   They can verify addresses, names and more at the point of entry.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:52.400]   You can even use the API to write it into your own software.
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.600]   Make sure your customer contact data is up to date.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:58.520]   Try Melissa's APIs in the developer portal.

[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:06.680]   with 1000 records cleaned for free.
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:11.920]   Melissa, M-E-L-I-S-S-A, Melissa.com/twit.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:14.760]   We thank them so much for their support of MacBrick Weekly.
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:17.720]   We thank you for supporting MacBrick Weekly by using that address.
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:23.880]   If you want to know more about Melissa, please make sure you go to Melissa.com/twit so they
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:25.920]   know you saw it here.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:28.840]   Alex Lindsey, do you have a pick for us this week?
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:29.840]   I do.
[01:57:29.840 --> 01:57:30.840]   I do.
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:34.320]   Yeah, so one of the things that we do a lot of as we're trying to figure out what we're
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.800]   going to do next is we build diagrams.
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:40.120]   This is where all the hardware is going to go.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:43.160]   We're going to have the tape decks go into the mixer or the router and the router is
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:44.600]   going to go to this and the route.
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:48.160]   All these things, we start building up all of these drawings.
[01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:51.640]   A lot of what we've done is an omnigraph or a Vizio or other things.
[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:54.960]   Finally, we have someone who's an AV person actually building these.
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.400]   John Barker has a thing called here to record.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:02.960]   One of the apps that he has created is called Gear.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:08.240]   What Gear does is that he has pre-built and he lets you build them as well.
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:13.160]   All of these ATEM Mini's and HDX networks and everything else.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:18.880]   They know that this is a video input and this is an audio input.
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:23.480]   It lets you do is you start to, because usually what happens is the first hour of each one
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:27.280]   of these is setting up all the little things that I'm going to use for my router and I'm
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:29.360]   going to set up this and I'm going to set up that.
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:36.840]   You're setting these all up instead of just being able to add them and connect them.
[01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:46.280]   Anyway, what he's built is this nice easy way for you to lay out a technical graph of your
[01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:49.120]   system.
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:53.240]   But it's smart, it's smart, so it knows what connects to what and it can't connect to
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:55.200]   a video input and things like that.
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:56.200]   Exactly.
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:58.320]   Which is usually what we don't have another drawing package.
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:03.120]   I can do this in omnigraph, which I've done for, since version one, or almost version
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:08.840]   one, and there's still things that I still graph out there, but I'm more and more finding
[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:13.320]   myself using this or experimenting with this is like, "Okay, this is what I'm going to,
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:16.240]   and I've started to build ones in here and it's safety."
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:20.080]   Plus, it builds a list for your packing.
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:25.840]   Here's the thing is this is a person who does video production, who also writes code, which
[01:59:25.840 --> 01:59:27.440]   is just the best.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:28.440]   Yes.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:29.440]   So because it's-
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.600]   He's scratching his own itch, but then we all-
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:31.600]   Exactly.
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:37.040]   And we can just throw him some change and have him put it together.
[01:59:37.040 --> 01:59:38.280]   So it's a subscription service.
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:41.040]   I don't remember how much it is, but it's- It's very affordable.
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:45.720]   There's a starter pack that's free, there's $5 for a personal, $15 for a prop lamp.
[01:59:45.720 --> 01:59:47.200]   This is very, very affordable.
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:52.440]   He's actually- And if you do this all the time, or even if you do it some of the time, it's
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:55.840]   super valuable to be able to throw something together because when you want to go build
[01:59:55.840 --> 01:59:59.320]   that yourself, again, you have that pack that's going to tell you what you're going
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:02.240]   to need to do it, or you're going to be able to send this out to somebody.
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:06.720]   And so it's a printout of it out to somebody else.
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:10.320]   And he's a very active person inside of our office hours community.
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:14.000]   So what we like about it also is that when we complain about things, things happen really
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.960]   quickly, he's usually there.
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:23.040]   So he listens to a lot of our input on, "We really wish we had this, we really wish we
[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:25.320]   had that," and he's really part of it.
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:31.760]   So I have to kind of say that because we get special- Anybody in office hours gets
[02:00:31.760 --> 02:00:33.320]   heard faster.
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:35.800]   But he hears everybody and he's really responsive to his own community.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:40.680]   He's got a great YouTube channel as well, where he talks about a lot of the stuff and
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:47.480]   just someone who really is into it, and really part of the audio, video, community in general
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:48.640]   in addition to making a great app.
[02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:52.560]   So this is a great find for me because I've been looking for a way to set up my home,
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:57.120]   to map out my home system, which is insanely complicated, and it's free for up to two
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:58.120]   different plans.
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.720]   So I mean, I can totally do this for free.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:01.720]   That's great.
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:04.400]   And I think it supports the ATEM Mini and all the things I have.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:05.600]   All the things we use.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:06.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:11.600]   It's a really set up, especially if you're in that kind of, for a lot of us that are
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:16.520]   in the $750,000 project production thing.
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.080]   It's got most of the tools that you would need.
[02:01:18.080 --> 02:01:19.080]   Very cool.
[02:01:19.080 --> 02:01:26.400]   H, the number two, R, gear.com, H2R, gear.com.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:27.400]   That's a great pick.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.400]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:31.320]   And it's a zero, Alex pick.
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:32.320]   Amazing.
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:33.320]   I've got to give you guys a break.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:35.320]   Every once in a while.
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:37.440]   Andy and I coat pick of the week.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:40.840]   He's just feeling extra guilty about what he's going to hit us with next week.
[02:01:40.840 --> 02:01:45.040]   Yeah, I'm sure we'll pay for it all on the run.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.680]   I mentioned how happy I am with all the productivity enhancements that iPadOS 15 has
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:51.600]   dropped onto my iPad Pro.
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:57.880]   And that's a great time to single out Ulysses, which is really, it really did.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:02.040]   It's a rising tide that floats all productivity app boats, so to speak.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:05.760]   So Ulysses, which has always been one of my favorite productivity apps for the iPad and
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:11.800]   iOS and the Mac, gets so much better now that it's so much to use Ulysses within the context
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:13.760]   of other apps.
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:19.360]   For instance, I've always had the ability to have Omni-Outliner in a narrow column to
[02:02:19.360 --> 02:02:25.760]   the left and then Ulysses in the main part of the window and use Ulysses as sort of as
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:30.720]   a scratch pad and organize ideas of something long that I'm trying to write and then refer
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:32.680]   back to that when I'm running Ulysses.
[02:02:32.680 --> 02:02:38.200]   Now it's so easy to access that kind of stuff that it really does feel as though Omni-Outliner
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:40.200]   is just a feature of Ulysses.
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:46.240]   It's supporting everything that Apple has thrown into iOS 15, excuse me, iPadOS.
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:48.280]   I'm sorry, I hard line on this.
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:52.040]   There is iOS and it runs on the iPhone, it runs on the iPad.
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.000]   I'm not even going to upper lowercase it correctly.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.000]   I don't care.
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:56.720]   That's who I am.
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:01.480]   But it supports all that stuff and all these integrations when you're maintaining not only
[02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:06.960]   different sort of work views, but also when you can have different implementations and
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:11.360]   different windows that you kind of need to navigate between, it really shows off exactly
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:14.000]   how powerful Ulysses is.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.800]   It's as good as an app as it's always been even before that where it's become my go-to
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:28.000]   app on the iPad where I just need to open a text document to write things into that
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.240]   text document and then save that as a text file and/or use it someplace else.
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:37.760]   It's not just a simple text editor, but it is exceptionally good at being that lightweight
[02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:42.000]   thing where it doesn't have to be as big and complicated as a Scrivener project, which
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.200]   is also one of my favorite productivity apps.
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:45.480]   Don't get me wrong.
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:52.560]   It doesn't have to be as cloud-based share-y workflow-y as a Google Docs app.
[02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:54.400]   It really is I'm saving it on device.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:57.400]   It doesn't matter if I have connected to the internet.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:02.200]   Of course, it will sync across to if I had an iPhone, my iPhone to my Mac because of
[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:04.160]   the Ulysses on the Mac as well.
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:08.280]   I've caught integration works extremely well, but it's exactly the sort of thing that I
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:14.520]   need to have to have a really good muscular text editor for all the, again, one and done
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:19.440]   sort of one-off writing or collections of writing that I do on the iPad.
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:24.360]   Things that don't amount to a novel, things that are not going to take me weeks and months
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:25.360]   to write.
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:30.120]   We're talking about I need to write show notes for NPR this weekend or there's an article
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:33.320]   I want to create for the blog or whatever and I want to hash it out here before I go
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:34.760]   someplace else.
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:37.400]   This is what it's super, super good at.
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:43.480]   It also supports shortcuts and workflows really, really well as well.
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:50.200]   I also got into this earlier this year where I just use it as a repository for output of
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:53.120]   shortcuts that I run on the iPad.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.840]   When I'm doing this sort of 3 a.m.
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:05:00.000]   3 hours into a research drag, it's going to be two hours before I go to bed again and
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:04.280]   I'm just collecting quotes and snippets that I want to sort of consolidate somewhere where
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:09.920]   it's so easy simply for me to create a workflow, a shortcut that will just simply attach to
[02:05:09.920 --> 02:05:11.720]   a share sheet.
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:15.880]   By the time I sober up in the morning and it's 1 p.m. and I'm finally awake and I see what
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:21.840]   the hell was I up to last night and I will see this nice 4000 word Ulysses document with
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:26.560]   nothing but like hundreds of quotes and snippets of data and references that I can now base
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:30.480]   an entirely new level of stuff that I'm working on from.
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.480]   Great stuff.
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:32.480]   It's not cheap.
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:37.240]   It's 50 bucks a year or 5.99 a month but it is one of those things where it kind of
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:42.880]   very quickly became an important app that justifies the expense that I've laid out for
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:47.680]   this iPad and it would be very, very hard to do without it at this point I think.
[02:05:47.680 --> 02:05:52.360]   Yeah and I think the reason you pay for stuff like this is a perfect example is because
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:55.600]   you're going to get an iOS 15 update on day and day.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:57.360]   They're working on it because they're making money on it.
[02:05:57.360 --> 02:05:58.360]   Money could be around.
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:02.840]   Yeah and also I absolutely understand the arguments about, geez I just want to buy this
[02:06:02.840 --> 02:06:03.840]   app and own this app.
[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:05.720]   I don't want to have to do a subscription.
[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:10.000]   The thing is they keep improving it and they keep adding things to it and the fact that
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.200]   you're buying a subscription means that you're always getting a better product and if it
[02:06:14.200 --> 02:06:19.440]   is something that you are basing so much of your work day around as I do with Ulysses,
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:25.080]   it's just nothing but frosting and a cherry on top of that and then caramel over the top
[02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:28.160]   of that and sprinkles on top of that and now I'm describing something really, really
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:30.280]   sickening so I've lost the analogy.
[02:06:30.280 --> 02:06:32.680]   But you know what I'm talking about?
[02:06:32.680 --> 02:06:36.560]   They're happy to keep paying the money just to make sure they keep making Ulysses because
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:39.120]   it's a great thing that I think the iPad needs.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:45.040]   Apple gets a lot of credibility off of an app like this being available for the iPad,
[02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:46.920]   the Mac and the iPhone.
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:47.920]   Nice.
[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:54.000]   Yeah and the integrations are really extensive now which is really cool.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:55.000]   That's great.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.240]   Again it'll integrate to whatever you want to do.
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:58.800]   This is what I want in a text editor.
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:07:01.000]   Whatever I want to do it will help me do that.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000]   Great.
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.000]   Thank you Andy.
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.960]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:12.360]   So this is esoteric but I have this first world, first videographer problem where I'm
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:15.280]   creating these massive video files and like I complained about with the iPhone I just
[02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:22.000]   I can't get them off fast enough and I originally had a USB-C card reader and it was taking forever.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.760]   So I upgraded to a ludicrously expensive Thunderbolt card reader and it's ridiculously
[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:31.400]   sized too because it's for CF Express cards which are the same size as basically SD cards
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:34.840]   like the slot is just tiny and it's right there and all the rest of this I've got to
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:38.320]   assume is just Thunderbolt nonsense but it is so fast.
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:41.240]   Like I can't even get coffee anymore so fast.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:45.800]   I stick it in the thing pops up saying done and I can't like it is such a quality of life
[02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:52.320]   improvement to not have to wait like sometimes like 30 minutes for an SD card over USB-C
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:54.160]   to pull data.
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:59.600]   It just it's like seconds, minutes maybe if I'm if I'm doing something ridiculously long
[02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:06.080]   but I can't get over how big the box is but speed I all I needed from this was to solve
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:10.920]   the problem of speed and it absolutely does it's expensive it's like 130 bucks US I think
[02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:15.480]   but wow does it solve a specific problem for me very beautifully.
[02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:21.880]   Very nice from pro-grade digital pro-grade digital.com CF Express type B and XQD single
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:27.160]   slot memory card reader with Thunderbolt 3 interface yeah and they have non-thundable
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:32.240]   ones they probably have others yeah because I yeah SD cards would be more useful to me
[02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:33.240]   and yes they do.
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:35.720]   Thunderbolt is what they is what you're paying the pretty dollars for.
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:42.040]   Yeah of course that's really annoying it must be a license fee thing it must be to Intel.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:46.720]   I forget which phone it was but somebody or which computer maybe it was the frame and
[02:08:46.720 --> 02:08:51.240]   they're like it does Thunderbolt they don't say it does Thunderbolt maybe licensing reasons
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:52.240]   but it does do.
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:56.120]   Oh that's interesting that's interesting yeah and for a long time Microsoft did not put
[02:08:56.120 --> 02:09:00.560]   T3 into their surfaces the rumors tomorrow they'll announce it we will be covering that
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:05.080]   event if you for some reason you care about Microsoft we'll be covering that event tomorrow
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:06.080]   morning 8 a.m.
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:09.720]   Paul Therat and I talking about and then you know the duo is interesting I think that's
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:13.480]   a very interesting phone there are there have been consistent rumors at Apple's looking
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:18.120]   at folding phones and now this rumor that Google is going to announce one this year maybe
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:22.080]   maybe this is the year of the fold I don't know I don't know.
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:26.000]   Thank you Renee Richie go to youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:33.680]   For the latest review of the iPhone he's got some great pictures explanations it's usual
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:39.280]   does a fantastic job youtube.com/ReneeRitchie are you working on another one right now?
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:45.120]   Yes I will have more stuff up this week and I'm also doing a deep dive on the A15 bionic
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:50.200]   because I think people misunderstood what it does and also on some of the photography
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:52.120]   and video pipelines that they're using this year.
[02:09:52.120 --> 02:09:54.160]   Nice thank you Renee.
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:55.160]   Thank you Renee.
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:58.160]   Andy and I co winner you're going to be on GBH next.
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:04.520]   12th, 30 in the afternoon on Friday you can listen live or later just go to WGBH news.org
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:09.040]   and stream it live or find the recording that will be dropping about a day later.
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:13.640]   Nice anything you will else you want to talk about anything else you want to plug?
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:17.120]   Not yet hopefully I'll have something to plug in about a month there's something that
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:21.400]   is hopefully launching but I have to keep the pipeline full for a while before I can
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:26.080]   turn the lights on the factory I don't want to turn on the factory and then say oh turns
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:34.480]   out that the factory had to close for a couple of days but I come back in a week maybe.
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:42.120]   And Alex Lindsey 090.media if you want to hire this guy he's the best in the business
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:47.840]   if you want to learn how to be the next best in the business office hours.global all day
[02:10:47.840 --> 02:10:51.400]   all night seven days a week.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:52.400]   So much fun.
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:53.400]   So much fun.
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:59.920]   Yeah we're on Saturdays we now have a there's a there's a bar in Belfast called the accidental
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:03.600]   theater that we're Belfast Ireland.
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:10.000]   Yeah yeah and but our group takes over the hardware from the world so the switching and
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.560]   the graphics and everything else and even some of the cameras are all going to be controlled
[02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:18.200]   by art by people all over the world and we play the multi view from what we're doing
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:22.720]   back into after hours and they're all watching it in this bar in Belfast.
[02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:26.880]   Well the bar is streaming the bar is streaming to the rest of the world is there anybody
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.040]   in the bar the band the whole there is the whole band is there.
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:37.040]   Okay the band the production is being done all over the world and it's you know you just
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:40.920]   really get the future you know and so the but these are we're just doing this for fun.
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:45.960]   You know like it's like this is like the offer office hours games.
[02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:47.440]   Let's take a roll.
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:51.480]   So it's a really it's a really cool thing but you know that's on every almost every Saturday
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:57.640]   I got to get my son to get in there and although I have to say a little plug for Henry salt
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:04.080]   underscore Hank on tiktok his latest video only has 317,000 views which compared to nine
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:08.840]   and a half million for the previous days video and this is what's annoying about this.
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:10.080]   He's yeah he's cooking.
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:11.240]   It's annoying about this.
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:15.840]   He made French onion soup it took him like 14 hours because he roasted the bones and
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:19.240]   everything which was crazy.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:24.040]   So and he's only got three and seven one thousand views so please everybody go and follow salt
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:26.040]   underscore Hank actually hungry.
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:30.680]   It's only been three hours so maybe maybe it'll go it'll go it'll go viral.
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:33.800]   You think you're nine and a half million nine and a half million to give you the soup after
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:39.400]   Leo do you know what do you think Henry will come on on office hours and talk to it.
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:40.680]   I would about how he does it.
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:44.920]   He has done a lot of research into what works on tiktok and I think you would be very interesting.
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:45.920]   I'll tell him yeah.
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:47.320]   Yeah if he wants to talk to our guys.
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:48.320]   Yeah yeah I'm sure he'd love to.
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:50.080]   Give him a second hour give an hour to talk about it.
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:56.520]   You know the key to his production was when I gave him my 5d and he's got on all the lenses
[02:12:56.520 --> 02:13:00.040]   and he really he really likes that camera for shooting but he also uses other can he's
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:05.480]   got he's got a second and third unit of course and audio he's using believe it or not some
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:07.480]   cheap Chinese microfices.
[02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:08.840]   I got to upgrade it.
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:11.280]   I think his audio is fantastic.
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:15.760]   It's like that's like the key to his whole thing is chopping and sizzling and crunching
[02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:20.600]   and he says this he says he thinks that's French onion soup won't be as popular because
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:22.520]   doesn't have as much chopping.
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:26.120]   I think the sizzling and the guggling in the wine.
[02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:27.120]   The wine's great.
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:28.120]   He just pey off.
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:30.200]   And I love the use pee off.
[02:13:30.200 --> 02:13:31.400]   That's twice he's used it now.
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:33.720]   I think I take some credit for it.
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:38.840]   I will paste the link in the video chats if people can watch it.
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:41.760]   It's not for it's really just to make your mouth water.

[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:25.240]   want to lower price for one show we're working on that we're going to use I think the Apple
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:29.800]   podcast subscriptions for that but you'll subscribe to one show and only one show won't
[02:15:29.800 --> 02:15:33.320]   include any of the other benefits and it'll be a little bit less expensive.
