[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.840]   Macs, weekly.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.120]   That pretty much says it all.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.200]   And I don't know what we're going to do for the next six
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.400]   months where there's no news, but we'll figure it out.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.280]   We've got a good panel.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.200]   That's one way to solve this.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.680]   Alex Lindsey in studio with us today.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.680]   We'll make it up.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.920]   Back from Rwanda.
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.840]   I am.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.880]   And Sunday.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.400]   Sunday.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.400]   So you--
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.840]   Do you ever-- how do you sleep?
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.040]   I mean, do you ever get used to any particular time?
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.120]   I don't really exist on a time zone anymore.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.320]   I mean, it's just like I don't--
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.560]   I don't really get jet lag.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.080]   I don't--
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.840]   Because you just kind of regulate it all with caffeine whiskey.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.120]   Oh, yeah, there you go.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.800]   It's got a caffeine in the morning balls.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.520]   I've got a whiskey at night.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.040]   All right.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.200]   Renee Richie also here from imore.com.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.560]   Dressed.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.200]   Imore.com.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.960]   Appropriately.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.720]   Look, he's got a mess.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.240]   Close in Montreal.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.880]   It's cold.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.760]   I'm shivering.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.280]   A Mac Classic bind in there.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.200]   It looks like--
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.240]   Peter Cohen's photograph.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.680]   He was doing the--
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.440]   he's doing a whole week of festivities leading up
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.720]   to the birthday celebration.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.880]   Oh, we should do that.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.200]   That's why I think this was his fond memories
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.320]   of Mac retrospective.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.880]   Hey, Burke, why don't you load up the back of me
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.200]   with all the old Mac-- we had a Mac original.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.800]   I think a 128K Mac back there.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.600]   Also here, Mr. Andy Inaka, with his friends Ralph and Ed.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   Let her go there, Leo boy.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.160]   Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.640]   Is this a honeymooner's day or something?
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.720]   No, it is a--
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.280]   found a really awesome--
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.520]   it's really weird when you see the characters and the actors
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.080]   for a classic 1950s television in high definition--
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.560]   Color.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.240]   --full color.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.680]   So when you see one of these studio promo photos
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.400]   that someone decided to scan in at a really good resolution,
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.000]   it's like, oh my god.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.520]   So that's what color the pinstripping on Ed Norton's
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.000]   vest really is.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.960]   It's a funny thing about history,
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.160]   because you get so used to seeing like Abe Lincoln,
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.320]   like in kind of grainy the garro types,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.600]   that when they do the colorization, it suddenly becomes very--
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.280]   oh, look, we really have quite a display now,
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.320]   behind us.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.440]   That's growing.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.080]   We've got the 25th anniversary Mac.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.360]   We've got the original Mac.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.080]   Remember the little duo.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   Now our book 5200.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.200]   Is that-- or is that the duo?
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.760]   Is that the duo?
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.680]   Is that a duo?
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.040]   No.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.760]   Patrick De LaHandy, what is that you're bringing?
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.200]   That's a titanium--
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.680]   G4.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.680]   G4.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.680]   Wow.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   OK.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.920]   But not only is it an impressive display, Leo,
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.680]   but what an awesome demonstration of the power you
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.800]   wield in this organization.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.360]   That's like a pit crew, isn't it?
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.600]   The idly whim and suddenly that you're surrounded
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.920]   by classic magnetizes.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.080]   The pit crew.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.160]   Whoa, whoo, whoo.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.240]   Then they put me down.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.920]   It's amazing.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:11.680]   Thank you guys.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.960]   You guys rock.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.040]   Hey, look who's here also.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.280]   First time I guess on the show,
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.840]   I can't believe it.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.000]   Dave Hamilton, old friend from the Mac Observer
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.360]   in the Mac GeekGab Premium podcast.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.960]   How you doing?
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.760]   It's nice to see you.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.480]   Thanks for having me.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.440]   You're welcome.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.320]   Everybody wants to know that Quicksilver iMac behind you.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.880]   I mean, Mac Pro behind you.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   Is that in service?
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.280]   It is.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.120]   I had to replace the power supply recently, but--
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.960]   Wow.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.840]   --it still runs.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.200]   That's a G5?
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.960]   Mirror Drive Door G4.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.800]   Oh, Mirror Drive Door.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.920]   Yeah, if it was on, you could hear it.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.440]   You say Mirror Drive Door Real Fest, it sounds like Mordor.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440]   Mm, that's right.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.240]   Mm, mm.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.720]   That is beautiful.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.480]   I don't think we have one of those, Dave.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.160]   So you've got us--
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.360]   Well, that's why I'm here.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.920]   You've got us.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.440]   We used to have some.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.920]   Yeah, you used to have some.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.880]   What is some in the Pixel Court terms?
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.000]   Oh, eight or nine of them?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.320]   I mean, not a lot of them.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.840]   Hundreds.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.960]   I have to admit that your company grows.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.560]   And we got this thing called Moroccan.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.320]   Are you familiar with--
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.360]   Yeah, I love Moroccan.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.640]   So we have Moroccan.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.680]   We're putting them in all of our nodes.
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.480]   But all of our computers have Moroccan.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.600]   And some Iraqi is--
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.920]   Is it by Moroccan built in?
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.400]   No, it's a little installer.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.240]   And you install it into the background.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.360]   And then you can see where all your computers are.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.560]   Well, you're not talking about the Wi-Fi router, Moroccan.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.360]   I am, you are.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.760]   So basically, all of our entire Cisco Moroccan is the--
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.320]   They bought it.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.240]   This is a-- actually, in my opinion.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.240]   So--
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.160]   Moroccan is a sad story.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.840]   Because originally, Moroccan was designed
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.520]   to give internet Wi-Fi everywhere.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.020]   Right.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.720]   It was going to be a mesh network.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.920]   It was--
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.560]   It was absorbed.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.960]   It was very altruistic.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.120]   You'd buy a Moroccan.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.160]   And then you'd share your internet with everybody else.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.760]   And the mesh would be passed along.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.320]   And only one person in an area had
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.400]   to have actual internet access.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.200]   And then something went wrong with that.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.720]   Oh, it didn't make a lot of money.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.880]   No, that was--
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.920]   That's exactly what went wrong.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.960]   But you could with the Morockeys,
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.400]   you could have a landing page and ask people for money,
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.880]   if you wanted.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.400]   I mean--
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.400]   Right.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.960]   It was kind of cool.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.200]   But anyway, so Cisco bought them.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.960]   But now what is it?
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.160]   Is now what we can do is--
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.120]   So we have these switches.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.640]   Are they switching?
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.880]   Yeah, so what we do is we have the switches.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.680]   And so we have a switch.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.440]   And I can basically--
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.200]   if you have a switch remotely, I don't
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   have to do any VPNing in.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.400]   I don't have to use the VPN.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.800]   I simply-- if I'm connected to that,
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.160]   it thinks that my DC office and the Rwandan office--
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.640]   Oh.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.440]   And the Petaluma office are all one office.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.120]   So it's completely seamless.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.040]   So it's basically a WAN, a secure WAN, with everyone,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.480]   no matter where they are geographically,
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.640]   who has one of these routers.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.080]   Exactly.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.720]   And it'll create the eye.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.280]   It'll mask the IPs and all the other stuff.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.640]   And so it's kind of like--
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.640]   what was that?
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.640]   Sushi.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   Sushi.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.160]   Himachi.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.720]   It's kind of like a Himachi network.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.360]   Because I mean--
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.720]   I don't know enough about Himachi networks.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.360]   And I have to admit, I'm not a network--
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.120]   I mean, Aaron Mailer is the one that
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.000]   figured this all out for us.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.160]   He uses it to manage entire college.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.680]   And so--
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.160]   Oh, neat.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.640]   But what's cool is with all of our computers,
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.000]   with all of our computers, we can--
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.600]   Why do I want this?
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.480]   When we have this set up, I can see--
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.920]   I can go to my dashboard.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.840]   I don't think you're going to be able to see this on the--
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.000]   I don't know if I want to show it on the thing.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   No, don't show it.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.800]   But what you can do is basically have a dashboard that
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.960]   will let you see all the computers that have it installed.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.080]   And we have a tendency to lose our retinas.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.960]   So they're in different kits and everything else.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.720]   And so knowing exactly where the last time that they logged in
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.320]   is very helpful.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.360]   So this also does 802.11ac.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.280]   It does some of the higher end stuff that AC does.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:43.320]   Doesn't do the beamforming, but it looks like.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.400]   It's really cool.
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.640]   It's pretty sophisticated.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.040]   It's a very high-performance--
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.040]   Wow.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.840]   I didn't realize that they've gone corporate.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.280]   So they've become an enterprise solution.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.000]   They got really big.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.640]   They got really popular, and then they got bought by Cisco.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.160]   Wow.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.480]   And they're laughing all the way to the bank.
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.840]   Why don't we have this?
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.400]   I don't-- because we don't have people
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.960]   over the world logging in.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.480]   You have people on--
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.600]   for instance, with our elementals that go on the road,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.600]   we've got a couple sets of elementals that go travel around.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.960]   And what we're about to do is add these all to the elementals
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.760]   so that when they come up, their static IPs
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.840]   don't change from our perspective,
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.400]   so that those remain all the same.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.080]   And we can log into them from anywhere.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.920]   They just show up as if they were in the office,
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.440]   so that if we need to administer them on the road, we can.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.880]   So maybe the chat room, a second man, says it's not cheap,
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.600]   because you have to pay a yearly license fee.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.080]   It's like that.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.240]   It's $1,500 for three years, I think, per device.
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.480]   So per device?
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.160]   Yeah, we-- $500 a year per device.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.480]   Well, we spent-- I mean, we spent like $12,000, $15,000
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.000]   on the hard bar, so--
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.200]   I don't want one, never mind.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   Cancel that one.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.160]   Well, the little ones that are like $4, $500,
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.480]   but the ones that we put in have to manage a lot of hardware.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.120]   It's enterprise, I understand.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.040]   That's the key thing about understanding enterprise
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.000]   great hardware.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.600]   If it's something where any normal human being would say,
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.000]   oh, my frickin' God, that is way too much to spend
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.040]   on one of those.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.680]   And if they're selling them that you know that there
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.480]   is a percentage of the population for whom
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.280]   this is cheap money, the problems that they solve,
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:12.320]   every time I see an $8,000 router,
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.080]   I think that I'm trying to figure out who it is that would
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.320]   pay double for that, because I know that there are people who
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.840]   would.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.800]   We have a G. Miele in the chat room, who's apparently an enterprise
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.720]   guy, says he uses ubiquity instead.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.400]   He tried Moroccan.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.160]   He likes ubiquity is the same thing, I guess.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.000]   I don't know.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.720]   Anyway, I'm afraid I'm not a network guy, so--
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.220]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:34.280]   Aaron said this is great.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:34.960]   He put it in.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.360]   It turns out that it's great.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.520]   You end up when you do this stuff,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.680]   you end up you have to trust somebody.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.320]   And so--
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.200]   You just have to trust somebody, because if you're not
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.960]   that guy, you can't be that guy for everything.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.200]   Aaron's much smarter at that than I am,
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.600]   so I just listen to him and go down that path.
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   One of the reasons, Dave--
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.480]   And you listen to him because he recommends stuff that works,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:51.880]   right?
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.240]   Exactly.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.280]   That's true.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.880]   And he's using it in a whole college with hundreds of nodes.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.720]   And it's not like--
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.520]   This is his hobby.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.360]   I mean, this is what he does.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.880]   One of the reasons, Dave's with us, every year,
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.880]   Macworld, you and your-- what do you call them?
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.560]   Mac All Stars, you're banned?
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.760]   It was Paul Kent who now runs--
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.400]   --all of Macworld Expo.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.720]   But about-- I want to say 13 years ago,
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.440]   he came up with the idea that we all go to these parties
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.400]   at Macworld Expo, and there's a band that plays in the corner
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.040]   that everybody does their best to ignore
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.320]   while they're talking to each other.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.200]   And it's because it's some nameless band
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.640]   that nobody knows about.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.960]   And so Paul had the idea that, listen,
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.560]   we got a lot of musicians in the community.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.200]   We should form a band.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.000]   And in 2001, we did that.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.720]   And Paul pulled us all together, and we had the first gig
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.320]   in New York City at the cooler.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.920]   And we were horrible.
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:45.920]   Horrible.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.240]   There is unfortunately video of this
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.000]   to back up my claims here.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.760]   Thank you, YouTube.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.440]   Nobody fails at private anymore, right?
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.640]   Everybody has to fail at public.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.040]   I know that's the problem.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.240]   So Dave, I'm taking from the drums over your right shoulder
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.120]   that you are the drummer in the band.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.640]   I am.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.160]   That's right.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.280]   You exploded every performance.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.520]   I try not to turn into a green globule.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.920]   That's right.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.560]   So the band is getting together for the 30th anniversary
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.840]   of the Macintosh announcement, which was January 24,
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.160]   three days from now.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.720]   But there's a big event at Flint Center
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.720]   where the original announcement was--
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.280]   Right.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.520]   --this shows you how long ago.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.920]   I'm at Flint Center in Co-retina.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.160]   Wouldn't it be awesome if we could stream this live?
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.560]   Yeah, that's what a great idea.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.040]   Have you guys thought about that before?
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.960]   We would, but it would cut into DVD sales,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.160]   and we don't want to do that.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.840]   So for those of you who are listening that don't know
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.960]   what a DVD is, in the last century,
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.320]   there was a piece of plastic that people would media on.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.120]   And they would call it a DVD.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.000]   It's not--
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.800]   We volunteered.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   We did volunteer to go down and stream it.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.400]   You don't bring our equipment and everything
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.120]   to stream it.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.160]   Because I think everybody who is watching this show,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.800]   certainly, and everybody who's a Mac fan,
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.440]   would be interested.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.920]   This is going to be quite an event.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.520]   You really should just go.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.680]   More information at mac30th.com.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.920]   And the event is January 25th, the next day.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   Yeah, it's Saturday night.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.520]   And there's going to be panels.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.680]   People like Dan Kotke, I think Dan's actually
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.840]   one of the organizers, but they're
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.040]   going to have a lot of the original Mac design team
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.880]   speaking.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.520]   They were going to have Ridley Scott,
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.520]   but now they've got some other assistant--
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.320]   Who did the 1984 commercial.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:26.840]   Right.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.280]   So just from the website, there's
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.080]   a series of panels.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.800]   The first one, Conception.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.800]   John Markoff will moderate Dan Kotke,
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   who was one of the first employees of Apple.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:40.440]   Larry Tesler, who was an Apple scientist.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.640]   And I can't remember what Larry did on the original Mac team.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.840]   Mark Lebron, Bill Fernandez.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.560]   These are original Apple, like pre-Mac guys.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.200]   Then the birth of the Mac, Stephen Levy
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.480]   will moderate that, the great writer who did hackers
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.840]   in so many wonderful books.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.840]   Bill Atkinson-- now, yeah, this is the Mac team.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.720]   Now, Bill Atkinson, Randy Wigginton, Andy Hertzfeld, Bruce
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.560]   Horn, George Crow.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.560]   They collected them all.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.800]   Yeah, I'd love to see Susan Care there who did the icons.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.440]   There's a few people you'd like to see there, but--
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.880]   She might be there.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.160]   I know she's been contacting.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.800]   I see some TBAs.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.360]   So that's good news.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.320]   There's people who--
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.920]   I'd love to see-- so well, you've got Hertzfeld and Atkinson.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.280]   You've got-- you've got to break it.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.720]   Randy Wigginton, Bruce Horn, who did the Finder.
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.640]   Then the coming of age, Dan Farber, formerly of CNET.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.000]   I don't know what Dan's doing.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.760]   Maybe he's still at CNET.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.080]   And third party developers.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.400]   And I don't know these names as well.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.000]   Charlie Jackson, Jim Rea, Heidi Rosen, I know, of course.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.440]   Ty Roberts, David Manell, who did--
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.720]   Is there still tickets left?
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.920]   There are still tickets left.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.040]   How many is at home?
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.200]   Not 1,800 people, I think total.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.960]   It's a nice place to go.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.720]   It's a great room.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.600]   Let's just check.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   I'm going to find tickets.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.520]   It's a little over 100 bucks.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.680]   Maybe 100 bucks even.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.240]   Tickets are not sold out.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.000]   So you don't have to worry about selecting a session.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.920]   Your ticket is for all of them.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.480]   We should really go.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.280]   You guys should go.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:06.680]   I'm going to try.
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.000]   And then after the three sessions, the band plays.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And we're better than we were in 2001.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.920]   General admission-- it is a little pricey, 140 bucks,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.040]   and 80 cents.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.480]   That's with the ticket master premium.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.640]   109 bucks, so there's a variety of choices.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.280]   So a lot of us have heard a lot of these people speak before.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.560]   And you do have the impression of someone
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.560]   that you're really glad you heard these stories firsthand.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.520]   Because if you wanted to hear Alan Turing,
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.120]   your window of opportunity has long passed.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.560]   And a lot of these innovators are the people
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.440]   that you really, really appreciate only when
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.600]   you read about them in history books, where you think,
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.320]   yeah, I really wish--
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.400]   I love to get 15 minutes with this person.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.960]   Or I'd love to see him explain from his point of view
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.000]   what it was like to develop this idea.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.600]   And this is one of those opportunities.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.720]   Because if you want to look at critical inventions,
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.160]   or-- excuse me-- critical consumer products
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.520]   or computers of the 20th century,
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.160]   Mac has got to be on the top 10.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.840]   And this team is an amazing team.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.480]   They are inviting anybody who was on the Mac team to be there.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:13.840]   Dress is, quote, old Apple casual.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:14.720]   Choose optional.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.960]   If you've got one of those--
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.480]   --they're all overdressed.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.520]   If you've got one of those great illustration--
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.280]   kind of abstract illustrations of the Mac
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.920]   with the Admauce coming off of it, definitely--
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:25.520]   I'm not like I have any of this stuff.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.560]   Really?
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:26.920]   Wow.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.520]   I would love to be at this event.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.760]   And I'm sorry we can't stream it.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.240]   But we did approach them.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.560]   And quite reasonably, they said, we need part of--
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.240]   this is expensive to put on.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.560]   And so we need to monetize it.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.880]   So they're going to try to figure out a way
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.280]   to make videos available somehow via say DVD.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.160]   But really cool.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.000]   And so I did want to give him a nice big plug.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   And if you go to Mac30th.com, if you happen
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.400]   to be in the Bay Area this Saturday night,
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.240]   you can hear Dave and his band play.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.320]   Who are the Mac All-Stars now?
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.520]   It's still Paul Kent?
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.240]   Paul Kent, sure.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.120]   Chris Breen plays keys and sayings.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:04.600]   Yep.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.240]   Paul the Midas plays guitar.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.120]   Chris is a killer keyboard player.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.600]   Yep.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.240]   He's a pleasure to play with.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.480]   He's a total pro.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.000]   Yep.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.520]   Because the question is, is the music
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.680]   going to be on the DVD?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.680]   Pro I know.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.160]   I hope so.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   OK.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.320]   That's going to be singing.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.240]   Because I'm sold.
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:21.720]   I'm sold.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.680]   If I get a good contract track out of this, you know--
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.440]   That's right.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.600]   Who else?
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.720]   Bob Livitis plays guitar.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.080]   Dr. Mac is great.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   Bob Livitis.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.640]   I've seen you guys play at Macworld before.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.440]   Great.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:34.920]   Of course.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:35.720]   It's a fight.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:35.920]   Right.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.920]   It's just a party band.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.680]   It's fun.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:38.920]   That was fantastic.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.640]   And we try to be better each time.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.960]   So this year we have two gigs because we'll do this.
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.560]   And then Cirque de Mac turns 11 this year at Macworld Expo.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.440]   So we'll be doing Cirque de Mac there.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.360]   Wow.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:50.960]   That's hard to believe.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.000]   That's 11.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.040]   That one goes to 11.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.120]   More spinal tap jokes than you can shake a stick at.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.200]   Here are, if you want to know what Apple Casual looks like,
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   here is the original Mac development team in Apple Casual.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.640]   And of course, there's Steve on his knees with the Mac.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.360]   Directly behind Steve, Andy Hertzfeld.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.800]   Like the black sweater vest with a white t-shirt and jeans.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.920]   I think everyone should just go as Steve.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.960]   1984 was--
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.120]   You could see the transition from the bow tie
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.400]   to the mock Purple Knight.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.320]   That's probably my favorite step in the transition.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.520]   And there's a little baby there, too, who would now
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.760]   be 30 years old.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.760]   Is that amazing?
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.440]   We should find out who that baby is.
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.400]   No kidding.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.960]   Somebody knows.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.440]   No kidding.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.120]   Somebody's got her.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.920]   Wherever on the right is--
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.920]   Is that Bill Atkinson?
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:40.480]   Maybe not.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:40.920]   I don't know.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:41.720]   I'm trying to--
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.520]   Now Bill had a big Afro back then, didn't he?
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.520]   Which I'm looking for.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:47.680]   Andy's going to know.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.320]   Wow.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.120]   Really fun to see that.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.080]   So that'll be a great event.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.120]   Is there any Mac news?
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.360]   I think we'll find some.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:57.960]   We'll search.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.360]   We'll look through the Mac News bag.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.080]   There's big news?
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.400]   Well, dig for it, Leo.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:04.920]   It's there.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.420]   Well, dig.
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:05.920]   Somewhere.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.680]   Somewhere, we'll find it.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.800]   And when we do, we'll tell you.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.180]   But first, a word from '99, designs.
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:18.780]   One of the things that Apple and Steve did with the Mac
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.560]   and he talks about it at the intersection of what do they
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.120]   call it, technology in the arts.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:23.620]   Right.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.480]   Engineering and liberal arts.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:30.500]   He really brought design sense to something that had none.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.760]   And I think ever since, we really
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.620]   could credit them with bringing the idea of design
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.260]   to the technical world.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.820]   '99 designs is the world's largest graphic design marketplace.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:41.580]   Nowadays, if you're doing an app, especially if you're
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.860]   doing it for an Apple product, you better have some good
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.020]   design.
[00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:47.980]   It's a great coding, but good design behind it.
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.300]   '99 designs get to your next graphic design,
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.100]   whether it's a new logo, a mobile app, a business card.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.100]   It could be a t-shirt.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.100]   One of our best t-shirts was designed by '99 designs.
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.980]   You'll find the right designer for your project
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.740]   at '99 designs.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.540]   More than 270,000 designers are sitting there.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.420]   I almost have this image of them just waiting.
[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.140]   Like, OK, OK.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.620]   And then you go and you say, I need this.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.140]   And then they give you ideas.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.460]   You work with the designers to refine the ideas.
[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.500]   Pick your designer.
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.300]   Pay them the pre-negotiated price.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.540]   And you're going to get great designs.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:23.220]   It's fun to see the ideas roll in.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.500]   You need fresh marketing collateral.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.740]   All kinds of marketing design.
[00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:30.220]   There's no reason for anything you do to look ugly.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:31.100]   I guess is the point.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.380]   Whether it's a menu, a brochure, an email template, a banner ad,
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.860]   an infographic, they even do vehicle wrap designs.
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.900]   And they all start as low as $199.

[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.620]   Free.
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.140]   And we thank 99designs for making the world a prettier place
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:18.420]   and giving us a chance to talk about them.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.180]   I'm just looking.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:24.700]   Chad, you really did yeoman work today, pulling together
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.100]   all the big news stories.
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.500]   Yeah, about that, Leah.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.300]   It's gotten to the point now where we're really
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.460]   going to start talking about Apple's patent filings.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.860]   That's how bad it's got--
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:44.100]   And it turns out that Apple's 5C screen repairs are now
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.860]   available at the Apple Store.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.300]   Some stuff happened to China.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.220]   Maybe not first, but you heard it.
[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.300]   Actually, this was the week that Apple entered the Chinese
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.300]   market, and it seems, according to some of the stories--
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.220]   I wasn't there, but it seems that it was
[00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.620]   kind of a collective yawn.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.580]   Yeah, but a collective yawn in China is like--
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.460]   But Tim Cook actually went to be there for it.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:10.220]   He went to the Verizon launch, too,
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.660]   and that was a bit of a yawn until people had to start upgrading.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.820]   I think he just wanted to fly first class on Singapore Airlines.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:18.900]   Cathay Pacific.
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:23.660]   So he went-- the lines weren't super long.
[00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.460]   I think they said there were 12 people.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.060]   This looks like a little bit bigger.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:29.980]   A little bit bigger of a crowd than that.
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.780]   Part of it is, while this is the first type, China Mobile,
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:35.780]   which is China's biggest carrier, has been selling iPhones.
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.900]   They've been on sale in China for a while.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.540]   And haven't they had?
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.020]   They had some kind of minor riots early on when they first came out.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.820]   And there's a ton of gray market iPhones on China Mobile already?
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.620]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.660]   China Unicom, China Telecom have been selling the 5S
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.340]   and 5C since September.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.700]   China Mobile is the world's largest.
[00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.900]   Not China's, but the world's largest carrier,
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.980]   740 million subscribers.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:04.900]   That's why there's a lot of people.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.900]   They're offering a 16 gig version of the 5S free,
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.660]   but you have to commit to-- it's just like the US, two years.
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:16.180]   And the monthly plan is $97 a month.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.860]   But that's actually a pretty good deal.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.900]   That's a better deal.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.620]   There's nobody in the States offering it for free.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:25.060]   And anybody in Canada offering it for free with a two year contract?
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.100]   We're working our way to words two year contracts
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.060]   from the old three year contract.
[00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.580]   Oh, you have three years, that's right.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.100]   You too.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.740]   They're bringing them towards two years.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.100]   It'll once in a while go down to free for special promotions
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:35.460]   and things.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.860]   But usually it's not when it comes out or for a while after it's come out.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.380]   If you sign up for the less expensive data plan, $31 a month,
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:48.340]   it will cost $625 with a two year commitment.
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:55.300]   Out of contract, the iPhone 5S 16 gig, $873 with the equivalent thereof,
[00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.340]   5,288 yuan.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:07.020]   So China, a little more expensive, $898 with no contract.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.380]   China Telecom has probably the best deal, 5S free,
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.140]   if you have a two year deal with a monthly cost of $64.
[00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:20.740]   So it seems like maybe the China mobile deal isn't the best deal.
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.660]   Bloomberg reported that China mobile had already hit one million pre-orders.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:30.620]   And maybe China mobile-- I don't know if the other ones are 4G.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.220]   So it might be--
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:35.460]   It's such a different market.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.380]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.100]   It's also I think going to be an interesting window into buying habits,
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.940]   like how normal humans react to the iPhone.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:50.540]   This is a phone-- this is probably the only major country
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:55.900]   that was completely shut out of the iPhone for the entire multi-touch touchscreen
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.820]   revolution.
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.740]   So they essentially, in terms of phones they
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.220]   can get without any whole balloon, these are all like Android devices
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:03.740]   and other non-Apple devices.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:10.340]   So it'll be interesting to see whether these are going to be accepted as a yuan.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.180]   If this population is going to say, well, we've seen this before,
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.140]   it's nice, but it's not necessarily a thing new or anything special.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.740]   We'll stick with what we have right now.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.020]   Or whether this will be really accepted as the fresh look at multi-touch mobile
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.460]   operating systems that was before.
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.180]   Not that they've been completely shut out before,
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.180]   but this is the first time it's really, really widely available that way.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.380]   So--
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:30.900]   That's it?
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.700]   According to Wall Street Journal's China Real Time Report,
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:37.060]   they're completely unscientific in comparison of mobile internet services
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.620]   using a 5S in China.
[00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.940]   Did show China mobile to be the fastest, faster even than AT&T, Verizon,
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:49.260]   AT&T mobile in the US with upload speeds of a little more than--
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:53.340]   well, about three megabits and download speeds of 15 megabits.
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.580]   It's pretty good.
[00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:55.260]   I take--
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:55.980]   It's absolutely interesting.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.580]   Did I take what the--
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:57.140]   I can't tell you what the speeds are.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.380]   They take what the LTE speeds are in Rwanda.
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.300]   What?
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.660]   106 down--
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:02.140]   What?
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.740]   98-- of course, I think there's only a couple of us on the network.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.660]   But it was-- we opened the phone.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.260]   We opened up the phone.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:11.100]   So Korea Telecom is installing it right now.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.460]   And so it's all through Kigali.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.260]   It's not being used yet.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.180]   So they opened up the phone for the show.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.020]   It was like-- we turned it on.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.620]   And I was like, that's the Wi-Fi speed.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.980]   He's like, no, that's the--
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:20.860]   here's the Wi-Fi speed.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.260]   And it was much slower.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.180]   You know, there's a reason that--
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:28.500]   there's-- the obvious reason why China is important to Apple in every other US
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.980]   and tech company in the world is because there's a billion consumers there.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.140]   But there's a second reason which I thought was quite interesting.
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:38.820]   We had a guy on yesterday, Larry Downs, who wrote a book called Big Bang
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.780]   Disruption on the Trangulation.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:44.140]   And he said, the other reason is because if you're a big company right now,
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.900]   one of the most important things you're doing is looking for where
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.380]   the disruptions are going to come from.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.180]   What new industries, what new applications, where the hot stuff is happening.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.980]   He said, it used to be you could look to Silicon Valley and maybe
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.700]   Silicon Valley and New York, maybe Austin.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.460]   He says, now, China, Russia, these--
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.660]   there's countries where stuff is happening that's potentially completely
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.140]   disruptive to your business.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.100]   And if you're not there and not paying attention to those markets,
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.260]   you're going to miss it.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.940]   And so there's a strategic reason that it goes beyond pure money to be in China.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.540]   You've got to pay attention to innovation.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.820]   Well, when you have that many people that could go one direction or another,
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.860]   I think that suddenly you were big and suddenly you're very small part of the market
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:26.580]   very quickly.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.900]   And that's whether it's China or India or Africa as a whole.
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:35.460]   And a lot of these groups, I mean, I spend a lot of time in the emerging world
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.180]   all over the world.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.020]   And you see a lot of them.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.900]   They're not going to take the same path of the United States.
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.220]   They're taking slower paths or faster paths.
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.500]   But they're all-- and you really do have to pay attention to it
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.340]   because it can move very quickly.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.340]   One of the things that's interesting, too, is for example, number portability
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.860]   is not very high in China.
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.460]   And people who got on the network early have specific numbers.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.020]   They don't want to lose because it's the sign of affluence that you got an early number.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:00.180]   Or if you have a lot of eights in your numbers, very auspicious,
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.460]   and they want to make sure they keep those kinds of numbers.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.460]   And then you have the App Store market.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.700]   Amazon is not going to get a retail presence in China, probably not for a long time
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.580]   if ever.
[00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.380]   Google Android devices don't often have Google services.
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.580]   They're typically completely different kinds of Android devices.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.580]   Even when they did the jailbreak for iOS 7, part of that initially
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.260]   was the installation of a different App Store that had paid, reportedly a lot of money
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.900]   to get into the jailbreak because App Store was just an important thing in China.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.140]   So there's a whole secondary economy that we don't really see in North America that's
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.020]   working there.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:32.100]   And if Apple can boost their retail and they can get their platform,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.900]   specifically the App Store in there, becomes a huge advantage to them that--
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.380]   it's not as easy for their competitors to compete there.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:46.140]   As far as your research asks, 7,500 US consumers--
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.220]   this is the third year they've done this--
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.780]   about big tech companies, three questions.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.300]   How enjoyable were they to do business with?
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.980]   How easy were they to do business with?
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:59.900]   And how effective were they at meeting your needs?
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:04.180]   You'd think that Apple would be number one here.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:05.980]   Not even close.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:06.460]   Not even close.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:11.460]   Amazon scored highest among the 17 consumer electronics manufacturers operating in North
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.500]   America.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.460]   The only manufacturer to get an excellent rating of 91 for Kindle customers--
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.460]   Sony--
[00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:20.980]   I don't believe this.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.220]   This actually means this study is wrong.
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:23.820]   It's just wrong.
[00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.380]   Sony came in second with a rating of 83.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.460]   It's wrong.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.180]   Who likes Sony--
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.780]   who would say Sony number one when it comes to doing business with,
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.700]   easy to do business effective?
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.140]   Howard Stringer.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:41.340]   Where did they find these people?
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.380]   This immediately makes me want to throw this out.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.460]   Maybe Sony paid for it.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.300]   I don't know.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:52.180]   Microsoft and Samsung came in fourth, tied for third with scores of 82.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.220]   Then Apple at 81.
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:58.700]   So according to this forester study, Amazon, Microsoft, Samsung, and Sony
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.700]   all have better customer experiences than Apple.
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.540]   Now I know this is a Mac break.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.220]   This is an Apple show.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.180]   We're all Apple-partisans.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.020]   But that doesn't sound right.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.940]   Well, so I think the Amazon one makes sense because they have that little video support
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.940]   that's built on right now.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.940]   I understand Amazon.
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:16.940]   So Amazon makes sense.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.940]   I think that having Apple near the bottom of those, I don't quite understand.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.540]   I mean, when you walk into an Apple--
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.300]   Well, OK.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.220]   Let me be clear, though.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:29.100]   Forester says, any score between 76 and 85, which Apple's well in that, is considered
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.100]   good.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.540]   But it is showing a dropping over the three years they've done this survey.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.380]   Apple is-- actually, everybody's dropping a little bit Amazon.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.380]   Actually, Amazon dropped and then came back.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.420]   Apple has always been kind of in the middle of the pack.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:49.900]   It was number two of the first year and the second year, number five for the first time.
[00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   What's the margin of error?
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.900]   A lot.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.900]   Plus, I mean, it's 100%.
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.460]   I mean, because it looks like that-- my guess is that all of those are in the margin
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.460]   of error.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.340]   7,500 is a large number, though, right?
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.060]   It is a large number, but usually they have to--
[00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.060]   It's just because they commit again.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.060]   Usually they post that.
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.060]   Because maybe not.
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.060]   Was it an enterprise survey?
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.060]   Maybe.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.060]   No, no, consumers.
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.060]   US consumers.
[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:11.860]   Was it generic consumers or people that had repairs done?
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.060]   I mean, how did they qualify these people?
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.060]   It just says they were consumers, is all it says.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:18.060]   OK.
[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.300]   I mean, 7,500 is probably-- I mean, the margin of error is probably pretty low.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.860]   I mean, 1 or 2%.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.740]   I would agree that Amazon probably does.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.740]   No, I-- well, that just went in.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.740]   That little video--
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.740]   The video support built into the--
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.140]   The Mayday thing is pretty cool.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.140]   That's a cool feature.
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:36.820]   And you know, and it's something-- that's something Apple-- I've heard friends and listeners say,
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.380]   "Oh, Apple will get that next."
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.220]   It's like, no way.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.820]   Amazon is set up to get that, right?
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.260]   For years, you could go online.
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.860]   You can still do this right now.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.940]   Click-- I have a problem with my order.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:48.940]   Click chat.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.340]   Your phone rings and you're talking to someone.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.020]   So they already have that infrastructure.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.020]   We just--
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.340]   I had a crack in my toilet.
[00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:59.300]   And I've been on the line with Jerry for, you know, like constantly.
[00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   This is actually an interesting story.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:01.940]   We bought one of those Toto washer butt.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.940]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.940]   Washing everything.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:04.940]   How do you like that?
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.940]   Then air dry it.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:06.940]   How's that working for you?
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.940]   I love it.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:08.940]   Actually, Alex was the one who said, "Get it."
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:09.940]   Awesome.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.940]   And it takes a turn that quickly listening.
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:11.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:12.940]   No, no, no, no.
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.940]   I'm talking about customer experience.
[00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:14.940]   OK.
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.940]   OK, please.
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:16.940]   I'm going to tell you, the customer's experience is excellent.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.940]   OK.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.940]   And it works fine.
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:20.540]   We installed it and then we had a very good installer installed.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.740]   And it is complicated because you have to install power and then--
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.740]   I need to find myself.
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.740]   You did, really?
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:25.740]   You had a plug next to your toilet.
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:26.740]   I had someone add a plug.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:28.740]   That's the critical one, of course.
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.740]   And then it's just like installing a toilet.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.740]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:31.740]   Basically--
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.740]   You don't worry about having power that close to everything else you're doing in that department?
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.740]   No.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:37.740]   I had to ask.
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.740]   It's a GFI, you know?
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.740]   Ground fault.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.740]   A hundred million Japanese are using these.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.740]   Yeah, they don't--
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.740]   Right.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.740]   The electric cushion rate is dropped considerably.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:48.740]   It's just like--
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.740]   Being a drummer, I worry about sitting on something and exploding.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:58.820]   So Jerry-- so there's a really kind of a small crack, but it's a crack in the plastic part
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:03.100]   of the top and the vent that's there falls out because it's cracked.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.740]   So we put-- you go to Amazon and you say, "There's a crack."
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:09.300]   Jerry's on the line like this.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.300]   Just like you said.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.300]   All right, it's Jerry.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.300]   Not from Amazon.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.300]   It was like Amazon Marketplace.
[00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:15.980]   It was a third party, but it's through Amazon.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.980]   No one wants a bad rating.
[00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:17.980]   Well, that's right.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.980]   Yeah, that's the whole thing.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.980]   You put it on Amazon.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.500]   And yeah, "Oh, I got to help you here."
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.220]   He says, "There shouldn't--" he says, "The only crack in that toilet should be yours."
[00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:32.660]   Okay, so-- and he says, "I've been on the line with Japan all morning."
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:33.660]   Wow.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.380]   He says, "Toto says this has never happened before.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.540]   Can you send me a picture?"
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:42.220]   So yesterday he says, "Okay, we got a big conference call with all the Toto executives
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:43.220]   in the morning.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.940]   It's going on right now, in the morning.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:49.420]   And can you send me a picture?"
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.420]   "Oh, the toilet seat.
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:53.700]   Oh, gosh, I wish I'd--"
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.180]   Anyway, but my point being that's how Amazon gets so high on there, that--
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.180]   Right.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.180]   Bam!
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.180]   And he wasn't even Amazon.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.180]   He was an Amazon Marketplace.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.620]   But everybody, I mean, you get all those requests for ratings of how do we do?
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.060]   And it puts a lot of pressure on people because, you know, I look at those.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.820]   I go, "Oh, it's got bad."
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.620]   The products got bad ratings or the service got bad ratings from that marketplace.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.420]   And you just go, "I'm not going to--"
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.420]   Yep.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.020]   It really is effective.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.500]   So but what is Apple-- I don't think you could say Apple's done anything wrong to lower their
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:23.500]   score.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.940]   They are very high score.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.940]   That's the point.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.900]   There-- I would say they're enjoyable to do business with.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:28.900]   Is anybody--
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:30.380]   You can-- Awesome.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.780]   Unless you want to do anything that they don't agree to.
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.780]   Well, there's that.
[00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:37.140]   But I mean, you call Apple customer relations an oftentimes--
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.140]   They're very good.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.140]   They'll take care of you.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.140]   Yeah, they're very good.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.140]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.580]   And then how easy were they to do business with?
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.580]   I think Apple's pretty easy.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.060]   Unless you're the music industry or the tell-- you know, the cellular business.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:52.060]   I would-- you know, you wouldn't ask AT&T CEO how effective were they at meeting your
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.060]   needs.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.420]   I think-- anyway, you-- okay, it's still a good score.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.780]   I have no idea how Sony got in that at all.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.340]   Maybe the antitrust monitor filled out the survey.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.340]   Is this US consumer?
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.860]   Yeah, US consumer, 75 and a US consumer.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.860]   And they're all in Seattle.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.300]   The Sony experiences sucks.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.940]   There's no one to call.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.900]   I don't know how you could say the Sony experience is good.
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:18.940]   I'm wondering if part of it is in the fact that Apple is unique in that that's the price
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.300]   that the list price is the price you're going to pay.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.300]   That's it.
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   Yes.
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.300]   There's no negotiating.
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.940]   And there isn't that much flexibility on config-- on a range of the things that you want.
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.900]   Maybe that's digging it a little bit.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.100]   But I agree that anything that puts-- anything that puts that big of a swing on the company
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.220]   that you would expect to be higher is way low.
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.100]   The company you expect to be way low is way high.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.420]   I wouldn't say that it's a fraudulent survey, but I think that tells you something about
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.980]   the sort of questions that they're asking and the sort of people who are responding
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:47.980]   to them.
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.980]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.780]   We're talking about Apple.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.620]   Actually, as I look through the line up, your chat has done a good job of finding stuff.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.180]   We're going to talk about Apple's FTC, this consent decree, which happened this week.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.340]   More about the Apple lawsuit with Samsung.
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.180]   Apple's playing hardball on this one.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.540]   I guess when you win, you can.
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:14.140]   And iOS 7 fixes perhaps imminent.
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.860]   You're watching the Mac break weekly and the not-cove from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.020]   Dave Hamilton, our first time.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:22.140]   I can't believe it's-- you've never been on this show?
[00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.140]   Not that I know of.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.140]   You're sleeping last time.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.420]   That's this horrible oversight, Dave, which we will make sure is fixed from Mac Observer
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:36.140]   and the Mac Observer podcast, which is called Mac Geekcab.
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:39.140]   What's the difference in Mac Geekcab?
[00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.620]   Do you have trouble saying it?
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.620]   I do.
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:44.500]   I've learned to say it over the years, but I came up with the name-- actually, my wife
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.660]   came up with the name hours before we recorded our first episode.
[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.460]   And I stumbled with it for a little while.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:51.460]   Mac Geekcab.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.460]   Mac Geekcab.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.460]   Mac Geekcab.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.460]   It's a chibileth.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.540]   That's how you know that people are real fans of the show.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.340]   If they can say it directly.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.340]   That's right.
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.780]   They are at episode 484, just to give you an idea.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.780]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:04.580]   That's a lot of gapping.
[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:06.580]   Almost nine years ago.
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.580]   You actually pre-date podcasting.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.580]   No, we don't pre-date the term podcasting.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:20.420]   We put out our first episode three weeks before they released the iTunes podcast.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:21.420]   Okay.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.420]   Okay.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.420]   So that's your right in there, though.
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:24.420]   Your pie in here.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.060]   I had to email Steve to make sure we were in the directory.
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.060]   Did you really?
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.220]   Well, you know how it is dealing with Apple, right?
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.340]   So we have friends at Apple, as we all do.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:39.780]   And I had asked my friends because Steve had announced it three or four weeks prior.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.780]   Mocking it by the way, saying podcast or what he made fun of.
[00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.780]   Yeah, right.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:48.380]   So I called my friends and I said, "Look, we just started this show.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.420]   I want to make sure it's in the directory on day one.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.860]   Can you put me in touch with whoever's managing the directory so I can pitch them effectively?"
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.180]   And everybody's like, "Oh, you know how I don't know.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.820]   It's not me and I can't introduce you."
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.100]   So I emailed Steve.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:06.380]   And within 20 minutes, I was in touch with the folks and it was all good.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.380]   Wow.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.380]   Wow.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.380]   Well, congratulations on episode 400.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:12.500]   Are you going to anything for the 500th?
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.420]   I'm sure we will.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.420]   We get a little while, though.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.420]   We only do one a week.
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.420]   So you get a little time.
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.420]   So you get 15 weeks.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:19.420]   You get some time.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.420]   Yeah.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.420]   You can find it at MacGeekGab.com.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:27.180]   What's the difference in premium and regular?
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:32.020]   Years ago, we started what we called our premium offering and really it's a way for our listeners
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.500]   to support us directly.
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.220]   And we followed a bit of what I'll call the NPR model where when people hit a certain
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.340]   threshold, we returned the favor with a gift back to them.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.540]   We actually did these really cool.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.980]   Yeah, we did these cool water bottles that I don't have in front of me here because I'm
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:49.980]   not smart enough.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.980]   But it was good.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:51.980]   So it was great.
[00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:52.980]   We have awesome listeners.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.980]   Awesome.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:54.980]   Awesome.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:01.420]   And also here, Mr. Alex Lindsey, visiting from the far visiting, visiting Petaluma.
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.420]   He's here from the east.
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.380]   He makes his home here, but he doesn't live here.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.420]   We should stop saying he's back from Rwanda.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:12.380]   He's never back from anywhere.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.380]   Now back is the wrong way.
[00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:15.380]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.380]   He's kind of everywhere.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.300]   Yeah, he's one of those things.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.020]   And ReneeRitchie, iMore.com.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:25.340]   I saw your state of the iMore post this week.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.300]   It's coming up with iMore.com.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.660]   This is your guys are, you've been on a tear.
[00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:31.500]   2013 was a big year for you.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.500]   It was huge.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:35.260]   Yeah, we were looking at the double our readership again, which is, you know, very scary.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.940]   Double your readership, is that what you said?
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.940]   We've been doing that almost every year since we launched.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:42.100]   We've been doubling our readership, which is kind of crazy when you think about it.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.100]   Nice.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.100]   But it's a huge responsibility.
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.280]   We want to really make sure that this year we're trying more than ever to, you know, do
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.020]   what the reader, give stuff that's real value and real quality to our readers.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.740]   We're doing a lot of, we want a lot of feedback from them to see what they want to see.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:54.740]   That's a novel idea.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:59.700]   Well, instead of trying to generate clicks, let's give something of value.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.340]   Here's the thing, my boss.
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.540]   I don't want to tell you how to run your business for an A, but you've been neglecting
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.260]   that for three years and you've doubled readership every single year.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.100]   It's possible that accuracy and value is not what your readers want.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:16.700]   No, I don't know if you consider doubling down for as a so-called editor position.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:21.300]   I've been humiliating and dis-satisfying readers since 1990.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.500]   I'm going to try to follow that.
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.860]   No, I'm lucky in that my boss has never once asked me about clicks.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.860]   It's not even on his radar.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.220]   He just wants to make sure the readers are really happy and that we're providing a service
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:31.220]   to them.
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.700]   But as you guys know, it's such a diverse readership now because there's the traditional
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.420]   geeks, there's all the mainstream people, there's people who want Mac stuff, who want
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.380]   iOS stuff, who use iOS on Windows.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.820]   It's really diverse and it's hard to meet the needs of all of them.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:45.460]   So we're trying to figure out better and more delightful ways to do that.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.860]   Yeah, that is the challenge.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:49.220]   Is the growing fragmentation of the audience.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.220]   Candy.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.220]   That's the key.
[00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.220]   I can't.
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.220]   You can't share candy.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.220]   I can't.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.220]   I can't add that in the show.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.220]   No, it's candy.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.140]   Candy question is, "King has trademarked the term candy questioner, sending out letters
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.140]   to everybody."
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:02.940]   Oh, but now you can use the word candy, can't you?
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.780]   Well, I put it, I just added it.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.220]   All right, we'll check it out when we come back.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.220]   We're going to take a break.
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.060]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:13.220]   There is no candy, but there is a cake.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.220]   So maybe that...
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.300]   Hey, I've had that cake.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:16.300]   It's a good cake.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.620]   We had someone in our office actually won the cake.
[00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:18.620]   Isn't it great?
[00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.620]   Yeah, it was very good.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.620]   It's no, this is no...
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   What are we talking about?
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.620]   FreshBooks.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.620]   FreshBooks.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:29.500]   FreshBooks is a cloud accounting solution for small businesses and entrepreneurs that
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.620]   you are going to love.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:31.620]   I used it for years.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:37.140]   In fact, until I really, until I had a staff, it is like having a staff.
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:44.900]   If you, I was using as many were, as many still do, word and Excel to create my invoices.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:48.740]   I had a shoebox of receipts to track expenses.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:54.540]   Amber MacArthur back in 2000, I think it was 2005, told me about this little company,
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.180]   this startup called FreshBooks.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.740]   I started using it to send invoices.
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.100]   Now you can manage expenses.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.700]   You can track time.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:03.780]   Does everything you need to do.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:05.940]   You get paid faster with FreshBooks.
[00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.980]   You can easily create invoices online.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:08.980]   That's a good start.
[00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.860]   I mean, the fact that you just can boom, create those invoices means you'll do it.
[00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:17.220]   It's not such a chore, which means you will get paid faster because I just never created
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.220]   them.
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.900]   I wait for months to invoice people.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.340]   You could capture and track expenses on the go.
[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:25.940]   You can get real-time business reports with a few simple clicks.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.620]   FreshBooks is free for the first 30 days.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:32.540]   So go to getfreshbooks.com.

[00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:49.380]   a section?
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.220]   I'm sure you would do that anyway.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.180]   Getfreshbooks.com.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:56.220]   Every day could be your birthday with FreshBooks.

[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.660]   Getfreshbooks.com.
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.820]   It was such a lifesaver for me.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.820]   I love them.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.780]   And I still have this kind of soft spot in my heart.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:12.460]   It's one of those companies where they just, I would rank them 100 on the scale for customer
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.700]   service and just doing a job that you need.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.860]   And freshbooks.com.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.380]   If you do invoicing or keep track of hours, you've got to get this.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.980]   Or expenses.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.020]   So tell us, Mr. Renee Richie.
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.900]   Well, actually, there's a number of stories and I'm more I want to talk about.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:34.260]   But you just mentioned, what was it you just mentioned?
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.260]   Yeah, candy crush.
[00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.100]   One of the most popular games on iOS.
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:39.100]   Some people love it.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.020]   Some people believe it's the closest thing to Casino Gamble.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.780]   I think it should be illegal.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:44.660]   It's a whale model.
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.740]   So they count on some people spending up to $1,000 a weekend on this game to generate
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.100]   the massive amounts of revenue that they get.
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:53.620]   So some people find that highly distasteful.
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.860]   Some people just want to play more and more of it.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:00.140]   But they've now trademarked the word candy as it pertains to games and clothing.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.140]   Wait.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:02.140]   In some senses.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:06.260]   You mean I can't make a game with the word candy in the title?
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.060]   They've sent out some desist led.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.700]   Like they've had the App Store send out some infringement letters.
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.700]   There was a guy who did candy casino game that got one of them.
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.860]   And it's interesting because for example, Apple owns a trademark to Apple.
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.540]   And Apple's a very common word too.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:23.620]   So can other computer companies use Apple?
[00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.100]   The trademark law is very nebulous to me.
[00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.660]   But they're arguing that there's some apps that are fine and they won't bother.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.860]   But there are other apps that they think try to make themselves look like part of the candy
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:33.860]   crime.
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:34.860]   That's legitimate.
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:35.860]   I don't blame them.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:40.180]   And I think you would win in court if you said luck, see your honor.
[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:42.260]   But if well, okay, here's one example.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.300]   Benny shoe who makes a game called all candy casino slots.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:51.860]   Actually, the title of the game is all candy casino slots.
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.780]   Jewel craze, connect big blast manial land.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.020]   Okay, that is spamming.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.020]   Search engine optimism.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.020]   Yes.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:03.540]   That is what for the two days seminar at the holiday in express, not the one day seminar.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.020]   And there is and there is candy.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.860]   If you look at the if you look at the game, there is candy in the, you know, the game.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:13.020]   It's a slots game where you have candy in it.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.020]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.580]   His icon says candy slots, which is what they took issue with was the candy in the icon and
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:23.580]   the prominence of the word candy in the apple was a apple has this mechanism where you can
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:27.580]   contact them as a rights holder and say that this app infringes and then they'll contact
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.260]   the person who makes that app.
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.260]   But then it's up to you.
[00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:31.860]   Apple doesn't want to get involved in the process.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.220]   So once that happens, it's up to you to sort it out with the other party.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:39.740]   And it's sometimes it's good because gait, like there's tons of temple run clones.
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.740]   Sometimes it's bad.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.740]   What else?
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.700]   Games like stone loops that got pulled off the store because looks kept saying the infringed,
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:48.340]   even though, you know, most people probably think they wouldn't.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.620]   But it's going to be a big problem because I believe memory now has also been trademarked.
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:55.500]   So keep people with the word memory in their games are, you know, sometimes having problems.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.540]   So let's see what else Benjamin shoe has done.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:00.580]   Maybe he's the question is like, is it all that way?
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.820]   Is he make a habit of this?
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.180]   In other words, yeah.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.620]   Well, that's a whole business model in itself.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:10.100]   It is in effect, you know, I play Clash of Clans, which is a great game.
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.740]   But if you look, there's like 800 games with exactly the same model.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.900]   And that's because supercell, I don't know if even they were the first, but supercell
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:22.100]   makes $2.4 million a day in app purchases.
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.380]   So these are his others, classic slots, candies.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.940]   So what he had was he had a slots game, which he has branded in a variety of different ways
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:33.300]   and candy slots was one of them.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:38.300]   And I think it's a very important thing to see in hopes that people who are predisposed
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.420]   to like the candy genre would land upon it.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:45.380]   Well, and you know, part of this is Apple's fault because their search is so bad in iTunes.
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.180]   I'm sure people just type candy.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.660]   And well, actually, hello, bite.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:56.820]   Look at all the iPhone apps that look like candy crush, candy crush saga, candy blast
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.620]   mania, candy maker, cotton candy where, well, that's not a farm horse.
[00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:05.260]   I'm not going to download Pippo Pobber Lite because that doesn't look like fun.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.860]   But you know, there are a lot of--
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.860]   The top version is good.
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.220]   It depends on who you are.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.220]   You're pro.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.020]   Pippo push your Pippo.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.020]   Candy shoot.
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.020]   Here's an exam.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:20.020]   And I'm not going after you guys particularly, but I don't know.
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.500]   Did this predate?
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:27.940]   If this came out before candy crush saga, then you'd say, well, I don't know.
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.180]   Is that a lux clone?
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.180]   Is that a--
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.540]   So-- and some games aren't even real games.
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:33.540]   They'll just have the wrappers.
[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:36.180]   Like, they'll be a Minecraft looking game and you open them up and they'll be nothing
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.180]   inside them.
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:40.340]   So I mean, there is a legitimate sort of knockoff problem on the apps.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:41.340]   Dem 90s.
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:43.340]   In our chat room.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.940]   Why is iTunes search so crappy?
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.940]   Because--
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.500]   What's the story, man?
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.140]   I have no idea.
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.340]   I think it's just low on the priority list.
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.340]   But they didn't even buy.
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.340]   They bought Chomp.
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.340]   In Chomp.
[00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.340]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.980]   That's an app recommendation engine.
[00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:02.940]   And the theory would make it a bit--
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:06.740]   It's so bad that if you're Twitter-ific and you update to Twitter-ific five, you'll no
[00:47:06.740 --> 00:47:09.020]   longer be a high-level search rank for that.
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.260]   I mean, it drops you all.
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.260]   It is broken.
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:16.860]   And so this is why I want Apple to buy whatever the service is equivalent of Nest is or Nest
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.700]   or anyone of those companies.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.700]   Yes.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:23.860]   Hey, do we-- did Apple miss a bet by not buying Nest?
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.700]   That would be-- did we talk about this last week?
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.700]   I think we did.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:27.700]   Never mind, forget I said.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.700]   Yes.
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.220]   I have no memory.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:38.820]   Also on "I'm More," big story, Apple has at least temporarily gotten Michael Bromwich
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.460]   off the case.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:47.660]   He is the court-appointed antitrust monitor that Apple says is horrible and doesn't know
[00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.140]   what he's doing and he's charging too much.
[00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.540]   And I think probably he is worse than he's subpoenaed everybody from Tim Cook to Johnny
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:54.540]   I.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:55.540]   Right.
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:58.340]   And I don't have anything to do with the e-books case that he's there.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:01.180]   Apple's been fighting to remove him.
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:05.900]   They said, according to Reuters, Apple's complained that Bromwich has been too intrusive,
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.660]   including seeking interviews with top executives and board members and has been charging and
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.740]   inflated $1,100 an hour for his services.
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.860]   The worst part is that he has no specific knowledge of the industry for which he is
[00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:16.860]   supposed to monitor.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:20.980]   So he had to hire an outside counsel at his own rate to do the actual work he was supposed
[00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:21.980]   to do.
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:22.980]   There's a word for this.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:23.980]   It's called nepotism.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:29.860]   Well, because apparently Judge Jennifer Cote, who's the judge of record on this case, is
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.860]   friends.
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:31.860]   Nep, nepotism.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:38.500]   So what is the what is the reprieve?
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:40.900]   He's off their backs while they file the appeal, I believe.
[00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.980]   Okay, which will last a long time.
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:43.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:52.420]   So Michael, give us your card key and we'll let you know when you can come back in.
[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:59.980]   People also in court agreeing to an FTC consent decree over in-app purchases.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.700]   I have mixed feelings about this.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:10.500]   Having spent considerable amount of money on kids in-app purchases on my account.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.860]   The issue, of course, is that Apple didn't soon enough.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:20.820]   They do it now, prevent children from buying currency or points inside apps and games.
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:24.380]   It's too easy in an app or a game and I agree with this to understand your spending real
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:25.380]   money.
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:30.220]   One of the guys in our office had his three-year-old daughter spent $450 in like an hour and hour
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.220]   and hour.
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:32.220]   It's really easy.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.220]   What was that fishing game?
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.220]   That was the one.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.220]   You buy fish.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.220]   It's a aquarium game.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:37.220]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.220]   It's something you want your fish to live.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.220]   You cough on that.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.220]   You cough it up.
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.220]   That's right.
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.620]   I mean, there was kind of like there were different objections to this from the interesting
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:49.580]   to the crazy and Apple said that it was double dipping because it already settled the case
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:51.220]   in court.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:55.720]   Some people also felt that it was suggested that because the person who now heads the
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:00.100]   FTC used to work for the law firm that represented Samsung and Google and was actually charged
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:05.340]   with spilling the secrets to Nokia about Apple, sorry, to Samsung over Apple's Nokia
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:09.660]   settlement that maybe that wasn't the best of images to portray.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:14.660]   Another one was that Google's policies are actually laxer than Apple's but the FTC went
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:18.580]   after Apple and not the industry at large, which is probably just because Apple did an
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:22.020]   app purchase so many years before anybody else and probably got complaints for years.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:27.660]   Because I remember last year getting from Apple a five dollar gift card.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:28.660]   Right.
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.660]   Who was this for?
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:35.380]   That's a makeup for this was there's this was their original settlement.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.380]   So the FTC, this is like a fine now.
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.380]   Is this like a.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.740]   See, Bob, they're saying that if Apple doesn't pay up to thirty five million for they're
[00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:44.980]   saying thirty four million is the least amount of money that Apple has to pay.
[00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:48.380]   So if people don't clean up instead of the five dollar card, they have to do full
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.380]   refunds.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:53.780]   And also if people don't claim that money, that it'll go to the FTC.
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:57.060]   So get your money now kids.
[00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:03.780]   So Tim Cook set out an all hands memo to employees on the 15th.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:05.300]   Of course, recode got it.
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:09.820]   I was a care swisher and company very good at getting these internal memos saying quote,
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:14.940]   it doesn't feel right for the FTC to sue over a case of that had already been settled
[00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:19.940]   to us.
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.740]   It smacked of double jeopardy.
[00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:27.020]   It feels it's decree better serves consumers who and this is the key unwittingly racked
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:30.340]   up massive in app charges because it requires full refunds.
[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:36.380]   I have to say the five dollar gift card did feel like I'd spent a little more.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.620]   I not made but my the kids involved had spent a little more than that.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:44.380]   And I have to I could tell you even a 10 year old doesn't really understand there's
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.380]   money real money there.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.380]   What do you do with your kids?
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.380]   Alex, I don't want them log in.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:48.380]   I don't know.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.300]   I don't want to turn off in that purchases and you don't give them the password.
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:53.540]   It's just Apple solved that.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.540]   Right.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:58.260]   But I guess this could are our kids are kids have access to it and they know they they
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.980]   always ask before they buy anything.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:02.780]   Yeah, they're pretty good about it.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.660]   Were there spankings involved getting into that point?
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.900]   No, but you know, I do have a way of punishing the kids.
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:14.340]   They have iPhones and they know they have me over a barrel that they have to keep
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.340]   their eye.
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.980]   I want them to have a phone.
[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.980]   Yeah.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:24.020]   But at CES or we all saw the brick and I can take their sim card.
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.020]   You haven't.
[00:52:25.020 --> 00:52:26.020]   Put it in this.
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:30.540]   We'll still have a phone, but it will be a brick phone.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:34.500]   You look like Michael Wallace and Wall Street and you should make them slick their hair
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.060]   straight back and worse as betters.
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.060]   That's right.
[00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.860]   Now my needs are served when they have the brick.
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:41.220]   That's brilliant.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.420]   I think so.
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:43.420]   I think so.
[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:47.460]   You see, this is, I thought, Oh, I'll give them a smart a smartphone and then I'll have
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:48.460]   something to take away.
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:50.300]   You always want to give them something so you can punish them.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.500]   And then I realized it punished me far worse than it punished them because I didn't know
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.500]   where they were.
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.500]   You can't catch them.
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:56.500]   Right.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.500]   Can't catch them.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.500]   Yeah.
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.500]   Brilliant.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.500]   Thanks.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.140]   Does the brick phone have a fine by brick phone feature?
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:03.380]   I doubt it.
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.380]   It doesn't have much.
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.380]   It does have a game and it can also be used as a Bluetooth headset.
[00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.380]   It has a link.
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:11.340]   I think it'll be a main purpose, but yeah.
[00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:12.420]   So did you buy that at CES?
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.020]   Dave, where'd you get that?
[00:53:14.020 --> 00:53:16.620]   No, I've actually had this since the summer.
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:19.300]   So this isn't the Benetone that they were showing at CES.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.300]   Oh, yes.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:21.300]   Benetone thing.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.300]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:25.340]   But they, their marketing company is actually right here in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.260]   So so I worked with them a little bit.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:28.260]   That's why you live there.
[00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:32.180]   They told them this boat and that they didn't get it out before Black Friday, but you know,
[00:53:32.180 --> 00:53:33.180]   that's good.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.180]   I would love that.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.580]   I did buy and they don't make it anymore.
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:40.100]   Sparkfun made an old Western electric dial phone that's a cell phone and I do carry that
[00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.100]   around.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.700]   It's not everything, but it only has a few hours battery life.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.980]   So and there's no safe game.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:51.420]   Are you concerned that the kids can still spell out boobies on the TV?
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:54.220]   There are worse things, Andy.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:55.220]   They're really hard.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:58.940]   I just don't even think I could do that with my, my, my six year old son.
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:02.700]   I told him if he didn't get stuff off the, like I said, I'm coming into the, into your
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:05.260]   room and if there's anything on the floor, but isn't clean, I'm just going to throw it
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:06.260]   away.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:07.740]   Like you have to clean it up and he wasn't cleaning it up.
[00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:11.060]   And I said, okay, you have to start picking what I'm going to throw away.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:15.260]   Because you have, you know, I gave him like six hours of deadlines, you know, to do this.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:20.100]   And, and, and my son looked at me and he picked up what I gave him for Christmas and, and
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.100]   said, well, let's start with this.
[00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:32.860]   I was like, oh, and I was like, oh, and I was like, oh, and then, and then, and then,
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:37.380]   emotionally blackmailing a little and then I took it and then I took it and I threw it
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.380]   away.
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.220]   And that's called check me.
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:42.460]   But it was like, but it was painful.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.860]   I was like, but it's like, it's like, it was just one.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:45.860]   I didn't throw it away.
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:47.100]   I put it in a thing.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.740]   I'm bringing back out some other time, but anyway, but the point is is that the, but
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.460]   yeah, I don't think I could play that game with taking his phone.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.220]   He would just do something else.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.220]   It's very sad.
[00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.220]   I want the Ben, a tone.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.620]   If you really a thing that is, that is so inspired.
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.060]   How old are you kids, Dave?
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.660]   My kids are 12 and 14.
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.940]   Oh, nothing more humiliated for humiliating or 12 or 14 year olds.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:11.940]   They have to carry that.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:12.940]   Awesome.
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:13.940]   Oh, you know,
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:17.100]   My daughter who wears those jeans that, you know, don't really have pockets so she can
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.900]   barely slip her iPhone in the back room.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:20.900]   I tell her, yeah, I say it's all about attitude.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:21.900]   It's all about attitude.
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:22.900]   You could pull that off.
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:23.900]   That's it.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:24.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:25.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:26.900]   Here's the picture.
[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:27.900]   That's awesome.
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:32.740]   I love him in back in the PI.
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.340]   I kind of do want one.
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:37.780]   I really want one and I want that mustache and the running suit.
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:39.780]   Now you come with it.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.780]   That number is only.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.860]   That's what America, this looks like American hustle.
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:44.860]   Have you seen that movie?
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:45.860]   This is American hustle right there.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.260]   Oh, I was going to say it looks like American apparel.
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:49.860]   Any ad they've ever done.
[00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:50.860]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.700]   It is making me feel slightly nauseous to look at it.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:53.700]   So it could be an American apparel.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.100]   I like the wallpaper too.
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.900]   The whole thing, if you're not watching on video, just go to Amazon.com and search for
[00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:05.620]   the brick Bluetooth one handset, two line, landline telephone by Benetone.
[00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:08.180]   And then you find it at meetthebrick.com.
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:09.180]   Meet the brick.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.340]   See, it's out of stock at Amazon.
[00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:11.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:15.020]   Well, it's a look at popular item.
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.820]   You've discovered a whole new way to torture children.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.660]   Yeah, I know.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:22.540]   My kids, listen, they're just like me.
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:26.020]   So it's like Alex said, it's a game of constant checkmate.
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:27.300]   You got to be able to deliver.
[00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:28.940]   I lost every time.
[00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:29.940]   I lost it.
[00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.500]   My kids are watching.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:37.100]   My kids are spoiled rotten because I never, I could never do any of that stuff.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.020]   I just go, okay, you win.
[00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:43.380]   Yeah, I have yet to brick them, but the threat is there.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:44.860]   Threat is there.
[00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:48.060]   It's not a fair fight because you know that at some point they're going to make the decision
[00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:49.740]   whether to put you in the good nursing home.
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.100]   That's what my son says.
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.100]   See?
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:53.100]   Exactly what Henry said.
[00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:59.140]   He said, Dad, just remember, I'm going to be in charge of your nursing home.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.900]   My kids are so smart about this kind of stuff.
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:01.900]   Even a six year old.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:02.900]   It was six.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:04.140]   I was like, that was quite a move.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.940]   It was a dead move.
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:10.460]   I mean, I didn't start doing those moves until I was like eight.
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.180]   So I guess he's a genius.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.180]   I don't know.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.180]   He's like falcon-crest for your house, isn't it?
[00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:20.460]   It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, yeah, yeah, it was rough.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:21.780]   It's come up ins for me.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:22.780]   I did that.
[00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:26.620]   My dad would usually back down and then look at how I turned down.
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:27.620]   It's a big mess.
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.620]   So I have to.
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.620]   I think that your dad did the right thing.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.100]   Because you're creative.
[00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:36.340]   See, I think the most important thing you do is to cultivate creativity in your kids.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.340]   My important parents.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:40.300]   They could be complete jerks, but if they're creative, okay.
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.420]   All my mom cared about is that we were obsessed, not bored.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:45.420]   So that's all that.
[00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:46.900]   That was really the only rule.
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:47.900]   That's good.
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:48.900]   That's cultivated creation.
[00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.900]   You just keep on feeding whatever upset you're so good.
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.380]   You could pick up a car so complete dick.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.380]   But he was a great fader, right?
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.140]   Are you calling me out?
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.140]   No.
[00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.180]   No, you're not at Picasso level anyway.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:07.820]   So the CEOs of Apple and Samsung met to try the behest of the court to try to settle.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:13.740]   And actually they're going to meet on or before February 19th.
[00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:19.900]   But apparently Apple is going to insist on an anti cloning provision.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:25.620]   HTC has already agreed to this with Samsung that will allow Apple, even though there's
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:30.940]   a settlement and there's license agreements, Apple can still sue if Samsung's products
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:36.340]   are too close to Apple's products in ways that could be avoided by design around.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:41.420]   Remember Apple said you don't have to make a square tablet with squares.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:42.980]   You could make it round.
[00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:43.980]   Angle.
[00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:44.980]   Angles.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:45.980]   Triangle.
[00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:50.060]   That would be awesome in another dimension.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:54.860]   According to Fos Patents, this could be a deal breaker, meaning they're going to have
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:58.020]   to go back to litigation if they can't.
[00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:04.020]   They have to judge that look, you guys sit down and hammer something out.
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.380]   But I wonder if Samsung would accept this cloning.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.220]   Apple's one most of these.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:10.220]   Apple's one month.
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:11.220]   Apple's one month.
[00:59:11.220 --> 00:59:12.940]   It's already rumored to come in both plastic and metal and to have a fingerprint sensor.
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.140]   I mean, this is big business.
[00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.140]   It is.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:16.140]   It is.
[00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:20.980]   But considering the range of stuff that Samsung makes, could any company with that kind of
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:26.260]   a portfolio ever make a modern line without infringing it?
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.300]   I would like to see how that language is applied.
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:33.420]   If HTC accepted it, then that means it's possible to build a touchscreen phone that
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:37.100]   is relevant for 2014 without violating that agreement.
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.780]   But again, I would like to see how that is spelled out that gives Samsung the ability
[00:59:40.780 --> 00:59:46.980]   to use a technology like fingerprint sensors that did not premiere on the iPhone by any
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:50.820]   means and still not get sent back to the outhouse.
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:53.100]   It could even be something simpler than a fingerprint reader.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.700]   It could be things like pinch to zoom.
[00:59:54.700 --> 01:00:01.540]   Remember that that was those three touch patents that Apple won.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:04.300]   Samsung said, "Well, we want to be able to license those."
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.300]   And Apple says, "No, not only can you not license them.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.060]   You can't have multi-touch."
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.740]   Well, that's kind of...
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:14.140]   I think it's fair to say that at the beginning, Samsung did everything they could to ride
[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:15.860]   Apple's marketing way by using similar-
[01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:16.860]   I agree.
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:17.860]   ...on-screen design.
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.700]   But the current stuff is really quite different already.
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.900]   It's almost like they're fighting a battle that's already progressed past where it was.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.900]   And from a point of view, consumers, and that's all I care about.
[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:31.700]   I mean, you can argue that Apple got ripped off by Samsung and probably argue correctly.
[01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:36.540]   But from the point of view of consumers, it's not good for Apple to be the only multi-touch
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.540]   manufacturer.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:38.540]   Right.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.540]   Right.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.540]   The diversity of the ecosystem...
[01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.540]   I shouldn't say something.
[01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.020]   Well, that's the question.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.380]   It sounds like Apple saying, "You can't even license this.
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.100]   You just can't do it."
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.100]   Is that just a negotiation?
[01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.860]   Is that just that risk of the price?
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:51.860]   Well, they're different.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.820]   Microsoft wants to make Android more expensive, and Apple wants to make it harder to use.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:55.820]   So that's both their advantage.
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:59.180]   So for Microsoft, if you have to pay licensing money for Android, then they're competitive
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.340]   again because they charge licensing for Windows Mobile.
[01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.180]   Apple has no interest in licensing fees.
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:06.780]   They just want to make a crappier user experience on Android so that iPhone stays what they
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.460]   consider to be a premier experience.
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.940]   Well, doesn't Microsoft make more money with their Android licensing than Windows Mobile?
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:12.940]   They do.
[01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:13.940]   They do.
[01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:14.940]   But again, that's a different philosophy.
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:15.940]   Right.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:19.260]   But I don't know how far Apple's going to get with that, considering that Google is now
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.620]   being more and more aggressive in the handset market.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:27.140]   And if there is an Ali versus Frazier on lawyers fighting against lawyers, that's going to
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:28.180]   be Apple versus Google.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:31.100]   They never want to go toe to toe against each other.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:35.380]   So I don't know how far they're going to get by claiming that if they're going to continue
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:42.100]   to claim that they have basic patents on fundamental multitouch operating UI, although
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:48.180]   if you roll back to the round one of these patent histories with Samsung, they weren't
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:51.020]   saying they were being very clear that this isn't about rounded corners.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:55.500]   This really is about trying to get recapture the entire spirit of a device.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:02:00.260]   So it's like I said, that's why, especially as a guy who not only do I not have a law
[01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:04.900]   degree in 11th grade, I was being sent preemptive letters from the best law school saying we
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:09.060]   don't even consider saying that we just don't want to even open the letter from you asking
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.100]   to be a law student at our school.
[01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:18.620]   So that's why the language is always so precise and express in the intent.
[01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:23.420]   I agree because there are two things that there are two signature fears I have about
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.740]   Apple and Google.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:29.300]   With Google, the signature fear is that anything that seems like a really great idea on the
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:33.980]   great piece of news on the surface, this is going to result in Google having more of
[01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.780]   my personal information.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:40.260]   I'm sort of okay with it, but I become more and more worried with more information I give
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.260]   them.
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:45.860]   With Apple, it's the idea of we're going to that they're going to have a exclusive exclusivity
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:50.740]   on more and more cool technologies because the problem is that if Apple has it, they're
[01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:55.300]   going to articulate it very, very well, but it's going to be a very closed ecosystems
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:03:01.420]   situation and there's not going to be a whole worldwide market of devices that can
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:02.420]   benefit from this.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.420]   They're going to try to defend this patent very, very, very tightly.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.060]   So those are the signature fears that I have about each one of them.
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.620]   So that's why I'm hoping that Samsung will get punished for what was clearly with the
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:14.820]   Galaxy S1 and 2.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.380]   Clearly let's make something that looks as much like the iPhone as possible while we try
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.900]   to figure out how to make something that's as good or better than the iPhone.
[01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:26.740]   They need to be punished for that, but the time that when it becomes harder for when
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:32.020]   when the market for phones and tablet operating systems stops becoming, let's create the best
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:36.540]   experience for the users possible and starts becoming, let's create the best experience
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.260]   that will not cause us to get sued by Apple.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:43.260]   That's when we start to question whether Apple's intentions are pro user or not.
[01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.540]   And part of the problem is patents are too long for technology.
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:51.100]   I mean, if I can't make a pinch to soon device for 17 years, well, I might you might as well
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.780]   just say you can never make it because there won't be any pinching by then.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.540]   I was thinking it's also very pro.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.660]   I mean, Apple in many ways is a very personal company.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:02.140]   The personalities of the people involved are more important at Apple than they are to
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:06.060]   a lot of other companies and Apple rightly or wrongly feels like they got sort of cheated
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.140]   out of the PC revolution from a partner of theirs, Microsoft.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:11.860]   And now they feel like they partnered with Google for the iPhone and they partnered with
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:13.540]   Samsung for manufacturing.
[01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:16.980]   And they in essence taught these companies how to do modern smartphones and these companies
[01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.140]   turned around and became their competitors.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.180]   Now, there's lots of ways to disagree with that.
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.140]   But if that's how Apple feels, especially under Steve Jobs and not as much under Tim
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:31.220]   Cook, but it's carrying on, it's hard to understand why they engage in these behaviors.
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:37.380]   Well, and I think that one of the issues is that in the early days, as we talked about
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.620]   earlier, you really couldn't tell from a distance you couldn't tell the difference between the
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:43.620]   tablets.
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:45.540]   And they were definitely drafting on that.
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:49.340]   But as you said before, I think that that's less of an issue.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:52.380]   But I mean, obviously Apple spends a lot of time on R&D.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.860]   And I think that I have become much more sensitive to it.
[01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:59.020]   Our company now does hardware and software R&D.
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.300]   And we write a lot of our own software and we're building our own hardware.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:07.940]   And I do have a different view of what it takes to do that.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.460]   There's just an enormous amount of work.
[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:13.020]   And so to come up with something and have somebody else, we have to be very careful of
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.260]   just not talking about it.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.260]   And we don't patent stuff.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:17.020]   We just don't tell anyone how it works.
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.820]   So I mean, that's the other side of it.
[01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:27.180]   Well, and with Apple, the issue is you've got people out there, we know the difference.
[01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:30.900]   We pick up an Android phone and we know darn well, it's not iOS and vice versa.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.540]   And there are things that you could argue are good about one versus the other.
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:39.220]   You've got the general populace out there that thinks their Comcast DVR is Tivo.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.940]   And it's even the Tivo.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.940]   People know that.
[01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.740]   The TVR is not Tivo.
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.740]   No, you see people know the difference between an iPhone and an Android.
[01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:47.740]   They know the difference.
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.380]   But they don't they know that there is a difference.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.220]   They don't know the difference.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.220]   And so an Android phone.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:54.220]   Good point.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.220]   It's more like and it's more like they don't say.
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:56.220]   They don't care.
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.220]   I think it's a very good phone.
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:58.220]   They don't know.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.220]   It's the same as an iPhone.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.220]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.220]   No way.
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:03.740]   But here's the main point.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:08.540]   I mean, we can there is so many just volumes and volumes of examples of again, look at
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:13.620]   here is this here is this phone that Samsung and and and HTC and these other makers made
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:15.020]   before the iPhone came out.
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.620]   And here's what they made the year afterward.
[01:06:17.620 --> 01:06:20.060]   And so it's hard to deny that.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.060]   Okay.
[01:06:21.060 --> 01:06:24.300]   It's hard to deny both that and the actual paperwork evidence that demonstrates that these
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:27.300]   these companies realize they're going to have to throw away what they were doing and do
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:30.100]   things like I don't like at the same time, though, I'm sorry.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.620]   This is the point that I wanted to make at the same time, though, you can go from, let's
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:39.380]   say 2009 onward and look at everything that was going on an Android before iOS seven and
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:44.140]   now look at features that are very, very Android like that turned up in iOS.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:48.060]   It's it's it's what it is the reason why you need to be very, very delicate and try to
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:52.860]   find try to get that very, very thin scalpel that figures out the difference between theft
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:58.940]   of an idea and theft of intellectual property and simply the recognition that, okay, the
[01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:02.300]   way that we're doing this on the iPhone or the way that we're doing this on our Android
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:05.660]   phone or the way that we're doing this on our blackberry phone is not nearly as good
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:10.260]   as this example that we just got that we just saw that we just bought off bought last month
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.260]   ago.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.060]   And if it means a better notification system for iOS users, if it means that a better sense
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:20.740]   of your path through through an application than for for users and if it means that, you
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:25.060]   know, God forbid they God forbid you accuse Apple of quote stealing something from touch
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.060]   whiz.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:30.700]   But the idea of scroll just simply swiping direction from the top or bottom now getting
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:34.100]   a panel of here's how you can turn off and on your your Wi-Fi and your Bluetooth and
[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.620]   things very, very quickly.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:42.020]   If that benefits users, my I think that it's I think that we want to have a very, very,
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:47.100]   very strict definition of what got stolen and the proof that this was an effective intellectual
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:52.180]   property and to we want to approve that this is not just simply a case of someone who came
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:56.420]   up with a great idea that was discoverable by other companies just getting their impacting
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:08:00.580]   at first because again, that's what real that that's what that's what that's what what
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:04.500]   leads to eight years from now in industry in which there are two makers of really good
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.580]   phones that are different from each other and then everyone else has to make the brick
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:12.900]   phone because that's the only one that's legally until somebody still somebody somebody
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.500]   patent the numbers one through four and then another company has a patent to the number
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:21.260]   five through zero on the keypad and now you can't even have the brick phone anymore.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:30.500]   Well let's talk about let's talk about sales numbers because I think that by the way these
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:34.820]   numbers it's always so hard to assess these so that's what we have you experts here.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:42.380]   Apple says they sold 55 what was it million iPhones last quarter that's up 16 percent.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:47.780]   55.3 million iPhones or maybe it's analysts it's not Apple Apple's not saying Apple's
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:51.940]   not reporting till next week right will they will they say a number though next week yes
[01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:58.820]   okay well historically they have always said a number okay NPD other analyst group always
[01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:04.420]   take those with a grain of salt says Apple got 42 percent of the US smartphone share in
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:12.180]   2013 Q4 Samsung only 26 percent and then HTC Motorola and BlackBerry down in the fourth
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:17.940]   quarter but this is an NPD report and the problem is it's not segmented the smartphone
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.380]   market is going to become the phone market and the phone market is so large that it's
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:26.300]   irrelevant you know what the share is it's more what's the share under $200 phones was
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:30.260]   to share over $600 phones those kinds of things are going to be much more important it happens
[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.420]   in the car industry the water industry but for some reason consumer technology always lags
[01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:38.940]   behind in quality and I'll let analysis of this kind of stuff.
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:44.100]   Fortune did a really nice chart so Monday Apple's going to announce its numbers we'll
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:49.580]   know by next Mac break weekly and we can compare this to the guesses portion did a chart of
[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:55.060]   all the estimates look at all these and so the average is 55.3 million but it goes as
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:01.020]   high as 59.7 million from the Brayburn group and as low as 50 million from the Brayburn
[01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:06.580]   group to a different analyst same group so it's a you know we'll say over 50 million
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:11.340]   we have a big number.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:16.620]   Pretty pretty so the point being at least in the US and I think it we have to say maybe
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:23.060]   only in the US the iPhone is still totally dominant right yeah.
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:27.500]   Again it's the number so if you look internationally phones that are cost over $600 Apple has a
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:32.020]   huge market share of them phones that cost under $400 Apple has a zero percent market
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:35.980]   share because Apple doesn't have any yeah and this kind of stuff is typically not factored
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.820]   into these kinds of things and it's really important information for every industry
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:44.580]   to have right right except Apple doesn't care we talked about we've talked about that
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:48.940]   does Apple doesn't want that market no they didn't want it for max for a long time either
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.660]   they didn't want to make a net book they did want it for iPods though didn't they they
[01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:56.060]   really ate up all the oxygen on iPods and they did they did you know it's kind of systematically
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:11:00.060]   and slowly you know it was why are they doing that with the iPhone because I bet you it's
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:05.660]   really hard to make a cheap iPhone at the spec that they make it out you can't make an iPhone
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:11.980]   shuffle screenless I'm calling who am I calling it doesn't matter you're calling the next person
[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:17.860]   yeah exactly yeah yeah exactly but I think I think that's hard I mean I think with a lot
[01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:21.780]   of the stuff Apple gets into these you know specific things I think we talked about it
[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:26.620]   earlier but like these these track pads I heard that the failure rate was like 40% when
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:30.580]   they started shipping and so a lot of times things getting out going out slow is not just
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:35.100]   because it takes a long time it's because they're getting a lot of rejections and the
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:39.260]   things just not meeting those criteria and so I think that's the issue yeah.
[01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:48.580]   Version 7.1 beta 4 is out came out yesterday iOS 7 look I know every time I talk about
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:54.340]   this somebody says no I have had no problems with iOS 7 on my iPad or my iPhone they're
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:12:01.780]   not I believe them but but you saw it here right here this is a virtually a stock iPhone
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:06.540]   5s and it just restarted while we were on the show I wasn't even touching it just went
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:12.700]   and it restarted and it wasn't a springboard restart it was a reboot so and I and I got
[01:12:12.700 --> 01:12:18.580]   to think it's iOS 7 it could be the iPhone itself 7.1 Leo or on 7.0 I'm on you know whatever
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:23.980]   the 7.04 the whatever they officially ship so are you on 7.1 can you admit it if you
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:30.180]   are I I tend to try the the beta so that I can write about them with yes some degree
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:37.820]   of knowledge when they actually ship okay so will 7.1 be a relief I think people will
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:41.740]   be really happy with 7.1 I hope I hope Apple puts it out soon if not I hope they put out
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:47.740]   a 7.0.5 soon because re springs are not good I mean I don't have a single device that's
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:51.700]   perfect all my devices have their quirks their flaws their problems their glitches they all
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:57.420]   require updates periodically but iOS 7 is incredibly popular hundreds of millions of people use
[01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:01.980]   it and re springs is not something you want people to see with any frequency but you know
[01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:06.220]   much less crashes so yeah do you have the issue where you're trying to answer the phone
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:14.820]   and it doesn't it's not responding to your finger I love that that's his iOS that's your
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:21.140]   phone saying yeah you don't want to talk to your mom right now exactly it's it's particularly
[01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:27.340]   problematic because people aren't used to having these problems yes I mean iOS 7 I don't think
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.420]   it's I don't think it's been a disaster by any definition but it's the first one where
[01:13:30.420 --> 01:13:36.860]   I've noticed that ooh this is that I'm having a problem with this a lot I'm having same sort
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:41.380]   of issue with Mavericks and that this is the first one in which I'm having recurrent bugs
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:47.220]   that are so annoying that it is really harshing my mellow so it's me man and that's and it's
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:52.180]   been it's been a long time since iOS or Mac OS has done that sort of stuff to me so hopefully
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:56.700]   it's going to be addressed really really quickly one of the things is a 64 bit is having
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:01.220]   apparently having memory like it's running out of memory faster than people anticipated
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:06.140]   so they're one of the updates they're going to do is for the 64 bit memory and hope and
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:09.980]   I mean the iPads also are still one gig of memory was probably not the best of choices
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:15.460]   for the new iPads hopefully the new ones will have more than that a bad choice for a 64
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:20.900]   bit OS and 64 bit just the memory management doesn't seem to be as good it just they seem
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:24.340]   to run out of memory faster on the 60 bit 64 bit versions because the things are bigger
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:28.220]   that they're doing but in general I think the iPads would have benefited from more RAM
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:36.380]   okay good and do we see a Mavericks update in the offing they're in beta I mean they're
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:41.940]   always I think nine whatever the next one is 10.9.2 is already up for developers so those
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:48.300]   will just chuckle on across some of my fingers and maybe maybe mail will be fixed but don't
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:54.340]   pull your mail mail with Gmail is the big problem right yeah just Gmail it's for the
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:15:02.860]   most part yes was awesome but it is the managing a large amount of mail with any iMap account
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:08.580]   is very different in Mavericks than it used to be in Mountain Lion Gmail sees it the worst
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:14.380]   because gmails iMap implementation is a bolt on at best for Gmail right but you know even
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:20.620]   with it just any amount of mail Mavericks just doesn't deal with large quantities of mail
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:25.100]   in any one mailbox as well that's that's the big issue and I it doesn't make any sense
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:30.180]   to me because they had this was a solved problem and in Mountain Lion they unsolved it
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:36.140]   they unsolved it yeah it doesn't I mean I get what they were trying to do with Gmail
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:40.860]   in terms of dealing with all mail differently and all of that and that that was great but
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:47.460]   I don't understand why that by changing that would break managing lots of mail simultaneously
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:52.540]   but but they succeeded in doing that for no good reason so hopefully they'll undo that
[01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:57.780]   what I think is awesome is in iOS is when you when you get your new mail your new Gmail
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:03.220]   and and you open a message and it disappears while you're reading it just it just it gets
[01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:06.460]   moved to another folder and you're like you're you're in the middle of it and then just gone
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.820]   and then you're like okay now I have to figure out what folder it decided to put it in so
[01:16:09.820 --> 01:16:13.100]   I had that problem Alex and it turned out that it was paying too much attention to Google's
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:16.580]   new mapping when Google started the social folder and the priority inbox and it would
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:20.180]   move it around and then mail would no longer see it and it would pull it out yeah it was
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:24.940]   it's been it's been awesome yeah it's there's so much blame to go around on both on both
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:29.260]   sides there Gmail's implementation is just kind of it's great if you're staying it really
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:34.060]   is designed to be operated through a web browser and a mail reader that that Google absolutely
[01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:39.300]   controls but that's that said there are other mail readers that that can do it with a lot
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:43.540]   more elegance than than iOS so but there's definitely a lot of blame to split between
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:50.980]   multiple between multiple parties here they're all wrong wrong all right any other stories
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:58.980]   before we take a break and get to your picks of the week let me see here Google Play movies
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:04.220]   and TV and iOS that's nice I use Google Play music on iOS very happy glad they did that
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:11.460]   I'm glad there's another multi-platform movie store available yes because I still think
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:15.820]   that if you're buying movies and TV shows directly from the iTunes store that's not a
[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:23.140]   long view play that's that's going to be a problem the more the more you buy the the
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:28.140]   more the more worried I get the more I buy from the iTunes store with the iTunes DRM because
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:32.660]   it's it's a great retail experience it's great video the hardware is great but what happens
[01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:36.820]   three years from now and there is a you bought this wonderful two hundred and fifty dollar
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:40.980]   NAS box that does a million things for you and it will do things for you if you've got
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:45.140]   Amazon video do things for you've got Google Play video that unfortunately you spent four
[01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:48.660]   hundred dollars on movies on the iTunes store and Apple doesn't want to play with you interesting
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:54.380]   leak from 9 to 5 Mac apparently Adobe briefly showed a page for its Lightroom for iPad you
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.300]   may remember last year we saw a video of a developer showing it on an iPad 2 for some
[01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:04.180]   reason the idea that Lightroom for the iPad would be integrated with Lightroom on the
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:09.140]   desktop you could make changes on the I would love this it would read raw for one thing which
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:12.860]   nothing on the iPad does and then you can make changes on the iPad and it would automatically
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:19.460]   sync with Lightroom unfortunately if this if this page is accurate since been taken down
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:26.100]   on Adobe site they plan to charge ninety nine dollars a year for Lightroom for the iPad
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:30.980]   I guess it'd be a great thing that's why they took it down I mean I think it was a trial
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:37.460]   balloon like let's see if anybody notices and what would they say it's a you're crazy
[01:18:37.460 --> 01:18:41.100]   now I well I think that the question is whether whether that's a ninety nine dollar a year
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:45.740]   for only that application they've got a lot of different cloud I pay ten bucks a year
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:50.740]   for they had a photographer package of Lightroom plus Photoshop right ten bucks a month I should
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:55.380]   say at 120 bucks a year and I thought that was a good deal right because you had Photoshop
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:19:00.740]   if they would throw in Lightroom for the iPad on that would be great yeah right that's not
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:04.700]   I don't think what they're saying I have the full crate of cloud it's fantastic because
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.860]   I use a lot of their apps but that's for me it's a murder deal than buying it thirty
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:11.220]   a month yeah I got the discount because I had a license for the last version so I forget
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:14.740]   exactly what the retail was but it might have been 50 if you had no previous version but
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.940]   it's still a great deal when you think about how much I was spending on all those apps
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:20.860]   individually over the years well yeah and I don't mind because I get Photoshop I don't
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:25.620]   mind ten bucks a month Photoshop plus Lightroom I already paid for Lightroom so that felt a
[01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:30.980]   little bad but that's why I got to get the deal I guess is because I was in Lightroom
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:36.020]   and Photoshop and licensee at one time it might be an interesting move because I the more
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:41.180]   photographers I speak to I've met more and more photographers who are moving from aperture
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:47.060]   to Lightroom because the average is not updated ever yeah exactly there it's there they it's
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:50.220]   it doesn't work as well with the large with the large libraries that they like to work
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:55.900]   with but also there it's a vote of I can either start the pain process of transitioning now
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:20:00.540]   or I can be forced to when I realized the writing is on the wall or when they they final cut
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:05.780]   10 me and I'm I'm in the process of leaving aperture and and it's it's painful but what
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:11.060]   happened was is I literally opened up aperture and I've been importing old iPhoto you know
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:15.700]   libraries and when I went into it there was a whole bunch of stuff that was just the previews
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:20.020]   so it hadn't grabbed the full and unfortunately I have the I got them all backed up and everything
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:23.940]   else and I have to go through and figure that out pain point but I've got you know 200,000
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:27.060]   photos and there's and there's and a lot of them are all you know trying to trying to
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:29.300]   go through there and some of them are there and some of them aren't some of them are somewhere
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:33.100]   else and then I just I used to think that it would be great to have aperture just kind
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:36.820]   of manage the library because it's all in one big chunk and it's all there and I just realized
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:42.300]   that it wasn't managing it very well so you know and I was trusting it too much I mean
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:47.380]   one of the big selling points of aperture was the fairly recent merging of its database
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:52.780]   with iPhoto so I can but that's a nice but I still use Lightroom but I have to admit that
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:56.580]   this one this one issue with bringing those iPhoto ones in because this is like pictures
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:01.900]   of my kids and all kinds of other stuff that now are like 600 by 300 now and again I I
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.500]   have it all I tend to be a little bit of a pack rat but it's gonna you know it's gonna
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:09.020]   be weeks or months of slowly going through all of that to figure out where they all
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:12.780]   are there features that you're missing from aperture when you moved to Lightroom 5 I don't
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:15.340]   think there's a lot of features I think there's actually more features in Lightroom I think
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.660]   that it was mostly that that I liked it being organized and I thought that it was pretty
[01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:22.180]   fast and I liked it all being in one big pile that I could move around without having
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:28.100]   to manage that photos nice and it's um photo stream yeah the photo streams good but I mean
[01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:33.140]   I can still do that in fact you probably want to do it in a more orderly way where you
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:37.500]   pick stuff in Lightroom export it out and import it to iPhoto and now turn on photos 20
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:42.500]   my rather than having all 27 photos on photos straight I'm doing it 1000 but my wife always
[01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:47.620]   knows whatever I'm doing because my iPhones my my Apple TV at the house is synced to my
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:52.020]   iPhone's photo stream I like it so when it plays obviously just you know she's a you know
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:54.980]   she'll be like why are there a bunch of pictures of field runners I don't understand I was like
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:22:02.500]   because I was on level 400 it was supposed to be 60 level those level 400 I'm gonna take
[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:08.340]   a picture of that so anyway but so that's a wonder if that you know that I photo it's
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.940]   already not that wasn't I for the Lightroom for iPad will come with storage because if
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:15.260]   you're moving raw files back and forth they're probably gonna have to do that online if they
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:21.180]   package it's larger than the price makes they do you get with you get it's enhanced right
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:28.020]   is that the name of their but but hands by hands that's terrible not enhanced bull hands
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:33.100]   that's interesting though because you know we're talking about moving our large photo
[01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:38.420]   media libraries out of Apple's ecosystem Andy was just talking about don't keep your movies
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:45.380]   in Apple's ecosystem and of course iTunes works for music but it's really slow when you
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:50.540]   have lots of music in there so I mean does Apple have a problem long term with this yeah
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:55.460]   this is not good it's I mean iTunes I have to I have to admit that I get a little bit
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:23:01.780]   as a I I'm such a since since since since since the Apple 2e I've been a fan of Apple
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:06.780]   I'm a happy user of Apple I still rely on Apple for I think some of the best products
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:09.980]   that you can I mean there's nothing comes close to an iPad and there's nothing that comes
[01:23:09.980 --> 01:23:14.660]   close to a Mac but for me but it makes me a little bit sad when I realized that they
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:19.620]   to me they kind of ruined iTunes and that's when I realized that I can I can move my I'm
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:24.660]   gonna use Google music as my cloud storage for music and it's gonna work better it makes
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:28.620]   me a little bit sad when I'm keep looking at I actually actually like the way that aperture
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:34.420]   works I don't like the workflow methodology of Lightroom I like the idea that I can sit
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:39.460]   in have a real multi windowed multi toolbar app that lets me basically discover how to
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:43.860]   fix these photos and aperture but the more time I spend in Lightroom the more I realize
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:48.780]   that oh man there are two major hassles with aperture and they both be solved if I switched
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:53.660]   and you're absolutely right you just it breaks your heart that they're I want I want I want
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:58.820]   to speak in generalities it breaks my heart that there are such big important things about
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:02.340]   the computing experience that I know now no longer think that Apple does really really
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:07.580]   well certainly not well enough that I want to use that as as my as my resource and ecosystem
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:11.380]   lock in is a huge selling point you know I mean it's well that's well that's it doesn't
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:17.540]   work huge it doesn't I mean like for me I in all of us when we travel I like to bring my
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:22.940]   iPad on the airplane and watch a movie how difficult is it to get a movie from my library
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:28.140]   to my iPad when I'm sitting in a hotel room right and the answer is not at all if I have
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:33.260]   a plex server in my house and I you know I'm a plex past member it would have heard 30 bucks
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:36.980]   a year I'd press I want that movie and then I go to sleep and in the morning it's on my
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:42.020]   iPad and I go you know the airport and I'm good to go that's impossible if I had everything
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:47.700]   in iTunes on my computer at home I felt like such a dope because I kind of I kind of had
[01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:52.140]   I kind of was using in my Apple TV as my main like cool little hockey puck thing plugged
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:58.500]   into the TV for for streaming video for months and years I had the the Roku 3 just sort of
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:03.300]   has a test device I was it was attached so that I find some new app came in then sling
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:10.140]   box came up with their new with their new app which caused me to update the update this
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:14.700]   the Roku for the first time in like three or four months and now I'm almost never using
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:18.140]   the Apple TV because this is the first time I've I spent like a few days saying I'm gonna
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:22.020]   do another deep dive into Roku and that's what I realized that oh I didn't realize that
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:26.220]   they have a streaming that they that I connect it's not built into Roku but I can download
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:31.500]   an official an official Roku app for playing things that are playing storage that's usually
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:35.420]   playing media files are simply attached to USB and I'm thinking that it'll just play
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:40.860]   this this cool file that is dropped onto a USB drive but oh it found every single deal
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:45.540]   deal in a compliant media server on my network and saying you want whatever movie whatever
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:49.620]   music whatever you want anywhere doesn't matter what what library created it will happy to
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:55.420]   serve it for you and now all these other third party apps are on the are on the Roku that
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:26:00.500]   are available on Apple TV and the only thing I miss from Apple TV is the screen saver that
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.740]   feeds from my flicker feet really that's the only thing I miss about it.
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:08.620]   Well it's also nice when you've got your iPad and you want to you know you've got something
[01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:12.500]   from YouTube up and I want to show the kids I can just you know boom right on the TV.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:17.340]   Okay but but but again see this this is like unfortunately this is like the it's almost
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:21.780]   as if the world is trying to collude against me and against my love of Apple TV because
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:25.740]   that's exactly what I was thinking well still it's nice when you have the iPad or my MacBook
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:31.380]   and then Roku finally released their official YouTube app and YouTube has that feature where
[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:35.380]   if you have the Chromecast plug in installed that's great you can just simply tap a button
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:39.380]   within the YouTube player and now you're streaming directly to the TV and it takes over from
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.820]   the streaming from from your iPads like oh that is better damn it.
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:46.700]   There's two kind of things that I try to remember with this stuff too though first is if you're
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:51.500]   outside the US almost no one but Apple still provides like I can't I just can't get Amazon
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:55.940]   movies Google Play has movies I've bought some whenever I try to watch them it asks me to
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:00.100]   rent them from YouTube even though I've already bought them so the kind of thing I don't think
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:04.420]   this is going to be solved until the DRM goes away because horizontal or vertical lock-ins
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:08.340]   essentially are the same thing and if you live through Microsoft's music experience when
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:12.540]   they started shutting down services just because they played on a wide range of device didn't
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:18.300]   help you from not being able to watch them on any of them so I like Andy's idea I like
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.380]   the idea that everything is just stored on the cloud I think it works great for music
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:25.780]   now because music you can take from your machine put it on the cloud nothing's stopping you
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:29.700]   from music and less than until Hollywood agrees to get rid of the DRM I think every solution
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:31.180]   is still kind of broken.
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:35.540]   I think I'll be completely honest I'm very very quickly I'm sorry I'll be very very
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:41.700]   honest I'm saying that I think that you shouldn't buy movies and TV through iTunes I definitely
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:45.340]   but I think that the optimum is to not buy them digitally at all I still if there's
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:49.420]   something that's worth keeping that I will buy it on DVD or Blu-ray and then rip it I
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:52.580]   just don't want to buy it in a digital locked up format.
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:58.220]   Yeah and I have to and I have to say I think as a you know with a family and people everybody
[01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:02.380]   sharing everything I think for me you know I do buy a lot of movies on I mean I just
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:08.020]   on iTunes or on Apple TV or whatever and and my whole thing is that everybody can use
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:11.500]   them they don't have to explain it I don't have to you know I don't you know it just works
[01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:15.420]   I mean I know that that's the marketing thing for Apple but I mean it just it's like everything
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:19.220]   just kind of works and I don't have to explain to my wife how to make that work and or my
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.300]   you know all my kids and I can put anything on their iPad and I don't have to figure it
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:25.740]   out and so I think that it just depends on how much effort you want to put into that
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:28.140]   and so for me that's not a priority.
[01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:30.140]   Well you can speak for a while.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:33.980]   Like for us okay so for us it's not geeky but for anybody else I mean Apple TV is like
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:39.180]   I just go click and it works and and all the other ones I mean we I put versions of all
[01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:44.300]   of these at some point in time you know in the house and you know my wife just goes back
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:48.420]   to the Apple TV you know because she doesn't want to think about you know she takes one
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:51.980]   wrong turn and she doesn't want to do that anymore you know and so and so that's the
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:55.740]   issue is that none of them are as slick and for us I mean I thought it was by myself I
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:29:02.300]   probably do a lot of more geeky now and more complex solutions that that were more elegant
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:08.300]   in that way but but the but as a you know with my family or my parents you know I just just
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:11.220]   want I just want to be able to turn it on and not call me.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:12.220]   I really like it.
[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:15.860]   I would really like iTunes in the iCloud the way I work is an iCloud now I think it'd
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:19.980]   be great if Apple took whatever is still sitting on the crappy windows version of iTunes and
[01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.060]   the Mac version just put them up on the cloud.
[01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.540]   I too I mean iOS can stream now it didn't used to used to have to download so I don't
[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:29.340]   even bother downloading movies anymore I just press the play button on iOS and it streams
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:33.220]   them but to have all that web browser based when theoretically you could access from any
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:37.260]   device then I think that you know it would kind of slow it would remove some of Apple's
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:41.740]   lock in but it would save so many problems for so many people that I think it'd be worthwhile.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:46.820]   Yeah what a good discussion I don't even know how we got into it but thank you.
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:53.660]   I'm a little blown away that you're that you're looking at at Google Plus I was just
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:59.420]   trying to see if there was anything more to talk about that we that we have missed.
[01:29:59.420 --> 01:30:01.380]   I love Google what are you talking about I love Google Plus.
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:04.780]   I thought you kept on saying that it was you know I'm not I like it's one of the reasons
[01:30:04.780 --> 01:30:05.780]   I like it.
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:08.300]   Yeah it's because it's a great place to hang out with people who work at Google.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:15.020]   They all use Android and it's great actually Google Plus has become more and more dominant.
[01:30:15.020 --> 01:30:18.820]   The real thing I was looking for is Chris Marquart's video workshop that he just put
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:22.660]   up discoverlightroom.com for people who are making the change to like I'm going to watch
[01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:23.660]   that aperture.
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:28.180]   He's pricing is interesting so there's a there's I don't know how many six and a half hours
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:32.780]   of video but you can choose your price so use depending on how you use Lightroom anywhere
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:34.820]   from fifteen to hundred bucks.
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:40.420]   And you get you get to choose the price same workshop different anywhere from fifteen to
[01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:41.420]   hundred bucks.
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:42.420]   Okay that's funny.
[01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:43.420]   Most people can choose fifteen.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:44.420]   Yeah I think.
[01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:45.420]   But if you're you know if you're pro.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:47.940]   For a little bit more at Chris and yeah Chris does great stuff.
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:51.580]   He does he's great and I know that moving Lightroom is probably fairly painful.
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.260]   I love but I have been using it for a long time.
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:55.860]   I just have too many photos and I wish I had done it earlier.
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:59.580]   That's my problem so it's going to be like the two thousand fourteen just real quickly
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:01.980]   aperture it's going to get an update right.
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:03.980]   No we don't know.
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:07.620]   I mean they have to have a Pro Tools teams working on it so it should get an update.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.060]   Wouldn't bet on it though.
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:12.900]   The double fear I do believe it'll get an update the question is what kind of update
[01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.460]   will it get right.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:18.340]   I mean well well well it's still beat will it still do the task that it was designed to
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:22.500]   do three or four years ago as a great one for people decided to build their businesses
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.220]   around the job that aperture does.
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:29.100]   Well for those who want to make the move this is probably a pretty good deal if you've ever
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:33.660]   owned Photoshop at least Photoshop CS3 or later.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:36.580]   This is the one I went for the foot they call it the Photoshop photography program it's
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:37.980]   part of the creative cloud.
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:42.180]   You only get two programs though Lightroom five and Photoshop creative cloud version.
[01:31:42.180 --> 01:31:46.100]   But you also get twenty gigs of storage a beance pro site.
[01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:51.740]   Ten dollars a month when you set up for the year plan this is not an ad just a mention.
[01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:57.540]   But I you know I haven't had Photoshop last Photoshop I bought was six and I just I thought
[01:31:57.540 --> 01:32:00.060]   you know I really probably should have Photoshop.
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:02.060]   It's good I think that pixel mator is doing a lot better.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.540]   I mean I think it's but there's some good choice.
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:07.620]   I think the problem is I think if I if I was just getting into photo editing I could probably
[01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:10.620]   use pixel mator and be pretty happy with most of the stuff I think the problem is is that
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:14.380]   I've been using Photoshop since two right version two and I and it's very it's very hard for
[01:32:14.380 --> 01:32:18.460]   me to like I go in a pixel mator and I just want to do certain things that I can't quite
[01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:21.620]   figure out how to do but every every update it's there's a lot of things that makes a
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:26.900]   lot faster than Photoshop so really it's fascinating because it goes on a modern architecture
[01:32:26.900 --> 01:32:30.660]   so and is using the GPU properly and the one thing about app about Photoshop is when you
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:33.980]   open it I just know everything else on my computer is going to run a lot worse so when
[01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:37.220]   Photoshop's open you really got to use it and then you got to shut it because it's
[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:46.740]   right on that Mac Pro test doesn't it sorry no but everybody's tried when can I play
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:50.820]   with a Mac Pro it's my house oh never I'll bring it in bring it I want to I want to do
[01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:55.500]   some three to come by you know my desktop but there's now every time I like I was doing
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:33:00.540]   a I was teaching a class this morning in Rwanda from my house and um and we were talking
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:04.300]   about how to do flags you know how to do a 3d flags and how much would you pay to borrow
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:08.060]   it was going very slow it was going very slow and I was like I can think of it back in my
[01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:11.460]   head was I wonder how fast this would be I have a new way of make money I can lease
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:16.940]   up my rent my Mac Pro to Alex you know no you could you please borrow it okay I'd like
[01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:20.860]   to play with it yeah yeah how long I'll a couple days okay I'm going gone for I'll be
[01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:26.100]   shaking a little bit but I'll survive like Thursday and Friday I bought Thursday and Friday
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:32.260]   okay actually one of the things that I did notice is the one I got is the base model except
[01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:37.780]   for it we did upgrade there or Ed actually thank you Ed Ed Gengberger Eingberg Eingberg
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:45.180]   upgraded the RAM slightly to 16 gigs but the 250 gig SSD filled up pretty quickly yeah
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:50.900]   you got to release external I mean yeah so I had an external SSD from other world computing
[01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:55.780]   that I plugged in but it's USB there's not we need more Thunderbolt 2 no Thunderbolt
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:33:59.940]   not enough even there's a lot of I got a Buffalo Thunderbolt device it's really just
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:04.980]   kind of a USB it's the same speed as USB 3 so let's try mine what do you have look I
[01:34:04.980 --> 01:34:10.180]   need a fun I have a kind of a Frankenstein one you have a promise no no no my external
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:13.780]   drives when I'm on the road so when I'm on the road I need I need I need external drives
[01:34:13.780 --> 01:34:17.020]   and I need to be able to swap the drives out but I need a Thunderbolt interface and so what
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:22.860]   I do is I buy Seagate makes these little Thunderbolt sleds for their drives I don't and then what
[01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:26.900]   I do is their drives are too slow so what I do is I buy then I just buy raw sand disk
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:31.540]   drives and then plug them in and then I tape them you know and then and then you plug them
[01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:36.100]   in and you get like 400 megs a second and so you can move them search to airport security
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:42.100]   90 it does look pretty good really did you just strap it to your body maybe get a vest
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:46.660]   yeah yeah then I have a vest that goes like this that's good that would be awesome
[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:50.980]   Scotty best so you got to put a couple business cards underneath it because there's like a
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:54.260]   little I do have a Scotty best I just think there's a lot of deceptive stuff that says
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:34:59.060]   it's Thunderbolt but it's not that fast the internal PCIe dual channel Thunderbolt not
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:06.900]   Thunderbolt PCI'd eat dual channel internal SSD is is reading it almost a gigabyte a second
[01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:13.100]   that's so crazy 973 megabytes a second so I want that on my external to but what do you
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:17.300]   need it for for my data drive I because I'm just using so what is what is you using
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:22.420]   I mean it's not I mean it's fast enough I'm using external data drive I just feel I got
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:26.420]   it I should have it no I know when I bought it when I bought it to CI when I bought it to
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:31.300]   CI they said that they they said why would you ever need 122 megabytes exactly of of
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:35.300]   of this space exactly because I'm working on audio if you spent out the butt for your
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:39.460]   Mac Pro you don't want to put a USB 3 drive on it that's why I was like dial up
[01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:46.900]   anyway is so are there people making truth under bolt to storage I guess we saw some at CES
[01:35:46.900 --> 01:35:50.820]   but it's not available they're gonna be expensive they'll be very expensive there's a promise
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:56.660]   enclosure RAID 5 enclosure that I think is truth under bolt 2 it's 700 bucks for the enclosure
[01:35:56.660 --> 01:36:00.660]   minus the drive but then you could put a old but you want to get the speed out of it you need
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:04.500]   this is to raid them you know the sea is the one I want the little big disk
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:09.140]   Thunderbolt 2 but I think that's going to be really expensive
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:15.060]   where do you know your time is valuable see this is the problem of the Mac Pro
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:20.660]   three thousand dollars but you have to have a three thousand dollar monitor and you have to have a
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:24.820]   three thousand dollar RAID array that's all they get you and then you need the shoes and you need
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:30.660]   the purse and the sunglasses don't forget the sunglasses it's like it's like it's like a Tesla
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:35.220]   owner you know you rarely meet a Tesla owner doesn't also have the Tesla hat and the Tesla jacket
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:41.460]   exactly I shouldn't bring this up it just makes me sense so no no I absolutely agree with you I
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:45.700]   think that I think that anybody who really thought out that purchase if you really thought out before
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:51.460]   before clicking that button you either decided that an iMac or or even a Mac mini will serve your
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:56.740]   needs very very well well with a couple of extra accessories or you decided that I either today
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:00.820]   over in the near future I'm going to need that and if you did blow three thousand dollars on a
[01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:05.780]   desktop part of you has to say that well if I don't want to leave performance on the table right
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:10.820]   it's it's it's the the the the meaner way of saying that is like it's like losing five thousand
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:16.420]   dollars in in blackjack and saying if I don't put in if I don't bet another two thousand dollars
[01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:22.020]   to get that money back then I will have blown the first five grand but I but I I definitely see
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:26.980]   your point I mean you know it's why if you're gonna put USB three why not just put USB two why
[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:32.500]   to put a battery cartridge on it a lot of people are saying Drobo but I gotta emphasize there you
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:36.820]   might have a thunderbolt interface that does not mean that you're gonna have the speed that you
[01:37:36.820 --> 01:37:40.980]   will only take another chance of Drobo but I and I have about to Drobo's and I use them every day
[01:37:40.980 --> 01:37:45.060]   but I've never seen a fast Drobo no that's not what they're this is the one I know this is what you
[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:49.860]   want I don't know what it's gonna cost it's the lacy little big disc it is thunderbolt two
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:57.620]   they promise 1.3 gigs per second for 4k video editing it's SSD in there and that's really where
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:38:03.380]   you need that kind of speed is 4k at any multiple layers or my iTunes library let's not let's not
[01:38:03.380 --> 01:38:08.260]   discriminate mmm what's the starting price we gotta be able to start that song yeah exactly
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:14.180]   they know it's so expensive they actually don't put a price on a slower he's like where's my mili
[01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:22.180]   Cyrus I'll ask for a quote um it is the SSDs are thermally coupled with the external aluminum
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:30.020]   enclosure to prove prove heat this is its dual PCI E SSDs not say they were showing us that thing
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:35.060]   it's yes yeah one Leo no they took it apart there's no fan it just did yeah I mean there is a fan but
[01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:41.140]   it rarely turns on yeah well that's the well by the way that's another issue the the Mac Pro is so
[01:38:41.140 --> 01:38:45.860]   quiet that I actually hear the buffalo spinning drive it's very frustrating it's annoying you
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:51.140]   understand like I want I want all solid state or nothing did you just get some earplugs and
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:56.740]   save yourself no you don't understand so that's what a good stereo Andy understands you understand
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:02.260]   Andy you understand I understand I may I may not approve but I understand this
[01:39:02.260 --> 01:39:08.740]   this your your logic is sound even though it may be a ideology that I even though I do not
[01:39:08.740 --> 01:39:12.580]   pray to your god I understand why you love your god well and I'm pointing out that if anybody if
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:19.460]   any of you at home are interested in a Mac Pro that you have to understand that you're not it's not
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:25.940]   just three thousand dollars even the base unit because well you got to get a 30k 4k display
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:32.660]   $3,500 and you got to get at least one if you want to get your full value but the reality is
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:39.220]   if you're doing 3d you don't buy this thing if no I don't need a 4k monitor right now well I
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:44.580]   don't have one eyes aren't that good I have enough trouble with this monitor it's not even 4k and I
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:51.620]   like went at it like what's going on all I'm saying is that if I if I bought a Mac Pro every
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:55.940]   singles fraction of a second that I'm looking at a spinning beach ball would fill me with a
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:40:03.140]   white hot rage that I'm seeking immediate output precisely precisely and and no sound you don't
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:09.060]   want any sound no right everything should be very quiet until I play Miley Cyrus it's actually
[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:16.660]   loud a wrecking ball you know squares all about the wrecking ball path to madness it is literally
[01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:24.580]   the path to madness Renee you have nailed it some some of the four came on later Leo still not happy
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:31.540]   exactly you cannot win no some of us are on the journey within some of us are not I bought a
[01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:42.100]   $2,500 Mac 128k with one 400 kilobytes swapie floppy paying ever since I still pay in the Macy's
[01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:48.180]   bill can I can I just can I just say that all I had to do with that when I was a teenager all I
[01:40:48.180 --> 01:40:56.180]   had to do was wait like two or three years and I was able to buy a Mac 512 for $94 that's that's
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:41:01.620]   that is laid out my path in hardware ownership for life that if I wait a little bit if I wait a
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:07.700]   little bit longer so long as I never have to render out a Pixar short on my desktop I can save about
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:15.620]   90 percent you this is a guy who only shops at the MIT flea market well that well actually the the
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:22.260]   90 the the $90 Mac 512 that was actually broken because it was in the computer store that I worked
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:27.300]   at and I'm the one who broke it and as soon as it and as soon as the automatic markdowns went down
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:32.660]   to a place where I could afford it I bought it then went back in and put retouch the cable that I
[01:41:32.660 --> 01:41:37.300]   internal cable that I disconnected here is here is here is a breaking story thank you to the
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:44.100]   chat room for this uh Steven Troughton Smith hello I'm Steven Troughton Smith he's an app developer
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:50.660]   he has posted images on twitter minutes ago of the upcoming iOS in the car interface unclear
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:58.100]   according to Mac rumors how he got the images but you can you can see the images on Steven Troughton
[01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:06.820]   Smith um Twitter feed I don't see the images here I want to see them crazy smart developer and he's
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:12.500]   cross-platform to like he's he's at every one of the apple and google and windows events he's fairly
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:18.820]   terrific aha I guess Mac rumors didn't was so nervous they didn't even want to put the images
[01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:28.420]   there maybe last time they got nervous I know really wow well if they if they have something that is
[01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:34.820]   not if it was press if there's a press photo that they don't have rights to maybe they've seen it
[01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:41.540]   in other forms right and they don't want to uh yeah what is Steven Troughton Smith's twitter
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:47.860]   handle do you know that off the top of your head or s t r u g h t o n smith
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:55.380]   I don't know you could have handles that long you know you're right Steve TS
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:43:01.220]   um it's not coming up because our internet has decided to go down to protect me from myself
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:09.540]   our show today you can exercise for left to the viewer or listener
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:14.660]   anything to say about the iOS for the car I mean that's exciting I'm looking forward to it I want
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:18.420]   iOS for the home I think you know app doing bidirectional airplay to other displays I think
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:24.100]   could be great for apple if they push it through here's uh here's maps uh i still think apples
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:31.140]   just make cars safety warning so basically this does this the point of this that when you plug in
[01:43:31.140 --> 01:43:37.460]   your iPhone it takes over the display in the car or is this in the car already no this is you
[01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:41.940]   your iPhone going to it's just a conduit right yeah yeah it's just like every plate of the apple tv
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:47.460]   but the car can send stuff back as well all right whoo so the car you could use a car GPS
[01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:54.100]   maybe maybe you wouldn't want to uh yeah exactly maybe you wouldn't want to but just the ability to
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:43:58.900]   have that let that low level of interactivity between the the center screen access to the touch
[01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:03.860]   screen and also access to the mechanical plicky buttons that are on the dashboard or on the steering
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:08.820]   wheel and not just have it be a dumb bluetooth like connect okay but actually be part of the
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:14.740]   user interface that's potentially huge but just just the just their ability to demonstrate how
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:20.820]   effectively they can broadcast iOS is also a big deal if you think about all the other
[01:44:20.820 --> 01:44:25.140]   devices they could broadcast that iOS interface too yeah so they don't have to make a tv set they
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:30.900]   don't have to make an interactive you know curling iron they could just simply have a small chipset
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:34.580]   that they can just simply work with whatever iOS device you already have or microwave
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:41.300]   was on my camera microwave please our show today brought to you by Squarespace.com the secret behind

[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:02.900]   the metric app which lets you keep a track of all of your analytics very nice and all of this
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:07.300]   eight dollars a month when you buy an annual plan that includes a free domain name if you

[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:28.180]   inventory tracking unlimited digital physical or service products I mean it's such a great thing
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:33.860]   we have a project we're working on right now with Squarespace or using Squarespace yeah we were
[01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:36.900]   like developing all this stuff and they're like well we want it to work it's a training platform
[01:46:36.900 --> 01:46:41.380]   it's a training thing and we wanted to work on all the tablets and we wanted to work on websites and
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:45.220]   and so there was this kind of off-handed response like why don't we just see if we can just build
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:50.020]   this on Squarespace and it turns out you can so it's we're building the whole training thing you
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:55.780]   know they're just it's all built around just using Squarespace to that's neat to develop the whole
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:59.860]   thing that's that's one thing that Squarespace is so good for is just this kind of quick and
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:04.740]   dirty site you can actually if you get two weeks free without even a credit card if that's sufficient
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:08.500]   you could do something really quickly they don't even mind if you do that they're very nice about
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:17.380]   a squarespace.com when you buy by the way use the offer code MAC break one for January MAC break one
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:24.900]   and you will get the first 10% off your first new account so that's a nice deal to MAC break one
[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:32.100]   squarespace.com time now for our picks of the week I see Alex reaching into his magic bag
[01:47:32.100 --> 01:47:37.060]   he's kind of like Santa but let's start with our guest Dave Hamilton for Mac Geek Gab and the
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:42.740]   Mac Observer soon to be playing his drums at the Flint Center this Saturday when do you fly down
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:49.780]   I fly on Friday we have a rehearsal Friday night and then that's that you know they're going to be
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:57.780]   good if they're rehearsing yeah we rehearse once whether we need it or not. I can't wait do you have
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:02.340]   anything I don't know if they warned you do you have anything to pick yeah they warned me mid-show so
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:11.060]   thankfully had this thing here it's from anchor i-a-n-k-e-r.com for 26 bucks you get a
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:18.580]   it's a charger right you plug it into your AC outlet yep and it's got five ports on it but the cool part
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:26.180]   is it pushes eight amps across those five ports and it can do it in any combination you like there
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:31.300]   aren't some ports that are only two and some that are one and this is important if you've got an iPad
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:36.740]   or you know something that needs more than that it'll charge your android stuff just as easily as
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:42.900]   it'll charge your iPhone or your iPad and and that's actually kind of a big deal because the two amp
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:48.020]   requirements for iPads and two amp requirements for android tablets are different the devices
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:53.380]   actually do a handshake with the with the USB port and if they don't get the handshake they want they
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:59.300]   they go down to just one amp like like normal USB so yeah this thing's pretty cool I was using it
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:05.300]   while I was out at CES and I was able to charge everything simultaneously no problem at all so
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:12.580]   that's uh that's my pick and it's like 26 bucks too I'm a huge anchor fan I buy everything anchor
[01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:18.500]   they're they're they're kind of the apple of battery stuff I agree they get a nice little
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:24.660]   thing in the box it's so nice to touch yeah batteries yeah yeah and I always get anchor I have a number
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:29.700]   of anchor external charges but I also get anchor external you know extra batteries for my phones
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:36.740]   and stuff like that I just love anchor yeah an ker it's i a n k er dot dot com calm
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:42.500]   Andy and I code what do you got for us uh this is one of my favorite alternate
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:47.620]   presentation apps is by boink software it's called photo presenter it's just 99 cents in the iOS
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:53.140]   app store because I love I think keynote is one of the greatest mobile apps ever made the ability
[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:59.460]   to do such beautiful formal presentations on the mobile devices just unsurpassed but it's not
[01:49:59.460 --> 01:50:03.620]   every presentation you give is a linear presentation we're going to start at point a and go through
[01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:08.500]   point 12 or whatever oftentimes you just know that you're going to be talking for about 30 minutes
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:11.940]   it's going to be a meeting a lot of different topics are going to come up and you want to be
[01:50:11.940 --> 01:50:17.060]   able to dynamically display whatever piece of information is going to be relevant at that time
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:22.900]   and that's what photo presenter is all about all it really does is it's essentially like a photo
[01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:28.900]   viewer uh on the presentation device there's a just a a tray of like everything that you think is
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:33.700]   is relevant you can also look at albums that are on the device and when it's not showing something
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:38.820]   it will show like just whatever whatever stock image that you that you want like your your company
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:44.580]   logo or uh or uh or the or a present or meeting meeting uh notes or whatever like that uh but as
[01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:49.140]   soon as you decide that oh we're talking about China now so if I tap this now people will see
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:53.860]   uh picture from the apple store and then when someone says but but if we have a presence in China
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:58.260]   won't there be knockoffs and you say well yeah I got to admit that when I was in China I did
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:03.460]   I was able to see a whole bunch of like apple knockoff phones as a matter of fact I actually
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:09.540]   bought a knockoff uh iPhone 3G this was a few years ago this this is where I'm talking about
[01:51:09.540 --> 01:51:12.900]   and then when they say wow you've got a lot of travel photos here so oh yeah well that's where I
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:18.740]   that's where I met the luewell and I did carpool and this is my picture of the Sagrada Familia
[01:51:18.740 --> 01:51:22.980]   and I don't know if you notice it if you know that but the ham is a really big deal in Spain
[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:28.500]   there so in Barcelona so you can actually buy ham flavored ruffles and so basically and when
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:33.300]   I was in London I tried to get a picture of the cows at the uh Abbey Road crossing so basically
[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:37.860]   if you've got if you've got like attention deficit disorder and you're just going to be again leaping
[01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:41.860]   from topic to topic but you don't know what's going to be handy I mean that's this is this is
[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:46.820]   just absolutely the perfect app for for that sort of thing I mean I'm joking but there really is a
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:54.260]   need for this kind of an app because I was I used a lot when I sometimes am invited to
[01:51:54.260 --> 01:52:00.660]   interview like comic creators on stage at the comic conventions and what I will do is I will
[01:52:00.660 --> 01:52:05.540]   load up this app with just if it's an artist just images that they've drawn from all their comics
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:09.860]   because if they start getting into a story about you know working with Bernie Wrightson it's nice
[01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:14.020]   to be able to happen to have a cover of that comic handy you suddenly tap tap something and
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:21.060]   there it is on the big screen 99 cents extra features are in app purchases like again the ability to
[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:27.140]   the ability to replace like the photo presenter icon with whatever you want to establish as the
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:32.660]   not showing anything screen that's one of them the ability to have a highlighter
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:37.780]   and a spotlight thing that's another in app purchase but the core feature is 99 cents and it's
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:43.140]   incredibly so it's it's a nice thing to have I bring this up a lot in terms of when it comes to
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:48.180]   iPhone apps and iPad apps there are apps that they cost 99 cents it's good to have them on the
[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:53.140]   device already at the time when you realize that oh man I really wish keynote could do this well
[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:56.020]   you know it doesn't do this but fortunately I happen to have photo presenter which we'll do
[01:52:56.020 --> 01:53:01.140]   exactly what I wanted to do great I already have that that's neat I'm gonna have to buy it right now
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:08.900]   photo presenter from its blinks blinks we love blinks we love blinks blinks is very lovable yeah
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:14.660]   and we always we always have what's his name from points on the show when he's in town all over all
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:22.340]   over whatever his name is fine hard way I can't believe he's gonna get mad at me is it Oliver
[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:27.460]   Olivier it's Oliver Oliver Oliver by the way congratulations Dave you have killed i anchor
[01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:35.060]   dot com so well done hey that's my job that's what I do the twitter army will not be defeated we
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:40.980]   twit twit recommendations we really are the magical monkeys paw because they'll say there's a company
[01:53:40.980 --> 01:53:45.300]   saying oh I wish that twit or another big show like that would recommend and really speak highly
[01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:50.020]   of our product and the devil says we will grant you your wish what you should have asked for is that
[01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:54.820]   and our servers were able to actually capitalize on all those referrals and convert them into sales
[01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:58.980]   there's no there's no it's not by accident that we recommend Squarespace before we do this
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:05.540]   it's a good point sorry anchor at the end of this we go and if you had been using Squarespace you
[01:54:05.540 --> 01:54:10.260]   would still have your site all of anchor stuff is also sold on amazon so you can always go to amazon
[01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:16.820]   search for anchor and I don't think we've brought amazon down yet but it's a goal though it's a goal
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:23.300]   I can retire everyone can dream Alex Lindsey what what you got there i got i got two i got two
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:28.660]   same gin i got two two things all right okay so one little software one okay so this is um
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:36.100]   this is kind of a cool app so um like you do oftentimes we're trying to analyze audio coming in
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:40.740]   you know in our pipeline and you want something that you can just kind of grab and there's a
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:44.980]   there's a little program called analyzer for your ipad and so what it'll do is you can get a so
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:50.820]   here you can see this is here do we have an over the shoulder for Alex or should I hold it up on my
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:58.260]   side here okay so here it is it's called i it's what analyzer it's called analyzer analyzer and
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:02.980]   what you're seeing there is it's just using the mic that it has and it's it's analyzing it so
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:07.220]   so and a lot of times we're looking for i mean what i'm looking for is is whether we're getting
[01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:16.500]   some odd you know sound uh see now you know the pitch of uh so when when Leo generates a tone it's
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:22.260]   at about 500 uh about 500 Hertz oh let's see the overtones are screwing it up
[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:29.940]   now if you go down if you hit the little button below this is hypnotic just watching it yeah and
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:33.860]   if you're down with your arms when you get when you start talking again because i've got my headphones
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:38.100]   off right exactly so yeah you can change the octaves that's so that's a pretty coarse one actually
[01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:39.300]   oh yeah that's better
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:48.980]   but there's other graphs so if you click on that little uh in the little menu button on the on the
[01:55:48.980 --> 01:55:55.220]   lower right yeah yeah yeah yeah the hamburger yeah and go up and go FFT plot oh so there's
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:56:00.420]   oh that's pretty so beyond being just cool is this really expensive before i get into my side
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:05.780]   I don't know how much it is hold on that you know it's a cutter card um so uh i don't have to look
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:10.900]   at what and how much this costs actually um now what i do with it now if you go go down again
[01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:14.900]   yeah and click on the menu window hamming the little menu no no over menu and then go to
[01:56:14.900 --> 01:56:19.460]   spectra graph oh that's pretty this one i use actually probably more so what this is doing is
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:26.420]   giving you kind of a heat map of your um of your sound and what this is really good for if you have
[01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:30.340]   you can visually see if there's a buzz being added to the line you know because you'll see it up
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:34.100]   but up in the 10 Hertz you'll see this little line going across and that's noise it's really
[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:39.540]   you know and so um you know that becomes really useful and so so anyway um so this is a way to
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:42.580]   analyze it now coming through your microphone is not going to be that useful but you can use
[01:56:42.580 --> 01:56:46.980]   something like this this is a little interview you have a noise noise generator all right
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:51.780]   it'll generate that'll generate yeah it has a it has a ton it'll generate tone that's this is
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:57.380]   we should have this uh this is really great yeah and so all right what's this thing now what that
[01:56:57.380 --> 01:57:02.580]   does is it if you want to get your signal in your xlr signal you can just pop it into the microphone
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:07.620]   jack and um and that's like 30 bucks on Amazon i mean i used to you know i don't there's a lot of
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.980]   them that make to make those um anyway and there's a couple of different interfaces i've been kind
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:16.260]   of playing around with a lot of them i i bought probably uh five or six of these analyzation
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:21.140]   sound analyzation tools and um and it's uh and this is the one that i like the best i mean there
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:25.380]   there are a lot of them are very similar um but this is as far as an interface and and ease of use
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:28.900]   um there's ones with more features there's you know a lot of different things that you can do
[01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:33.860]   just dsp mobile yeah nice 15 bucks and i spent some of them are like a hundred dollars on the bottom
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:37.540]   all if you bought this in hardware this would be thousands oh yeah yeah it's really nice and it
[01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:43.540]   allows you to really you know they do have some in-n-app purchases so right yeah and so so anyway
[01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:48.500]   there's a there are um you know i i really like this one a lot um for the price you know i think
[01:57:48.500 --> 01:57:52.900]   there's some that are a little more expensive that i've that i've um that i've gotten that i like too
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:58.500]   but but this one i'm trying to be trying to be nice and um so add you're gonna want to at least
[01:57:58.500 --> 01:58:02.740]   so it's 15 bucks and you're gonna want to spend another three bucks at least for using the built-in
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:08.740]   microphone although it supports apogeez mic which is great right uh you can also use the apple ahead
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:13.060]   at earphones or earpods but you have to buy well you really want to something i mean i don't know
[01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:17.540]   for me when i'm analyzing this stuff i want i want a line in you know because i'm what i'm looking
[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:21.860]   at is and what's really useful for this is you can say you're hearing something but it's a lot
[01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:25.380]   when you're talking to the audio engineer going you have you have sound in the line they never
[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:28.260]   believe you they'll be like oh i don't know what you're talking about and you show them a picture
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:32.420]   of see this right here that is that is that is the ground loose so great you know you know you know
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:37.300]   you know and so so yeah um and and it also this is good for bar bets
[01:58:37.300 --> 01:58:42.900]   i never thought of using this bar bets but it's a good i i hear a high-pitched tone do you
[01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:48.900]   no right let me show you the spectral analysis yes exactly so um so anyway that's that's that's my
[01:58:48.900 --> 01:58:54.340]   that's my pick my second pick is just this is just darn um what's the URL so this is trouble with my
[01:58:54.340 --> 01:59:01.540]   internet map's engine.google.com and if you haven't seen this um yeah you have to it's crazy so um i
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:06.180]   wasn't really this is a interface to google maps or yeah but it's it's a developer interface and so
[01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:12.340]   but it's much easier and so um alan uh alan golberg in south africa met me in roanda and showed me this
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:17.540]   so let me create another check create a new map or should i open a map uh you should create a new map
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:22.100]   okay well i'll create a new map because it's easier for well i don't know how to see it
[01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:24.900]   create a map and share it with me and then i would be able to see it so this is a neat thing so i'm
[01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:28.900]   gonna create a map and there's some classic my maps like yeah so you can here's my walk to
[01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:37.620]   world oh we played laser tag and i can import the laser tag g kml file into this and it'll give you
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:46.900]   how this is me running around playing laser tag so that was kind of fun um so what i can um let's do
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:52.340]   something else when i work map sengine um so i can go in here and i let's make create a new map i'm
[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:56.980]   gonna play with it too you play with it not play with it okay so but you can you can basically bring
[01:59:56.980 --> 02:00:01.780]   in excel files and so you can have a lot of information and what's cool about it is you can build a map
[02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:05.140]   and it used to be you have to figure out the gps record notes and you had to do all a lot of other
[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:08.980]   things right now you just have cities you know like it's just that you know all you need is the
[02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:13.380]   is the is the raw cities so here's for instance um i'm i'm importing a
[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:19.780]   the other thing is you have nine different backgrounds you can you can import on top of so this is a
[02:00:19.780 --> 02:00:23.460]   there's a terrain background so you can see elevations there's the satellite map
[02:00:23.460 --> 02:00:29.700]   uh you can have a political map which means merely state divisions on it light or dark you can have
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:35.060]   this is this is a white water so water is white so you can see all the bodies of water so we had
[02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:40.100]   a for instance we had a form we have these forms for a lot of the events that we do that um
[02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:46.740]   uh so this was a form everyone just filled out the form and just put their city yeah and so here
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:53.860]   i just imported this from our database so you can import in a csv or an xlsv file so in fact you
[02:00:53.860 --> 02:01:00.340]   can even use google uh google drive itself to have somebody fill out a form right and then
[02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:04.100]   automatically import those values i haven't tried to automatically do it yet but we've exported
[02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:08.260]   it is you have to do manually yeah right and so you import it and so here's like for instance this
[02:01:08.260 --> 02:01:11.860]   is like this is the distribution for those of you listening and this is a whole bunch
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:17.300]   this is a lot of dots a lot of people that signed up for this specific event and i click on one of
[02:01:17.300 --> 02:01:21.780]   these dots and it's all the information that was in the database oh wow and i didn't do anything
[02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:27.140]   that is really and so i wish i could show you that yeah but anyway it's it's um it's pretty slick uh
[02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:30.500]   pretty slick little tool and so somebody geek forever in a chair says there is a limit to the
[02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:34.900]   number of pins yeah there's i think there's a limit of a couple hundred pins i think it's like
[02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:39.540]   yeah i i got the pro one for five bucks oh okay so the pro one's like five dollars a month and uh
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:43.940]   and then you can have up to two thousand pins and then the i think that there's a developer one which
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:48.420]   they don't have the price for which i'm going to find out um which is um i think hundred thousand
[02:01:48.420 --> 02:01:51.940]   pins or something like that wow and you can have multiple layers and so you can all you can set it
[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:58.100]   up and and it's it's uh it's definitely a rabbit hole uh i just didn't and i don't think it's super new
[02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:04.340]   but but until alan uh goldberg in south africa had shown it to me i i didn't uh didn't know it existed
[02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:08.980]   and it's it's crazy awesome and it's maps engine and it's definitely worth playing with that very
[02:02:08.980 --> 02:02:13.780]   cool yeah couple of cool things uh finally let's wrap up with rene richie in your pick of the week
[02:02:13.780 --> 02:02:18.100]   rene i have both a complaint of the week and a pick of the week i think we should call it a
[02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:22.500]   bitch of the week i'll start with the bitch of the week then so a couple years ago apple introduced
[02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:27.380]   air print which is a fantastic way to print from your ipad or iphone to a network attack or
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:32.740]   through a wifi printer in your vicinity but what they didn't roll out is print to pdf now i understand
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:37.860]   this feature actually exists i don't know if it was ever finished or not but if you've ever wanted to
[02:02:37.860 --> 02:02:42.500]   just you can take a screenshot on ios that's true but it's only the screen if you ever want to share
[02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:47.780]   a complete web page in a you know a packaged form at the same way you have the wonderful pdf
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:52.260]   features on the mac where you can just save something as a pdf like a receipt or a web page or
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:58.260]   basically anything you want that same capability could exist on ios but either you know it's it
[02:02:58.260 --> 02:03:02.660]   hasn't made it into the feature pipeline or people don't think it's an important enough feature or
[02:03:02.660 --> 02:03:07.060]   enough people would want it but there's been several occasions where i've just i've just wanted to make
[02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:11.700]   a pdf out of the content that's on my iphone and if apple could add that in if they could squeeze
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:17.220]   it into the pipeline i would be super really grateful to them so that's my complaint of the week okay
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:24.500]   my pick of the week is storehouse which is uh at storehouse.co it's a website and an ipad app
[02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:30.340]   it's created by mark kuano and his team uh mark kuano was at frog design then he worked on the
[02:03:30.340 --> 02:03:36.260]   interface of photoshop then he worked on building aperture at apple and finally he was user experience
[02:03:36.260 --> 02:03:40.740]   evangelist at apple until about last year when he left and went into you know his own
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:45.860]   uh company and he's been working on this since then i've been part of the beta so i've had a
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:50.340]   you know the pleasure of watching it develop and he's a photographer he loves photography and he
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:55.220]   always wanted a way for photography to at least have the an equal chance at being a storytelling
[02:03:55.220 --> 02:04:00.980]   mechanism on mobile because there's so many really good text based platforms and writing apps and
[02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:05.380]   he wanted to wait for people to be able to easily and quickly take their photographs and make really
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:11.540]   beautiful looking stories that they could easily share so with storehouse you can pull photos
[02:04:11.540 --> 02:04:15.620]   from instagram from your camera roll from flicker from all these different sources
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:20.340]   you start off with a template you can pull images in you can very quickly move them around
[02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:25.620]   it's got the kind of interface you expect from a guy whose job it was to criticize interface at
[02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:30.820]   apple so it's it's very physics based things float around you can move them around easily
[02:04:30.820 --> 02:04:35.620]   you can stretch them they'll bounce and snap into the right sizes so it's hard to put things
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:40.100]   in the wrong places and then it's really really easy to share them once you've built them you
[02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:45.300]   just create an account you can see other people's uh stories that they've shared and then you can
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:52.180]   easily construct and share your own right now it only works on the web and on the ipad but you know
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:56.820]   we're used to using flip board we're used to using all these things that are existing in those
[02:04:56.820 --> 02:05:01.220]   one places so it hasn't been a detriment to me and you know if you don't want to go to pages and
[02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:05.460]   actually make a document if you want something more than what a if you don't want to do the work
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:09.940]   that would be required to do it in WordPress or tumblr or you know four square something like that
[02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:14.980]   this is just a really easy way it does video and images so you can have those beautiful
[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:23.140]   slightly moving pictures as well and they they just it's not it's not bristling with features yet
[02:05:23.140 --> 02:05:27.220]   but the features that it does have they really knocked out of the park excellent
[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:32.100]   excellent choice well we got some really good pics this week i'll tell you we'll put them in the
[02:05:32.100 --> 02:05:37.860]   show notes at twitter.tv/mbw that's where you can find the show of course download it listen to
[02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:42.980]   audio or video you can watch live we do it tuesday's 11 a.m pacific 2 p.m eastern time
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:50.020]   1900 UTC don't forget the mac 30th is coming up saturday dave hamilton and the mac all stars
[02:05:50.020 --> 02:05:55.060]   will be performing their mac 30th dot com for tickets. David's great that you're coming out
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:06:00.020]   look forward to it and we'll have you back real soon macobserver.com and of course mac geek
[02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:06.420]   gab at macobserver.com always a pleasure. Oh yeah thanks for having me. You've muted your
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:10.660]   your octopus what do they call it the squid yeah i'm going to use a different mic when i come on
[02:06:10.660 --> 02:06:16.500]   again everybody's giving me a hard time. I used to be our 40th studio. You sounded fine. No it sounds
[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:21.140]   great it sounds great i'm not a fan of usb mics in general but this sounds fine it sounds fine yeah
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:26.100]   absolutely we're snobs here and you don't listen i get it i'm a snob dude your mac geek
[02:06:26.100 --> 02:06:31.620]   gap has the best sound of any podcast in the nation so we know that you know we know you know
[02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:37.300]   it's how we roll. Thanks dave great to have you thank you Andy and echo chicago sun times always a
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:42.340]   pleasure if you ever decide. Oh you got a great microphone yeah and we know that you know that
[02:06:42.340 --> 02:06:50.580]   we know that you know you got a great microphone hey naughton why i turn a moon alice so Andy if
[02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:54.100]   you ever want to get out of this snow and move to beautiful california i've got a i've got a

[02:07:37.380 --> 02:07:41.380]   andy if you want to be out here i'd love to we you don't need a guy who delivers wood out here
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:48.580]   it's optional it's optional we have munchkins you don't need it as per it's purely recreational
[02:07:48.580 --> 02:07:54.100]   we don't have moose we have we do have deer but then don't bonomas always a pleasure andy
[02:07:54.660 --> 02:07:58.420]   thanks they always think about life on the west coast it's waiting for you
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:03.940]   yes like the west coast manager i'm not i'm not sure i'm used to that three-hour head start on my
[02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:08.420]   west coast editors that the oh that's literally the only thing you know what that's a good point
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:14.420]   you would lose that wouldn't you because you still get up early yeah wake up at six o'clock no
