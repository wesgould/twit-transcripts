[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.700]   We'll talk about the impact of Spectre and Meltdown and answer. I think a very fundamental question.
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.700]   Given the performance impact, is it worth fixing, worth patching your Mac and Tasha, your iPhone?
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.700]   Mac break weekly is next.

[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700]   Renee Richie in your new studio.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.700]   No, still not. I'm still in Georgia. This is Georgia's basement.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700]   And I just...
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.700]   Everything is... I have no podcasting set up right now so I just deal for makeshift one.
[00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.700]   Someday it will be true.
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.700]   I'm supposed to move in Friday, but they're still doing renovation, so we'll see fingers crossed.
[00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700]   Excellent.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.700]   Thank you for working so hard to get on the show. I really appreciate it.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.700]   Thank you also to Mr. Chicago SunTimes. That's Andy in that co.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.700]   And we are... The screen is getting elaborate.
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.700]   What's going on behind you? You have...
[00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.700]   Oh, well, that's just... My podcast desk is now opposite to my work desk.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.700]   Ah, we're still fermenting.
[00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.700]   So that is simply a screen saver.
[00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.700]   That's a nice looking screen saver.
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.700]   I think it's from one of the X-screen collection.
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.700]   Oh.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.700]   So I downloaded the Apple TV screen savers and I keep those really cool.
[00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.700]   And then it's nice because I have three screens, so I have a different screen.
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.700]   I get to see more of them because each screen has its own video.
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.700]   I like to see... I love them, but there's like a slightly increasing amount of resentment.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   Every time there's a new screen saver and like, well, how about Boston?
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.700]   How about...
[00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.700]   Okay, great. You got chaggy.
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.700]   You got chaggy.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.700]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700]   Just tell me what it's going to be worth.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.700]   If it were a Google product, it would also have like Expedia ads.
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   Wouldn't you love to go to Malakini Crater?
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.700]   You can, you know.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.700]   Especially also for you.
[00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.700]   Yes, this is also Dubai.
[00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.700]   Yes, Dubai is easy.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.700]   If it's a crazy, crazy building that no sane person...
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.700]   Yeah, I would rather the Lego infrastructure would do than it must be Dubai.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.700]   There are six Dubai's, though.
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.700]   If you say, why do I keep seeing Dubai?
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.700]   It's because there are six of them in the...
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.700]   It looks pretty.
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.700]   Aerial screen saver.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.700]   It is pretty high.
[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.700]   I was pretty sure...
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.700]   The Arctic sunset is my favorite right now.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.700]   I was pretty sure that the Dubai was CGI.
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.700]   This looks, to me, this looked like CGI.
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.700]   I thought, that can't be real.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.700]   Apparently it's some famous photographer with his helicopters and drones.
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.700]   Yeah, I know who it is.
[00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.700]   Yeah, we interviewed him and he wouldn't say, "We wink, wink, nudge, nudge."
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.700]   Yeah, this must be drone.
[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.700]   You wouldn't fly a helicopter like this.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   I just was sure that it was CGI.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700]   I think it's also slow motion.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.700]   Yeah, super slow-mo, yeah.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.700]   So it could be a helicopter.
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.700]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.700]   It could be.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.700]   But you wouldn't fly a helicopter down that corridor, would you?
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.700]   You could.
[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.700]   You could clear it.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.700]   I mean, we've flown helicopters.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.700]   I know you could clear it, but would they allow you to?
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.700]   We've done it now, Lang.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.700]   We've done it now, Lang.
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.700]   It's scared the heck out of me.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.700]   It's really cool.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.700]   It's really cool building.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.700]   It's really cool doing shots through buildings.
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.700]   Oh, that's Alex Lindsey.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.700]   He does it all.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.700]   Sorry.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.700]   For the Pixel Core.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.700]   Hi, Alex.
[00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.700]   I forgot that I hadn't been in it.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.700]   I forgot too.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.700]   You're not alone.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.700]   We both, we both forgot.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.700]   You need no less to talk to Alex.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.700]   Oh, it's such a pleasure when we have you here, though.
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.700]   It's good to be here.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.700]   Arctic sunset.
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.700]   I haven't seen that one yet.
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.700]   Yeah, it's like all these little frozen ice islands with a sun, either setting or rising.
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.700]   They couldn't tell, but it's quite amazing.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.700]   Have they updated those for the 4K Apple TV?
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.700]   Oh, yes.
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.700]   Yes, and HDR.
[00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.700]   Some of them look too real.
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.700]   There's a beach scene where people are walking around the beach and just the colors that
[00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.700]   you see there.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.700]   I keep thinking this just looks not human anymore.
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.700]   Now you got me looking for it.
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.700]   You can download the aerial screensavers.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.700]   Apple doesn't seem to be...
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.700]   I thought they'd block it, for sure.
[00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.700]   These written a little program that'll let you download it and run it as a screensaver
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.700]   on your Mac.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.700]   And I thought with a Mac Pro, Apple shouldn't get mad at me.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.700]   I spent so much money.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:44.700]   If I want to gosh darn it, Apple, if I want to use the aerial screensaver on my iMac Pro,
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.700]   I ought to be able to...
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.700]   The T2 chip will say, "No, no Leo, this is not your screensaver."
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.700]   No, not allowed.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:59.100]   So, Meltdown Spectre, are we fully mitigated?
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.100]   We are increasingly mitigated.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.260]   So the thing to remember with Meltdown Inspector is that there's no way, absent new hardware,
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.260]   there's no way to fix them.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.540]   So all we're doing is mitigating against perceived vulnerabilities, like the way that people
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.380]   might choose to exploit them.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:19.020]   So they've done a series of Meltdown mitigations and they've now done a series of Spectre mitigations.
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.620]   But that's against known threats.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.660]   If new threat surfaced, they might have to mitigate again.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.780]   And there's one good thing to point out.
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.700]   There was this weird story over the weekend about a developer who said he updated to iOS
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.860]   11.2.2 and it crippled his iPhone by like half, which made zero sense to me because
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.660]   Spectre mitigations are all in WebKit and Safari.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.980]   They don't touch the actual operating system.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.980]   Oh, is that true?
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.980]   They don't...
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:43.980]   No.
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.900]   So on other operating systems, Windows, and even Mac OS, their operating system patches.
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:49.900]   But on iOS, their...
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.900]   Meltdown is.
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.980]   Meltdown, Apple's address Meltdown on the operating system level, but Spectre is being addressed
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.740]   because the most...
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.860]   Sorry, the most anticipated attacks against Spectre are all JavaScript and the browser-based
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.860]   attacks.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.100]   So they're putting those defenses into Safari and into WebKit.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.180]   And that's why I was shocked because that shouldn't affect it.
[00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.660]   And then John Poole, who creates Geekbench, very kindly chimed in and said, "The second
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.700]   test was done in low power mode.
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.300]   I don't know why he didn't realize that.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.860]   I certainly don't know why people reported on it without checking first because this makes
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:24.860]   no sense."
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.860]   Okay.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.860]   So there was a rash of stories over the weekend where people were very fearful of the Spectre
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.860]   updates, but don't be.
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.340]   They do not affect the performance of your iPhone at all.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.700]   Well, and another thing that doesn't make sense is now there's a class action lawsuit
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.900]   against Apple over Meltdown and Spectre slowing down iPhones.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.020]   And it's affecting everything, everything slowing down.
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.020]   If you want to sue somebody, I guess Apple makes its own choice.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.300]   There's a lawsuit to prevent them from changing the batteries because they say that'll make
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.940]   it harder to prove the lawsuit.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.300]   So they want other people to stop getting battery replacement.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.940]   Oh, that's nuts.
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:56.940]   Yeah.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.860]   Oh, come on.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.860]   That shows you that this is all about law firms making money, not about what's right for
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.860]   consistency.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.860]   We all get $5, but they get hundreds of millions.
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:07.860]   Right.
[00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:08.860]   Yeah, it's a good deal.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.740]   And by the way, you shouldn't be able to get a $29 battery either because that hides
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.740]   the problem.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.140]   No, it fixes the problem.
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.980]   She's Louise.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.540]   So I mean, this is, I'm going to ask all of you.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.860]   This is kind of a debate that I'm having with myself.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.140]   Do we recommend the, I think you don't have a choice.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.660]   You have to do the Meltdown and Spectre mitigation.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.620]   But given that I believe Meltdown and Spectre is going to be very hard for somebody to exploit
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.300]   and really only going to be useful in a targeted mode.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.900]   It's not the kind of thing you'd mass exploit.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.700]   It doesn't give anybody root access to your system or allow them to do other things to
[00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.700]   your system.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:49.740]   It merely gives them a dump of data cached by the CPU.
[00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:54.380]   In theory, if they knew what they were looking at, they maybe could get a password that would
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.220]   allow them to then do some other exploits and on and on and on.
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:02.660]   But if you did this to a million people and you got all of that data back, I don't know
[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.180]   if you would be able to do, get anything reasonable out of it.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.900]   I think on the other side of it, if I was targeting Alex Lindsey, I could maybe know what
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.900]   to expect.
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.900]   I think for 90%, maybe 95% of the users, that speed change is not going to affect them.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.900]   Well, see, that's the question.
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.940]   So you jumped ahead because that's the question.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.460]   Given that it's going to be hard to exploit and that we know it's going to affect performance,
[00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.860]   should you just not do it, you say, I'm saying, I would say go ahead and do it because I think
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.300]   that you're not going to notice the average Mac user is not going to notice the difference
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.460]   in speed, but you're leaving yourself open to an unknown security flaw.
[00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.700]   Whereas, but I just paid $8,000 for the fastest possible I'm at.
[00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.540]   But you know your work, like it's very workload dependent and you know your workload.
[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:46.140]   And if you're doing something that involves a ton of system calls or a ton of IO.
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.700]   Probably somebody who has an iMac Pro is, right?
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.700]   Right.
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.100]   So I be tempted to say I'm not going to update my iMac Pro, but I'm going to air gap it.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.300]   Should somebody not buy?
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.300]   Should somebody not buy?
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.380]   Oh, you would say not update, but they're gap it.
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:03.380]   Should somebody not buy an iMac Pro and wait for the six months or 10 months for the new
[00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.380]   fix?
[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.740]   The question is, will it be six months or 12 months?
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.740]   And will they be fixed?
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.500]   Like how will they be fixed?
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.340]   The pipeline for these chips is years.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.340]   It's like three years now.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.380]   I don't know if they're going to have it fixed until 2020.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.700]   And what kind of fix will they do?
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.100]   Any fix is going to change speculative execution.
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.900]   Like we've seen Coffee Lake already, right?
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.060]   We've seen a Canon Lake already on the drawing board.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:25.740]   Are they going to go back and totally rearchitect Canon Lake and Coffee Lake?
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.940]   I'm going to ask Steve because Steve is the expert on this.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:34.060]   But I got the sense from Steve that mitigation, if you were designing a new chip, is as simple
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.780]   as saying, no, no, no, user land processes can't look at the cache.
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.860]   And then it can be forehand not after.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:42.860]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.900]   But that means that you're going to give up performance.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.020]   No, you'll give up.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.540]   Is it the reason they're doing it now?
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:49.540]   No, they're not.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:55.060]   No, you will not because you'll still have speculative execution and the process that
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.180]   needs it will see it.
[00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.900]   What we won't have is a leakage across processes.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:00.900]   And that's the problem.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.500]   If you said a bit that says, no, no, you're a user land process.
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.060]   You can't see this cache.
[00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.220]   Yes, you're a kernel process.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.220]   You can see the cache.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.580]   You continue to do speculative execution.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.140]   You continue to have full use of the caches.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.860]   You just-- and I don't think you have much-- I don't think you have much if any of a performance.
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.300]   There's no performance gain by this leak.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.300]   That's just the meaning of--
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.260]   Well, even if they're over a minute would be in hardware, which is much more efficient
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.260]   than software.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.340]   But there's a side effect.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.700]   It's not in any way a performance improvement.
[00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:32.080]   The problem is the mitigations today are hitting performance because they're either
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.020]   turning off speculative execution, which would be a very bad idea.
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.300]   More likely what they're doing is flushing caches as you switch from user land to kernel.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.020]   And doing the page isolation.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.020]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.460]   All the Kaiser stuff.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.460]   So what's that?
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.460]   I don't know that mitigation.
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.460]   What are they--
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.220]   So Kaiser was actually this proposal that they made before any of this happened about
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.140]   better isolating user and kernel data using page isolation.
[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.580]   And people are like, oh, that's nice.
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.820]   That's cute in a theoretical sense.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.820]   Nobody's going to do it.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.820]   Two thumbs up, good on you.
[00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.980]   And then all of a sudden after Google's project zero and then the--
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.700]   I think it was a graph university project.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.700]   They discovered it too.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.300]   Suddenly people were really interested in it.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.300]   And they're like, why?
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.300]   You said this wasn't important.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.660]   Why are you suddenly looking at it?
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:10.660]   You know there's a performance hit.
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:11.660]   And it's going to be hard.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.700]   No, you're super interested in it now.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.700]   We're really curious.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.940]   Why do you want it?
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:17.420]   And Kaiser's became--
[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.340]   Kaiser, I think, is the foundation for a lot of the non-town--
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.020]   It was actually how we learned about it.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.500]   I think it was that in KPTI were the first Linux mitigations that were--
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.860]   being done in public with redacted source companies.
[00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.460]   I think KPTI is based on Kaiser.
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.780]   It's the same sort of--
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.020]   OK.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.460]   But there is a performance hit to that.
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.700]   I wonder if that's the--
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.380]   Depending on workload, again, yeah.
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.460]   It can be-- we saw, again, another--
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.100]   what was it, Stack Overflow was saying that it was not just
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.820]   performance, but for them, at their scale, it was a power--
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.340]   I think it was like 235% more power requirement.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.780]   That makes sense, yeah.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:53.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.180]   I didn't think about that in terms of to make up
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:58.500]   with that performance, you're now spending more electrical budget.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.940]   KPTI is kernel page table isolation.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.460]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.980]   Now, I'm not sure how that's different from the mitigation
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.540]   that Steve and I were talking about,
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.740]   where you just kind of prevent this leakage of information.
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.660]   I think the isolation is what prevents the leakage.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.420]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:22.820]   But maybe it's not an efficient thing to do.
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:25.460]   Modern pre-processors are prefetched data from all mappings
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.460]   run as fast as possible.
[00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.740]   That's the speculative execution.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.180]   What data gets prefetched depends on the CPU implementation.
[00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:36.140]   When running a user space program,
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:39.180]   when a running user space program accesses the kernel mapping,
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.780]   it will take a fault and crash the program.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.500]   The CPU, however, may prefetch kernel data without causing
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.820]   any change to the running program.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.700]   Pre-fetching is not usually a security risk,
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.260]   because there's still permission checks on the addresses,
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.660]   so user space programs cannot access kernel data.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.980]   What Meltdown discovered it was it was possible to measure
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.900]   how long data accesses took on prefetched data
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.180]   to gain information about the system.
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.060]   Wow.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.740]   So they weren't even getting the cache data.
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:08.220]   They were just getting timings.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.300]   And that was the same thing with Spectre in browsers,
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.940]   is that they would sort of push information,
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.180]   and then see how long it would take to get it back.
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.020]   So that's my point, is that writing an exploit is very hard.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.540]   Thinking about what this exploit might be able to do,
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.300]   it seems to me that the stuff you would get would be so--
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.100]   And again, if I was doing high performance gaming
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.980]   or graphics or video, I'd probably
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.860]   would be tempted not to do the upgrade,
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:34.620]   and I'd keep important stuff off of that computer.
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.060]   If I'm saying that it's difficult to write,
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:38.660]   doesn't-- I mean, if I'm doing stuff that
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.140]   isn't going to be impacted by performance,
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.860]   by that level, if I'm using Excel or the web,
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.940]   or the mostly pages or numbers or whatever that is,
[00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.820]   that's not going to be affected by this upgrade,
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:52.420]   I don't think.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.180]   And so then you're just safe.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.500]   You're safer.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.420]   I think that just because it isn't hard,
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.780]   I mean, there's a lot of people in China and Russia,
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.380]   and everything else, but in a lot of time,
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.180]   figuring out how to do hard things.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.500]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.660]   Hard doesn't mean it's not going to get done.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.420]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:07.860]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.940]   Also, remember that you're talking about--
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.820]   these are businesses.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.980]   These are entire industries.
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.740]   They are well-funded because there's
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.300]   a lot of profit in what they're doing.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.100]   I'm talking about breaking into computers
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.140]   and looking for interesting pieces of information.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.620]   I agree with everything that's been said,
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.260]   that for most people, the degradation of performance
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.660]   is not going to be something you're
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.180]   going to really, really sense.
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.140]   If you just spent $9,000 on a new Mac,
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.660]   you're probably not also using that to run fresh books
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.300]   and use one pass, where you're probably using that to do
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.100]   renders and actually make money with.
[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.420]   That's a good excuse to tell your employees that,
[00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.540]   no, you cannot actually put your personal information
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.700]   on this machine.
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.180]   But the other thing that makes this a little bit more
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:51.260]   difficult to think about is that realize that you're
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.980]   best protection isn't even necessarily in applying
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.380]   all these updates, even though you should apply these updates.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.500]   It really is making sure you keep a close eye on all
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.660]   of your accounts, all your financial accounts, all your bits.
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.780]   If we're talking about a problem that these two
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.340]   vulnerabilities are going to create,
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.660]   that's just two more on top of this big wobbly pile
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.460]   of vulnerabilities to our data.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.980]   It just has to do with all these hundreds and hundreds
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.620]   of thousands and millions of pieces of data
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.500]   that are purchasable by anybody who's interested in a huge
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.140]   file of passwords or a huge pile of social security numbers.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.100]   And if someone wants to target you specifically,
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.140]   they're probably going to do it with a telephone,
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.460]   not with an IP.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.300]   And you're more exposed, you're almost definitely more
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.460]   exposed, hooking up to the Wi-Fi at the airport
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.820]   or Starbucks than you are with this.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.460]   I think we're exposed in a hundred thousand ways.
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.260]   Exactly.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.780]   So when you're thinking about this, it's good hygiene.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:47.780]   It's good hygiene.
[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.380]   It's good to always be aware of this sort of stuff
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.580]   and always apply patches.
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.660]   And we should also say, especially the way Apple does patches,
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.060]   they're not always that forthright about what's in those
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:57.500]   patches.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.380]   And I understand why.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.180]   They don't want to give hackers anything to hang on to.
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:04.820]   So you can't really say, well, I'm going to apply this patch
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.540]   and not--
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.540]   I'm going to fix this, but not that.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.420]   You're going to get these patches no matter what in a bundle.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.460]   So it's almost moot to say, well, should I apply these patches?
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.340]   You'd have to--
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.020]   Yeah, there is disclosure in the patches, too,
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.900]   which makes you a bigger-- not you personally,
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.020]   but does make a bigger surface attack area for--
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.100]   I'll contest.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.300]   Berkeley Stephen, who's a very smart fella, pointed out,
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.660]   says-- and I don't know, but I'll take his word for it--
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.620]   Vax, the VMS operating system, solves this whole cache
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.900]   issue 20 years ago.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.460]   Intel even had the patents.
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.860]   They bought the patents.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.380]   But they wanted to optimize speed and didn't choose to.
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.060]   And if you can prove that, that's the smoking gun that's
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.740]   going to get in telling a lot of trouble.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.420]   Because if they did this, as it seems,
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.180]   apparently Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux believes
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:18:00.580]   that really this is just janky, slapdash design on Intel's part
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:04.540]   that was, I guess, then copied by AMD and ARM systems.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.060]   Well, especially if they knew it.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.500]   Like--
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.180]   Well, they did know--
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.780]   There was one thing to me.
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:08.580]   They did know it.
[00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.540]   We talked about this last week on security now.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:14.740]   There was a paper in 1994 that said
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.420]   there's a potential here for memory leakage
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.020]   that you should be aware of.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.780]   There's no question they knew it and they ignored it.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.900]   Maybe they thought as--
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.580]   Who's ever going to do that?
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.340]   It was just too hard.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.220]   No, it would ever do that.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.900]   And what would you get that would be of use?
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.300]   I mean, I have to say these timing attacks
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.940]   seem highly sophisticated, like Roe Hammer.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.580]   And this one, he's so sophisticated.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.500]   I could see people 20 years ago saying, well, yeah,
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.340]   but nobody's going to--
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:40.100]   You don't have to see--
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.700]   Or they thought they covered it in some other way.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.220]   It turned out not to be the case.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.780]   Now, historically, this goes back decades and decades
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.180]   and decades, the source of so many security problems
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.500]   is somebody seeing a problem and thinking, oh, there's no way
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.700]   anyone's going to go to that much trouble.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.340]   They're going to go through that much trouble
[00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.020]   because there's money involved.
[00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.100]   Yeah, well, remember, in 1995, Windows 95 didn't--
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.060]   You could log in with a blank password.
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:10.700]   They didn't-- I mean, nobody thought
[00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.300]   we would get to the world we have today,
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.060]   where you're constantly being hammered on constantly,
[00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.300]   constantly being hammered on.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.100]   Nobody thought that.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.580]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.540]   Is there a way-- so on Windows, there
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:29.180]   are a number of ways to check to see if you're secure.
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.260]   On Linux, even, there is at least one program
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.300]   I was able to find that checks to see if you're secure.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.260]   These programs kind of query the processor directly
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.100]   and so forth.
[00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.180]   Is there a way anybody knows of on a Macintosh
[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.140]   that I know I've run all the updates,
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.940]   but I just want to see is, am I fully patched, fully mitigated?
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:48.820]   Is there any way to do that?
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.780]   I just have to trust that Apple's doing the best it can.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.380]   Not that I've seen.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.220]   Yeah, I haven't seen one--
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:53.860]   It may well be one.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.540]   I looked for one.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.100]   I didn't see one.
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.140]   Nobody knows of one.
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.940]   Chatroom, anybody know of one?
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.940]   So Steve Gibson-Wickerman is going to debut it later.
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.060]   He's written one for Windows.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.700]   I've run the PowerShell script that Microsoft offered up
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.060]   10 days ago.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.740]   And that's actually very useful.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.620]   In fact, I could show you, I guess, the output of this.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.260]   I think I screenshotted it.
[00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.500]   It's very useful because you then see--
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.620]   or at least have the kind of feeling, OK, well,
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.140]   it's been mitigated.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.300]   But maybe I don't have a screenshotted this anymore.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.220]   I sent them off to Steve, but I might have deleted them.
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:36.820]   It's a cool little text, a text-based text,
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.420]   a test that just tells you all green means everything
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:40.980]   is working.
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.100]   And I really feel like we need something like this for Apple.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.740]   Not necessarily for end users.
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.620]   End users, we're just going to tell them what we've been
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.060]   telling them all along.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.020]   Do it.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.140]   What happens if you fail as they go, sorry, you have failed.
[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.100]   There's nothing you could do.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:54.900]   You're a computer right now.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:58.740]   Well, but don't you think you should know that?
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.780]   No, totally.
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.620]   Because then you might air-wap that computer or something.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.300]   I mean, if you've got really secret stuff in there,
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.500]   and maybe you dare-gap it at that point.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.620]   I feel like you'd want to know that stuff.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.340]   There's some kind of--
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:15.860]   I'd like to know that your door's open.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.340]   I wonder, I guess you could run Windows in boot camp
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.900]   and run the Windows testers.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.980]   But that would only tell you firmware.
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.660]   Did we get a firmware update from Apple?
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.220]   I don't remember one.
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:26.980]   No, it's not.
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.940]   OS update, there hasn't anything on there.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:34.220]   OK, because on all my PCs I had firmware updates,
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.580]   presumably patching microcode.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.580]   But Apple may be able to do that without firmware.
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.020]   You see, this is the thing we just don't know.
[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:40.860]   It's ignorance.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:41.980]   We don't know.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.620]   And ignorance is not a good thing when it comes to security.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.500]   I also saw someone saying that the 32-bit versions of macOS
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.620]   weren't vulnerable, but haven't had a chance
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:50.900]   to actually check that yet.
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.060]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:57.620]   Yes, scooter X is saying Apple can shadow update firmware.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.580]   That seems dangerous.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:04.420]   I have had firmware updates on my Macs.
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.180]   And you'll know, because it's reboots, and then there's this--
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.980]   Oh, under no circumstances should you unplug your computer?
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.380]   Yes.
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:15.460]   But more modern Macs, maybe they don't need to do that.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.980]   And I wonder if your T2 Mac is different,
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:18.940]   because of the way it secures all of that.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.620]   Right.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:24.300]   We're living in Terra and Cognito with this.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.340]   We were talking-- I was talking with some people
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.940]   about the recent login bugs.
[00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:31.580]   And it was interesting that all these login bugs surfaced
[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.140]   at the same time that Apple was moving a lot of the login
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.180]   stuff to dedicated chips.
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.180]   Oh.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.380]   And there's so much transition happening.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.980]   Yeah, the newest one is you can change app store preferences.
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.660]   Just click the login, Bing, but a Bing, but a boom.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:50.140]   This is macOS High Sierra.
[00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.300]   You need a login as an administrator,
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:55.380]   but the password doesn't matter.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:57.660]   This is a really dumb thing.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.580]   Almost nobody will actually be--
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.340]   you could be pumped by this if I want damage anybody.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.020]   But it's the third or fourth in a series of login bugs.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.860]   And they feel like they're all related, right?
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.860]   Yeah, I was just wondering if they've
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.300]   been moving so much stuff to dedicated security chips.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.340]   If someone turned on a bunch of test things,
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:17.260]   and they were properly turned off after they--
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.300]   It's probably someone who was working in Hawaii.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.220]   Oh, cuz.
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:23.220]   There's--
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:23.740]   I hate--
[00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.140]   Do you think if people don't know, they got the alert,
[00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.060]   they went to the jungle, and they just haven't come out yet,
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.300]   and they don't know what's safe?
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.580]   Where's the bomb?
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:32.180]   There was supposed to be a bomb.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.860]   Ten years later, they walk out, and they're going,
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:35.500]   oh, the guys were covered quickly.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.140]   Well, what's amazing is it turns out that they did that--
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.780]   they do that every day, I guess, when they switch--
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:40.580]   Oh, really?
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.180]   Are we learning more about what happened?
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:42.700]   Yeah, they said that--
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.380]   So for anybody who doesn't know, on Saturday, 8 a.m.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.060]   in Hawaii time, every phone on the island lit up,
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.460]   I think more than a million phones say--
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.180]   Oh, we agree with them in Hawaii.
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.740]   As you put it on Facebook, she was like, well, this is relaxing.
[00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.820]   You know, like, she was there for vacation.
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:02.340]   It says, incoming ballistic missile, this is not a test, take cover.
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.260]   And then for 38 minutes, nobody knew any better,
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.540]   except, I guess, within 20 minutes, one of the Hawaiian members
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.620]   of the Hawaiian assembly tweeted a Tulsi somebody.
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.500]   But still, I mean, it's like--
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.620]   There was on TVs, too, right?
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.260]   It was on a slow-down--
[00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.780]   It was on TVs, I saw it on TVs.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.620]   So there was an article that said that what happens is that--
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.140]   The shift changes.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.020]   When they do shift changes, every time they do the shift change,
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:25.820]   there's two buttons.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.620]   One is the real one, one is the demo.
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.940]   That's so stupid.
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.500]   And what it does is it sends it out to a certain number of people
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.660]   so that they know it's working.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.380]   So it's like every shift change, they check it.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.300]   And they hit this button.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.820]   And they've been doing this evidently for a very long time.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.420]   And so it just happened to be out of 1,000 times someone
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.860]   wasn't paying--
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.100]   Maybe it was his first day on the job or something like that.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.900]   He's now going to be working in Alaska.
[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:51.380]   He was like, why was it great, but get used to Alaska?
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.940]   And so it just-- but the two buttons are right next to each other.
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.420]   And he just--
[00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.740]   But they're still like, when you hit it, are you sure?
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.300]   But the other one says the same thing.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.860]   So it goes to really, really bad UI.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.220]   So they say it was bad UI design.
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:06.060]   It's worse than that.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.700]   The goal is that they want the system to run so close to being
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:12.660]   parallel so that if something's not working, they actually
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:12.860]   know.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.940]   Because obviously, their bigger concern
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.780]   is not sending it out when it is actually happening.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.060]   You know?
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:19.500]   And so--
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.940]   I think the bigger concern is sending it out when it's not
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:22.700]   happening.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.620]   I think that--
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.100]   I think that if it's happening, you're at a lot.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.580]   I think a lot of people's lives have been changed.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.420]   That's all I can say.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.260]   They got 38 minutes to think about their mortality.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.060]   No, there's a--
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.980]   whatever office in Hawaii is responsible for that actually
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:39.380]   released a screenshot of what the interface is.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:39.820]   Oh, really?
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.460]   And it looks like an HTML 1.2.
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.260]   It's just a list of underscored links.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.660]   And there's one--
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.420]   there's a BMD false alarm, Amber Alert, Kawaii County, Amber
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.140]   Alert statewide.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.860]   And then there's test message.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.060]   And then there's PACOM, state-only, tsunami warning,
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:00.380]   state-only.
[00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.420]   All these are just like individual links that you can just--
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.140]   put the wrong one.
[00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.060]   Instead of clicking one test message,
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.620]   the operator clicked one down.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.060]   And by the way, here's what it says.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:14.180]   PACOM, CDW, state-only.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.060]   That's the one.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:18.740]   That's the one you don't want to click.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.620]   Good Lord.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:22.740]   I can't believe this hasn't happened sooner.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.180]   This is all the result of having like an old style mouse.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.740]   And there's a little bit of grit in the ball.
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.260]   And so--
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.500]   it just skipped down one.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:32.660]   That's all.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.740]   Marjorie, but isn't it?
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:37.220]   But I'll say this in almost complete seriousness.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.020]   Isn't it a relief to know this is just absolutely
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.460]   the result of human stupidity and not some sort of larger
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.900]   operation to make us not trust our--
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:46.900]   This is why it's terrifying.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.540]   --of our care of fun.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:48.540]   --of our care of fun.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:49.340]   Yeah, we don't--
[00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.700]   I mean, we still shouldn't trust these systems
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.420]   because they're stupidly put together.
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.140]   But at least it's not anything more malicious than the thing
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.620]   that was hardwired into our brains at birth.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.420]   I love this New York magazine says,
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:05.420]   no, you are not looking at Craigslist in this photo.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.300]   This is the actual interface that the real government uses
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.860]   to alert its citizens of likely nuclear catastrophe.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.700]   Oh, I see the-- no, no, so not test message.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.900]   So there's one that says drill PACOM, CDW State Only,
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.380]   and one that doesn't have the word drill.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.580]   And that's the difference.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.620]   They should have clicked the one that says drill, not the one
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:25.380]   that doesn't say drill.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.260]   And somewhere else that said that they literally
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.580]   took the drill one at every shift change.
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.740]   Yeah, so it's amazing.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.020]   This hasn't happened before.
[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:32.500]   Right.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.460]   Every day.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.180]   I just don't you remember when the browsers first
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.940]   got like JavaScript and tables, and they're like, oh, wow,
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.500]   we can actually-- instead of having everything being
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.700]   underscored links, I can make something that highlights
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.100]   like a button when you will over it.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.060]   And then I remember how excited I was to change my website.
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.620]   I'm just not sure what the contract--
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.660]   On mouseovers, they--
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.180]   Are you really, really sure?
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:54.340]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.220]   That probably-- that little list that you saw there--
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.780]   probably went through like four or five rounds of revision
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:02.100]   and cost a million dollars to have that little--
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.140]   I'm sure it's a little--
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.340]   Yeah, it's amazing there wasn't panic.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.340]   It just shows you that people in Hawaii are chill.
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:14.740]   Had that happened in New York City, imagine.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.100]   Imagine the riots in the streets.
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.180]   They had interviews.
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.940]   Almost every person they interviewed said there was like 90%
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.900]   of me that just said this is not actually happening.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.500]   And 10% of me that was like, well,
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.860]   and then there was a handful of people
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.380]   that were like calling their family.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.900]   You have kids.
[00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.260]   Your kids are sleeping in the other room.
[00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.700]   You get this. What do you do?
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.380]   Well, why aren't they putting their kids in storm drains
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.780]   just to protect them?
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:35.940]   Yeah, but that's not--
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.060]   I mean, honestly.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.900]   I think it would depend on where I was.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:39.900]   I think it's going to--
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.140]   If you're in Honolulu, you might as well have a nice breakfast.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:44.140]   I know.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.940]   If I was in Honolulu, I wouldn't think about it much.
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.860]   I'd just go, well, maybe we can get to the top of the roof
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.860]   and watch it.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:50.860]   Watch it.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.380]   And watch it for very long.
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.580]   No, but I mean, you might as well--
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:54.820]   you might as well like--
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.060]   I'd rather be on the top of the roof than be only slightly
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.180]   injured in the dietary phase.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.980]   But if I was further out, I'd probably
[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.300]   try to find some--
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:03.260]   On the market, it's--
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.900]   Start the invasion.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.820]   There's new math involved in this equation.
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.340]   You definitely would go to the top of the roof
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:10.580]   because either I'm going to die or I'm
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:14.140]   going to have footage that I can sell on eBay for a hell
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.140]   of a lot of money.
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.380]   Or maybe both, baby.
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.140]   How about this?
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.700]   Kevin Collier of Buzzfeed said there
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.380]   was an AP story on the Hawaii Emergency Management
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.940]   Office's last year that had passwords visible on Post-it
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.140]   notes.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.140]   Oh, God.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.660]   And they've now redacted it since.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:35.020]   That's right up there with the TSA guy that showed--
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.860]   let him take a picture of all the keys.
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:39.500]   You see that?
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:40.940]   They did an interview with the TSA guys
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.860]   and the guy showed them all the keys for the TSA locks.
[00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.980]   And of course, they're really--
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.340]   Yeah, they took a picture.
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.140]   As soon as someone saw the picture,
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.140]   they were made of counterfeits.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.940]   They were widely available on eBay.
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.900]   So they've changed the screen, by the way.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:53.900]   You know how they've changed it?
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.500]   They added one more entry that says false alarm.
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.860]   Because note, there's no false alarm button.
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.460]   That's why it took up 38 minutes.
[00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.140]   There's no way to say that was wrong.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:03.700]   So easy was that?
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.780]   That didn't have to go through a lot of approvals
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.300]   or anything else.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.380]   They were able to-- because it was just a list,
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.340]   they were able to just add another HTML button.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.300]   But that means they're anticipating more false alarm.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.500]   Look, in a country where people are dying from eating
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.820]   tied detergent pods, I have no high hopes at all.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.820]   It's nature's way, Leo.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.740]   It's nature's way.
[00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.260]   Darwin is--
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.860]   I wonder what the false alarm says.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.820]   Just like, you're about to be hit by a new--
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:26.580]   this is not a drill.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.460]   And then two minutes later go, my bad.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.660]   My bad.
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.420]   Brian Quibbs tweeted this emergency alert from Tokyo.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.140]   A giant lizard is attacking Tokyo.
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.060]   This is not a drill.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:39.260]   I think that would be-- they need a button for that.
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.260]   That would be good.
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:48.140]   So--
[00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:52.780]   For some reason, there's a horrible practical joke
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:53.620]   that would be--
[00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:55.100]   you've got big loudspeakers and you're
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:56.580]   able to get that thing out on Tokyo,
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:02.300]   then have the big Godzilla speakers going through Tokyo.
[00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.020]   I would be more afraid of that than the nuke.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:09.660]   I would like to think that I would be--
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.580]   I would have enough integrity to admit
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.620]   that I had made that mistake and recall it.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.780]   I have to say, though, that I'm also
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:18.660]   enough of a weasel to think that, look,
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.180]   if this system is designed so badly that you can just
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.940]   miss hit a key and put this--
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.980]   what are the chances they're going to figure out that I didn't?
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.300]   Almost another--
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.580]   100% of Nako.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:36.780]   I'm so glad even if my iMac Pro is now only 30% of as fast
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.380]   as it used to be, I still am glad I bought it.
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.980]   Oh, Leo, it's not that slow.
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:42.140]   It's not.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:42.500]   You know what?
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.980]   I'm not taxing it in any way.
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.340]   Is it fast?
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.700]   I don't know.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.060]   I actually honestly don't--
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.060]   Oh, I forgot to send you those files.
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:49.540]   Those files.
[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.300]   You know, still not fast.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:51.700]   I asked you and you never sent me.
[00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:53.300]   But send them to me.
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:59.420]   I did get a motion template that Anthony did--
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.420]   he does a motion open for some of the shows
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.460]   for the like, Tech News Weekly.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:07.220]   And it's pretty big 4K render.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.980]   He doesn't even turn on motion blur
[00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.420]   because it takes all night on his MacBook Pro as it is.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.980]   And so he said, would you just try it with motion blur?
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.660]   One hour.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.500]   OK, that's good.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.020]   That's good.
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.300]   I need one.
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.100]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.260]   So you have some of those pictures.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:22.900]   So I don't--
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.980]   You have some transcoding, Leo.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.220]   Is that what would be-- what would tax the dang thing?
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.980]   I can't get the CPUs to peg no matter what I do.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:31.740]   Try-- I don't know.
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.300]   I'll try some transcoding, because I should at least
[00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.060]   show you all the processors getting hit.
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:39.260]   Yeah, I installed I-Step menu just so I can watch it.
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:39.660]   But nothing--
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.260]   Or get where it says, thank you.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.220]   Nothing ever happens.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.340]   It's very-- except weird.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.700]   The other day, it said you've run out of RAM.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.540]   I have to shut down.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.220]   What?
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.420]   Well, that's obviously a program with a bug.
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.100]   And I think it's Android file transfer,
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:58.500]   because I had just installed that.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.300]   And it was running.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.380]   And I think something had a massive memory,
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.140]   because to use 64 gigs of memory--
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:10.140]   I have never gotten past 10% of my 64 gigs of memory.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.860]   So I think-- I think, honestly, there was a runaway--
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.220]   there had to be a runaway process.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.740]   It hasn't resurfaced, and I immediately
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.620]   uninstalled Android files.
[00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.860]   Set up a bunch of virtual machines
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.940]   and run Tomb Raider and all of them.
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:22.820]   I'm going to have to do something like that.
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.780]   I have to keep playing games of tic-tac-toe
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.900]   and understands that nuclear war is futile.
[00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:30.740]   Shall we play a game?
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.420]   On the other hand, it is darn hard
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.340]   to find an external drive that comes close to the speed
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:36.820]   of the internal.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.340]   I don't think it ever will.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.740]   3 and 1/2 gigabits a second.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.740]   That's crazy.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.620]   You get a bite a second on the reads.
[00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.740]   Actually, it's right.
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.340]   OK, answer me this.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:51.700]   Why is write so much faster than read on these internal assets?
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.460]   I don't understand that.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.100]   That makes no sense.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.140]   What was a brand new machine?
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.660]   It was probably just writing sequentially.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.380]   And I don't know why it wouldn't read sequentially then,
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.220]   too.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:33:59.740]   Mm.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:01.260]   Mm.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.020]   That is interesting.
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.860]   Yeah, because I ran it again on an external drive,
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.620]   and as one expects, writes are slower than reads.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.940]   Because of course, writes are going to be slower than reads.
[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.580]   And I ran it on my old 5K.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:13.980]   Same thing.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:17.900]   By the way, the old 5K is like a tenth of the--
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.580]   this drive, this internal drive.
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.980]   So maybe I'd have to qualify--
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:25.220]   your original device was-- look at the smallest internal drive
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.700]   and get it used as Thunderbolt 3 external drive.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.700]   But the only external drives I've seen that--
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.820]   they don't even come close.
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.180]   There's one that gives you a gig.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.260]   I've never seen-- I've just had never seen those numbers.
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:37.180]   No.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:41.540]   There's a-- the G-Shock guys have a new array,
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.500]   but it's spinning drives.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.180]   Not G-Shock.
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.060]   What is the name of that?
[00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:45.700]   Those G--
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.700]   G-Check?
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:47.700]   G--
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:47.700]   G--
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:48.700]   G--
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:48.700]   G-Tech.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:49.620]   That's it.
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:55.420]   They have a new drive, G-Technology.com array that's
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.300]   Thunderbolt 3.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.780]   But it's like $2,000.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.620]   The Shuttle X-Time.
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.740]   I think you still want to treat the internal drive
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.700]   as another level of cash.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.420]   It's just so expensive to scale that up.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.820]   It really is.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.100]   And it terabytes a lot.
[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.860]   But if you are looking for maximum performance,
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.500]   even something like the Shuttle XL, which is super fast,
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:18.140]   is only getting up to 1.3 gigabytes a second.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.900]   It's not even half the speed of the internal drive.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.060]   But you get so much data, Leo.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:24.700]   Look at that.
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.540]   How much is in there?
[00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.340]   Does it tell you?
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.300]   They have different ones.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:27.780]   There's a--
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.220]   That's got to be--
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.540]   They're really expensive.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.420]   It's hardware-rayed.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.500]   They're really expensive.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.220]   I bought a--
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.900]   So none of my Thunderbolt 3 enclosures,
[00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.460]   they're all Windows-specific.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.780]   Apple prevents you from using them.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.020]   I think I mentioned this last week.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:46.820]   I had an Akideo.
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.860]   And Akideo says, you have to buy a new one
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:49.860]   if you want to use it with a Mac.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:51.620]   We can't patch the firmware or anything.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:53.860]   Although, as I mentioned, there's a kernel hack that will.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.780]   But I don't want to do that.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.220]   So Alex is already ordering--
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.780]   I'm not ordering an ex-lucant.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.300]   I'm just looking.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   I'm just looking.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.820]   It's going to be as big of the week.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.380]   So for an 8-bay, it's 2,000--
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.020]   And this is populated, though.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.060]   It's $2,199.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.660]   But if you spent $8,000 on that computer--
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:13.660]   That's nothing.
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:14.580]   That's all the two grand.
[00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.020]   That's it.
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.020]   What's in?
[00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.380]   What's in?
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:15.860]   It's money.
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.380]   What's in?
[00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.300]   It's opportunity.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.340]   I didn't even realize they made 10 terabyte drives.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.980]   I haven't-- I've been out of the--
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.820]   So for $7,500, I immediately go to like--
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.740]   How big can they make this?
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.540]   --how big can they make this?
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.540]   That's Thunderbolt 2.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.340]   You don't want that one.
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:32.100]   You need the Thunderbolt 3.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.220]   This is the new one.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.220]   I want the new one.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.300]   This isn't the new one.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.620]   They just announced a new one.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.740]   96 terabytes.
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.860]   Pretend grand.
[00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:42.700]   96 terabytes.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:43.140]   Oh, here it is.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.380]   Here's the press room.
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.940]   It's the new ultra-transportable 4-bay G-speed
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.860]   shuttle with Thunderbolt 3.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.860]   And yeah, you'd have to-- yeah, 16 terabytes, 17.99.
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.620]   24 terabytes, 22.99.
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.260]   32 terabytes, 27.99.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.180]   48 terabytes, 37.99.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.060]   But for $9,999, you can get--
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:04.820]   But that's Thunderbolt 2.
[00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.060]   That's your knock on the Thunderbolt 3.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:06.700]   Is it?
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.500]   Thunderbolt 3.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.020]   Oh, it does.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:09.460]   Yeah.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.700]   12 terabyte drives.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.940]   Anyway, I don't need all that storage.
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.140]   Ah, the terabytes.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:17.940]   But I think you should-- if you're
[00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:22.020]   going to buy an iMac Pro, consider how much stuff you want
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.460]   local, because that's where you're going to get the best.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.980]   Could you like a fusion drive?
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.580]   So yeah, Alex, what would--
[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.140]   You want three of them.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.540]   Whatever it is, because you want three of them.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.860]   What you want is you want one that's sinking to the other one,
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.540]   and then one that you take off site.
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.100]   So like once a week you swap the backup--
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:37.300]   Yeah, but seeing the internal drives.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.300]   But the internal drives.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.060]   Oh, I make three iMac Pros.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:40.500]   Macs won't turn.
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   Yes, you will.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.500]   Look at them.
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.500]   You can back up--
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:44.300]   You can back up--
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.300]   I'm in the backup drives.
[00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.820]   At night, you can back up.
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:47.820]   Yeah, no, I think--
[00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:48.940]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:49.940]   but the other one.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:50.440]   Really?
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:50.940]   And then you swap it.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.180]   Yeah, I would never put more than one terabyte
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:54.460]   into my internal computer, because I don't
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.460]   even want to think about doing it.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.700]   Knowing it's so much faster internal, wouldn't you want to put the project you're working
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:00.700]   on today?
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.180]   How big are the assets today?
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.380]   It's a dangerous way to think.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:08.380]   It's a dangerous way to think to have your computer saving stuff internally.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.060]   Your big file should always be going somewhere else.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.900]   Get something fast out there.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.780]   Maybe if you're going to do a compression or you're going to do something else, you
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.820]   can render it to it and then move it.
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.140]   But you shouldn't think about keeping stuff on that internal drive.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.140]   So I don't feel so bad.
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.820]   In my opinion, I wouldn't want--
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.300]   maybe I'd get two terabytes if it was really cheap.
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.980]   But from a mindset, I always want to have-- my programs are on there and I have some
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:34.740]   slush there, but I don't want to constantly moving that stuff to another drive that's
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.180]   external, because it's just not a good way to live.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.180]   It's just not a good way to live.
[00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.380]   John, could you bring me the package that just came?
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.380]   So--
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:42.380]   Is it a drive?
[00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.380]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.380]   Well, yeah.
[00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.100]   So I wasn't using a Drobo mini.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.740]   By the way, a little tip.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.860]   I love these Drobo minis.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.460]   You can have four 2 1/2 inch drives, but I didn't know that there's different heights
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.460]   of 2 1/2 inch drives.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:39:00.260]   If you get the four terabytes, they're really thick and they don't fit.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.380]   They're 15 millimeters and it needs to be 9 millimeters.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.940]   So I have two 4 terabyte spinning, not SSDs.
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.180]   I'm not made of money.
[00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:15.060]   Spinning drives-- so I have eight terabytes of spinning drives.
[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:20.260]   So I thought, well, if I could just get an enclosure that holds 2 1/2 inch drives with
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.500]   Thunderbolt 3, maybe I'll put them in scary rate.
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:24.500]   Right?
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.500]   Rate zero, right?
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.500]   So that maximizes its interleaved writing.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:28.500]   Right.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.300]   Anyway, I'll let you know because I just got--
[00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:34.100]   I cried lots of enclosures and I have not been successful.
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.100]   No.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.100]   Getting real speed now.
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.100]   So John's bringing me the one that just came.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.100]   I finally gave up.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:41.540]   I bought like, I don't know, four or five enclosures trying to test them and I just never got
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.780]   to a thing where I was happy with the speed.
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   So I don't--
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:49.220]   This is some off brand, but I was searching like crazy to find something.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.860]   So if this is going to do it or not.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:55.220]   Two years ago, I went through like a tirade of trying to find one.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:58.500]   I was like, I want to have something like I put my backpack that's big and fast.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.060]   Well, this whole world where Alex Lindsey wants to work.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.060]   But this is scary, right?
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.460]   So you want to be having-- you want to be time machining or whatever are sinking this
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.460]   all the time.
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:09.260]   No, no, you want three iMac pros, Lee.
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:12.380]   A one tobacco guy and a third one that you switch.
[00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.380]   This is every--
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.660]   And we have a title, three iMac pros.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.140]   This is the mini-- see, I know this is going to be a crappy thing.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:22.300]   Look at the name of it, the mini pro raid v3.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.900]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.660]   It's not even Thunderbolt 3.
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.340]   It's 10 gigabit C-type 3.1.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.340]   That's right.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:33.340]   I remember now.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.300]   I couldn't find a good Thunderbolt 3 that was less than $2,000.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   $1,000.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.780]   But this will be fast enough, right?
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:39.780]   This will be all right.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.780]   And see, I'll put the two--
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.780]   I'll tell you, Leo.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.260]   I could use a J-bod raid with zero or a one.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.060]   I'll use probably raid zero, but just not trust it, right?
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.060]   But I'll do it.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.060]   If you're going to use it for work, yeah.
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.220]   It's my way-- because I have the-- when I'll back up anything I want to save the
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.180]   Drobo mini kind of always-- that's kind of nice.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.180]   Two drives.
[00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.180]   It's made of metal.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.180]   That's always a good sign.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.180]   It's always a good sign.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.180]   It's not plastic.
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.180]   It's transuranic.
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.180]   It's fine.
[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.260]   Well, I'll take it apart to get it open.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.420]   So it's not Thunderbolt 3.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:08.420]   That's right.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.140]   I couldn't find anything reasonably Thunderbolt 3.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.260]   And how confusing is if they have the same connector and you just hold that and check
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.260]   that every time.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.260]   It's type C.
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.260]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.260]   And I just don't know.
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:19.580]   But you do want type C. Don't you?
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:24.380]   Isn't type C USB-- is type C USB 3.1 faster than type A?
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.380]   No.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.380]   No.
[00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:27.380]   No.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.380]   The USB spec is confusingly named because it's-- yeah, you've got--
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:30.380]   It's 10 gigabits.
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:33.300]   Type C and type A plugs and then type 3.1.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.300]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.300]   Anyway.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.300]   So what do you think?
[00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:37.300]   I like it.
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.300]   I like it.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.300]   I like it.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:40.300]   The consumer.
[00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:41.300]   Yeah, I mean, it feels solid.
[00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.300]   I have tested, but you know--
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.100]   Well, next week I'll have a-- I'll run Blackmagic's disc speed test on it and all
[00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.100]   that.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.100]   It looks promising.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:50.100]   USB 3.
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:53.820]   I mean, if I get 10-- I won't get 10 gigabits, but if I did, that would be like a gigabyte
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:54.820]   a second, right?
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.460]   I think I have 10 gigabit NASL.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.460]   You'll just slap that on the back.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.660]   You fast.
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.260]   Do they make 10 gigabit NASS?
[00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:04.260]   I guess they do.
[00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:05.260]   I don't know.
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.260]   But now I want one.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.260]   I want one.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.340]   So I'm not worried about my backups because I have a Synology.
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.540]   I have Cloud Backup.
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.540]   I have my Synology.
[00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.100]   I have Mini.
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:16.900]   I have a Time Machine running on a big 4-terabyte drive.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.300]   I have copies of my copies.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.700]   I'm not worried about backups.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:24.380]   I wanted to fast external work drive.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:28.460]   That'll be 8 terabytes of relatively fast.
[00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:31.380]   What I like about this is taking something-- this is something I can actually put in my
[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.380]   bag.
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:33.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.500]   And then you can-- if you're on the road, this is like you're great.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.980]   Like I'm going to edit something real quickly.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.420]   And you have to have a lot of storage.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.660]   I can throw it on and then take the finals and throw them on to something else.
[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:42.660]   And if you want--
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.660]   Great zero on the road.
[00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:45.100]   Why is Thunderbolt 3 so expensive?
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.500]   Is it because it's new?
[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:51.260]   It's not always like Thunderbolt 2 is outrageously expensive when those drives first started
[00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.260]   coming out.
[00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:55.340]   It's probably because it's the high-end providers doing the premium products first to milk people
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.740]   like us out of the money possible before they make the mainstream.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:42:59.740]   Right.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.380]   But they've been around now for a while.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.660]   It's as mainstream as it's going to get.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:08.900]   But also because of the first bill to buy these things and the people who really need
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.900]   that kind of performance.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.220]   So they're generally built to a higher standard.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:17.380]   I have a whole bunch of Thunderbolt drives that are now-- they're just boxes that I put
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:19.660]   whatever drive I need to carry with me in.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:26.300]   So I don't necessarily need the mil spec dust and moisture repellent features to them.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   So--
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.300]   You know, I do like about this.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:33.420]   If you're using the Thunderbolt type C port, it's got enough power on it.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:36.940]   It goes on at Watts that you can have it be bus powered even with two drives in it.
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:37.940]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.940]   I love that, right?
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.580]   Whoa, it's $439.
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.580]   It's populated.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:43.580]   Oh, OK.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.820]   It was-- I think it was 200, I think.
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.820]   That's populated.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.820]   OK.
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.820]   So-- and I had-- as I said, I had purchased drives that don't fit in anything.
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:54.540]   All right, let's take a break and we will be back.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.380]   I'm sure there's some other stuff to talk about.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.820]   Is there a new Mac mini?
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:59.820]   Anybody?
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.820]   No?
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:01.820]   Not today.
[00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:02.820]   Not today.
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.820]   Let's check in tomorrow.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:04.820]   Check in tomorrow, new Mac mini.
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.260]   Mac Prawl, what do you think, Chuck?
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.260]   There is a new iMac.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:09.260]   That's all we know.
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.220]   There's been no January event either.
[00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.220]   New laptops, no January event.
[00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:14.980]   No Mac world.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:15.980]   Si.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.980]   Isn't that sad?
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:17.980]   I know.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.300]   You used to have to decide between CES and Mac world now.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.300]   2007--
[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:23.300]   Just go to see it.
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:28.020]   2007, iPhone 2008, MacBook Air, 2007, 2018, nothing.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.300]   We will talk when we come back about CES.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.300]   Nobody went--
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.300]   I know.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:33.300]   I went.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   You went?
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.300]   I went to all the price events.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:37.140]   You look way too healthy to have been there, Alex.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.100]   I have gotten old.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.580]   I was home every night.
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:41.820]   I barely drank anything.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.820]   I was eating salads.
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.820]   I was like, man, I'm really--
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.820]   You have to take care of yourself.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.820]   You have to pace yourself.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.820]   You know, I've been tired doing that.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.820]   I was doing that.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.460]   People would say, hey, we're all going out for a drink.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.460]   I say, I'll see you.
[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:52.460]   I'm going to bed.
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.460]   It's 8 o'clock.
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:55.060]   The father Robert Ballinger was there.
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.060]   He got sick.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.060]   Scott Wilkerson was there.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.060]   He got sick.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.060]   I saw the Robert Everywhere.
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.060]   I saw the Robert Everywhere.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.060]   He was running a long throat.
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:02.060]   I was running a long throat.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:03.060]   All got sick.
[00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.060]   But did he Bartolo went-- you got sick?
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.060]   Did not get sick.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.060]   I found out.
[00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:08.660]   That's because he was patient zero.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:09.660]   He brought the sickness.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.660]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:12.140]   He's like Chuck Norris.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:18.180]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:23.700]   Now if you're about to buy a home or-- and I think this is a good time to refi-- because
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:28.100]   I think interest rates are about as low as they're going to go because they're going
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.340]   up, right?
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.340]   The feds aren't announced.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:32.740]   They're going to have three raises this year.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.380]   And that usually means the home loan interest rates will go up.
[00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:37.860]   So now would be a good time to lock in at low, right?
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.900]   The best place to go, not your bank, Quick and Loans.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.580]   The most-- not only the-- I think one of the-- certainly one of the best lenders, according
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:51.900]   to JD Power, the best lender in the country, customer satisfaction, number one for years
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:55.980]   and years, but also because I think they're very technologically savvy.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.380]   Dan Gilbert, who created Quick and Loans many moons ago, it was at the time I think it was
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:05.940]   rock capital and then he sold it to Quick and in 1999, three years later he said, screw
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:08.940]   this, bought it back, but kept the name.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:15.260]   So I think that's why Rocket Mortgage-- I think that comes from their old name, Rocket Mortgage.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.100]   This is their new product designed for geeks for us.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:23.860]   It lets you do everything you do to get a home loan or to refinance on your phone in
[00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.860]   minutes.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:28.220]   No visit to the bank, no visit to the basement or the attic to get paperwork.
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:30.420]   You do everything you need right on the phone.
[00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.940]   They start by first create account, go right now to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak and create
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:37.180]   an account.
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:40.740]   Then when it's time to apply, you're at an open house, you say, "Ooh, I like this.
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:42.300]   Let's buy it, honey."
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.700]   You can apply very simply, just a few basic questions.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:49.980]   You don't have to get any paperwork because they have trusted relationships with all the
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.620]   financial institutions, they'll just go out and get it.
[00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:58.340]   When they crunch the numbers based on income assets and credit, they will off-- and you
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:59.780]   will know every step what's going on.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:02.620]   You really will understand fully what the process is.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.620]   They will say, "You're qualified for this.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:05.620]   What down payment you're looking for?
[00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:06.620]   What term?
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:08.780]   What rate?"
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:14.340]   Then you pick it and mortgage with confidence because you got the loan you want.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:20.860]   Personalized results, and it's all in minutes without any paperwork.
[00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:23.660]   To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:31.820]   Apply simply, understand fully, mortgage confidently with rocketmortgage@rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:36.820]   Equal housing, lender license, and all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30.
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:37.820]   30.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.940]   It's so easy, so fast.
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:43.500]   It's really a revolution in the mortgage process.
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.500]   Look how fast that was.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.420]   Boom, rocketmortgage.com/macbreak.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:52.900]   So Apple's not at CES, and interestingly, Apple didn't really get any mindshare as they
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:53.900]   often do at CES.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:54.900]   I remember 2007.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.740]   I saw a lot of people with Apple shirts on.
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.740]   Did you?
[00:47:58.740 --> 00:47:59.740]   There were a lot of Appleers.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:00.740]   A lot of people wandering around.
[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:01.740]   A lot of buyers.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.740]   I mean, Apple-- I think Apple's always there.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:06.540]   What are they looking for?
[00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.100]   Apple retail goes there to buy products for the Apple stores.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:10.340]   They want to see what's coming out.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.820]   Then Apple marketing is typically there, and then a bunch of other people are there
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.820]   for meetings.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.260]   Rumors was they were looking at a lot of ARBR kind of stuff.
[00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:19.260]   Yes.
[00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.260]   There was a rumor that they--
[00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.460]   I didn't talk to anyone there, but I am.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.220]   Well, the home kid stuff is there.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.460]   The health kid stuff is there.
[00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:31.860]   They were also talking to augmented reality component makers.
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:36.580]   So now, remember, Apple does not make AR headset, but this kind of lent credence.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:39.300]   This is from Mark Gurman.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:48.220]   He knows this lends credence to that notion that Apple might be doing some AR headsets.
[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.980]   Let's see.
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:52.860]   I don't even think we saw a lot of AR.
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:53.860]   Did you see a lot of AR?
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.100]   There is still VR, isn't it?
[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.980]   It was a standalone Google cardboard, wasn't there?
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:48:59.980]   Daydream.
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.860]   Yes, they have a daydream.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.820]   They have a daydream.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:04.820]   This is it, actually.
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:10.340]   The Lenovo Mirage Solo VR headset with Google Daydream and Mirage camera.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:12.260]   I know, I shouldn't.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.260]   I shouldn't.
[00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:17.140]   And a new VR Pro from HTC Vive Pro or something?
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:19.220]   The Vive was updated.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:24.500]   I will say that I played with the Vive that with the wireless transmission, and it's pretty
[00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:25.500]   awesome.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:26.500]   It's nice not to have wires.
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:31.060]   I mean, it was like, and that's going to give you a lot more of six degrees of, you
[00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:34.260]   know, you're going to move around a lot more and so on and so forth.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.140]   So that's going to be something that I think is going to be interesting as we move forward
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.860]   is getting away from you up to stand in one place.
[00:49:40.860 --> 00:49:44.020]   And you can kind of, and we can do that in our office, but that's because we have a motion
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.020]   capture system.
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.700]   They're in wander around in a 20 by 20 space and it's much more interesting.
[00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.820]   So a lot of the stuff that we're looking at right now is still very early on.
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.940]   I think we are going to see a lot of movement in VR.
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:50:01.060]   Google is experimenting with 180, which is where they had the cameras.
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:07.100]   But Apple, I mean, most of the AR stuff I have to admit I've seen is kind of, I'm not
[00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:08.100]   that excited about yet.
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.940]   Did you see the iPhone mocap?
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.020]   Alex, where the guy had the iPhone dangling in front of him and was wearing a cheap motion
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.260]   capture suit and he was doing AR kit facial recognition.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.100]   And the little dude, and the little dude moving.
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.460]   Yeah, it's cool.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.820]   Like I'm always like, when they show the video, I'm like, yeah, that was the perfect moment
[00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:26.500]   that he did it that he shows.
[00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:28.900]   You know, like with any of those tests, I get to play with it.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:33.580]   I'm always like, okay, yeah, I show the just right stuff.
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:34.580]   Not where your feet are.
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.100]   You're doing that on a phone now.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.300]   I mean, I remember for Andy Serkis how much technology it took to do Gollum and now we're
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.300]   doing it on a phone.
[00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:41.300]   Well, it's not the same.
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:46.620]   You're doing the face capture stuff, but you're not doing the rest of stuff.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:51.700]   I mean, I didn't see a whole lot of AR stuff at CES that I thought moved the needle forward.
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:58.460]   I saw some new stuff with VR that moved the needle forward only in the sense of making
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:03.100]   the hardware more practical and more functional, but still doesn't solve the problem of how
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:09.140]   do you get people to actually use a VR VR headset for anything other than you want to
[00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:13.980]   leave your current reality and play a game or leave your current reality and do some
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.860]   education or training.
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.860]   So that didn't really change anything.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.180]   And getting back to Apple, I was surprised.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.980]   You didn't hear very much about home kit.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.180]   You didn't feel hear anything about car play.
[00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:25.660]   You didn't hear about really.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:26.660]   It's the whole kid.
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:27.660]   It's the toilet, Andy.
[00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.740]   I mean, how much more do we want?
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:32.020]   And the faucets and the shower, yes.
[00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.860]   But but that's but that's okay.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:38.420]   We're getting more counting though their echo their Amazon partnerships than their Apple
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:39.420]   partnerships were.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.860]   I mean, it felt like works with Alexa.
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:46.780]   Yeah, Amazon really was the and to second Google assistant where the big winners.
[00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:50.180]   I felt like Google assistant was probably I saw Google assistant a lot more on the floor
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:51.180]   than I saw echo.
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:55.820]   They wrapped the model rail that you know, they went puts those weird people with the
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:59.220]   white jumpsuits and there's a big there's a race going on.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:00.220]   You go Andy.
[00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:06.100]   No, I didn't, but I was I was having my usual like three screen experience of frankly, I
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:08.820]   think a better picture of CES not going.
[00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:13.540]   Yeah, I mean, my CES usually happens in about a couple of weeks when all the people that
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.460]   I talked to and responded to a week before CES say that I'm not going, but hey, let's
[00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:19.620]   talk later in the month after you.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:20.620]   Andy was there.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.620]   Come with a quick.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:22.620]   So he's helping me.
[00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:26.220]   So the whole kid is challenging and I the people I've talked to make IOT devices say,
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.780]   you know, yeah, we want it because Apple's a big market, but it's hard.
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:32.540]   Well, there's a couple of things like they're making the chips are going to be virtualized
[00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:33.540]   soon.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.340]   So you won't have to actually buy the physical chips to get the encryption.
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:37.020]   Yeah, you'll do it in software.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:40.180]   But the I was talking to someone who's in the industry and there's still a lot of things
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.700]   that any of these products don't do like they're very good at like, for example, if you say
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:48.580]   get me a Coke, they're very good at understanding that you're saying Coke, but they're not getting
[00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:52.020]   better understanding that you want to Coke rather than a Pepsi, like they're understanding
[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:55.100]   what you're saying, but not not understanding you any better.
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.860]   And also there's things like if you you can say turn on my shower, but doesn't learn that
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:01.980]   after you wake up and check Twitter, you always want to take a shower.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:04.180]   So it's hard preparing it's where you act.
[00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.540]   And there's still not hardwired yet.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:08.020]   Like it's all Wi-Fi and a lot of systems want hard links.
[00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:11.580]   And there's just a lot of steps that we're like, we're the very, very nascent beginning
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.580]   of this technology.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:16.980]   And you so you start we were having a conversation with one of the manufacturers and you start
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:21.140]   realizing and they didn't confirm or deny any of this, but they, you know, is, but this
[00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:27.420]   is where you can see it kind of going is imagine having an iPhone that has a has your recipe
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:32.260]   and it says, okay, you're going to go start cutting the chicken, put the pan on the stove
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:36.060]   and then the pan as soon as you put the pan on the stove, the app tells the stove to turn
[00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:41.180]   on and it heats the pan and the pan tells the stove how what temperature it's at.
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.980]   So it keeps on heating the pan until the pan reaches the temperature and then it's constantly
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:47.540]   making sure the pan stays at that temperature at the same time.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:50.540]   It tells you to go now put your chicken in and you put your chicken in.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:53.540]   And so there's like it's and it then just keeps on doing what it needs to do with the
[00:53:53.540 --> 00:53:56.500]   pan and the pan's talking to the stove and the phone's talking to both of them.
[00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:00.540]   And I mean, that's like that is probably two or three years away.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.500]   I mean, and so we're still looking at this stuff.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.020]   So even some of the stuff like.
[00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:05.820]   It's around the lights.
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:06.660]   You're in the.
[00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:07.820]   Sorry.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:12.700]   I'm just saying that you have to accept that you're solving problems that are great for
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:18.260]   nerds, but ordinary people, they've got no problem creating creating bad fried eggs the
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.900]   first two or three times.
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.060]   And then after the third, the third time you've created bad fried eggs, you understand how
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:27.300]   to make fried eggs and you don't need computers to remind you, take the pan off the stove
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:28.900]   now, like make sure you add the butter now.
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:30.220]   Oh, no, no, that's too much butter.
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:36.260]   But I think it's so, but I think it's more of a blue apron on steroids, you know, where
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:40.580]   it's, you know, it's really sort of like you have these things that are being sent to you.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:45.900]   And I can imagine the market is really an Amazon market in a lot of ways where, you
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:49.500]   know, on my, you know, I'm going to get to watch a little thing on how to do it on my
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.980]   on my show on my Echo Show or whatever.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:54.220]   And then it's going to show up from Whole Foods.
[00:54:54.220 --> 00:54:57.740]   And then it's going to turn, you know, talk to everything to do what I wanted to do.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:58.980]   And people will be more adventurous.
[00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.140]   Yeah, sure that fried eggs is probably a rough one.
[00:55:01.140 --> 00:55:04.980]   But if you want to make chicken cord on blue or and you've never made it before and you
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:08.540]   want it to actually turn out because you've got to, you know, a date card over or something,
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:13.460]   you know, like it, you know, and there's also like just basic stuff like turn on the light
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:15.100]   and you have to say turn on the kitchen light.
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:18.340]   Even if you're in the kitchen, it doesn't know that you're watching your phone, whatever.
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:21.140]   There's motion sensor in the kitchen and that that's the light that you mean.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:24.740]   You've got to be specific every time the context part is still super laggy.
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.300]   The prediction part doesn't really exist yet.
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:31.180]   Be able to talk and not be super specific about what you want and what order and then
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:36.060]   break it apart into my new chunks is still very like again, we're at super beginning
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.900]   of these being not very good assistants.
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.820]   They're good at taking orders, but they're not for a good assistance yet.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.820]   Well, that's where I like the Google Assistant.
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:48.780]   I was I was walking home, blocking home just last week from someplace wanted to.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:52.860]   I need to take the commuter rail home, asked how long I'm trying to figure out if I should
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:56.620]   walk it or I should just, you know, get a new or whatever and just ask the assistant
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:01.900]   how far is it from here to the train station and says, well, by MBTA, it's 6.2 miles and
[00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:04.020]   showed me where to pick up the green line.
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:08.060]   But then I just simply said, what if I walk now, it understands that this is we're continuing
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:12.300]   the conversation that the saying will take the request I just gave you and modify it
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.300]   thusly.
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:19.300]   So I think that the Google Assistant is showing that it's just they're not getting better
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.300]   from it.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:24.140]   They got like basic two step sequential inference and they're left it there.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:27.260]   I do. Yeah, I do think that Google Assistant is getting better at that.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:31.900]   But what I was about to say though is that even just but so many simple, stupid things
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:37.140]   like here in here in my new place, I've got I've got a Google home in the in the office.
[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:42.700]   I've got a Google home in the living room and it annoys me that I had to place them so
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:47.380]   that if I say, if I give a command in one place, it's not going to be picked up by like
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:48.380]   iPhone on my desk.
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:52.020]   It's not going to be that the work not going to have multiple devices fighting over it.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:57.020]   We really should have these two Google homes on the phone understanding that, okay, just
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:57:00.740]   like if you're old enough to remember having one phone in the house and everyone as an
[00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:05.300]   extension, so just the the act of putting your hand over the mouthpiece and yelling,
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:06.300]   I got it.
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.300]   So everyone else just puts down the receivers.
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.300]   That's what we need.
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.780]   It's it's simple things.
[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:15.220]   But what you're talking about, like learning that this is my routine.
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:20.020]   If I if I turn off the lights in the living room, I'm probably going to be turning off
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:25.020]   the lights in the bedroom very, very shortly because it's not 11 p.m. and I'm just going
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.020]   there or whatever.
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.020]   Yeah, right, right.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.740]   All these things are very, very, I think are within reach.
[00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:33.260]   It's not you're not talking about a moonshot to get this done.
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:38.540]   I think that they're just waiting for enough enough people, enough normal people to be
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:41.060]   using this stuff that they can actually take advantage of it.
[00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:43.860]   Not only that, but trust it.
[00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:44.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:45.860]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.820]   I mean, I we still have our, you know, the echo just randomly.
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:52.420]   I mean, of course, is my name is close, but it is.
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:55.700]   But the other issue is is that even the one my kids are talking about, like, we're watching
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.300]   TV and suddenly the echo says, I don't understand what to do there.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.780]   And it's just like out of like, like, completely nowhere.
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:01.780]   Yeah.
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:02.780]   Like imagine you say seriously.
[00:58:02.780 --> 00:58:06.060]   I mean, well, that's the thing to like serious supposed to do this voting system where if
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.460]   you just say the word and you have a bunch of, because you can have a bunch, you can
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:12.060]   have your phone, your roommate or partner's phone or a kid's phone or somebody else's
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:16.700]   phone and iPad, a watch, you can have all these devices in the area.
[00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:20.740]   I once was driving in a car, I lifted my arm up and I had a phone on the dash and two
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:24.780]   phones I was just testing with on the side and I said the command word and like they
[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:28.380]   argued for like two seconds over which one was going to answer it.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.700]   And there's supposed to have this voting system where it takes this telemetry and realizes
[00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.860]   what's the, what device has a screen on, which has it off, which is the last one you
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:38.260]   use, which is the closest proximity to you and the sliders went to answer.
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.700]   But it's not always fast and it's not always right.
[00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:44.020]   And it just, it creates what Andy said where suddenly you hear a voice upstairs.
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.340]   You're like, no, no, I am obviously downstairs.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:50.340]   Well, I find what's interesting is how assume and beans, we get pretty good at talking to
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:54.940]   our things in a way that they, you know, like you, you slowly, like my kids are masters
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:55.940]   of it.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:59:00.100]   They, they, they know exactly the intonations and exactly how to say things to the action.
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.100]   Addiction.
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:05.460]   Yeah, but they just, they immediately, you know, and they spend way more time with that
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:06.460]   than I do.
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:10.300]   I mean, they're over there asking questions all the time and talking to it and everything
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.300]   else.
[00:59:11.300 --> 00:59:13.100]   And so they, they absorb that much, much faster.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:17.820]   There's a lot of things that now I, I really realize that I have to have my kids look at
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:21.700]   and tell me whether it's actually what, well, it's like, but you're highly technical.
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:22.700]   It's, isn't that it?
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:25.460]   I mean, I understand that with parents who are there like fish in water.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:27.100]   Like it's just, it's like, there's this.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:32.540]   I mean, have you seen, um, it is, uh, lively, live, don't know why.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.020]   Yeah, the kids love that.
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.020]   It's just chaos.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.860]   Like it's just like, like, like horrible.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:37.860]   And you look at it.
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:39.380]   You're like, I don't understand what I'm looking at.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:40.380]   I don't even know what I'm looking at.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:46.100]   It's basically Karaoke, uh, but periscope for karaoke kind of or what.
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:49.620]   But, but it's, there's all kinds of different shows and they're kind of singing along and
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:50.620]   they're kind of on.
[00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.860]   So your kids are, are, are, are lively users?
[00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:54.100]   No, I had to show it to them.
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.020]   So like, cause someone else is understanding.
[00:59:56.020 --> 01:00:00.540]   Yeah, we had a partner that was talking about it and I was like, oh, lively's over, I think.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.540]   And I looked at it and I was like, I don't understand this.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.700]   And I show the time we hear about it.
[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.700]   It's over.
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:05.700]   Oh yeah.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.700]   I think it's over.
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.700]   We got bought by some Chinese company.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:08.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.620]   But the, the stream, the, the stream counts are like, I'm looking at it.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:15.380]   And I'm like, I don't understand what I'm looking at, but there are 40,000 people looking
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:18.300]   at this and I don't, you know, I don't, I don't understand.
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:20.220]   I don't, so I had to show my, have to show my kids.
[01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.540]   And then they were like, oh, that's pretty cool.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.540]   I see what they're doing.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.900]   And, and then they're, they're like talking about, when are they going to do another coin
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:25.900]   drop?
[01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.420]   You know, like, like, but this was like within minutes of seeing it.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.860]   Like I couldn't understand at all what was going on.
[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:34.300]   Um, but it's a, um, yeah, it's, it's crazy.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:35.300]   It's, um, yeah.
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.020]   That's all I gotta say.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:40.260]   And I talked about this previously, but my God kids before they could read or write, we're
[01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.300]   using Siri to send and receive, uh, iMessages and they could, they could have it read out
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:46.620]   the last time message, dictate the next one.
[01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:48.140]   And it's incredibly enabling technology.
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:49.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.620]   It just, it still hits walls very quickly.
[01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:51.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:54.100]   Uh, all right.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:56.980]   Uh, Apple is, uh, still in the PC business.
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:02.940]   In fact, the number four PC manufacturer, they sold 20 million.
[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:04.900]   This is from IDC and Gartner 20 million.
[01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.980]   Cause they don't say Apple is saying 20 million.
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.220]   Uh, Macintosh computers.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.780]   Don't tell us at the end of January with their, their year end.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:13.780]   Okay.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:14.860]   So we'll have, yeah, that's right.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.420]   We'll have at the quarterly results.
[01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:21.540]   We'll have the, uh, so they, uh, number one is HP, number two, Lenovo, number three,
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:25.820]   Dell, number four, Apple leapfrogging, Asus and Acer.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:30.140]   It is a little bit like being the fourth largest army on the planet.
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.420]   It's like, there's a kind of a drop off after.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:33.420]   Yeah.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:36.540]   The price sold 50, almost 59 million.
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.980]   What I was amazed is that HP is at the top and growing at 8.2%.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.420]   I was like, what did they do?
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:45.220]   They're making great computers, which there's a big shift for HP.
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:48.340]   When they split off from the enterprise group, they say, I think they must have said, I'm
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:51.300]   guessing, you know, guys, we have a crappy reputation.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:53.140]   These pavilions suck.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.580]   We've been loading them with crap where they break.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.820]   Let's, what if we made good computers?
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:59.180]   What was that crazy brand?
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:00.500]   Well, it wasn't Alienware.
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.260]   It was, it was another premium brand and they were getting super frustrated because they
[01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:05.260]   weren't maintaining it.
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.420]   And then I think they decided to go all in on it.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:12.820]   It's, I have my, the thinnest, lightest, most beautiful computers, my specter, third,
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:13.820]   a specter T.
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:14.820]   It's a 13 inch beautiful.
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.820]   How does that name resonate now?
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:18.820]   Huh?
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.020]   How does that name resonate now?
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:22.180]   The specter T is not a good name, is it?
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:23.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.380]   They even spell it the same way.
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:31.260]   But it's, but they're really nice systems and they, they're, they're reliable.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:37.180]   It's a HP's, it's inch, what I find interesting is how quickly consumers get the message,
[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:40.700]   you know, because HP was number one for a long time, dropped and came back.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:45.420]   And I think, I think it's, there's a, there's a real telegraph among consumers.
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:46.420]   Hey, you know what?
[01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:47.420]   These are good again.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.420]   Right.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:49.420]   Or companies.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:51.540]   I mean, I think with HP, I feel like it's big companies buying them.
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.860]   I mean, I don't, what's your, what's your experience looking at the airport and the
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:55.860]   airport?
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.180]   Like how, what laptops you see?
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:02.260]   I see, actually I've started to see a lot of aces and aces because they're good quality,
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:03.700]   but lower cost.
[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:07.380]   And I think that's one of the reasons these companies, you know, maybe most people haven't
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:09.900]   heard of them, but they've, they're selling 18 million each.
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:10.900]   Cause I do this thing.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.340]   I, I think I, I kind of do as I go to the bathroom on a plane.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.940]   You look at what's, I just kind of, I just kind of, what do you stage?
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:19.540]   It's about 65, 70% a lot of laptops.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.540]   So a lot of laptops.
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:22.700]   And then like the sun version or iPads.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:27.140]   12.9 inch iPad pros playing a gem find the candy.
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.060]   That's been my every flight I go on.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.300]   It's, it's loaded with apples.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.300]   It's really interesting.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.620]   But you'll, you'll, you'll see people, you know, if they're doing a spreadsheet, chances
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.420]   are they're doing it until, you know, or something like that.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.980]   It's a Montreal to Toronto flight.
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:40.980]   You'll see blackberries still.
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:44.700]   No, because they're going back to rim headquarters.
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:45.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.340]   There you go.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.820]   So I mean, that's good news.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:53.940]   I hope Apple takes it seriously and says there's a market apparently, and this is discouraging,
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:59.580]   Apple insider, Malcolm Allen reporting Apple shifting more MacBook orders to Foxconn with
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.860]   no plans for a major update in 2018.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.860]   That actually digitized.
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:03.860]   Sorry.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:04.860]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:05.860]   Okay.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:06.860]   So he's.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.860]   And I'm clear what they mean by major update.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:10.500]   Like a major update could be a redesign, but a major update is probably not coffee lake.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.820]   Like coffee lake is probably not considered by them to be a major update, even though.
[01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:17.220]   Well, and that's the kind of update you'd expect, frankly, is a processor update when
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.780]   you, I mean, it's pretty much perfect.
[01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:23.820]   But I don't think the only thing I'd love to see on a MacBook is a second type C port
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:25.820]   on the left and right side.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:30.660]   Well, see, this is the thing is that we are now exactly 10 years after Steve Jobs announced
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.100]   the original MacBook Air.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.860]   And a couple of years after that, like the original MacBook Air, I had it and it was
[01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:40.020]   a fun machine, but it was incredibly limited to have that little Millennium Falcon ramp
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:43.380]   that you pull down to get to the ports.
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:44.500]   And it really couldn't do much.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.980]   And then they came out with the, the wedge shaped MacBook Air that had plenty of ports
[01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.420]   and it was much sleeker and better.
[01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.300]   And we've had the MacBook now going on.
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:55.060]   This is like going into the fourth year now.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.460]   And we haven't had that wedge shaped MacBook Air moment that we've all been waiting for,
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.780]   where they sort of said, yeah, we've worked out the kinks.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:01.780]   We've got the future down.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:03.060]   This is what it's going to be.
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:06.780]   Now here it is with like two, three ports and, you know, it's not using pen, it's not
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.460]   using core M anymore.
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.780]   It's using a big boy processor or some arm processor or something.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:17.220]   It's rank speculation and this comes from Apple Insider, but Intel has now announced
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:24.420]   that they're doing a processor, the G series that has G P AMD GPU built in a Radeon RX
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.100]   Vega built in.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:30.020]   That would be a great candidate, I think, for something like the MacBook because you
[01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:33.500]   could keep your slim line, but have discrete graphics.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.940]   And Siders also saying there's, they might want to adopt the tight, it's not merely the
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:41.060]   processor, the Titan Ridge chipset, which would be an upgrade to Thunderbolt 3 that
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:47.900]   would enable DisplayPort 8K screens fall back to US 31 speeds.
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.380]   So there are certainly.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.780]   30 Hertz, oh, yeah.
[01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.780]   30 Hertz, yeah.
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.300]   Who wants an 8K 30 Hertz screen?
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.580]   That's not that's yik.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.940]   That's like the original five.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.940]   Like the four K.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:57.940]   Same thing happened for K.
[01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.940]   That's right.
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:05:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.940]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:01.940]   Wait a minute.
[01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:02.940]   Wait to get that out.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.940]   4K is fine.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.940]   5K is nice.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:05.940]   I don't mind 5K.
[01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:10.660]   I have two to, uh, cinnamon display monitors, the older ones, you know, the LED one and the
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:13.660]   Thunderbolt one on left and right in the 5K in the middle.
[01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.060]   And I'm very happy that looks great.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:21.380]   Although 5K at its native resolution, I'm, I had to order computer glasses because.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.540]   You know, even at arm's length, it's pretty hard to see.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:31.500]   We were talking about even just when you're doing 4K, uh, podcasts or, you know, whatever,
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.380]   you know, like we've been recording some stuff at 4K.
[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:34.380]   Have you really?
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.380]   The camera part is easy.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.220]   Um, but the screen is you have to really bulk it up.
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:40.540]   You know, and some apps don't do that very well and everything else.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:41.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.540]   Showing screens.
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:44.580]   You just can't read the screen and it's, but it's interesting.
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.540]   The AK stuff is coming fast and we saw.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:50.820]   Can you get 4K screen converters that, uh, how are you doing that?
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:55.140]   You do HTM just to HT my out and you and that goes our switchers will see 4K.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:56.140]   So what you see it.
[01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:07:02.020]   So the, um, but the, uh, for the interesting thing is, is that such a change from the tech
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.020]   TV days.
[01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.020]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.020]   Do you remember how hard it was to get us.
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:06.020]   Look at a camera pointed.
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:07.500]   We ended up shooting a screen.
[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.140]   Oh, no, it was locked down camera.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.620]   I will say in some ways that still better.
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:13.700]   Well, you get more a, you get weird effects.
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:18.660]   But when the guys got it right, the nice thing is, is you had a camera operator focusing
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.460]   in on things and moving around the screen.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:21.460]   That's true.
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.820]   And it was like this rather than just going to a screen, it was really like getting in
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:28.700]   there and moving around and having a little bit of a simulate that with this, uh, it
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.220]   is, but there was, but it's not you.
[01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:34.380]   Like it's somebody else thinking about it and just a way this is better because I know
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.380]   what I want to show.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.380]   Right.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.380]   You know, I want to see.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.380]   Let's say, let's take a look.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.380]   I'm going to take a look at a camera.

[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:35.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:38.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:41.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:42.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.380]   I'm going to take a camera.
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:48.380]   They wouldn't do a mesh.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:49.380]   They wouldn't do what's it called?
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:51.380]   Po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po-po.
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.380]   Yeah.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:56.380]   It cuts it in half because it has to have a back channel.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:58.380]   It's half duplex speed.
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:00.380]   It's not a good solution.
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.380]   I'm glad they're selling the Velop.
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:06.380]   I hope that I'll have to get some and see how these work.
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.380]   Most of them, it's expensive.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:11.380]   I think it's 300-some bucks for the three unit system.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.380]   Can you share packages?
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:15.380]   If you buy an Euro or a Velop or something and then Velop,
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:18.380]   and then could I give two to you, Leo, or one to you and one to Andy?
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:20.380]   Do they all work independently or do they have to be there?
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:21.380]   Some of them, that's true.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.380]   I had a Google Wi-Fi system with three units.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.380]   I don't use it, so I spread it out.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:27.380]   They were all heterogeneous.
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:30.380]   The Euros, for instance, have base stations and beacons.
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:33.380]   But yes, most of them, they are.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:37.380]   The Orbeez one is a base station, one is a satellite.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:40.380]   If there's a distinction, then you have to be careful.
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:44.380]   But Euros, if you get all base stations, you just can spread them all around.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:46.380]   The plumes are all identical.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.380]   If I get 12 and I only need six, I can give three to you and three to you.
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.380]   It wouldn't make any difference.
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:54.380]   They're all equivalent units.
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:55.380]   But you have to check that.
[01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:57.380]   I guess six pack of beer.
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:58.380]   Twelve is overkill.
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.380]   No one needs 12.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.380]   I don't know.
[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:03.380]   I've heard this word overkill.
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.380]   You keep using that word.
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:06.380]   I don't think it means what you think it is.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:08.380]   When you have 62 units...
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:09.380]   A castle Lindsay.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:11.380]   Connected to three just in the tower.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:14.380]   It does put ideas in your head.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:17.380]   There is a little park around the corner from my building.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:19.380]   I can put...
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:22.380]   One of my windows is on a little...
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:28.380]   It's not a porch, but I can only refer to it as the Mussolini window.
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:32.380]   It has a little ledge with a railing around it.
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:35.380]   If I wanted to give a speech like Mussolini, now you know what I'm talking about.
[01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:39.380]   I was thinking that if I put another Euro on there,
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:43.380]   and then I can hide another on somewhere else,
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:47.380]   I can maybe get my wife to reach into that park.
[01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:51.380]   If I bounce it off of this brick-willed building that's across the wall,
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:53.380]   across the street...
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.380]   Oh, no, put a district there.
[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:56.380]   Put a little dish on that wall.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:00.380]   It's like if you can do it, something tells you you should do it.
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:01.380]   That's your right seat.
[01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:02.380]   Not as Peter.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:03.380]   That's my wife.
[01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:04.380]   What is the story of my life?
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.380]   What is that?
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.380]   So I have found the secret to using your phone less,
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:10.380]   article in the New York Times,
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:13.380]   said, "Make your phone black and white."
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:17.380]   And if it's black and white, it doesn't attract.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:18.380]   It takes all the fun out of it.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:23.380]   It takes all the fun out of your phone.
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:27.380]   It makes it just a dim, grim experience.
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:30.380]   It's actually very easy to do on the Apple.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.380]   My life is not not nice enough.
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:32.380]   It's a German expression.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:33.380]   I say make it black and white.
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.380]   It kind of looks like what you have there.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:37.380]   Make it black and white and make it half.
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.380]   Contrast or half the brightness.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.380]   Then make it black and white.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.380]   You can really, you can really.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:46.380]   Why don't you just set it in comic songs, Leo?
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:47.380]   That'll be even worse.
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.380]   So if you, if, anyway, I think it's reasonable.
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:53.380]   You go into accessibility display accommodations,
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:55.380]   color filters, and there's a grayscale.
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:19:00.380]   You can use other ones for different kinds of color blindness.
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.380]   But just, you know, making it black and white,
[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:04.380]   that's a lot of fun.
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:07.380]   No.
[01:19:07.380 --> 01:19:08.380]   Andy, you sound skeptical.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:09.380]   Don't know.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:14.380]   I just recently did something kind of similar that has very,
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:24.380]   that is, I turned, by default now, my data connection to LTE is turned off.
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:27.380]   So that if I want to do, I'm perfectly free to use Twitter.
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.380]   Perfect free, but I just have to turn it back on again.
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:33.380]   And when you add that extra step to just simply check in on Twitter or
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:38.380]   Instagram or your mail or whatever, you find that you actually don't really want to do it.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:41.380]   And so I'm using my phone a lot less outside the house.
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:43.380]   They'll tell you, make it black and white.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:44.380]   You really want to use it.
[01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:45.380]   I'm going to try it.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.380]   I'm going to try it.
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.380]   You get all the data, everything's there.
[01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.380]   There are only a few things that need color in the.
[01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:51.380]   It's noir.
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:52.380]   It's fine.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.380]   And actually, even Instagram looks fine.
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:56.380]   It's German expressionist.
[01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:57.380]   It's, yeah.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:19:58.380]   Ansel Adams.
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.380]   Like being attacked by a dementor.
[01:19:59.380 --> 01:20:00.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.380]   This is a local by L.C.D.
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:05.380]   Nelly Bowles, who has the best name for a journalist.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:10.380]   It looks like she's trying to, like, let's sort of report this, trying to
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:14.380]   circumnavigate the globe and lend fewer days of finniest fog.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:15.380]   Yeah, that sounds like it.
[01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:19.380]   I want Wall Street Journal version so that it has little dots for all the pictures.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:20.380]   Oh, yeah, we just do that.
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.380]   Oh, what a great mod that would be.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.380]   That would be really cool.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:26.380]   You also turn your TV to black and white.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.380]   I'm doing how far I take this.
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:31.380]   We're seeing more and more of this.
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   You know, Apple, activist, Apple investors are talking about this last week.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:39.380]   Telling Apple, you've got to find a way to make people, you know, kids not, you get addicted.
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.380]   I don't want to be too harsh on this stuff.
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:44.380]   When I was a kid, there was like this, we had a park with a little stream in it
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:45.380]   and there was an accident in the stream.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:49.380]   And we had to go through two months of the city trying to figure out if they should put the stream in a pipe
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:50.380]   because it would be safer.
[01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:54.380]   And that's, it's just, it's a weird world when you want to put a, a, a stream in a pipe.
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:21:00.380]   And I guess I just feel like I was at 10 years old, from 10 on, I spent so much time in front of a computer
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:02.380]   that, and I played so many games.
[01:21:02.380 --> 01:21:08.380]   I played, you know, I come home every day from school and played pitfall on my, on my Atari.
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:10.380]   You know, I, I do think about it with my kids.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:16.380]   So I don't, I did, I take their, yesterday they were home for the day and I was like, okay, we're going to read for the next four hours.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:22.380]   You know, like, you know, like, we're, we're not going to, you know, and, but when they're spending a couple hours on it, I don't.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:27.380]   Another solution I'm trying, and I don't know how well it's going to work because Michael really loves his video games.
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:36.380]   I got some electronics kits, things, and I thought, well, he likes, maybe this is sort of computers, but it's actually doing stuff.
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:39.380]   He's learned to solder in school, which is really great.
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:40.380]   Right.
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:43.380]   Or solder for those of you who do not live in the United States of America.
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.380]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:47.380]   For those of you in S-hole countries, solder.
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.380]   With an extra U-
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:49.380]   That's what he said, by the way.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:50.380]   He said in solder countries.
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:51.380]   Right.
[01:21:51.380 --> 01:21:52.380]   He said, yes.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.380]   Right.
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:54.380]   And people don't know.
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:57.380]   And having been born in one of those countries, I really appreciate it.
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.380]   Does it strange when I say solder?
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.380]   Do you feel like, what's he saying?
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.380]   No, we, we speak American in Canada.
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:04.380]   You've learned.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:09.380]   Apple is really stepping up the action on original content.
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:12.380]   And I have to think this is, this can't be all for Apple music.
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.380]   It's like a deal every couple days now.
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:15.380]   Yeah.
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.380]   The latest deal I'm excited about.
[01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:23.340]   They got Stephen Knight and Francis Lawrence, who are the production team behind The Hunger
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.340]   Games.
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:30.180]   I'm sorry, Stephen Knight is the writer of Peaky Blinders, which is one of my favorite, favorite
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.180]   Netflix shows.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:32.180]   I haven't seen it yet because.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:33.180]   Oh, clearly he doesn't want to watch it.
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:34.180]   And so I'm just going to.
[01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:35.180]   Well, it's a little violent.
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:40.780]   It takes pace in the, in the, in a, in a black and white, it seems like grim northern
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:43.780]   England town in the, in the peak of the industrial era.
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.580]   Like, like my kind of century.
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.580]   It's awesome, really.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:47.580]   It's awesome.
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:48.580]   Yeah, the peak.
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.580]   I mean, it's grim.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:53.980]   They're, they're, they're making, they're smelting steel in the streets.
[01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:54.980]   It's like that.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:55.980]   It's really great.
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:56.980]   I got a 10 hour flight tomorrow.
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:57.980]   I'm going to.
[01:22:57.980 --> 01:23:01.060]   And the reason they call them Peaky Blinders, and this is not a spoiler, is they put razor
[01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:05.820]   blades in the brims of their hats to blind their opponents from the peak of their hats
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:06.820]   when they get in fights.
[01:23:06.820 --> 01:23:09.700]   There's lots of fights, but it's a great show, really well written.
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:12.220]   Stephen Knight, the guy who created that.
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:16.940]   And the guy who created the, or directed the Hunger Games.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:21.380]   And this is a, from Chairman Entertainment and Deaver content, it's going to be called
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:24.220]   C-S-E-E.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:29.700]   They, the deadline calls it an epic world building drama set in the future.
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.020]   My kind of show.
[01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.540]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:33.900]   Sounds like Apple's doing a lot of sci-fi.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:35.580]   They know what they know their audience.
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:40.420]   They are definitely, it looks like they're really going after this kind of high end, you
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:42.420]   know, they're not doing any experimentation.
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   I mean, they know.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.420]   This is class.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:47.500]   Then by the way, this could cost them more than the billion dollars they've allotted,
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.860]   not that they don't have the money.
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:55.900]   They've also got a morning show drama starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Weatherspoon.
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:23:59.860]   They're going to do a bring back amazing stories of Steven Spielberg.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:03.380]   And we talked about the Ronald D. Moore space opera.
[01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.660]   And they're going through this kind of, I think Apple's doing this kind of blue chip.
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:11.460]   I was talking to a filmmaker and, you know, I feel bad for some of the online folks because
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:17.500]   he, there's definitely this echalin that filmmakers are starting to break down of, you know, features.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:21.500]   Unless you're, a lot of filmmakers that I'm talking to now are basically like unless you're
[01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:26.020]   doing an effects film or something really with big cameras, you don't even bother trying
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:27.020]   to get to the theater.
[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:28.020]   People are still trying to do that.
[01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:32.180]   They're still doing some of it because, but that's, you know, like not going to happen.
[01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:36.620]   And so everyone's focused on like if you're doing some kind of, you might be able to,
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:41.500]   do action, but really if you're doing like romantic comedies or drama or whatever, they
[01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:42.500]   really look at all these.
[01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:44.620]   And it's interesting to watch people start to break that down.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:46.700]   Like Apple is like the top of that world.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.700]   Like if you can get them to buy it, you're going to get all the money.
[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.700]   You're going to get all this up.
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.260]   The Netflix is below that.
[01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:56.220]   Then HBO and then Showtime and then Amazon and then you, you know, and a lot of people
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:59.060]   are talking about like, well, get big on YouTube or get big on Facebook on one of their
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:02.300]   things and then we'll turn that in, you know, go to one of the other ones, you know.
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:07.040]   And so it's just an interesting mix of stuff where there's still, you know, a lot of people
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:10.740]   trying to push forward, but it looks like Apple's really jumped very much to the top
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:12.380]   of the online distribution.
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:13.380]   It's a big thing.
[01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:14.940]   Money and clients will do.
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:19.020]   Well, and I think if you think about people like Jennifer, Aniston, Reese Witherspoon,
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:21.500]   they probably love the idea of making something for Apple.
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:25.540]   It's a brand that I think people, well, they probably, I mean, I think Aniston has a,
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:26.740]   her own production company.
[01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:27.740]   That's right.
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.500]   And this is also attractive.
[01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:30.780]   They retain ownership.
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:31.780]   Right.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.980]   So Apple has, how does this go to market?
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.380]   Does this go under the Apple music banner?
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:37.260]   Well, that's, that's the Quest Apple TV brand.
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:38.260]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:39.260]   It's a separate subscription service.
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:40.260]   This is not Apple music.
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.140]   This is, this is something else.
[01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:43.900]   These, these buys are for Apple TV.
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.540]   I mean, it's, I bet you it'll be only on Apple products.
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:47.740]   Is it a subscription product?
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:48.900]   Will it be in the TV app?
[01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:49.900]   Will it be in the Apple?
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:52.740]   I don't know if they need to.
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:56.380]   I mean, they, they, they could definitely create some kind of a subscription that would
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:57.380]   support it.
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:26:04.180]   But surely if Apple just produced a, let's say spent $100 million a week on a, on a feature,
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:07.620]   you know, feature film and it only came out about Apple products that would people would
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:11.500]   buy Apple TVs because that's where the, you know, I think Apple could basically, you know,
[01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:12.500]   do it.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.500]   I don't think they're going to.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.500]   I think they're going to, they want to have value.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:15.500]   And you know what?
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.500]   I'd pay for this.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:17.500]   This is going to be, yeah, they've hit.
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:21.100]   So this morning show for instance, the month is an easy thing.
[01:26:21.100 --> 01:26:22.100]   Everyone's used to it.
[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:26.660]   They option Brian Stelter, who's the media critic for a CNN in the time.
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:27.660]   Brian's great.
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:28.660]   We've had him on shows.
[01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:29.660]   He's really good.
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:30.660]   He's super smart.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:34.260]   They option a book he wrote about the morning shows called top of the morning.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.260]   So he's going to be a consultant.
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:39.700]   The show runner is Jay Carson from House of Cards.
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:41.820]   This is, this is a premium product.
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:43.820]   Blue chip.
[01:26:43.820 --> 01:26:44.820]   Blue chip.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:45.660]   That's the word I'm looking for.
[01:26:45.660 --> 01:26:47.420]   And I don't think you give that away.
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:54.460]   It's because partly because all of these people don't want to be the freebie in the bottom,
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:56.660]   at the bottom of the Apple TV page.
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:58.500]   That's not what you don't know.
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.940]   No, no, no, they want a flagship position for this.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:07.260]   Well, when you look at it, I just I just think that what happens is that they get an exclusive,
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.660]   Apple has a producer position on it.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.060]   They have they retain some ownership of the product.
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.420]   They have an exclusivity window.
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:19.100]   It doesn't end then at some point it can go either if they're even if it's can't go
[01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:24.860]   onto another streaming service that at least goes on to some sort of a digital to own market.
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:28.900]   I can't I can't imagine them making sense of this deal by saying that this is just going
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:35.380]   to be something that you have to own an Apple product in only in order to see it and build
[01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:36.380]   audiences.
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:40.380]   I think that the way you do it is that you do make it an exclusive for the first year,
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.820]   let's say the first season.
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.020]   And then hopefully you wind up with a game of thrones.
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:49.300]   And you get to release season one to Google play Amazon video.
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:55.380]   I think it's good for money, but that's not what Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:56.580]   joined the game for.
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:59.980]   I think it's easier for Apple to convert Apple music to Apple media.
[01:27:59.980 --> 01:28:00.980]   That's what they need.
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:02.780]   Like I just think they just flip it.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.580]   I don't think they I don't think they want to have two subscription services, one for
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.380]   music and one for I think what they want is they want to make they just want to flip
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:14.580]   it to something that's everything and I think that maybe we see that.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:15.580]   Yeah, this year.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:19.500]   I think I think what you can give Reese Witherspoon that they're going to she's going to really
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:25.380]   respond to is you still you get complete control over as a producer.
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.580]   You hire whoever you want.
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:28.300]   The story goes in whatever direction you want.
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:32.340]   We don't care as long as it can compress down to an MP4 file at some point.
[01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:37.260]   And no, but Andy, Hollywood, you're only as good as your last thing.
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:42.380]   If nobody sees your last thing, it's really important to these people.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:43.380]   I guarantee you.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:46.140]   I mean Reese Witherspoon is coming off big little lies.
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:49.660]   And by the way, HBO has already signed a second season of that.
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:54.140]   They are looking for it's of course, it's money, it's control.
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:58.300]   All these are very important, but they're also looking to be the jewel in the crown.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:28:59.300]   Event programming.
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:02.540]   Because there's got to be something that's going to everybody's going to go.
[01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:03.860]   I got to buy Apple media.
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:07.220]   The money and the control is everywhere right now.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:08.220]   If you're a creator.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:10.220]   HBO gives you that, Netflix gives you that.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:14.860]   And Angelina D'Elie made a movie about the genocide in the Camier language.
[01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:17.620]   You know, and and and and that looks like a full control.
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:18.620]   No money in it.
[01:29:18.620 --> 01:29:19.900]   You know, it's full control though.
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:23.420]   Well, it's also going to it might win an Oscar because it's, you know, prestige.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:28.140]   So, so I mean, Apple's putting them put their completely putting down the money and they've
[01:29:28.140 --> 01:29:30.500]   saying something that is getting these.
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.220]   I mean, every one of these is top flight.
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:36.260]   They're saying something and I wonder what their whispering into their ear.
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:37.420]   And I think it's a cure right, Renee.
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:43.580]   It's something like come June, we are going to be announcing the most important streaming
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.060]   TV network ever.
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.900]   Or maybe the fall.
[01:29:46.900 --> 01:29:47.900]   Fall is better.
[01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:52.980]   But I think that the I and you launch with four or five really big.
[01:29:52.980 --> 01:29:56.540]   And they have to hit it, especially after revenge.
[01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:57.700]   They have to hit it flop.
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:29:58.700]   They have to hit it hard.
[01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:01.860]   I think they kind of experimented on that one and that was not a good experiment.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:05.340]   So they brought in regular Hollywood folks, regular show runners, regular, you know, all
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:06.340]   that stuff.
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:07.340]   They said, write the check.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:08.540]   Let's just write, like do anything we need.
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:09.540]   What is it?
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.540]   What is it you need to get this done?
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:15.620]   I think that we're trying to avoid is being the next, you know, Amazon or YouTube or Facebook
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:18.340]   who have spread it out too much over a lot of stuff and too much.
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.980]   And as this has already said, we want the next game of thrones.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.700]   Like he wants to spend, he's ready to spend real money on it.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:27.060]   He doesn't want to be better off spending eight billion dollars on five shows.
[01:30:27.060 --> 01:30:28.060]   Absolutely.
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:30.860]   Because if they're the right five and look at the demographics.
[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:32.780]   They've they've got the sci fi.
[01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:34.100]   They actually have two dystopian.
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:36.820]   They've one dystopian, maybe one upbeat sci fi right.
[01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:37.980]   They've got the morning show.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:41.580]   That's going to appeal to a broad demographic.
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.620]   Steven Spielberg's amazing stories.
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:44.620]   They are spreading.
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:47.500]   Well, I mean, net clubs are still crushing it.
[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:51.340]   I mean, that's the they are if you look at the breadth and depth that Netflix does.
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:53.820]   Too much depth, I would argue too much depth.
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:54.820]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.340]   Or maybe too much breadth, which one I don't know.
[01:30:57.340 --> 01:30:59.860]   I see so many shows is what I'm saying.
[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:03.540]   Because because they are they are taking this this group of people, everybody's got to find
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:04.700]   something for Netflix.
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:06.500]   It's like a CD store that you have to walk in.
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:11.540]   And even if you very rarely go over to the Z section, that CD still has to be there Netflix
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:16.260]   is they're trying to serve an entire audience and replace basically all of the content that
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:17.260]   they're buying right now.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:21.820]   I mean, I just I just love the fact that that I can watch that someone made the Punisher
[01:31:21.820 --> 01:31:26.300]   and then made whatever is a chef's table.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:27.300]   Yes.
[01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:29.820]   Both of them are just masterful in two different ways.
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:31.420]   I think I agree.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:33.660]   I think that that's spreading it around too much.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:34.660]   I think.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:39.860]   But if you're watching, it's fine for Netflix because your goal in Netflix is every every
[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:44.980]   four weeks to have something that will get either get people new people to subscribe
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:46.820]   and then the new subscribers to stick around.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:48.860]   You just have to do that every four weeks.
[01:31:48.860 --> 01:31:50.180]   That's not apples need at all.
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:51.180]   Now, Apple isn't.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.660]   Apple wants to be a headline.
[01:31:52.660 --> 01:31:53.900]   They want to win the awards.
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.700]   They want to be at the Emmy Awards.
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:56.700]   They want to be at the Golden Globes.
[01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.500]   And they want to add value to people who own Apple products.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.500]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:02.380]   There's something that changed because the first Netflix stuff was okay.
[01:32:02.380 --> 01:32:05.060]   I mean, there's a couple of good things and a couple of bad things.
[01:32:05.060 --> 01:32:10.300]   I now when I go on Netflix, I am looking for the Netflix logo on the things like I want
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:13.460]   to see what they did because I think it's going better than the crap that they buy now.
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.460]   Well, that's because they're solving a business problem.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.900]   But it's confusing too because some of it is just international shows they bought and
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:19.220]   branded as Netflix original.
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:20.940]   That's right.
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:22.140]   I think it's very confusing.
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:25.260]   I mean, it's they're not going to lose me as a subscriber.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:26.740]   That's all they care about.
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:27.820]   But I think it's very confusing.
[01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:29.180]   But this is a business necessity.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:30.380]   They're not getting movies.
[01:32:30.380 --> 01:32:32.740]   That's basically they know they're not going to get any more movies.
[01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:34.020]   Probably still got them now.
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:36.140]   I know, but they're not.
[01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:40.220]   I just don't know how much success they're going to have in getting people to say that
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:44.500]   go ahead with Netflix and Hulu and the rest of these services.
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:49.140]   All they have to do is say, give us no money for the first 30 days and then give us maybe
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:50.780]   eight bucks a month after that.
[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:55.860]   I don't know how they're going to tell people, give us a hundred bucks for an Apple TV box,
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:33:01.940]   which doesn't do as much as the box you have now or the or what's already in your TV.
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:07.300]   And then maybe after the you'll like the show and if you don't, well, there's still a
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:08.500]   revenge to the apps.
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:13.140]   I think that if you get if you get if you switch Apple music to Apple media, what happens
[01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:17.860]   is that that's all the phones, all the iPads, all the computers, everything can watch can
[01:33:17.860 --> 01:33:19.580]   watch the media that you're creating.
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:20.580]   The Apple TV is just one.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:22.580]   You can always play it to your regular.
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:23.580]   Oh, no, you can't.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.740]   That sucks.
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.140]   That's that's a horrible experience.
[01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:27.140]   Nobody.
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.140]   I don't think I don't think people really like that.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:31.260]   I think that that's why I think that if Apple's going to make a go of this, they're going
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:35.860]   to do it again as a production company where they'll take they'll keep the first they there's
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:40.500]   never any assurance that this billion dollars series they're buying to is going to be success.
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:42.860]   What they're hoping to is that it's going to be a success.
[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:46.500]   And then after the first season that when the first season becomes available for purchase
[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:48.900]   elsewhere, that's the thing that gets people hooked.
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:51.900]   See, I find, Oh my God, I got to see the season two of this.
[01:33:51.900 --> 01:33:52.900]   Damn it.
[01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:53.900]   It's only on Apple TV.
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:57.260]   That's what I want to make it available to any other.
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:58.260]   I think that's small.
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:33:59.700]   Well, I too know you build a button on iTunes.
[01:33:59.700 --> 01:34:02.100]   I'm guessing it's I don't again.
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:06.220]   I don't I don't I sometimes think of myself trying to answer that question that someone's
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:13.500]   asking me and I absolutely can't I can't imagine a show that's so good that it would
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:16.700]   define the hardware that this person buys.
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:18.180]   I can't picture it.
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:21.380]   I don't think one show does that, but I think that there's one show.
[01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:23.300]   But again, does that person have an iPhone?
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:25.300]   I mean, you know, like they can still watch it on their iPhone.
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:26.300]   They don't want it on their iPad.
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:29.540]   I don't even think that's really how Apple thinks about it.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:34.380]   I think they think about it as is the ecosystem.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:39.540]   Are we going to make a premier ecosystem, including hardware, software and content?
[01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:44.140]   And that the and the people who are in this ecosystem will be getting the best possible
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:45.140]   experience.
[01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:48.340]   They want differentiated experiences is what their their north star is.
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:50.180]   Yeah, I think that this does that.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.260]   Of course, the antitrust question is does Apple buy Disney and then what happened?
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:56.340]   Yeah, I actually don't want them to.
[01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:57.900]   I think that would be such a big.
[01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.540]   Right now is a great time for that.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.540]   I know.
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:04.180]   I got the money, but I feel like that would be too big an apple to bite.
[01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:06.380]   Oh, I think there's worms in there.
[01:35:06.380 --> 01:35:12.460]   By the way, Apple's upset because the FBI calls them jerks and evil geniuses.
[01:35:12.460 --> 01:35:14.980]   I like these jerks and evil geniuses.
[01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:20.940]   Apparently, this is according to motherboard FBI forensic expert Steven Flatley speaking
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:26.140]   at the international conference on cybersecurity in Manhattan said Apple is pretty good at
[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:28.380]   evil genius stuff.
[01:35:28.380 --> 01:35:29.380]   Those jerks.
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:30.380]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:37.300]   For example, Flatley complained that Apple recently made password guesses slower changing
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:40.980]   the hash iterations from 10,000 to 10 million.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:46.300]   That means he moaned that password attempt speeds went from 45 passwords a second to
[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:48.780]   one every 18 seconds.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:51.500]   It's harder to hack into my stuff.
[01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.500]   Well, that's a.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.500]   Can't hack in.
[01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.260]   I thought that it closes up much faster than that.
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:59.020]   I didn't understand that because usually if you get the wrong password a couple of times
[01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:01.700]   on your phone, it's like 64,000 years or something like that.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:02.700]   It's not.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:03.700]   Oh, they have a way of resetting that.
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:04.700]   Okay.
[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:05.700]   That's the issue.
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:06.700]   Yeah.
[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:07.700]   So good.
[01:36:07.700 --> 01:36:10.380]   You know what?
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:11.540]   Keep the apple.
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:13.660]   You're my kind of jerks.
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:14.660]   Keep doing it.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:15.660]   Good job, Apple.
[01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:16.660]   Good job.
[01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:20.740]   Yeah, see, they know that the FBI knows that in law enforcement knows the only way that
[01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:25.500]   they can win is by getting the public so riled up about those that they cast Apple as an
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:26.500]   enemy.
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:29.700]   And I think that's going to be a very very long route for them to try to.
[01:36:29.700 --> 01:36:33.180]   I'm trying to capture devices before they get locked, which is dangerous too.
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:34.180]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:37.020]   Apple and Epic care 10 years old this week.
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:38.020]   Who?
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:41.940]   Who actually might even be today was yesterday.
[01:36:41.940 --> 01:36:42.940]   I have.
[01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:43.940]   I have.
[01:36:43.940 --> 01:36:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:45.940]   I remember from layers.
[01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:48.260]   I was just thinking it in a Manila envelope and pulling it up.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:49.260]   He was such a showman.
[01:36:49.260 --> 01:36:51.860]   It was amazing.
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.940]   Think about the Mac book though.
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:56.020]   You could put that in the even smaller one.
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:57.020]   Yeah, right.
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.020]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.020 --> 01:36:59.460]   Did you see the file maker Adleo?
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:00.700]   Is that on your list?
[01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:02.060]   No, let me see that.
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:03.060]   What is that?
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:05.860]   There was just like all this gossip that Apple's making this farm thing.
[01:37:05.860 --> 01:37:06.860]   And what is this?
[01:37:06.860 --> 01:37:07.860]   It's going to be a new campaign.
[01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:15.220]   And it turns out that file maker, which is an Apple subsidiary, has a minute long quasi-clever
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:19.860]   new television or new video ad, which we didn't really hear much about file maker for a long
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:20.860]   time.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:24.060]   I know it's so funny because I actually really like file maker.
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:25.900]   I continue to recommend it.
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:28.260]   But boy, you wouldn't even know that Apple makes it.
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:29.260]   Right.
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:30.260]   Anybody makes it.
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:31.260]   Right.
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:32.260]   But I just apply it.
[01:37:32.260 --> 01:37:33.900]   This has the stars of the office.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:34.900]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:38.780]   Let me see if I can find something that will play because it's on YouTube, I believe.
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:39.780]   Yeah.
[01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:42.780]   That's probably the best place to find it.
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:46.780]   I have something, Chrome does something weird.
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:47.780]   Let's see.
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:54.660]   Oh, there's a lot of file maker stuff on file maker pro 12 beginner tutorial from 2012.
[01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:55.660]   That's not what I want.
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:37:57.660]   I'll make your farm, try farm.
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:01.060]   File maker farm ad.
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.860]   Here we see Breeze farm.
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:04.900]   No, that's from 2012.
[01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:05.900]   Damn it.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:10.620]   I'm going to have to go to this Mac rumor site, even though it's doing this weird blinking
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:11.620]   thing.
[01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:12.620]   Oh, that's so weird.
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:14.220]   Oh, it's Chrome.
[01:38:14.220 --> 01:38:15.220]   It doesn't.
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:21.540]   It's a Windows slash Chrome having to do with video issue on just drives me crazy.
[01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:22.540]   Time for Firefox.
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:24.260]   Time for edge probably.
[01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:26.540]   I hate to say it.
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:29.420]   Let me go to edge.
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:31.980]   Now Microsoft.
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:35.900]   Oh, Microsoft.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:36.900]   File maker.
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:38.900]   Farm time, the mini movie.
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:47.780]   I just see actually if edge, yes, the edge channels it.
[01:38:47.780 --> 01:38:48.940]   No problem.
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:49.940]   Same page.
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:50.980]   All right, let's play it.
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:52.780]   We got to play it because I like these people.
[01:38:52.780 --> 01:38:53.780]   Yes.
[01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:57.620]   One upon a time, there was a small rude vegetable farm.
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:39:04.500]   Beats that suddenly became very successful and nobody seemed to know quite what.
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:05.500]   Farm time.
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.100]   A hundred thousand flies out here.
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:11.700]   So news reporter decided to investigate and this is the story of her findings.
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:14.540]   You just want me to walk in a dirt with the heels on?
[01:39:14.540 --> 01:39:15.540]   Uh huh.
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:20.620]   Hi, this is Rita Haywicky and we're continuing to see.
[01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:24.540]   Special reports.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.660]   This is where it all starts.
[01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:27.660]   The seating.
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:28.660]   Planting.
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:29.660]   Planting.
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:30.660]   What do you think?
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:31.660]   Oh, it's what's his name?
[01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:32.660]   I like that.
[01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:37.660]   I'm confused.
[01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.660]   Who's that?
[01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:40.660]   Not lunch time yet.
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:41.660]   Back to work.
[01:39:41.660 --> 01:39:42.660]   Not lunch time yet.
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:44.660]   It'll grow and grow.
[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:45.660]   We got it.
[01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:47.660]   We have a charge of love.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:49.660]   Yeah, I'm not amused.
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:50.660]   It's easy.
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:51.660]   I basically...
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:55.660]   And by the way, what does this have to do with File Maker?
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:56.660]   Basically it just builds me.
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:57.660]   Oh, there we go.
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:58.660]   There's some File Maker.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:39:59.660]   How do you do that?
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:00.660]   Click this button here.
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:02.660]   Oh, just that button?
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:03.660]   Yeah, that's the one.
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:05.660]   So, like, anybody can do that.
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:07.660]   Yeah, it's like the backroom stuff, though.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:08.660]   I can't.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:10.660]   You need to download the app.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:12.660]   It's the HR guy that Michael hated.
[01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:13.660]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:14.660]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:15.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:19.660]   That she may have just stumbled upon the biggest story of her career.
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:22.660]   Yeah, this isn't great.
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.660]   Oh, and there's what's her name.
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.660]   I'm glad you're getting work.
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:27.660]   I'm just saying.
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:30.660]   I don't know.
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:33.660]   It's an odd choice for a flounder commercial.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:38.660]   Well, yeah, obviously somebody a fan of the office,
[01:40:38.660 --> 01:40:41.660]   because remember Dwight Schrute had the beat head of B-4.
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:43.660]   Yeah, it's his brother.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:46.660]   It's not up there with the IBM commercials where they reunited the cast of Match.
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:50.660]   Which seemed like it united the country.
[01:40:50.660 --> 01:40:53.660]   They couldn't afford, of course, Dwight Schrute.
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:58.660]   Oh, but yeah, they didn't.
[01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:00.660]   Unfortunately, I can't show you all that now.
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:07.660]   Oh, highly encrypted shipping.
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:11.660]   Again.
[01:41:11.660 --> 01:41:13.660]   Oh, he's got some work into this.
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:14.660]   I'm glad they did.
[01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:15.660]   I thought that was a bird.
[01:41:15.660 --> 01:41:16.660]   They put a lot of money.
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:17.660]   I, well, maybe not.
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:18.660]   I don't know.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:19.660]   Not a bird.
[01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:21.660]   I don't know how expensive these actors are.
[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:23.660]   I think we got enough.
[01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:27.660]   So you see, it was an application built on the file maker platform.
[01:41:27.660 --> 01:41:29.660]   That helped these farmers build that.
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:33.660]   It's weird that they're just captioning, they're kind of bouncing me and fucking you.
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:35.660]   And a guy with an unidentifiable accent.
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:38.660]   It might be Tommy Wiseau doing the narration.
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:39.660]   And live.
[01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.660]   The end.
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:41.660]   Oh, hi, Mark.
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:43.660]   It's an odd choice.
[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:44.660]   I did not use it.
[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:47.660]   I did not use FileMaker.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:48.660]   All right.
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:53.660]   And by the way, FileMaker and Apple subsidiary on the logo.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:54.660]   That's interesting.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:57.660]   Isn't the Apple subsidiary?
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:01.660]   Does Disney have the same people who got you the Avengers movies?
[01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.660]   And you like the Avengers movies?
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:04.660]   So why FileMaker?
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:12.660]   Since it's movie time, maybe we should show what at some point this has got to be the last drone footage of the Apple campus.
[01:42:12.660 --> 01:42:15.660]   Some point they start shooting them down.
[01:42:15.660 --> 01:42:18.660]   So the trees are going and this is January 28th.
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:19.660]   Not enough.
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:20.660]   It looks just like the model.
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:21.660]   It does.
[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:22.660]   It's moving in now, too.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:23.660]   Even the people.
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:24.660]   Look at that.
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:25.660]   Oh, it is really pretty now.
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:28.660]   They're getting the landscaping is getting finished up here.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:32.660]   That looks like a challenging par four.
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:35.660]   It would be funny if they put a green there.
[01:42:35.660 --> 01:42:38.660]   It does look like a golf course.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:40.660]   That's a good ARF.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:44.660]   I would be shocked if nobody inside Apple writes an ARF that turns that.
[01:42:44.660 --> 01:42:46.660]   That meadow into a golf course.
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:47.660]   Oh, that'd be fun, wouldn't it?
[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:48.660]   AC2 golf.
[01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:49.660]   It's pretty.
[01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:50.660]   It's done, right?
[01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:51.660]   I mean, this is it.
[01:42:51.660 --> 01:42:53.660]   You can't get done or than this.
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:55.660]   It's the ultimate walled garden.
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:56.660]   What a statement.
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:57.660]   Wow.
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:10.660]   Well, in fact, that's what some noted that while Amazon is building its headquarters to be part of Seattle and kind of an active participant downtown, Apple has built walls around its employees.
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:12.660]   So entirely inside.
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:14.660]   I don't think that their employees are complaining about it.
[01:43:14.660 --> 01:43:15.660]   No, no, no.
[01:43:15.660 --> 01:43:16.660]   No, they're in the walls, though.
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:18.660]   That's the inside the wall.
[01:43:18.660 --> 01:43:19.660]   They're actually in the walls.
[01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:20.660]   They're in the walls.
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:23.660]   I don't think that they should be expected or required to do that.
[01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:29.660]   I will say that would have been very, very nice if they had integrated themselves into the community community a little bit more.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:34.660]   I think that was the one consistent complaint about from architecture, architecture critics.
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:36.660]   There's the idea of how they're doing this.
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:37.660]   Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:43.660]   And you can see now we get a sense of what you said, Renee, which is distant from the actual ring.
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:45.660]   You can't let us take it.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.660]   Wow, look at that from the street, though.
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:51.660]   That is if that is not a scary looking monolith.
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:52.660]   Is this the visitor center?
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:53.660]   We're flying over now.
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.660]   I think so.
[01:43:54.660 --> 01:43:56.660]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:57.660]   It's across the street.
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:59.660]   I don't know if the visitor center was across.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:01.660]   The visitor center was just up the path.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.660]   Just down the path from Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:44:03.660 --> 01:44:04.660]   Look like it.
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:06.660]   It did look like the visitor center.
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:08.660]   It's very pretty.
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:10.660]   There's not much to say.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:11.660]   This must be the last video.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:15.660]   I mean, what else are you going to, I mean, it's just going to look like this from that one.
[01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:19.660]   Unless somebody like maybe Tim Coam comes outside and shakes his fist at the drone.
[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:20.660]   That would, that would.
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:21.660]   Oh, there's a concert or something.
[01:44:21.660 --> 01:44:22.660]   Or a concert, yeah.
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:23.660]   Beer bash.
[01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:24.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:25.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:26.660]   Let me give credit to.
[01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:33.660]   This is the Duncan Sinfeld 4K drone footage.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:37.660]   And it's a, is it generating all the energy it needs on the roof?
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:40.660]   I think it would, well, they want to be carbon neutral, right?
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:41.660]   Right.
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:44.660]   They say they're carbon neutral, but sometimes companies do that by generating all their own power.
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.660]   More often they do it by selling carbon credits.
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:51.660]   Or they give some back and off key times and they bring it more in on time.
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:52.660]   Right.
[01:44:52.660 --> 01:44:53.660]   It's got a lot.
[01:44:53.660 --> 01:44:54.660]   I mean, that's a lot of panels.
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:55.660]   Yeah.
[01:44:55.660 --> 01:44:56.660]   That is a lot.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:59.660]   That's enough panels to really, to power a lot of stuff.
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:00.660]   There is, there's the view.
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:04.660]   It's a lot of landscaping still to go in or maybe it's just because it's winter in California.
[01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.660]   I grow the grass.
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:07.660]   There's the view of the Steve Jobs Theater.
[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:08.660]   Boy, that looks pretty.
[01:45:08.660 --> 01:45:14.660]   That is a, that is a, that by itself is really a working, it's already getting a little dirty.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:15.660]   Is it?
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:16.660]   Is the roof dirty?
[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:19.660]   That's a little, I think, can you get somebody out there with a power washer?
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:20.660]   Yeah, get a mop.
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:22.660]   That is an interesting question.
[01:45:22.660 --> 01:45:28.660]   Like the, the giant chrome bean in Millennium Park in Chicago is like, is polished, not just
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:34.660]   clean, but polished on a regular basis because it has to be like unvariegated chrome.
[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:35.660]   It has to be perfect.
[01:45:35.660 --> 01:45:40.380]   I'm wondering if that's part of their maintenance budget to make sure that that roof is always
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:41.380]   scrubble will clean.
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:42.380]   Yeah.
[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:44.180]   I mean, you're not supposed to be on top of that.
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:48.220]   I can't imagine doing pickup hockey games on top of there, but I'm, but nonetheless.
[01:45:48.220 --> 01:45:53.180]   Oh, and then, well, the world has to do with the, like efficiency of the solar panels.
[01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:57.020]   They're going to have to clean them if they're periodically, if they're going to keep getting
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:45:58.260]   as much power as they're hoping to.
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:03.180]   Peter X points out that probably the next event at the Steve Jobs Theater will be the
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:05.180]   shareholders meeting February 13th.
[01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:06.180]   Come to see.
[01:46:06.180 --> 01:46:09.180]   Have they had the lottery yet?
[01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:13.180]   Because I was thinking maybe I'll buy one share of Apple stock and see if I can get in.
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:14.900]   It's the only way I'll ever get in.
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:15.900]   Right.
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:16.900]   Get ready with your picks.

[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:51.300]   I thank them so much for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:53.300]   Come on, you got something good for us.
[01:47:53.300 --> 01:47:54.300]   Don't you Alex Lindsay?
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:55.300]   I know you do.
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:57.300]   Something that costs a couple of Alexes.
[01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:58.300]   It does.
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:47:59.300]   It does.
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:00.300]   Yeah, I know you.
[01:48:00.300 --> 01:48:03.420]   I've been going cheap on you guys for a while, but I decided to.
[01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:06.780]   And I wanted to play with this one for a little while before I recommended it, but I, and
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.980]   I've recommended this before about every couple of years.
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:14.580]   I just remind everyone, Cinema 4D R19 is out.
[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:17.500]   It's been out for a little while, but I wanted to play with some of the features.
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:21.460]   And it is still, if you're thinking about 3D, if you want to add it to your broadcast,
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:27.340]   if you want to add it to almost anything that you want to do, it's still my favorite 3D
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:29.140]   app out there.
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:30.740]   And there's a great demo of it.
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:32.940]   There's lots of different levels of how much you can add.
[01:48:32.940 --> 01:48:37.100]   I tend to use the ones got all the features in it.
[01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:42.020]   And it is this, they've got some new stuff in there where, I mean, in addition to a ton
[01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:48.740]   of, you know, great things that make things a lot more efficient, they've got a, and I
[01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:50.500]   can't ever say it right.
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:56.220]   It's Voro, Voronoi, or Voronoi fracture, which is basically they've improved how it
[01:48:56.220 --> 01:48:57.220]   blows things up.
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:49:00.060]   And I like dropping things and breaking them and so on and so forth.
[01:49:00.060 --> 01:49:05.100]   But it also has, if you're thinking about 360, it's just got a really easy to use 360
[01:49:05.100 --> 01:49:06.100]   camera.
[01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:10.140]   And I've used it for a couple of interface designs at this point.
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:12.980]   And so if you're thinking about wanting to build like a 3D interface and then you can
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:17.340]   mix it with motion, where you have 2D graphics coming from motion and 3D graphics coming
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:19.780]   from Cinema 4D, those are great.
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:23.740]   And also the other thing that we've just started testing or playing around with is being able
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:25.580]   to, basically you match move things.
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:29.740]   So in, instead of a separate app, you can move your camera around, you can match move
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:34.380]   to it and then it'll actually help you rebuild the scene well enough that you can stick objects
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:37.820]   to things in the scene and that type of thing.
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:45.460]   And so it's used all over, especially in broadcast, especially in corporate, but definitely in
[01:49:45.460 --> 01:49:47.220]   visual effects as well.
[01:49:47.220 --> 01:49:52.380]   But it is in broadcast, I think they kind of own it.
[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:58.220]   And so anyway, it's easy to learn, it's easy to get off the ground.
[01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:01.060]   And it just keeps on getting better every year.
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:04.740]   So it is, you know, just highly recommended if you're thinking about this and you're
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:07.540]   trying to figure out what you want to use.
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:09.660]   And it's super fast on a Mac.
[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:13.020]   So runs on Mac and PC, but very fast on Mac.
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:15.540]   Very nice.
[01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:18.260]   Cinema 4D and it's what, 5-Alex's?
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:19.260]   It depends on what you're getting.
[01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:24.900]   I think it starts at a couple, 1-Alex and then it goes up to, I think it gets up to, I
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:32.380]   want to say $3,500 for the full, fully blown studio, I believe, $2,500 or $3,500.
[01:50:32.380 --> 01:50:36.820]   And there's still a lot of good business to do.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:39.020]   Did this kind of work?
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:41.940]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:50:41.940 --> 01:50:43.260]   My pick is not an Alex.
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:46.340]   It's a fraction of an Alex and it's an upgrade to something that's been a pick of the week
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:47.340]   a while ago.
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:52.620]   Elago has this really cool and cute charging stand for your Apple watch that is a shape
[01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:54.020]   of a classic Mac.
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:51:00.940]   They recently upgraded it to, now you can get a Johnny Ive iMac style one either in Bondi
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:02.980]   Blue or in Strawberry.
[01:51:02.980 --> 01:51:04.700]   And there's still 50 bucks.
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:08.740]   You just route your charger cable into it, but it's still hard rubber.
[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:12.580]   It tilts up a little bit better so that maybe you get a better angle on it on your nightstand
[01:51:12.580 --> 01:51:13.740]   or whatever.
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:14.740]   It is the classic.
[01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:18.940]   This is the most adorable, stupid, inexpensive thing.
[01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:22.660]   And I like anything that's the perfect intersection of all three of those things.
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:26.700]   Yes, I have my little rubber iMac.
[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:28.940]   My watch sleeps in it every night.
[01:51:28.940 --> 01:51:29.940]   Yes.
[01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:34.700]   And you can see that the time of the car comes to the screen of it.
[01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:36.860]   Yeah, so it's quite lovely.
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:41.020]   It's compatible with my iMac Pro now.
[01:51:41.020 --> 01:51:45.460]   And I've got the powers of the G3 processor behind that.
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:49.020]   So, the Motorola 16000.
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:53.300]   My pick of the week is something you should not use for birth control, apparently, even
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:52:02.060]   though it's called natural cycles birth control, recently attacked by the Swedish government
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:08.780]   because it turns out women who are using this to protect themselves against pregnancy are
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:10.780]   getting pregnant.
[01:52:10.780 --> 01:52:18.300]   37 unwanted pregnancies, according to the natural, the Swedish medical products agency.
[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:21.860]   The app scans your body temperature during your menstrual cycle to notify you when it's
[01:52:21.860 --> 01:52:23.300]   safe to have unprotected sex.
[01:52:23.300 --> 01:52:29.340]   But anybody who knows about the rhythm method, which used to be the Catholic Church's preferred
[01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:33.420]   birth control knows that it only works a little bit.
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:36.260]   600 women, 37 pregnancies.
[01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:38.260]   It depends on how close you get to the edge.
[01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:39.260]   I think that's the thing.
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:40.260]   That's right.
[01:52:40.260 --> 01:52:41.260]   That's right.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:42.260]   Don't play it safe.
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:43.260]   That's the real thing.
[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:45.260]   It has an Apple watch app.
[01:52:45.260 --> 01:52:49.060]   I think you could also use it in the other direction.
[01:52:49.060 --> 01:52:50.580]   It's time to fornicate.
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:52.740]   Let's have kids.
[01:52:52.740 --> 01:52:53.740]   Let's have baby.
[01:52:53.740 --> 01:52:56.220]   Let's make a baby.
[01:52:56.220 --> 01:52:57.220]   Natural cycles.
[01:52:57.220 --> 01:52:58.220]   We'll see what happens with that.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:01.620]   I think it's effective if while checking the phone app to get so distracted by Pokémon
[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:04.980]   Go that you forget about sometimes.
[01:53:04.980 --> 01:53:09.220]   Natural cycles response says they have a pearl index of seven.
[01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:13.580]   That means it's 93% effective at typical use.
[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:17.260]   It's still seven babies out of 100 times.
[01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:18.260]   You use it.
[01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:21.420]   All of the birth control have some level of loss.
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:22.420]   I don't know what they are.
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:25.940]   It doesn't replace other forms of birth control, although I think at one point their ad copy
[01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:26.940]   suggested it might.
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:27.940]   Probably not.
[01:53:27.940 --> 01:53:32.460]   Also, it doesn't protect you from communicable diseases, which we pointed out.
[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:36.740]   They have a pearl index of seven, but then they say it's clinically tested to be 99.5%
[01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:37.740]   effective.
[01:53:37.740 --> 01:53:38.740]   See, I...
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:39.740]   Mmm.
[01:53:39.740 --> 01:53:40.740]   Yeah, see it's...
[01:53:40.740 --> 01:53:42.500]   That's fine print that'll kill you.
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:43.500]   Oh, there they go.
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:46.700]   Now they get a typical use of seven.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:52.860]   Mr. Renee, I don't know if that's a pick of the week or an anti-pick.
[01:53:52.860 --> 01:53:55.540]   It depends on what you want.
[01:53:55.540 --> 01:53:57.340]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:54:00.700]   So my pick of the week, we've talked about hugh lights before, but since I'm moving,
[01:54:00.700 --> 01:54:03.060]   I've been accumulating more and more hugh lights.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:04.900]   I had the standard bulbs before.
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:08.900]   In the place I'm moving into, I'm going to be using the hue beyond overhead lights,
[01:54:08.900 --> 01:54:10.300]   but I needed something to do fills.
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:14.540]   I wanted to have enough lights that I could remove shadows for some of the videos that
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.740]   I wanted to do.
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:21.020]   And Russell Holly, my good friend from Mobile Nations, he suggested the hue hue go, which
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:26.100]   is like a little bowl light, and it's rechargeable, and you can put it anywhere, and it'll give
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:30.740]   you just this beautiful white light at any intensity you want.
[01:54:30.740 --> 01:54:32.460]   So it's really, really good at...
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:33.460]   If you especially, like I want to be able to move around...
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.820]   I should, that looks like a birth control device.
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:36.820]   Are you sure?
[01:54:36.820 --> 01:54:37.820]   No!
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:40.420]   Well, if the lights are on, it could do it for me, Leo.
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:41.860]   So that's fine.
[01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:43.700]   But yeah, no, so it's just great.
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:46.220]   You can move it around once you recharge it, you can put it anywhere.
[01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:49.020]   So if you want to move around where you're using it, you want to take it outside with
[01:54:49.020 --> 01:54:50.020]   you.
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:51.020]   I might get one of those.
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:52.020]   That's neat.
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:53.020]   In my case, you want to shoot in different locations.
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:54.500]   You just get a few of these.
[01:54:54.500 --> 01:54:55.500]   Not the cheapest thing in the world.
[01:54:55.500 --> 01:55:01.020]   I forget what the price is in US American dollars, but really, really handy, and you
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:05.020]   can use them to color match or to change the lighting.
[01:55:05.020 --> 01:55:10.220]   And now $71.79 US.
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:13.820]   And what's cool is, like for other people, for example, you can get a home kid aware
[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:15.060]   sensors now.
[01:55:15.060 --> 01:55:18.620]   So if a motion sensor goes off, it could turn this light red as a warning or if a water
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:21.820]   sensor goes off, like you put it next to your water...
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:26.460]   Red as a warning in case you don't look at the phone notification.
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:29.620]   So it's really handy to have these sorts of things around these days because they become
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:32.620]   just one more part of your intelligent abode.
[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.620]   Do you need...
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:38.020]   Do you understand the hues no longer require the bridge or do they?
[01:55:38.020 --> 01:55:40.620]   I still believe they still do.
[01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:42.700]   I don't think each one of them is an access point yet.
[01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:43.700]   I still have a bridge.
[01:55:43.700 --> 01:55:44.700]   Okay.
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:48.180]   Well, I think the hope would be that it would use home kid or something, so you didn't
[01:55:48.180 --> 01:55:49.180]   have to have the bridge.
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:51.740]   Well, it does, but I mean, so there are trade-offs.
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:56.260]   If every one of them becomes a point, you start to run out of those points pretty quickly,
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:56:01.380]   but with the hue bridge is just one point, then the bridge coordinates with all the light bulbs.
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.380]   And you set up zones...
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:04.540]   Yeah, three hours is disappointing.
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:08.260]   If it had longer battery life, I think it would be really useful.
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:12.700]   Yeah, I mean, there's always a trade-off between size and battery life.
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:15.380]   And for me, I'm going to set it up and do some shoots and I'm going to go put it back
[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:16.380]   on it.
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:18.020]   And you can leave it, I believe you can use it while it's on its dock.
[01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:21.660]   So if you just have it on a TV or a bedside table or something, you're using it normally.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:25.220]   And then once in a while, you want to pick it up and take it outside on your patio or
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:28.340]   take it to where you want to shoot or do something and then put it back where you had it.
[01:56:28.340 --> 01:56:29.340]   I think that's the reason.
[01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:31.380]   It's kind of like the idea of just being able to take it out on the porch.
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:32.380]   Yeah.
[01:56:32.380 --> 01:56:33.380]   I feel like it's upside down.
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:34.380]   I think it's...
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:35.380]   Yeah.
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:37.100]   And I also think it would be a great kind of safety light.
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:41.500]   Like the power fails, you still have the...
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:44.740]   It's bigger, it's kind of like a serial goal.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:45.740]   Like a hole.
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:46.740]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:47.740]   It's bigger than I thought.
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:48.740]   I don't know.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:49.740]   I'm tempted.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:51.180]   I think this looks kind of cool.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:52.900]   How bright does it get?
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:53.900]   Is it just a blow?
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:56:54.900]   I have...
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:55.900]   I mean, it's...
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:57.540]   I'm not a judge.
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:57:01.740]   It goes fairly bright when you want it to.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:02.740]   Oh, they're using it.
[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:03.740]   I like this.
[01:57:03.740 --> 01:57:04.740]   They're using it to wake you up.
[01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:05.740]   Does it...
[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:06.740]   Can you slowly ramp it up?
[01:57:06.740 --> 01:57:07.740]   I think you can.
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:09.740]   I mean, that stuff is super cool.
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:10.740]   And they're also showing...
[01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:11.740]   I forget who it was for.
[01:57:11.740 --> 01:57:14.740]   I think it was for Nanoleaf, actually, not for Hugh, but they were showing the Nanoleaf
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:19.740]   wall at CES and how they bring the program movies into it so that if you have the Nanoleaf
[01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:21.740]   lights on, it'll start matching what's happening in the movie.
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:22.740]   So, like if the sunrise is coming up.
[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:24.740]   As long as you start getting those scripts ingested.
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:25.740]   Right.
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:26.740]   Yeah.
[01:57:26.740 --> 01:57:27.740]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:32.740]   And then you're going to be able to do that.
[01:57:32.740 --> 01:57:33.740]   I have to check.
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:35.740]   I did a test of that and that can be very arresting.
[01:57:35.740 --> 01:57:37.740]   Like I did a long time ago.
[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:40.740]   Because like the room feels like it's part of the...
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:42.740]   Well, it does.
[01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:44.740]   You just have to really...
[01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:48.220]   The attack in decay is super important because if you get a whole bunch of things changing
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:49.540]   the room, the room starts to...
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:51.040]   I had a lot of them and I...
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:52.040]   That's not a good idea.
[01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:53.040]   It was bad.
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.040]   It's shimmer.
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:55.040]   Correct.
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:56.040]   What a jumpscare will be like with a...
[01:57:56.040 --> 01:57:57.040]   What's the change of the op?
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:58.040]   That's three minutes later.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:59.040]   Ah!
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:03.040]   But yeah, so just leave it plugged in when you don't need it portable and then take it with
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:04.040]   the unit.
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:05.040]   I think it says some...
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:06.040]   I'm intrigued by this.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:07.920]   This is a little easier than my hues.
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:11.320]   I still have a bunch of bulbs because I don't really have anywhere good to put them.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:15.520]   I bought the hanging light now and I also got one of the insealing lights which are super
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:16.520]   bright.
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:20.040]   I saw this on Instagram.
[01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:22.760]   Actually, Lisa saw this on Instagram and I had to buy it.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.400]   It is an LED light that looks like fire.
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:26.400]   Nice.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:33.320]   And I have two sconces in my office that are kind of see through opaque so they kind of
[01:58:33.320 --> 01:58:34.320]   obscure it.
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.360]   This doesn't look like fire just by itself.
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:39.120]   When you put it behind the sconces, I feel like I'm in the Minecraft.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.120]   You know, I was not Jim Dallerimple by the way.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.120]   It is not Jim Dallerimple.
[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:43.120]   It is not Jim Dallerimple.
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.120]   It is.
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:45.120]   It looks like it.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:47.120]   I really like this.
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:48.120]   I've been...
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.120]   I've been...
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.120]   I need to know whether you like it or not.
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:51.120]   Come over to my house.
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:52.120]   I'll show you.
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:53.120]   I have been resisting the temptation to buy one because I get it on, you know, in...
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.120]   Yeah.
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:56.120]   I'm over and over and over and over.
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:57.840]   Should I get one of those?
[01:58:57.840 --> 01:58:59.680]   So that, it by itself is a bare bulb.
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:00.680]   I don't like it.
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:01.680]   Right.
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:04.640]   But boy, am I sconces where you can't quite see the detail?
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:08.480]   It looks just like I've got flames on my wall.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:11.240]   Do you recommend it's constant for you?
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:13.320]   I don't know where my sconces came from.
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:15.520]   They came with the house.
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:16.840]   But you know, what's there...
[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:19.880]   It kind of makes me want to get a bunch of those for my office.
[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:20.880]   Come over.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:21.880]   It looks like you're in a touch.
[01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:22.880]   It just looks like you're in a...
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:23.880]   Oh.
[01:59:23.880 --> 01:59:24.880]   That's awesome.
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:27.600]   But then if Leo extinguishes his leg survivor and you have to leave, it's very sad.
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:31.560]   I mean, our fireplace is pretty realistic looking, but it's even more than that.
[01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:32.560]   If we got some for...
[01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:33.560]   You know what?
[01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:34.560]   Maybe we'll put them in the studio.
[01:59:34.560 --> 01:59:35.560]   Torches.
[01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:36.560]   Torches Leo.
[01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:40.360]   Lisa got a couple and I stole them and now she wants more.
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:42.600]   These are the 12.99 each.
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:44.440]   They're not too expensive.
[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:45.600]   Those are the ones you got the lakes.
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:47.280]   I don't know which ones you got.
[01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.560]   I don't know which ones she got.
[01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:50.560]   These actually look pretty good.
[01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:51.560]   These lakes, they actually look more...
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:52.560]   Those are pretty cool.
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:54.560]   It's also the...
[01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:56.360]   The love is here.
[01:59:56.360 --> 01:59:58.200]   LED flame effect firebox.
[01:59:58.200 --> 01:59:59.200]   Two pecs.
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:01.720]   Two pecs for 15.99.
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:02.920]   You know, they're all made in China.
[02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:04.560]   They're all the same.
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:07.560]   Don't believe the picture.
[02:00:07.560 --> 02:00:10.680]   But they are LED so they should last a good long time.
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:11.680]   And put them in...
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:14.560]   Like if you put them in a teaky torch, you'd never know the difference.
[02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:15.720]   You really wouldn't.
[02:00:15.720 --> 02:00:16.720]   All right.
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:17.720]   That's my second pick.
[02:00:17.720 --> 02:00:19.720]   The person on the actual pick.
[02:00:19.720 --> 02:00:21.440]   It was a warning and I'll pick.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:22.440]   That's right.
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:25.840]   I'm really picking that because I didn't want to make it pregnant.
[02:00:25.840 --> 02:00:26.840]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:29.920]   We do Mac break weekly every Tuesday, right after our iOS today.
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:32.240]   Usually around 11, 11, 30, Eastern time...
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:33.760]   Pacific time, I'm sorry.
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:41.880]   That's 2 or 2, 30 Eastern time, which would be roughly 18, let's see, 8 hours, 19, 1930.
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:46.840]   UTC, if you want to stop by and watch, you can at YouTube, Twitch, YouTube stream.
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:50.200]   Actually, you know the easiest is just go to our website, twitter.tv/live.

[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:57.520]   You can even pop it out and continue on with your business as you have the show in the
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:58.520]   background.
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:03.240]   But your business might want to include our chatroom, irc.twitch.tv.
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:08.440]   That's a great place to be as you're watching the show and we like having you there.

[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:13.640]   three groups.

[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:39.920]   You'll get a piping hot and fresh out of the oven every Tuesday afternoon.
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:40.920]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:42.680]   Now my friends get back to work.
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.240]   It's a great time.
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:45.040]   It's over.
