[00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.400]   So, of course, the show is much longer
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.000]   because we just had fun talking about all sorts of things.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.500]   We will be waiting to see if the Mac Pro comes out during this show.
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.000]   And we might find out who bought that product red Mac Pro
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   and the gold earbuds.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500]   Stay tuned. Mac Break Weekly is next.

[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   A jam-packed program starting in Liverpool,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   the northernmost visitor today, Don McAllister from ScreenCastsOnline.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Happy Holidays. Mary Yule Tide, Don.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Happy Holidays to you too.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Thank you.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Good to be here.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Liverpool seems a good place to have Christmas.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Yeah, it's not bad.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I mean, sometimes you do get snow, but normally it's just cold and damp sometimes.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   But it's a damn good place.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   That's what I'm looking for.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Anything cold and damp.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Andy Inaco got some snow, I think, yesterday.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Did you not, Mr. Inaco?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Our pro-ordered delivery of Slush arrived on Sunday.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   We're getting more snow tonight and tomorrow.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   As such, my errands this morning included, okay, maybe,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   maybe another three bushels of firewood just in case.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Maybe a couple of days worth of food and provisions and anything that any project
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   that I mean to do around the house, just in case I can't leave for about 36 hours,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   maybe tomorrow is the day I will be taking apart the toilet and the guest bedroom
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and replacing that dried out flange that I've been meaning to get to for the past.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Wow.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   That's what you do when you, when you're housebound.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Well, not necessarily housebound.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   But, you know, it gets icy enough that if you are self-employed and you have the option of,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   you know, where I'm out of soda, I guess I don't have to get soda today.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And if you want to, and if there's, and if there are things that you would be meaning to burn
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   a cold winter day where it's just still like icy outside,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   a good day to consider burning those things.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Although there was that time last year where I lost power, the heater is electric
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and it was eight degrees over the ice.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Ever since then, I make sure that I have at least a volume of wood about this big.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I'm ready to go at all times.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's an afternoon in the park with Andy.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Yes.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   We also have Renee Richie from Montreal, our second most northern visitor.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I want to apologize to Andy for the snow.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Dalrymple and I were cleaning our porches and they didn't think you'd travel that far.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   He's swept too hard.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Is Dalrymple live up your way?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   He's a Nova Scotia, so he's an e-chair.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   I'm sure he's going to be in the park.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Yeah, it should have been.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It should be...
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   With a guy named Dolly?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   The Dolly Llama.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Wow.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Of course, I was only going to watch.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Now, it's not his first hangout.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   He did a hangout in 2011.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   2011, 2011.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   But he hosted a Google Hangout.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I think it was hosted by Anderson Cooper.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   That is just wild.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   That is just wild.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Definitely worth checking out.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   No, this one is...
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Oh, no, this is the old one.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   If you go to YouTube.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I see here, Anderson Cooper hosting...
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   CNN ounces News.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Anderson Cooper hosting a Google Hangout.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Wow.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Wow, wow, wow.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   That is neat.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And it was regarding...
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   No, this is the old one again.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I hear...
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   No, this is it.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And Richard Branson.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Wow.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   I thought that Mary Roberts...
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   For the hangout to promote Assassin's Guild V.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   You're in exactly...
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   See, that's why I was confused.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Well, you know, I...
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Oh, there you go.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   So this was remembering Anderson Mandela.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Wow.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Wow, that must have been amazing.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Where was that done in India?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Or I think it was Paul all over.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   So, oh, yeah.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   From what I've heard.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   He has no idea, folks.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   He has no idea.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   It's a pretty cool hangout.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I would definitely suggest you watch it.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   We have so much trouble with Skype.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   We just had to recall Renee.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So we'll be using Google Hangouts for this show.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I think that for what...
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   The way it's run here, I'm not totally certain that...
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That Hangouts will be the...
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Because you have an individual connection with each person.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Really the answer to...
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Hangouts for the group calling.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You want to have one screen that has a whole bunch of people in it.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   That's particularly useful.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   The thing that would probably be more useful for this would be WebRTC.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   So WebRTC is a point-to-point solution.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It takes a little bit of work to tie non-web cameras.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   But you're using web cameras on those ones anyway,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   so you could definitely pass it back.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   But WebRTC is a...
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   That's what I'm interested in.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Now, Google Hangouts use...
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   The codec is video, which we had...
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   We tried.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   We're not getting great results with...
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Well, the codec now is for Hangouts.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   But RTC is VBA.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Yeah, so it's not...
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It still says when you use Hangouts...
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Video.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Yeah, because there's a partnership there.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   They've announced that.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   There's a partnership between video and video or whatever.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I don't know if you want to...
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   They want you to say video, but the problem is it's filled with a Y.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Why would you want to just call your name?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   You call your company...
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   And video.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Yeah, so it's like me calling ourselves podcast with a Y.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Yeah, it's for something.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   So...
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Yeah, but it's got a Y.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   No, you can't see.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So the answer to...
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   The question is, why can't you just do multiple one-on-one Hangouts?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And you totally could.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It's just that I don't think that you get...
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Well, you just don't get the same...
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I don't think that you don't get the same quality.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We do that with Jeff Jarvis because he refuses to use a real computer.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   He insists on using a Chromebook.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   And so we have to do that because it can't Skype on a Chrome.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Right, but I would say that Skype is not getting any better and the Hangout quality is getting
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   much better over very quickly.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So I think that there could be a time when...
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Oh, yeah, because Skype's getting worse, frankly.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   But when you look at a well-set-up system, so a good example is Andy and Aco.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   That is a webcam, right?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Yeah, that's over Skype.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Oh, we're Skype.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Roger Technum 20.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I was recommended by Mr. Alex Lindsay.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   But that's a solid computer.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And really the only webcams to own at this point are the Logitech ones, the 910, 92930.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I just got a 930, which the only thing different about as far as I know is it's got a cap now,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   so it's just great.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Anyway, but a good connection, a good computer, and a webcam is, in my opinion, broadcast quality.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I mean, Andy's image has gotten...
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Isn't it great?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Every time I look at it, I'm like, "I cannot believe you."
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And Renee's is close to it.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   You're using it pretty much a similar...
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Andy was terrible for a while.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   We threw money at it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And I haven't figured out what the difference is.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   So Andy's is just a little bit higher quality than Renee's, even though you're using...
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Renee's in Montreal.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   He's using Rogers.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   That's the...
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Oh, it's definitely it.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   So when I paid for the ban with upgrade, it really comes down to number one, make sure that nothing is running Dropbox or Netflix anywhere in the house.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And also, whatever it is, the best thing that your service can give you, get it.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Or when you actually call the people and say, "I'm looking at the chart, is there something better than the top thing you're offering?"
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Because it's often that they won't put...
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   They won't put it on the list, but, "Okay, we could give you 500 if you want.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I want it."
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Thank you.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   That would be a image in it.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Well, and it's a very...
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   What do you like?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   We have swords.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   We also have the magical flaming swords of instant death.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   That's what we have.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   That's what we have.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I want to be mad at it.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I want to be mad at it.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   You can flaming and deliver death.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I think I would like that.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   That's next to $12.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   It really comes down to the SLA service level agreements.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And most ISPs have no...
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   They have no quality agreement.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   In fact, Netflix just came out.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   They do this every month with bandwidth measurements.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Because they nobody knows better than Netflix.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   What you're actually getting.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   That's actually getting...
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   That's actually getting...
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   That's the problem from a Skype perspective.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I understand.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.600]   But if you look at what the Netflix numbers are, it's a lot less than you'd think.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.000]   The number one...
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   So now they're in the Netherlands.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Do you have Netflix in the UK?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Yeah, we do.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   It's only recently actually that they've...
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   You know, sort of become more well-known.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   But yeah, we certainly have Netflix now.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Yeah, on Apple TV and on my Tivo box.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So the average speed in the UK, the highest speed is Virgin.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   The lowest speed is Talk Talk.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   The average speed is not bad.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   2.48 megabits.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Now, you...
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   No.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   This is a really important thing to note.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   But we would not...
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   They will say 20 megabits.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   But you will not get that speed.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   It will not get you the quality that you're getting that you're seeing with Andy.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   On a Skype connection.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Well, but that's download.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   We don't know what the upload is.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   But generally if the upload is...
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   The upload is going to be less than that.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Yes, we'll be less than that.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Look at the US.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Again, this is Netflix.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   This is prime-time performance when everybody else is using it.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Google fiber, the fastest in the US.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Not a surprise.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   But that's only 3.5.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I'm wondering whether that's measured based on what Netflix is using for streaming.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   That's sustained throughput.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   But my thing is that that might be all...
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Because the Google fiber is much faster than that.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I mean, it's...
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Well, but that's the point is...
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   But I'm saying that might be all...
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   All of these are.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I Comcast gives me 50 megabits down.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   But it's all bursty, right?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   So sustained is a lot harder to do.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And they're averaging 1.8 megabits.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   But I get better.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   No, you think you get better.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   That's my point.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   These guys know.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   But I'm wondering whether that's the scale of...
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Let's see what Canada is.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Do you have Canada?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Do you have a...
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Yeah, they keep complaining because our caps are so low that people can blow through Netflix
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   in a couple hours.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Yeah, no way.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Mexico.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   No, you're not even on the list.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I was talking to somebody in a...
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   We were doing an event in Kansas City.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And I said, "So is the Google fiber really that fast?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I mean, are you really getting a gigabit?"
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And he's like, "Oh, no.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   We never get faster than 930 megs."
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Aww.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Aww.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Aww.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Now, I do suppose that Netflix at some point caps out.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   But it's a higher cap than I thought if they get up to 3.5.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   The point is, if Google fiber is getting 3.5 megabits, everybody is getting less than that
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   and is not getting as much as they could be getting.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   In other words, those are real maximums.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I don't know if Google fiber maximum is a true maximum because that might be...
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   That's the max that Netflix can use.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Right, I think that might be the max that Netflix can use.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   It's a pretty...
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   That's a lot of...
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Well, if you go to the Neterlands, the highest average speed...
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   It's a 3.5.8, which is...
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   3.5.8.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   So, yeah, maybe it is nice.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   You see it everything maxing out in the 3.5.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   It might be what Netflix actually uses for...
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It's Korea.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Terabit.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   But like, for instance, when we're doing Hangouts, we require almost everybody that's on a high
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   profile Hangout to have a 5 megabit up and down connection.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Like, test it on...
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   SLA, though.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   I mean, that's the problem is...
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   When they sell it to you, it's always maximum.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   We don't need 5 megabits, but we require...
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   As much as...
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   As high as...
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Right.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So, you know, once in your life, it's...
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   I'm quite tempted actually to get Nip across the room and get my Logitech webcam and hook
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   there up because I feel like the second class citizen here is stuck in this little 4x3 box.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   You look terrible.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And you look washed out and...
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   What are you using?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   You're probably using a Macintosh.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   It's the...
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   It's...
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   This year's Resinama Pro.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   So, I'm just using the web...
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   You would think that would be at least as good as a Logitech.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And what's your bandwidth?
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   I see 9.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   10.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   I think your bandwidth...
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   I'm going to 100 meg...
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   You should go get a watch down and see how it turns out.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Nip across the room.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Yeah, go ahead while we're talking.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   I don't think you'll hang up the call.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   You can just transfer.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   While we're talking about bandwidth and stuff like that, don't also don't deny...
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   I get asked this question a lot.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Don't deny the effect of spending, like, all of $150 on an actual light.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   A light helps?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   A light helps?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   People don't understand that you don't have good lighting.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   And so, your camera has to increase the gain in order to...
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   You're not getting good skin tone because...
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Or you're using whatever lights coming off your...
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Well, and maybe screen is probably going to be blue.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Yeah, and the other thing is, is that when you have low light, it increases the gain.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   When you increase the gain, you increase the grain.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   And when you increase the grain, it's a higher requirement on the...
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Your actual megabits per second required to get a good image is actually higher.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   So, you're saying no gain more grain?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   No, you...
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Nog?
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   That's good.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   You did it right on the...
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Bam!
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Bam!
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Boom!
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   So anyway, so, yeah.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   But you want to have as much light as that camera needs.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And you're going to have low grain, which will be higher.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Now, someone asked about...
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Yeah, I don't really care if this is a Logitech commercial because I got to tell you...
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   I really wish everyone...
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I really wish everyone...
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I really wish everyone up the game.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I buy every webcam that's sold in Amazon.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Like, I own every single one of them.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   You know, because we always think that there's going to be a new one that's going to be better than...
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   You know, I don't even bother with the ones that are less than 30 bucks because I know they're not going to get there.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   But all the ones above that, I'm buying them trying to find ones that are as good as a Logitech.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Because a Logitech's are pretty expensive, but nobody's even close.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   So, the 910 is actually the best quality image, but they don't make them anymore.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   They do H.264 compression on the 920 and the 930, which smooths out some of the skin tones.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   But the advantage of the 920 and the 930 is better pan and tilt if you have the controls through webcam settings.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And they have a quarter 20 mount so you can mount them to tripods.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Anyway.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   But which one's going to work best with a Mac Pro?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Definitely the...
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Well, if you want to put it on a tripod, 920.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I...
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   We got all excited, John Slimia, that night.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And the 930 is the one.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   He was prepared to go down to the Apple Store this morning and purchase a Mac Pro for today's show.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   In fact, he even got up several times in the middle of the night to check the Apple Store for a Mac Pro.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And we owe it all to 9-5 Mac, which lied to us.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   They were suckered like it was worse.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   You know what's worse?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   What?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I have an entire set built.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Waiting for a Mac Pro.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Waiting for a Final Cut Pro.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Like, we built a whole Mac Break video, or Mac Break studio.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   We built a whole live set just in case they were released today.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   What?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   So, like, we were going to go breaking news.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   I was ready.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Well, you know, we have Mark Spencer.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   We've got Steve Martin.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   These are the guys that...
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   They are the Final Cut Wizards.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Wizards.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And so we were going to like...
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   We're going to be ready.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And...
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   So you two were fooled by that.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And I even called Mark and I was like, "Should I be ready for it on Tuesday?"
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   He's like, "I don't know."
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   He doesn't even know.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   He says, "I have no idea."
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And Apple doesn't tell me anything.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   It was almost heartbreaking.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I was working until about three or four in the morning last night.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And the same thing that happened at like 1201 East Coast time happened at like 301 West Coast time.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   There was like suddenly a flurry of like tweets from people I know saying, "Oh, right.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I guess I'm going to go to bed now, another day."
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Now this 1205 and the store hasn't changed.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Like, you were waiting.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   You were up until midnight on the off chance of the...
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Be for sale today.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   It's like, this is why like, Dell and Lenovo are shooting themselves.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Because when was the last time that anybody waited up past lunchtime to buy one of their products?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   But it still could be this week.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Well, okay.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   So here is the reasoning.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   First of all, there was some bad rumor site that published a picture of a Mac Pro from the Mac Pro announcement back in June.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And it looked like it was at an Apple store because it was on Blondwood.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It was next to a cinema display.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And everybody picked it up and said, "Some Apple stores are already displaying their Mac Pro.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   Then we found out the picture was a fake and nobody knew anything."
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   But as they did point out, Tuesday is not correct me.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Is this correct?
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   They said Tuesday is typically the day that new hardware appears.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   It's typically the day you release everything.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   I mean, new...
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Why?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Why?
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   No, I can tell you.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Except for Wednesday and Thursday?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   So you release new albums, new everything on Tuesdays.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   I mean, so the reason you do Tuesdays is because it gives you the most number of press weekdays.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Without making everybody work on Sunday to prepare for it.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   So you want everyone to come in on Monday to be able to do all the final little bits and pieces.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And then on Tuesday, it gives you four days of press before you go to the weekend.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   So that's why they do so many launches on Friday then.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Because they're crazy.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Craycray.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Because they're saying I don't care.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Because with the Mac Pro, they don't need any press because who cares?
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   But typically, but it's very, very typical for...
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   You'll see almost every album release, everything else is always on.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   But the Friday releases typically have reviews go live on Tuesday anyway.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   So you still get the week of press building up to the release.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I'm thinking that we're going to see it the last week in December.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   I don't see any reason for Apple to release it anytime this week.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   They're going to lose next week anyway because of the holiday.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   So now I'm guessing they're going to say why bother.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Let's just get more of those containerships putting more of this product into the pipeline because there's going to be demand.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   It's a long drive from Texas.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   We're going to leave our set up all week.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   I forgot they're being sublimated.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   I would leave your set up because don't you want to ship before Christmas because maybe on the off-gen somebody would buy one for Christmas?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Now there's a spoiled kid.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Here Freddy.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   I bought you an $8,000 Mac Pro for the...
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   What the hell is that?
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   He has everything.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   I want a Mac Pro.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   I know you're getting tired of your pony so I thought I'd get you a Mac Pro.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Give me the red one, Daddy.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   You're the red one.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   It went to red one.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   It was Mac rumors that had the story and they immediately posted, you know, "Build it as a fake," but it got everybody excited.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   It was a real picture.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   It just wasn't from where people said it was from.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Right.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Well, as if someone's going to smuggle out a picture like that, that kind of made me think that...
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I didn't know whether or not I was going to ship on Tuesday, but if that was the reason why someone was going to blow...
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   That seemed like exactly the sort of picture that you would not see because of anybody.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   This is the...
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Reputively the Bromley store in the United Kingdom.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Where is Bromley?
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Bromley is down south somewhere.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Somewhere down there.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   So by the way, Don, is...
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Did you change cameras?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Yeah, I've gone on to the other camera.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Oh, you're clear.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   It's nicer.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   It's still a little washed out.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   We got to saturate.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   No, no, I don't know what that is, but that's...
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Are you using a 920?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Yes, it is, yeah.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Yeah, the 920 has a much more sensitive autofocus than the 910.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   So if you tilt down just a little bit so that you're a little bit more in frame...
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   It'll go for Don.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   It'll just stay...
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   If you drop out of the middle of that, the 920 is super sensitive to...
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It'll start focusing on the rack in the back.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Yes, it does this little breathing thing that we...
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   That's why we like the 910.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Can you use the Webcam Settings app to adjust that?
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Yes, so if you have Webcam Settings, you can adjust color and you can also lock its focus.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   You have that, Alan.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Webcam Settings for everyone is a $7 app for the Mac or $8 app for the Mac that takes over your Mac.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And with the 910 and 920, it can actually manage zoom, pan and tilt, and zoom inside of the application, which is kind of cool.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Excellent.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   WebCams, go ahead and download that while we're taking the time.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   This is my...
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Sorry.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And I have to admit, I...
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   He knows a little bit about this.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   One thing we know a lot about is WebCams with people that aren't in the office.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   We have a crew that processes 50 to 100 people a week.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Is that what's going on in the basement there?
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Because it looks like you use the conveyor belt for something.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   That's 205.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Okay.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   The basement just sends out kits when they don't have what they need.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   So they process the kits.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   We're going to send...
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   There's a whole lot of...
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   You look great and then there's a...
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   We're going to send you a box of stuff.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   You know, it's a nice way of saying...
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   You can grab Yellen Drum.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   You're going to need someone to sign for it.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   It will contain Internet.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Just get the hose right from the computer into that because it can't be worse than what you've got.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And this just in, here's Bromley.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   C910, by the way.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   It is in Greater London.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   I told you it was down south somewhere.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Everything in New London.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I don't even know where that is.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I have to trust the Google plugin.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Trust it.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   It's hardly no.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   It's the one behind it now, Leo.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Look at there it is.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   Brom...
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Now we're back at Twit.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   I want to go to Bromley.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   All right.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   There it is.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   I think Logitech makes Windows 920 controls, but I don't know how to use them.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   And they don't make Apple controls.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   No, but Webcam settings works on all of them.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Can you see the Mac Pro in the street?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   I'm looking to see if maybe Street View will have the Mac.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Let's just look.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Maybe you see someone just extending his middle finger to every Mac person in the world who
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   is staying up until now.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   He's now groggy today.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Dragged it to the map.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   And now let's see what's going on in beautiful Bromley.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Well, last...
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Apparently we're in an alley right now.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And let's look around.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   No, I see no Mac Pros in the alley.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   I suddenly feel a need to pee, however.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   I don't know how I got in this alley, but I want out.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Oh, well, I'm telling you, I can't...
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Get yourself and respond.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   That's how it always works.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   I responded an alley.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   I actually have money saved up for this Mac Pro.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Now I'm thinking I'm going to buy...
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   I have a new space saved up for a whole bunch of them.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   You have a set saved up for a Mac Pro.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   We need for watching DC as it is.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   We have seen, according to somebody, build to order numbers.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   It got a while ago.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Those have leaked out a little bit.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   I mean, because we're trying to figure out, you know, we know that it's $29.99 for the base unit.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Is that right? Did I say that right?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   It's around $10 grand for the...
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   $2999 for the base unit.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   And then there's a one up that's $3,999.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   But then we've seen...
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I'm trying to find the link.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Do you have the link in here, Chad?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   For the BTO, um, prices...
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   I think you can find it at Apple still.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   I think this was a... I thought this was a leak.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Apple's telling us?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   It's like...
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   It had all that...
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   It had RAM and all of that stuff.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   No?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Yeah, I think the business...
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   The Apple business units have been reaching out to customers that they think...
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Exactly.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   They reach out stores and they've been sort of doing quotations for them based on, you know,
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   built-to-order machines.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Yeah, this is from MacRumors.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   But I don't think there's an official page yet.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Renee Richie's looking at...
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I'm looking at...
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   King of Rumors.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   I saw them somewhere.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   This is from MacRumors.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   They're saying, for upgrades beyond the $3,999 high-end stock version,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   this is what they're guessing based on what they've heard from these business quotes.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   The eight core three gigahertz add $1,500.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Oh, yeah, the 12 core.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   12 core add $3,000.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   You can go...
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   The high-end stock...
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   This is the high-end one, not the low-end.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   The low-end uses AMD FirePro D300.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   The high-end uses dual AMD FirePro D500s.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   If you want to go to the $700, add $600.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   That's a deal.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   But I have to admit, like...
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   There's a lot of things that you can do with this.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   You don't have to load it up.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   Like for what we're going to use them for, we may even buy the low-end one.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   It's probably going to be a low-end one.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   I'm probably going to get a couple of those.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Because I'm using it as my home theater PC.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   So, for the Hangouts.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Ram stock ram in the low-end is 12 gigs in the high end of 16 gigs.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   It will be to double that $400.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Does that sound...
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   That's about right for Apple.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Actually, that's pretty good for Apple.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   16 gigs of ram for 400 bucks.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   That's not bad.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   That's DDR3 EEC RAM.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   And if you want to increase the hard drive, it's stock hard drive is a 256 gigabyte.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   By the way, these are PCI Express based, which means they're really smoking.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Welcome.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   512, $300 a terra by $800.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   So...
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   [Laughs]
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   If you want an 8-core Mac Pro with 32 gigs of RAM, 512 gigs of storage,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   you'd get your base $4,000 plus upgrades to yield a total price of $6,199.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   You know how much my Mac, 2C, I cost?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   I know.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   $6,000.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   I know.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   So, you think what you're getting?
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   It's a deal.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   That was back when it was real money.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   That was my education fund.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Instead of going to college, I bought a Mac, a 2C.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   It was a good investment.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Wow.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   If you had a college education, you'd still have that.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   [Laughs]
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   That's the only difference.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   The 2C.I.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   A couple of years later is like that.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   See you later.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   I made a lot of business with that.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Of course, you would have forgotten everything you learned by now.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Exactly.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   So, just you would have a piece of paper.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   The $2,999 base model, the one we're getting.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Quad-core Xeon, 12 gigs of RAM.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   That's a lot of computer for $3,000.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   Dual D300 graphics.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And it's round.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   They're all right.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   I got over the round thing.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   What do you think is going to be about ventilation?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Can you upgrade RAM?
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Yes.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I mean, you don't have to be to upgrade the RAM.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   You could do that later, right?
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   I realized when we were watching the net, this is kind of like the second generation cube,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   right?
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   It's kind of like the cube and then we figured out what we did wrong.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   The cube done right.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Instead of having --
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Instead of having four sides.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   This has infinite sides.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   But you cannot make an aquarium out of it.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Yes.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   You could.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   When they transparent aluminum ships.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   You want a transparent case for this thing because it looks so much like Vader without his helmet.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   You've got to get a little sound effect there.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   It just looks so good.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Is transparent aluminum available now or is that just something people talk about?
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Could you theoretically get an aluminum transparent?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Could Johnny I make you a transparent aluminum?
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   If I ask Johnny nicely --
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Why couldn't we just use pucks across?
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Aluminum.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   All right.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   That's the Mac news.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   We had four K display on the Apple Store.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   What?
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   It was a sharp 4K display.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   They actually put on the Apple Store and then they took it down after 24 hours or so.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   I'm interested in wondering was that a mistake or were they going to release it at the same time as the Mac Pro and then the Mac Pro has been delayed so they've taken it down again.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   But I think it might have dispelled any sort of inkling that I had that they might bring out their own tin and display the fact that they've got a sharp one in the wings waiting to pop onto the Apple Store.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   They've got to have some 4K solution.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Right?
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   All right.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Yes.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   I think that I mean I think the one thing we're going to see in CES which is coming right around the corner is I think CES is going to be 4K.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   4K.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   It is all the way that all we're going to see is 4K.

[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Let's go look at Max here.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   The 30 day quote is good now because I don't even know what processor I have on this.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   I got the 3.3.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Okay.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Let's do this.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Well, that's the high end.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Of course you do.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   In fact, I just picked the top of the line for everything for you.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Let's get an offer on your 3.3.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Is it in flawless condition because it's been under your desk for the last four years.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   True.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And then you choose the hard drive.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   It's a little more complicated for the Mac Pros because you got all sorts of specs.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   If you just want to say, "Hey, I have an iPhone 5 and I want to get a new, I just bought my daughter a 5C."
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   She didn't want the 5S.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   She said, "I want the color one."
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   C or S?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   C.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   My daughter doesn't know.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   That's your daughter?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   That's Hannah.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Hi, Hannah.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Wow.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   Visiting.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   That's nice.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Happy holidays, Hannah.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   I've heard a lot about you.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Alex says you're brilliant.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   But he's your dad, so what does he know?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   No, he's given me evidence proof.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   See, the smartest people know about Gazelle.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   They go there.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   They don't keep their gadgets until they are completely worthless.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   They get rid of them promptly on Gazelle and get top dollar to it for it too.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Here's your iPhone.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Easy as well to upgrade.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Look at this.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Now, this is interesting.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Now, they're going to give you a little more time through January 16th.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Oh, that's a month, right?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   To send in your phone.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   If you have an AT&T locked phone, $205.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   If it's unlocked $255, you'll earn more.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   And you can unlock it for them.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   See, they tell you how.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   So, that's...
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   See, Gazelle is on your side.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   That's what I like.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   One you start using Gazelle.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   You start thinking about it all the time.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Like, I take much better care of my electronics because I'm like, well, then I'm going to get Gazelle.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Save the box, save the cable.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Blackberries, they'll buy those.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   HTCs, they'll buy those.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   LGs, Samsung devices, of course.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Got a Galaxy S3.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Want to go to the S4?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   You got an iPad, third generation, ready for the new iPad?
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Here's the deal.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   None of this stuff is gaining in value.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   It's all getting less worth...
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Worth less over time.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   So, it's getting more worth less.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   But the worth is getting less.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Not more.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   No gain.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   All grain.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   So, here's the deal.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Go to Gazelle.com and get cash.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Now you can get a check.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   You can get a PayPal credit.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   But if you're an Amazon buyer, get the Amazon gift card, because they'll bump it up 5% to give you back the Amazon affiliate rebate.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   I love Gazelle.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   You will too.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Good time of the year to get rid of the old.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Bring out the old, bring in the new.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Get a little cash while you're doing it.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Gazelle.com.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Yes, as is our tradition, after we do an ad, we run an ad.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   In this case, it's an Apple ad.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   The Apple ad, they said, will make you cry.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Let's see.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Everybody got your hankies?
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   [laughter]
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   There's going to be a lot of salt damage in that undercarriage, because they usually over salt those roads in the back.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   They don't like to run the whole...
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   They're home for the holidays.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   They drove up in their Subaru.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Oh, Grandpa gave him a hug again.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   He always does that.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   This kid's not happy.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   You could tell he's depressed.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   He keeps looking.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   He's just a teenager.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   He's looking at his iPhone the whole time.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   Can't wait to go home to his girlfriend.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Oh, yeah, get involved.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   My kids are never like this.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   He's checking the sales of his app on the App Store, finding out whether they're taking the entire family to Hawaii or to your...
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   They just sold it to Yahoo.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   This is cute, though.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   And the teenager's finally showed up.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   You tell so.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Oh, what's he been up to?
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   Teenager.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Made a movie.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   This iPhone.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   This whole time we thought he was texting his girlfriend.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   Oh, I am a slow motion.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   That hat.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   So we're seeing from the teenager's point of view all the shots that we saw.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   That's nice.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   He loves the slow motion feature.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   That's like the star white but it doesn't mean...
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Everybody.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   ♪ Hanging the shining stars upon the highest ♪
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   See, we love the teenager after all.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   He made Grandma cry.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   You're not such a loser.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   We thought you were a loser.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   See, emo kids.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   No.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Not all bad.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   This is one slide.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Only had was an iPhone and a dream.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   The truth is, it's a complete fantasy because you know the kid was not making a movie with text.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   His girlfriend and being a...
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Did I see holidays?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   That's a little harder.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   You're about to be visited by three spirits.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   I know teenagers.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   No, that's a sweet movie.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   See in that video because in the shot where you actually get the sock thrown at him,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   he actually has the iPhone in portrait mode.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   The whole time, by the way, is right.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   Yeah, well, I went back over that because that really irritated me.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   He's not shooting it.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   If you look...
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   He's hitting it when you see him.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Yeah, look, he's, you know, he's texting.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   He's not taking a videoing.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   It also indicates that at the time he was shooting video of his knees and the guy interrupting him by throwing a sock at him.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   See?
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   No, wait.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Is he shooting a video of the snowman?
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   He's working.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   He's working on it.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Oh, he's editing.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   He's editing.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   I'm busy editing.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   He's already in post.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   He's editing.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   He's in post.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Alright, let's watch the sock scene very closely.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Okay, no, no, no.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   I think he infected, shoot the sock.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Let's go back and see that instant.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Replace slow motion.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Is there an instant repair roll in the back?
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   Yeah, no, see, I think we can conclude safely that he did, in fact, shoot the sock.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Shoot the...
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Shoot the sock.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Shoot the sock.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   Shoot the shuttle.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Shoot the shot.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Shoot the sock.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Shoot the sock.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Don't forget to shoot the sock shot.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Actually, that is a sweet ad.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   It is also a minute and a half, which means it will never err on any television network I know.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   It did last night on Fox.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   They ran a minute and a half ad.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   They bought a...
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   Chitching.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   That's money.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Well, the problem is that Apple just doesn't have that kind of money to throw around.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   I mean, that's really the challenge for them.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   You know, it's just the other thing, and this is really more important.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   I think this is what you were saying.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   He's shooting everything in portrait, not landscape.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Well, I don't think he's...
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   He's editing.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   He's editing.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Yeah, you can only...
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   There's only one shot in the whole video where...
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Which is reflected in the final thing, and that's when the sock hits him.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And if you look closely at that frame, he has got the camera in portrait mode.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   By the way, you don't ever shoot with your iPhone in the portrait mode.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Now, I have a different opinion.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I believe that you are speaking from an old aesthetic, that old landscape aesthetic that
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   goes back to the days of landscape paintings.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Have you ever seen the portrait in YouTube?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Have you seen the portrait in YouTube?
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   We live in a portrait...
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Well, that's YouTube's fault.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   We live in a portrait mode world.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   That is...
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   You are going back to...
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   No, I think it's a good development because it didn't make sense a couple of generations
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   ago, where every time in movies, the way that the director would communicate, the point of view of this shot is someone looking through binoculars about having two cutouts.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Are you communicating?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   So now the new language is...
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   This is how we know this was shot on our phone.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Shot vertically.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   But more than that, you have an excellent point, aesthetically and an untetical point, you're absolutely correct.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   I just want to give you a warning that the first 800 people who pointed out that you can't use the word "wonderful" because where you actually flip the point of the wondered scene.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Are you in wonder, seeing that?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   It was fine for the first few hundred times, but after the after times, you're just one of these people who's saying, you know, those tomatoes shouldn't be in the vegetable aisle.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   (laughter)
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   So it should be, technically they're berries, like...
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Okay.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   I am that guy also.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, an argument. I will be out-argued now by a chimp.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   (laughter)
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   (music)
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   There's a picture of John Goodman on the wall. Wait a minute.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   This video didn't have to look this way. It could have been prevented.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Say no to vertical videos.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   That's a beaver.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Vertical videos happen when you hold your camera the wrong way.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Your video will end up looking like crap.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   (laughter)
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   There are more and more people addicted to making vertical videos every day.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   It's not cracking nothing, but it's still really bad.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   (laughter)
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   There are two different kinds of people who are afflicted with VVS.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   The first group treats the videos they shoot like pitches.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   They don't mean any harm.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   They just don't stand up while you can turn a picture.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Some grandparent who has their first really good phone and they're so proud showing their nephew.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Here's the shot that I shot.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   I think you showed how much I love you.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Grandma, you shouldn't have held the camera that way.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   You have VVS, Grandma, vertical videos, syndrome.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   But I'm going to be a fine man.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   But don't photographers all the time show sideways?
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   No, I had a friend who went with me to Africa and he's a photographer.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   He was shooting video and he had the camera turn sideways.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   He had this great frame of this in mirror player playing in the middle of the desert.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And he's like, "Look at this shot."
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And I was like, "That's going to look great as long as everyone can turn their TV sideways."
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   All I'm going to say is that all of the video that everybody watches in the movie, 2001,
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   is shot in portrait mode.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   So if you want to say that not only Stanley Kubrick, but future Stanley Kubrick is an idiot,
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   you know more than he does, well fine.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   I'll look at his version of Clockwork Orange and you can show me your version of Clockwork Orange
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   and yours is going to be so much better.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   By the way, that video, vertical video PSA has been watched by 4 million people.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   It's from the Glove & Boots video channel, the puppet channel, and it's a good YouTube channel.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Love and Boots.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Well played.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Nicely done.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   I just should be.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Not as good as the wrecking ball chat.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   That's a good one too.
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   That's a good one too.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   I can't get that out of my mind.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   Kids do not ride a wrecking ball naked.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   We should do a PSA.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Well, actually you could do a PSA, but it turns out that that is worth 76 million views.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   But actually the more important message though is that especially in the winner, make sure
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   you heat up that wrecking ball.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   If you send a lot of rattle, that's going to be great.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Wrecking ball chat roulette.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Wrecking ball chat.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Can I show it on the...
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Yeah, you can show it.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   It's on YouTube.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   I'll take my headphones off and kind of look at you.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   You know, having stuff on Root YouTube no longer...
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   There you go.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Yeah, there's no...

[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Stuff gets on you.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   84 million views of this.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Oh, 84 now.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   There was like 70 million yesterday.

[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   So this is an actual chat roulette.

[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Can you do that?
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   So you took...
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   You took portrait and turned it into a landscape.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   You could just zoom in.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   What really should happen is there should be a way on the phone to lock it into landscape,
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   no matter what.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   So you could hold it up like this.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   Because there's plenty of resolution on the camera.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   I...
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   You took a capture of the complaint if you tried to shoot in portrait.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   I've seen complaints.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Youtubers complain?
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   No, you took a portrait.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   The app...
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   The app says...
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Are you sure you want to shoot this in portrait mode?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   Yeah, on the YouTube capture app, it won't let you.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   If you have it up in portrait, it'll say, "No, the record button's gone."
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   That's a little bit fashistic.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Wait till they...
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   Like I said, wait till they have Boston dynamic robots to enforce this Leo.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   No, they're saying...
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   I was really surprised there for a second.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   I bet you, if you do look at that video closely, I bet you that shot is in low res as well.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   He says, right?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   I bet you they have cut out just a square or zoomed in so that shot is probably going to be in low resolution.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   And you can do that.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   Does it stuff like Vine and Instagram just use the square anyway?
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   So it saves us from ourselves.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   That's why they do the square, right?
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   And doesn't matter how you shoot it.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   It's going to be square no matter what.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   This is a little interesting though.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   I know that there was an interview with a grant in Mahara.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   It might have been even on triangulation, I don't know.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.640]   But it was... we was talking about designing the energizer bunny and that because of some
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:29.800]   rule or convention of advertising, the fact that they had to make sure the energizer bunny
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.000]   actually ran on energizer batteries.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   Or else they'd get in trouble.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.880]   So I wonder if there was something like that going on here where they had to make sure that
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.720]   every time they seem to be saying that here's video that the kid actually shot, they had
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.080]   to actually use shot video.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:49.000]   So that's another vote in favor of low resolution adjusted video.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   Unless they say at the end video simulated or something like that.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   I don't know.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Let's watch it.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   I bet you the whole commercial...
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   I bet you all of his point of views are all...
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   One more time here.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   We're going to watch closely just to make sure.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   I bet you the whole movie that they actually show was shot on an iPhone.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Yeah, if you go to apple.com/apple they have the actual video that they use as the kid's
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   video.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   It's called the Harrison family holiday video.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   You can see the whole video but I don't think it was probably a large crew.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   It's a sound man and everything.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Everything is well lit.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Portrait mode.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   This is very sweet.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Very touching.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   This is kind of a forest for the trees.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   I mean we're worried about...
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.880]   This is a disenfranchised child finally finding his voice for the enabling technologies of
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.880]   Apple.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:34.880]   There you go.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.880]   Don't forget about his orientation.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.000]   In an earlier day he would have been just a messed up teenager.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Now look at it.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Best into the periphery.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Ununderstood.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   His family doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   He doesn't know what he's doing.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   It's all important.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   It's all important.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   They could get.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   But with their...
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   What they're doing is that...
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Here's the idea that...
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   You're saying the...
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.680]   They're saying that this boy could have grown up to be the next isolated troubled brilliant
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:47:00.100]   singer-songwriter but he was diverted from the path of being the next Kurt Cobain or Bob Dylan
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:03.000]   because he had a gadget that let him distract him from his suffering.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   The whole thing is a portrait mode.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.520]   Ohhh.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.000]   This is how it should have been.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.400]   She's crying because she hates it.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.400]   Why did he do that?
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:17.400]   In a vertical video.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   Our son is...
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   Have we taught you nothing?
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.400]   To an idiot.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.800]   Happy holidays with vertical videos.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:30.000]   There was a disclaimer at the end of that something about Wi-Fi and AirPlay.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.040]   I see phrases, beers on Twitter made a great comment.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:38.800]   The video did actually make him cry but only because his iPhone won't buffer to his AirPlay
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.640]   devices quickly as it does on the videos.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.400]   That was quite quick, wasn't it?
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.800]   AirPlay uses Wi-Fi extra hardware needed.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   Extra hardware needed.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   Apple TV.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Apple TV.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.400]   10,000 LED light panels.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.720]   You know that covers everything, doesn't it?
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:54.720]   Union actors and...
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.360]   We're going to take a break.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.560]   Do you want to play Brian Brushwood's Family Christmas card?
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:00.560]   That was kind of sweet.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.960]   I don't think that was shot on an iPhone.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:04.680]   We'll leave that as an exercise.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.800]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.com.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.880]   Audible is a great place for people who have time to spare that they'd like to read but
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.000]   they can't hold a book.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.600]   It's audiobooks performed by some of the best readers ever, in many cases famous actors
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.200]   like Anne Hathaway doing The Wizard of Oz.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.960]   There are 150,000 titles here and I am such a fan of Audible.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.800]   I've been an Audible listener since the year 2000, 13 years.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:36.120]   I have 500 books in my library and that's one of the nice things about Audible.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.520]   Those books are yours always.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:42.160]   If you did install the Audible app on your iPhone, iPad, Android device, Windows Phone,
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:47.600]   Windows 8, Macintosh, you'll be able to listen to any one of those.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.640]   Go back in time and read your novels again, your nonfiction.
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.080]   I listen to a lot of history and biography.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.800]   If you like thrillers, there's no better place.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.360]   In fact, it's probably a good idea.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.720]   We're going to give you a book free to get something that really grabs you, a page turner
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:06.240]   for your first book because then you'll really appreciate how Audible books come to life
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.400]   in your mind's eye.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:13.320]   It's really, it's the movie the way the author imagined it.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.320]   Here's what you do.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.320]   Go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.480]   You'll be signing up for the gold account.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.760]   That gives you a credit for a book.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.920]   Almost all the books are single credits for the most lengthy books.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.280]   That first month is free.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.280]   That first book is free.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.880]   You cancel any time in the first 30 days.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.880]   You'll pay nothing.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:34.600]   You'll also get the daily digest of The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal audio.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:39.400]   It is just a great way to enjoy reading again.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.960]   I listen in the car all the time.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.120]   I listen at the gym.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.480]   I listen when I'm walking the dog and washing the dishes.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.200]   Annie, what are you listening to these days?
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.880]   An absolute holiday tradition.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:56.840]   Every single year I get out my copy of Patrick Stewart reading a Christmas carol.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.440]   Oh, I think that's crazy.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.840]   I bought it originally on Audible on cassette.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.600]   Then when it came out on CD, I bought it on CD.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:10.840]   And now I own it digitally because it's a brilliant story.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:15.640]   If you're just going from the Mr. Magoo's Christmas carol or the...
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   Or the...
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.640]   Or the...
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:24.160]   You're no fan for my fingers too fast.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.360]   Tell me that I may wipe the racist name from this stone.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.360]   I mean, it's fine.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.360]   It's amusing.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.560]   It's just not quite as stirring as the original next is.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.720]   And the backstory behind this is that this was...
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.480]   Even before he started playing John Luke Picard on Star Trek, this was like a hobby of his
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:48.080]   to do dramatic reading in which he was not simply reading the text but also performing
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.680]   every single character.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.920]   He does the women's voices.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:52.440]   He does the children's voices.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:55.640]   He does the carolers singing and everything like that.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:00.200]   And this is... he's honed this act year after year after year and thank heavens.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.640]   He actually put it on audio and so you can enjoy it every single year.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:07.560]   And really it's slightly abridged I think.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.120]   It runs at one hour and 47 minutes.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:11.120]   But it really...
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:15.480]   Especially if you're one of these folks who spends Christmas even Christmas day like
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:20.520]   shuttling between friends and families' houses, it's just a brilliant thing to have in the
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:21.520]   car.
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:27.800]   If you feel that the level of enjoyment you get out of this unique time of the year is
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.880]   starting to wane, this will put you right back in the trade.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.880]   I'll play a little bit of that.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.480]   I don't know what part of it we're going to get here.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.880]   I'm Krosan and Naomi Brettar.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.440]   You failed.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.840]   Merry Christmas, uncle.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.120]   It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:55.600]   intimation he had of his approach.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.480]   This is really where audiobooks come alive.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:00.480]   I think this is great.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:05.920]   By the way, if you search for a Christmas Carol, there are about 20 different renditions,
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.600]   including Tim Curry doing it.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:12.440]   Jim Dale, who does the amazing Harry Potter books.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   But this is great.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.360]   You're not alone, Andy.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:20.640]   In the reviews, there are also people who say, "I listen to this every Christmas and
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.280]   it's not Christmas without it."
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.160]   What a nice tradition.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.040]   Long before the iPhone, before even the iPod, I used to keep those cassettes in the glove
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.240]   box of my car.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.520]   The day after Thanksgiving, I would reach in the glove box, put that in the cassette
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:37.080]   deck and it would stay there pretty much for the entire holiday season.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.320]   Can't recommend it highly enough.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.120]   It's one of my favorite things about audiobooks.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.600]   Or my favorite things that the audible sells.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:48.280]   You know, I'll give you my Christmas tradition when I was a kid for years, we would listen
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:53.840]   to a recording, was on a vinyl record, of Dylan Thomas reading his child's Christmas
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.160]   in Wales.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.160]   And I just looked it up and they have it also.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.000]   This is the poet reading him himself.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.560]   Probably it's a little crispy because I'm just curious what it sounds like.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.560]   But it was...
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.680]   Yes, I'm very fond of him.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.240]   I think it's just an older recording.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:21.840]   I tell you what I have to say.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:25.560]   And I know you can barely understand it because it's so Welsh.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.440]   But and I'm sure you would get a little bit better than I do time.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:31.000]   But it is a great tradition in my family.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.240]   I'm going to download this too.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:33.240]   See, look at that.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.240]   Thank you, Andy.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.760]   I got two Christmas traditions now.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.440]   One for Christmas Eve, one for Christmas night.
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.440]   How about that?
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:39.440]   Excellent.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.440]   I love it.
[00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.640]   And then the Cricut in the Hearth voiced by Jim Dale.
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   Wow.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.080]   We're getting suggestions from a...
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:50.360]   Our chatroom, the Cricut in the Hearth was a classic too.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:51.360]   Was that Dickens?
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.440]   Trying to remember the Cricut in the Hearth.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.600]   Yeah, Charles Dickens.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.680]   Read by Jim Dale.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.480]   No, narrated by Jerry Dickens.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   Must be his great grandson.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:05.720]   This is a series called Dickens on Dickens.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:12.640]   I remember recently, she used to go around essentially doing like the Charles Dickens
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.120]   experience I think.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.120]   Going from...
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.800]   Because Dickens used to do his own readings of his own material.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.440]   And as a matter of fact, he actually created his own...
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.400]   His own reading scripts, right?
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.080]   In fact, he would make cuts.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.840]   He would make additions to...
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:27.480]   So that put in act breaks.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.640]   As a matter of fact, just Sunday, I was at the New York Public Library listening to Neil
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.720]   Gaiman do a reading from Dickens's own reading copy of Christmas Carol.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.520]   And I really do think that it's almost as if this was...
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:43.680]   It's a toss-up whether I prefer to read that book or listen to it.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.400]   Because when you're just sitting there, especially, you know, a couple of years before Christmas
[00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:51.720]   and listening to it being read to you, it's like suddenly you're seven years old and you
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.920]   anticipate Hot Wheels race track coming your way in four or five days.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.560]   It's just a wonderful experience.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.520]   Christmas is nothing if not tradition, right?
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.360]   That's the whole key to it.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.400]   This is Charles Dickens' great, great grandson reading this.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.400]   Jerry, Dickens.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.400]   Wow.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:11.120]   Let me see if I can't find the Jim Dale version though.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.720]   Maybe that's only available in the UK or somewhere.
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:15.560]   Anyway, audible.com.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.560]   Now see, we made it hard.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.720]   You got to pick one.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.960]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.320]   I can promise you you'll want more.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.880]   Audible is really great that way.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.880]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:27.360]   Here's the Jim Dale version.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.360]   Christmas...
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.560]   Oh, that's a Christmas Carol.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:36.320]   Anyway, there's quite a bit of great stuff here.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.720]   Moving on.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.560]   Is there any other news?
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:43.160]   There's lots of stuff in the notes.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.080]   I should go back to the name of it.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   iOS firmware.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   iOS firmware.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   Okay.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   I'm still getting springboard crashes.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:55.080]   I mean, it's under NDA, but I haven't been seeing as many complaints on Twitter about
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.080]   those with the new beta.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.080]   Oh, my God.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.480]   I've got to fix that.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   You too, Don?
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.120]   Yeah, I'm afraid so.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:09.080]   I love iOS 7 and I love the new iPhone 5S, but it's the crassiest iOS version that's
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.080]   been out.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   It is.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.000]   Luckily, though, it is quick to recover, but it's still very frustrating.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.720]   Well, it's just springboard or backboard that are crashing.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.720]   So that's just the UI layer.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.720]   So that's quick.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:19.720]   It's the Apple logo when it comes right back.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.040]   So it's not rebooting the whole phone stack, but it's still terribly annoying.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.040]   Exactly.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.120]   We have to remind ourselves and remind everybody that iOS 7 and MacBreak are the two.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:34.000]   It's hard to recall to Apple cutting up with two such big releases at the same time or
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.240]   even two such big releases period.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.080]   And so there's definitely going to be a few months in which Apple's really going to have
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.440]   to chase down every single last bug.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.320]   It's not going to be until, I don't know, January, February until we can say seriously,
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.320]   it's done now.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.720]   Have you even expected to work?
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:53.800]   Have you seen the bug where someone calls you and you can't, the slide won't work?
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.200]   I've had that since I always have one.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:01.360]   Every audience is the one argument for one of those keys, one of the hardware keys.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.360]   The answer to the phone.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:06.160]   You know, because it's like, you're sitting like, there's no setting on an iPhone that
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.160]   you can do that.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.160]   It's a client.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:12.480]   Most Android phones have a, or maybe that's, maybe that's part of cyanogen, but I have
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:15.080]   seen on my Android phones, you can press a button to pick.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.640]   Yeah, I just look at where they would make it.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:20.360]   One of my friends really misses those two answer and hang out buttons at all the old
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:23.640]   trios and block movies had right on the front.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:30.040]   Yeah, I also, I have a deal breaking problem with, with Safari, where it's just so unreliable
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.040]   that I just can't use it.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:36.800]   And these three, it used to be, because I have a new MacBook here and it used to be that
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.760]   I could, I would choose a different browser maybe because I have a free option.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:45.200]   I want to get the extra battery life of Safari, but it just locks up my machine.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.120]   If it'll slow it down and then we'll lock it up, guarantee at least once a day.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.320]   So, and it's, and this is enough.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:52.640]   This is the, it's full.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.880]   It was a, okay, Mavericks is a big deal.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:58.840]   And well, this is the, this is like you move into a new house.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:03.320]   It's not, it's not officially something that is going to annoy you long term until you
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.320]   fix the last thing that needs to be fixed.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   This takes you once.
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:09.880]   See, Safari and Mavericks fixed, I, I didn't like it at all under Mountain Line because
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:12.960]   it would, it didn't do the same thing that Chrome did with WebKit 2.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.640]   It just basically separated out the flash processes, but the entire thing could force
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.960]   you to reload every tab.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:21.160]   Seemingly at whim, but now they've broke it all out.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.600]   I, I, I, I, I, I temporarily went back.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   I quit using Safari in, in 10, eight for that reason.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:32.360]   As a matter of fact, I had to actually write an Apple script and put it into the menu whose
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:38.040]   only job it was to harvest every single open tab and stuff it to a file so that I could
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:41.560]   quickly quit without having to look and, and, and review every single tab.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.320]   Cause you know, you know how it is sometimes you have windows open.
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:46.320]   They have research in them that you didn't actually bookmark.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:50.840]   And the fact that when I realized that you just spent 20 to 30 minutes writing a complex
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:56.360]   Apple script for triaging an emergency situation, Andy, is this an indication that perhaps Safari
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:59.720]   is not the browser for you at this point in your life.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:02.920]   But in Mavericks, but in Mavericks it was working.
[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:03.920]   It was much, much better.
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:08.000]   It was still not as good as Chrome at that kind of thing, but it was at least stable,
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.160]   but this new one is just, no, it just doesn't work.
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.600]   I've never had that problem with, with Safari really.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   I mean, I'm not heavy.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.160]   I mean, I don't know loads and loads of tabs where I have found it useful for in Mavericks,
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:21.120]   especially now is the, is the iCloud key chain between all the devices.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   That's a huge benefit.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:26.360]   I'll still use one password, but you know, the benefit of having the iCloud key chain
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.640]   built into Safari, a mobile Safari, especially is brilliant.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.880]   And also the iCloud tabs as well.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.600]   I didn't think I'd use them very much, but the, you know, to have a tab open on your
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:39.120]   Mac and then go across to your iOS device and have open the same tab there.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:41.600]   And I don't really find it that, that crash you to be honest Safari.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.600]   I'm speaking.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   I'm heavy.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.280]   What are you, what are you running it on?
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:49.880]   So I'm running on a 20 brand new 2013 13 inch retina Mac Pro.
[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:54.360]   Yeah, it's on the, on the 15 inch retinomap Pro, one of the new ones.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:55.360]   That's weird.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:58.160]   I'm the same, but I put all the Google, I put all the flash and all the Google stuff in
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.280]   Chrome and then I just use all the Apple and all the basic web stuff in Safari.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.360]   And that makes them both really stable for some reason.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.720]   That's annoying.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:10.320]   I mean, neither of them is, is a perfect answer because Chrome is such a resource hog that
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:14.440]   will instantly, just by virtue of the fact that it exists, it will cut about two hours,
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.960]   at least two hours of your battery life on.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.640]   Sometimes I'm getting losing three or four hours of battery life.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:22.280]   Same mean same tabs, same setup as not them running something spectacularly different in
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.760]   Safari than the other one.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.120]   We're asked with Safari again, it's just that I want to, I want to give you a chance.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.840]   Just please, please, please don't freeze up.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.140]   When you guys are on your Firefox for deadline.
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:33.140]   No.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.140]   I'm, I'm, I'm.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.140]   I am fire.
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.140]   I give up one gecko.
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.140]   It is ugly.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.140]   Yeah, ugly.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.800]   I'm thinking about, I think about giving opera a try.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.000]   If for no other reason that I want to see if I can get an answer, I want to see if I can
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.440]   get a stable browser that doesn't eat up my battery.
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:52.360]   I use opera as a sec, as a supplemental browser on all my machines because it is the best
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.200]   at look, I do not want to be tracked.
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.000]   I do not want to be have any JavaScript run.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.080]   I don't want to have anything happen that would not be happening to a computer in 1993
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.080]   with HTML 1.1.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:09.000]   I think it gives you the best amount of control over how a webpage will interact with your
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   computer.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   So that's the one I fire up whenever.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   Let's take the above links.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.720]   Links with the text braced browser.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:17.720]   I'm happy.
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.720]   I'm my tarry links.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.360]   But yeah, so, so, so when someone, someone, someone gives me a URL to visit, like, so
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.840]   oh, I just, I just thought you might be interested in this bit of research that we put together
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.920]   like, okay, I've never talked to you before.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:31.120]   I, and I believe this is a bitter and cruel world full of evil people.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.920]   I think all of this is an opera.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.680]   The thing with iOS seven is still like, I mean, they only began, this is not our problem.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.320]   They should have fixed this, but they only began making it really seriously in December,
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.200]   which is way shorter than their usual schedule.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.680]   And there's just so much in it.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.680]   They changed every pixel, a lot of the basic stuff.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:50.160]   And it's going to just take a while before it's, it's like any Apple product.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.680]   They regressed it to a certain point.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.720]   It's going to take a while for it to get back to where it was before I was.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.480]   I was, I was seven potato because especially when you talk to people inside Apple about
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.600]   what they are trying to accomplish with iOS seven, this, it really feels like not simply
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:09.480]   the next version after iOS six, it really feels like what if we simply spent from 2007
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.800]   to now thinking about how we would like this operating system to be and we built something
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:20.200]   brand new in 2013, it really is there at least philosophically, it feels like it's that ambitious.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:26.200]   So I was given, I always have, and I think it's a free pass until spring, not that it,
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.560]   not that it could be, it could be unreliable.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:32.200]   But I'm saying that if I'm annoyed that a certain, if I'm still annoyed that a certain
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.080]   like, continue our next button is too small.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.400]   It's in an upper wet end corner.
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:39.080]   If I'm annoyed that there is a certain app that isn't working properly, I will note it
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:40.520]   and I will complain about it.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:44.080]   But I will say, okay, but let's look back in a few months after they're really finished
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.800]   shaking this thing out.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:52.680]   I, I, I, I want to think this entity.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.400]   I just feel like they, this is kind of unacceptable.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.680]   You guys are being very generous to Apple.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:04.400]   Well, see, here's, here's what, here's my, here's my philosophy.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.960]   One of the things that I like a company to do is let me know what they, what, what, what
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.160]   is their vision of their own future?
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.280]   Are they just throwing stuff against the wall and hoping that they make sort of an impact
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   with it?
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.920]   Or is there three or four different factions within the company that are fighting out for
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.200]   a different vision?
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:22.200]   Or are they working towards a goal?
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.200]   I'll, as a, to get off of Apple for one second, Nokia and what they're doing with cameras
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:31.520]   right now is just, I have, I can't think of another company, including Apple, that has
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.960]   had this level of focus and commitment towards improving a specific feature.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:41.320]   And so if the camera on the 10 20 has a couple of problems, I'm not willing to, willing to
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:45.400]   write it off because I think that let's see what you, what these guys do next.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.720]   And now if you have the next version of the operating system, you see that a lot of the
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.440]   problems with this phone have been fixed with Apple and iOS seven, this isn't them just
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.280]   screwing around and saying, Oh, I suppose if people are going to complain about, about
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.040]   this, we'll kind of fix that or let's try.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.120]   Well, it does seem like one of the things I think is interesting in the, in the recent
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.760]   past with Apple is it does see what they are throwing stuff up against the wall and then
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.760]   fixing it later.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.680]   Like there is a deadline that they're trying to meet.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:13.200]   So they're, you know, for instance, they are, they're uploading I work and just, we're
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.120]   just going to remove a bunch of features or, I mean, and final cut 10 before that.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.600]   And I'm not sure if it necessarily, I mean, you know, make sense for Apple to do that.
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.440]   I mean, I think that, I think that they're getting a lot of bad press by releasing things
[01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.120]   too quickly and then no one gets over it.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:28.280]   Like Final Cut 10 has gotten a lot better over the last couple of years, but, but because
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:31.240]   they released it without a whole bunch of features, it's never really gotten over that
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   stigma.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.960]   But also, but also the other problem that I think Apple is facing is that everybody thinks
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:42.120]   that the first three Star Wars movies that were released were perfect and wonderful and
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.400]   was only the prequels that came after it that ruined the Star Wars franchise because
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.400]   Oh, it was a soundtrack.
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.400]   We absolutely the soundtrack.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.640]   I talked about, I talked about, I know I'm talking to someone with insider knowledge.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:59.560]   What I mean is that we tend to forget that how about the first titanium power book that
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.000]   Oh, it turns out that Wi-Fi signals cannot penetrate this material.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.160]   Perhaps we should have put those antennas someplace where they can get reception.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:11.800]   You know, every single major release has had has had teething pains.
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.800]   Just as almost every manufacturer who's made something brand new and tried to do something
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.720]   that's not simply taking the perfect and stable thing.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.440]   They started with an incrementally adding something new to it.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.800]   So Apple doesn't get a free pass, but they get they earn at least some patience for me
[01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:29.600]   because usually the weight turns out to be worth it.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.600]   I'm similar to Andy in that.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.960]   I like the direction they're going.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.760]   If I didn't like it, I would be way, you know, and I think a lot of people don't like
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.760]   it.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:36.760]   I would be way angrier.
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.640]   But I think what they're some of the things that they're doing are so innovative when
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:42.320]   it comes to interface and projecting that interface to cars and other scenes and the
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.360]   technology they're building into it that I'm happy to extend out to them until I, you
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360]   know, Andy said the spring.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.760]   I don't know if it'll be iOS seven point, whatever.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:54.500]   But I'm willing to extend out to them the ability to see that vision fulfilling and
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:06:00.600]   I own it compelling and in coming off the week of the hour of code, I think that I think
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.360]   that we ought to remember that that, you know, some of this stuff is pretty complicated.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.200]   I mean, I read this article about, I guess, the beginnings of flip board and the fact
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.760]   that when they were doing it, they were talking to the engineers about the way that they wanted
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.200]   it to flip and the engineers are like, you can't do that.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.200]   You can't do that.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.200]   You like that is going to work.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.200]   That is not workable.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.200]   You know, and they insisted on it and it took a lot of work and they think one of the reasons
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.880]   they got ahead was because they could do it.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880]   No one worked.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:32.480]   You know, and so I just feel like it's to me if there's a there's a tension between
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:37.200]   represent saying, hey, we as users deserve stuff that works.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:42.840]   And then giving Apple a little bit of a pass because they've done great stuff in the past.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:46.640]   Well, it's it's I don't know where I don't know where the dividing line is.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.000]   No, that that that is a really, really good point and a really, really good comment.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:00.480]   I think that customer faith is like forward momentum that you don't need to keep building
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.560]   and sustaining it.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:07.240]   If you have six months to a year in which you're disappointing a longtime customer, you have
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:12.360]   so much faith and experience that that'll carry you through through the next release.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:16.360]   Or in the case of Apple, sometimes they have the benefit of delivering a product that simply
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.560]   doesn't exist anywhere else.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.280]   If you want a full size tablet, there really is no alternative to the iPad.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:25.520]   Even if you want a small size tablet, that can be used like a computer as opposed to
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:27.240]   a content device or an accessory.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.200]   There really is no alternative from that the iPad mini.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:35.720]   So iOS seven would have had to have been absolutely terrible to have shed any users based on it.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:39.360]   However, that momentum that that carry over of momentum doesn't last forever.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:44.000]   I think that if Apple doesn't, if someone is upset with iOS seven and doesn't listen
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.120]   to people like us saying, well, stick with it for a little while.
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.800]   I know it's buggy, but they're doing something really, really big and you'll be happy with
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.600]   what happens in 2014.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:56.600]   They now have there's at least an invisible counter saying that if if I if the next iteration
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:01.840]   of iOS doesn't fix these problems and I'm I'm still unhappy a year from now, and if it
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:07.000]   turns out that the next Microsoft tablet made by Nokia that has this incredibly cool camera
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.960]   that a friend of mine had and was able to take pictures of my iPhone couldn't take that
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.400]   might that that makes Apple that makes that consumer vulnerable to a switch at that time.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:18.680]   It really has to be a long term consistent series of letdowns.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:23.680]   If someone decides to ditch a platform because of one major release that let them down a
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.160]   little bit, they probably weren't terribly happy with that phone or that device to begin
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.160]   with.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.000]   It was probably just a purchase of convenience and they were always able to switch pretty
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   much at whim.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.560]   I think you also have to put it into context as well in that I mean, I'm talking about
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:41.320]   it being the crassiest iOS that I've had.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:46.280]   Once every two days say I'm like a re springboard thing and when it does happen, it's a couple
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:51.280]   of seconds and I sort of I sigh and think, oh, it's not a break in the day, isn't it,
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280]   Don?
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280]   Pardon?
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.280]   It's kind of a nice break in the day, isn't it, Don?
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:59.320]   You get a moment to collect your parts and say hello to the children.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.560]   When you think how when it was like in the beat and you know, the sheer hit the effort
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.960]   they've done to actually release it as a valid operating system, you know, they might have
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.920]   worked, they've put into actually get it to release status.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.520]   You sort of have to give them a bit of a let on that.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.600]   And then I always as a, you know, an existing customer thing, well, they will get it better
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.880]   and we've just got to give them, you know, a point release to fix in some of the bugs.
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.520]   But you know, it's not it's not like it's crashing every five minutes and I'm losing
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.520]   data.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.600]   It's just an inconvenience during the day, which we never used to have on previous iOS
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600]   devices.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.640]   The one thing that I find the most interesting is if you look, we could have very easily had
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.840]   something different if Scott Forest, all stated Apple, you know, Bob Mansfield would have
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:35.840]   been upset.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:36.840]   Johnny I would have been upset.
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.200]   We would have had a different hardware destiny, but we would have had an iOS that looked and
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:45.480]   functioned and it was a stable and solid and relatable and comfortable as iOS six, just
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.480]   with a few more features.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:48.320]   And then we'd be complaining about the skeomorphism.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.320]   Absolutely.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.880]   But Johnny, I had a very powerful vision in its my understanding sometime in November,
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.840]   December, he pitched that vision to pretty much the entire company and he had to get
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.440]   buying for it because it was a huge amount of change.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.280]   And it was something that a lot of people would have to work very, very, very hard to
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.160]   get ready for WWDC.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.680]   So he had to have those designers and engineers committed.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:11.520]   Like if you tell somebody, look, we're going to have parallax and we're going to have
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.520]   Gaussian blur.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.840]   Someone has to build all that.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.800]   And these are people who could have had a much easier time developing iOS seven without
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.960]   these ideas.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.200]   And I might only regret is that he doesn't like the stage so much that he couldn't give
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.320]   that same pitch to us on the stage at WWDC.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:30.680]   I think having him explain it, having him be almost like the next generation Steve Jobs
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.120]   in terms of corporate vision would have made a lot of people maybe more comfortable or more
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.840]   understanding about where iOS seven was going.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.840]   But what does he do?
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:44.200]   Come on stage and say, hello, I'm Johnny I've we've made a new version of iOS seven.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.640]   It doesn't work very well.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.880]   But he get away with a lot with an English accent.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.240]   Yeah, you understand that.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:56.240]   But it's the most exciting version of iOS we've ever met.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.840]   In the UK, it wouldn't have gone anywhere.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:01.440]   But in America, he would have just gotten up and explained that and we wouldn't like,
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.760]   oh, yeah, your battery will die twice as fast.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:08.440]   Occasionally you'll have to look at your family while you're a system reboot.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:12.040]   But in many ways, this is the best iOS we've ever met.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:17.840]   And all the Americans would just be like, oh, the really strange thing though is the icons.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:21.240]   I mean, when the icons first came out in the beta, I mean, they hurt your eyes.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.360]   You think, no, why can they release these icons?
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.480]   So you keep expecting that each beta release that they changed the icons into something
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.480]   a bit more presentable.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:29.480]   And it didn't.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.480]   It stayed exactly the same.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.840]   I just say, if an automobile company came up with a car that the brake only worked sometimes
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.480]   and the car occasionally died in the middle of the road, we might not be so forgiving.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:42.960]   Is this a Microsoft joke from 1988?
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   Yes.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.320]   I know that joke.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:48.880]   But yeah, but it's, I mean, like I said, I certainly can see that point.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:52.560]   It's just that there's sometimes you feel as though you're not going to tear down the
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.160]   entire house because you don't like the way that the toilet and the upstairs bathroom
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:57.720]   is running now.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.640]   It's, I agree.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.240]   You appreciate the complex system.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:09.480]   And again, taking a personal attack to this, what caused me to switch from iPhone to Android
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:12.860]   wasn't that I didn't think that iOS 6 was very good.
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:17.780]   It was because there was a fundamental divergence in future philosophy where I had a vision
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:21.460]   of my future phone that diverged from Apple's vision of their future phone.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.740]   And that's what gets people to lose.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.220]   Whereas good and gravy.
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:29.620]   Think about everything that we put up with in the Mac in the late 80s and early 90s while
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:33.180]   they were trying to figure out, I bet there's a way we can write, we can have a document
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.740]   that's longer than eight pages.
[01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.700]   Let's try to get cracking on that.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:40.060]   You know, and we stuck with the iPhone, even though it couldn't cut and taste and didn't
[01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:41.580]   have any apps available for it.
[01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:46.220]   It's because we shared a, we felt as though we shared with Apple a common philosophy of
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:49.140]   what an Apple would, what a phone should be and what it should do.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:50.740]   So that's the most important thing.
[01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:56.140]   That's the most important covenant to maintain between a manufacturer or maker and a consumer.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:57.140]   And everybody has that choice.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.220]   I'm doing very well with that.
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:02.860]   We're not telling, I wouldn't say to somebody, oh, it's, you should stop liking Apple because
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:03.860]   of this.
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:04.860]   It's everybody has the choice.
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:07.660]   I mean, and in this isn't anything new and you're right, Andy.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:13.460]   We did put up with the worst memory manager in the world in OS 9 for years.
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:17.060]   Maybe, maybe it's that momentum analogy you gave.
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.420]   Maybe the, you know, for some of us, Apple has a little more runway than others.
[01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.420]   Right.
[01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:24.260]   I just, it feels frustrating.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:28.060]   And I see the frustration a lot of people.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:29.820]   But it's not, but it's not affecting sales.
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:30.820]   Let me put it this way.
[01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:32.580]   Oh, imagine, look at this.
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.580]   That's absolutely not.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.340]   More than like 76% or something.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:37.260]   I mean, I think, let me put it this way.
[01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:42.300]   Think about like your girlfriend or your boyfriend or your husband or your wife, suddenly announcing
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.300]   to you, you know what?
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:47.220]   I've decided I want to quit my job and become a potter.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.940]   And you would probably wouldn't leave them immediately.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:53.460]   You would give them three or four years to work that out.
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:57.620]   I tell they either be proofed to you that they could be a, that this is not going to
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:02.540]   end in tears before you'd say, honey, let's try separate bedrooms and see how that goes.
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:06.540]   I think the real point though, you put up with, I mean, you know, anytime you're in a
[01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:08.940]   relationship with somebody, there are some rough spots.
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:11.660]   There are some, well, the real question is you'd like to fix and you put up with it.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:15.020]   But I should point out that the iPhone is not your girlfriend.
[01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.660]   And I think the other thing you have to ask yourself is how long would you stay with someone
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:22.180]   if they crash every once in a while, every, every couple of days?
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.180]   That would be bad.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:24.180]   My wife has stayed with me for a long time.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:25.180]   I crash all the time.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:28.860]   I said that I'll be talking to her and suddenly I go like this, I just go.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:31.980]   And then I come back up, but it's only a couple of seconds and it just takes an hour to swipe.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:36.380]   I've never had the courage to ask a girlfriend that question.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:40.380]   Exactly how much would you be willing to put up with?
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:43.100]   Have you ever heard of a guy named Kevin Abos?
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:45.340]   He's a Hollywood photographer.
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:49.340]   If you go to his website, you'll see portraits of Dennis Hopper, Scarlett Johansson, Johnny
[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:52.620]   Depp, Dustin Hoffman, great photographer.
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:56.540]   He also has a good friend, a friend named Tony Fadel.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:04.860]   And apparently Tony came over the other day to Kevin's house with his newest acquisition.
[01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:10.140]   Tony Fadel, of course, of Nest, former iPod designer, seems to have bought some solid
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:12.620]   gold earbuds.
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.540]   And it was a friend of his.
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.460]   Was it a friend or was it Tony at the bottom?
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:19.460]   He denied it.
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:20.460]   He denied it.
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.460]   It was him.
[01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:28.340]   And then Tony Fadel with a Red Mac Pro and apparently he's already trying to hack it.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.940]   So that answers one question.
[01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:31.980]   They did deliver the Red Mac Pro right away.
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:33.940]   They didn't wait.
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:38.780]   You're saying if he's trying to hack it, but it's not his, I think it's his.
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:40.620]   Yeah, no, he put out a statement.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.940]   He said that trying to find it.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.660]   He said that he was not the owner, but he had access to them.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:49.820]   I fix it, sent out a request.
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:50.820]   That's clear.
[01:15:50.820 --> 01:15:51.820]   I'm not the owner of either.
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:54.300]   The real owner will reveal themselves if they so choose.
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:55.300]   I fix it.
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.300]   Can we do a tear down?
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:57.780]   We'll give it right back.
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.460]   It'll be in the same, you know, in this.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:00.460]   Exactly.
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.700]   And you'll have a manual on how to do it yourself.
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:04.580]   Think of how many people are going to watch it before it's even been released.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:06.020]   I fix it.
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.020]   Come on.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:08.580]   Call Tony.
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.020]   So Tony said it's not mine.
[01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:11.020]   It's a friend of mine.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:12.020]   Who would that be?
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:13.500]   He was not going to reveal.
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.900]   He said it's up to his friend to reveal who it is.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:17.860]   Well, he shoots for a lot of actors.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:18.860]   So it could be.
[01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:19.860]   It could be.
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.860]   A Bosch does.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:24.300]   It could be a friend of Tonys and Aboshes, right?
[01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.300]   Like Johnny Depp.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:28.580]   It could be Johnny Depp's new iMac.
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.220]   To be clear, I'm not the owner of either.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.620]   The real owner will reveal themselves if they so choose.
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:37.740]   I don't know if I buy that.
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:44.340]   You did have to say that in the first picture, it looks like every medieval panel of Mary
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:46.340]   and the newborn Jesus.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:48.140]   In the future.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:51.140]   Come let us adore the rose color.
[01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:53.180]   First one, the first one with the earbuds.
[01:16:53.180 --> 01:16:54.180]   Oh, the earbuds.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:57.580]   Oh, come let us adore him.
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:00.380]   In ex-childcy stay.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.300]   It does, doesn't it?
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:05.740]   Just like Photoshop a manger around those earbuds.
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:07.500]   Unto us, a child has been born.
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.500]   We're waiting for it.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.300]   For those of you who are waiting for that picture to be sent to Twitter.
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:12.300]   Wow.
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:13.300]   During the show.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.300]   He's gazing upon it.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.140]   He's now going to get a new morning.
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.140]   I mean, Tony's a guy designed the iPod.
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:21.420]   So this would be kind of a big deal for him, right?
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:26.100]   I mean, rose gold, solid rose gold.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:29.420]   Her buds designed by Johnny Ive.
[01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:33.420]   Do you think Johnny I've bought it?
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:34.420]   No.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:36.460]   Yeah, Tony, I'm holding it for him.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:39.820]   I'm wondering if he did buy the table.
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:42.980]   I wonder if he bought something off of that list.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:46.740]   There must have been something that was so cool that, I don't know.
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.900]   Especially if he could have it and be tax deductible.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:55.220]   I love the picture Kevin took of himself in the reflection of the red Mac Pro.
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.860]   That's a nice picture too.
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:17:58.820]   That's instant lock screen.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:17:59.820]   Yeah.
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.180]   Oh, Lee, I wonder who.
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:04.180]   Okay.
[01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.900]   I mean, you should be able to try if you know, if we were the NSA, we could tell with the
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:11.860]   metadata that we already have who it was.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:12.860]   Who's in the reflection?
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:13.860]   I bet you he's good.
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:14.860]   Is there's, you know what?
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:15.860]   Let's get somebody.
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:16.860]   Okay.
[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.660]   What do they do in Blade Runner zoom center?
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.460]   He's rotating a little more.
[01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:22.460]   Zoom in.
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:28.980]   Because there's somebody in that reflection, I swear to God, there's a, I see a camera,
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.380]   but who's this person?
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:33.900]   I'm telling you, I want you guys to get to work on this.
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.100]   There's something in here.
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.020]   Could be John Rubenstein.
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:39.020]   Who would it be?
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:40.020]   Who has that kind of money?
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:41.820]   What this sold for almost a million dollars.
[01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:45.820]   The two together like a million a quarter.
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:48.380]   That's a lot of money to throw away on in a home theater piece.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.380]   John's estate.
[01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:51.060]   Do you think it's Lorraine?
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:52.060]   Okay.
[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:57.220]   Now, I know to alpha team who's now Photoshopping the major scene.
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:02.220]   I want to not create Bravo team to their companies that will create that will like shrink wrap
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:04.340]   things like they shrink wrap cars.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:08.060]   When you get, get them when you get a Mac Pro, get one of these companies to shrink wrap
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:13.500]   in red, take it down to a genius bar just for routine service and see if they say anything.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:14.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:18.020]   Can you imagine the guy coming into the genius bar with the red Mac Pro?
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.260]   He gets it home.
[01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:21.260]   That's a black one.
[01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:22.460]   Oh, well, you had a bad watch.
[01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:24.420]   We just we just swapped you out of free one.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:27.700]   We know that's out of warranty, but hey, we're awesome.
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.340]   It's had after marketing.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.740]   We're sorry.
[01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.020]   We managed to scrape off the paint job that some loser put it on.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:36.740]   My God, anyone goes to Home Depot and gets a can of spray paint.
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:39.940]   They think they know more than Johnny I have about how these things should look.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:43.580]   It's like when they call it correct at the green girl.
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.940]   I have a theory.
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:46.940]   I'm going to do.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:47.940]   I'm going to do some digging.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:50.340]   I'm going to try and calculate this.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:55.540]   I don't know if this was a cop show in 1983 when computers were starting to become very
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:56.540]   popular.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:58.180]   They would have solved this about eight seconds.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.180]   I'm telling you, zoom in on that.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.700]   I've been a friend at JPL.
[01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.700]   All right.
[01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:03.700]   I'm going to do some.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.700]   All right.
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:05.700]   Let's let's getting nervous.
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:07.500]   Is it Alex's picture in the Mac Pro?
[01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.620]   I thought he's averting his gaze.
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:12.100]   He really is not listening to you.
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:13.100]   It's like no way out.
[01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:15.740]   The thing was though, that didn't turn you for now actually take it along.
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:18.780]   So it must be a really, really close friend of hers if it's not his too.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.620]   I think you sure take my million dollar of Mac Pro and the solid gold earbuds and go
[01:20:22.620 --> 01:20:23.940]   and show them to your friend.
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:24.940]   Well, no.
[01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:27.020]   Here's what happened.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.620]   It's going to be a friend of the two of them, right?
[01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:34.620]   Because the guy came over to A. Bosch's house, brought his new toys.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:36.940]   Tony Fidal came over and they were playing with it.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.420]   They took pictures.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:41.020]   The guy said, don't take a picture of me.
[01:20:41.020 --> 01:20:43.500]   So it means it's somebody we'd recognize.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.460]   I'm going to vote for John Lasseter.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.460]   Maybe.
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.740]   That would be my guess.
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:50.740]   Interesting.
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:54.100]   It's going to be a Hollywood type.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:59.140]   But somebody who has an appreciation of Macintosh, you know, Pixar, of course, they render stuff
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:00.140]   like crazy.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.140]   I'm going to--
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:03.020]   It's not me because I don't want that rumor to take hold.
[01:21:03.020 --> 01:21:04.020]   It's definitely not me.
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.020]   Not me.
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:07.860]   I don't know how these rumors get started except for on shows like this.
[01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:10.220]   So don't start telling people that I'm the guy who--
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:12.860]   That's definitely not in the basement.
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:17.260]   I want to-- I think we need to track the back.
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:19.260]   Who is Kevin A. Bosch friends with?
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:20.260]   It's definitely not me.
[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:22.260]   R2D2 housing over back there.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:27.900]   It is, by the way, we should point out tax deductible because for charity.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:28.900]   Just in case.
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:30.900]   Also, the Apple Carries--
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:34.700]   It has matching tax action coming out of their bank account.
[01:21:34.700 --> 01:21:38.700]   And it's going to be somebody who has a love for Apple and a love for Macintosh, right?
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:41.380]   Otherwise you'd have bought the Leica.
[01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:42.380]   I don't know.
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:48.220]   They could have been just-- there are probably four or five really high profile cool things
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.220]   in that option.
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:56.380]   In that option, called the earbuds, the Mac Pro, the Leica, the table, and I probably
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:57.380]   can bump up the five.
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:02.460]   But they're four five that were really high profile, really cool.
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:03.460]   Oh, no.
[01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:06.300]   It's fun to have friends with Photoshop skills.
[01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.300]   How can we--
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.300]   I'll send that over to you.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:09.300]   Send me that image.
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:10.300]   I beat you all.
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:15.420]   Well, while we were talking, Alex Lindsey made a little picture first.
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:16.420]   He does.
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:18.860]   He's gazing with wonder.
[01:22:18.860 --> 01:22:19.860]   And it's even gold.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:20.860]   Did you see that?
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:23.460]   It took me a lot of time to find that one.
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.980]   He got Rose gold, baby Jesus.
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:27.060]   Is it Ashton Kutcher?
[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.180]   He's not rich enough.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.180]   Is it Wozniak?
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.740]   He's not rich enough.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:32.740]   You know who's rich enough?
[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:33.740]   John Laster, I'm telling you.
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:34.740]   That's who it is.
[01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:36.060]   They bought both of them, Leo.
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:37.060]   They couldn't just leave.
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:38.060]   You know, not just one of them.
[01:22:38.060 --> 01:22:39.060]   They had to buy both of them.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.740]   Is he going to use his Mac Pro wearing the earbuds?
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:42.740]   I have to.
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:43.900]   You've got to do it exactly.
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.900]   You've got to do that.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:51.260]   I mean, he should have the Mac Pro listen to the music through the earbuds on top of
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:55.420]   that aluminum table, wearing the space suit, and then take a picture of it with a Leica
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:56.420]   camera.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:02.140]   Just to show that he is the captain of all the Easter days.
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.580]   It's got to be somebody who has a thing for Apple.
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:07.820]   That's when Fidel is there.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.820]   Somebody in LA.
[01:23:08.820 --> 01:23:10.220]   Did you send that via email?
[01:23:10.220 --> 01:23:11.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.980]   All right, I will show you what Alex is doing for the last three minutes.
[01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:15.980]   You are good.
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:16.980]   You are fast.
[01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.460]   I don't know how you do that so fast.
[01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:19.460]   You know.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:23.500]   It's got to be a photo show for a little while.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.500]   Have you?
[01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.380]   You know something about that program?
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:27.380]   Hey, what?
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:29.980]   I can't remember when Photoshop didn't have layers.
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:30.980]   What?
[01:23:30.980 --> 01:23:31.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:32.980]   I remember when Photoshop didn't have colors.
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.980]   Yeah, that was a big, that was a big, like, oh my gosh, we have layers.
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:40.380]   We don't have to keep on saving versions of this file over and over again.
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:44.500]   Ladies and gentlemen, Tony Fidel and the second coming.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:48.500]   Oh, come let us.
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:49.500]   This is so sacrilegious.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.740]   No, that's just a little baby.
[01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:56.540]   Alex Lindsey, you win the $20 gift card to Outback Steakhouse.
[01:23:56.540 --> 01:23:59.460]   Please contact me with your mailing information.
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:01.900]   It is the right look though.
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:02.900]   You nailed it.
[01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:03.900]   Come let him adore him.
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:05.700]   Oh, come let him adore him.
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:11.100]   Now Alex, over the next commercial break, have the baby actually wearing the gold earbuds?
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:12.100]   I'm not.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.460]   Oh, there's an assignment, huh?
[01:24:14.460 --> 01:24:15.460]   Okay.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:16.460]   Okay, okay.
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.100]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:20.460]   This is called feature creep.
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:25.420]   Yeah, feature creep is right.
[01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:27.460]   I just I let oh, here's another one.
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.460]   Oh, oh, I don't know.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.980]   That's a good one too.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:33.980]   Nice.
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:37.100]   He's looking at them.
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:38.940]   They're looking at each other with that or a show.
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.460]   Oh, that one was better.
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:42.380]   Now just put the gold earbuds in there.
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:43.380]   I did this one.
[01:24:43.380 --> 01:24:44.380]   I don't know.
[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:46.060]   You need a little bit more on the selection there.
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:47.060]   That's good.
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:48.060]   But it's very good.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:53.100]   Well, yeah, it was using the halo to really kind of make it work.
[01:24:53.100 --> 01:24:57.340]   What would the baby Jesus be listening to in the rose gold earbuds?
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.180]   You lost Beatles album?
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:02.220]   No, I'm thinking something from Fiddy Cent.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:05.860]   [SINGING]
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.300]   In the club.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.100]   That's my birthday.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.940]   It's your birthday.
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:11.940]   Go, Jesus.
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.140]   It's my birthday.
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:14.860]   There's a new video there.
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.660]   I'm guessing people from the new traditional isseera.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:19.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:20.900]   I'm going hell.
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:21.900]   Imagine there was Mac New.
[01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:24.220]   I just hope Robert is just the father Robert is in the room.
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:27.100]   See how much more fun it is when we have nothing to talk about?
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:32.180]   Um, you know what's making this so good?
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:34.940]   Because all the lawyers have gone home for the holidays,
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:37.740]   so there's no legal news of any kind to bog us down the club.
[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:38.740]   That's what it is.
[01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:39.740]   Yes.
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:40.740]   Yeah, we have Lisa on the other side.
[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:41.740]   Just going, good, good.
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.740]   Uh, actually she's not.
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:47.780]   So, but Bloomberg, now this is one thing I got an email from Lisa immediately.
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:51.780]   When Bloomberg announced this week that they were going to have a live channel on Apple TV,
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:54.780]   and she says, why don't we have a live channel on Apple TV?
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:59.180]   And at that point, it took me three, four hours to explain how Apple works.
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.980]   Uh, do we have a friend at Apple?
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:04.780]   How do you get a live channel on Apple TV?
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:06.780]   At least now we know we can do it, right?
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.580]   Are you just going to talk to them about it?
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:09.580]   Yeah, just talk to them.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:10.580]   Yeah, sure.
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:11.780]   Yeah, sure.
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:13.460]   I said, Lisa, you can call them.
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:15.180]   Probably I shouldn't be me.
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:20.300]   They're still going for pretty much the very, very high influence.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:25.940]   And Bloomberg, if you think about it, is a channel that very wealthy people have on 24/7,
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:26.940]   right?
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:31.300]   So it's probably a desirable thing to have on your Apple TV.
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:33.900]   I think today they added now Sky Sports in the UK.
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:35.300]   They added another channel.
[01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:37.500]   They've had Sky before.
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:38.500]   Sky News was on there.
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:39.500]   But was it live?
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.500]   It's not huge.
[01:26:40.500 --> 01:26:41.500]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.500]   No, it was, I think they did have a live feed, and then there was sort of pre-can snippets
[01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:45.500]   of other stories.
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:51.100]   But now TV is the premium content that's for just for Sky subscribers only.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.700]   And we had a couple of other things, 10 up early this week as well.
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:57.500]   We got Sony's crackle channel last week as well.
[01:26:57.500 --> 01:27:00.700]   Yeah, but those are, I'm just, I'm interested in the stuff, the live stuff.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:04.540]   And we know they can do it because of the iTunes concerts they do every summer.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.500]   Those are live on Apple TV.
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:12.460]   Yeah, I'm just having a, I'll fire up later and have a look, but I'm pretty sure there's
[01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.620]   going to be some live content on there.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:17.620]   ABC2.
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:22.700]   Well, and I think that there's an option for it to definitely, it'll be interesting to
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:27.100]   see how far Apple rolls that out and how widely they make it available.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:29.100]   Well, they also have a UI issue.
[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:32.980]   Because right now it's just a grid of channels and it's out of control.
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:36.220]   The interesting thing is a bunch of really smart iOS engineers are not working on Apple
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.220]   TV stuff at Apple.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:40.340]   So hopefully we'll see the results of that in the near future.
[01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:43.460]   The iOS 7 version of Apple TV.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:44.460]   Right.
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:45.460]   Pastel colors.
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:48.420]   It is a classic battle though.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:53.860]   The difference between Roku and Apple TV is that Roku isn't quite as nice and quite as
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:58.580]   elegant as Apple TV, but it's nice to have that kind of open-ish framework where, you
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:02.780]   know, if you want to get Plex right now, the, the, the, the, the, the, I know lots of people
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:07.300]   who love their Roku's, but then when I show them, well, have you seen the Plex app?
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:10.220]   And say, well, you mean that pretty much anything on any of my computers anywhere and
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:15.060]   anything I bookmark in any browser can, can actually now be within that.
[01:28:15.060 --> 01:28:16.060]   It's nice.
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:18.500]   Glad I downloaded that free app.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.500]   Chromecast.
[01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:22.060]   We'll do that.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:23.540]   YouTube is now on Roku.
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:27.140]   That was one of the big differentiators between Apple TV and Roku.
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:28.940]   There was no YouTube channel on Roku.
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.980]   We couldn't really figure out why YouTube's everywhere else, but this is now, I guess they
[01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:34.980]   made a deal.
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:39.220]   For three years, they've been going back and forth and Roku's finally made a deal with
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:44.900]   YouTube, YouTube channel launch today on the Roku in US, Canada, UK and Ireland.
[01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:50.780]   Republic of Ireland is expected to be available on older player models later next year.
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:52.660]   So you have to have a Roku three.
[01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.780]   I'm curious if a lot of that was over, whether you see ads or whether you see any inserts
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:57.780]   that they have.
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:02.900]   Usually I think that I think recently that's been a lot of YouTube's focus is making sure
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:05.540]   that their things are being cut out of them.
[01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:08.300]   Because right now I think with Apple TV, I don't think you see any ads.
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:10.300]   You also can't click on your iPhone.
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:11.300]   Is that right?
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:12.300]   You don't see YouTube ads at all.
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:15.460]   And you didn't see them on the old Apple TV, the old app on the iOS either.
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:16.820]   Yeah, which is a big deal.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:19.620]   I mean, if it gets popular, it becomes a big deal.
[01:29:19.620 --> 01:29:20.620]   Right.
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:23.620]   It's a lot easier to watch.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:26.900]   If you want to browse YouTube, it's so much more fun to do it on your Apple TV than it
[01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:27.900]   is on our webpage.
[01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:31.940]   You know, because you don't see any ads, you don't see any new improvements.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.980]   You also can't use any of the interactive features.
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:36.820]   So you like it says, like, if you want to see behind the scenes or something like that,
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:37.820]   you can't click through it.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:39.620]   You know, we haven't talked about in a while.
[01:29:39.620 --> 01:29:41.820]   64-bit processor.
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:44.380]   Apple's still the only phone with a 64-bit processor.
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.380]   Well, the chip anyway.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:46.860]   I don't know if they're really using it yet.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.780]   Well, they made a big deal about it.
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:49.780]   And they did.
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:51.940]   And I don't know if that was enough to get people.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:55.900]   I doubt even one person bought an iPhone because it has a 64-bit processor.
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:57.860]   Nevertheless, it's something that no one else has.
[01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:04.100]   Qualcomm says Apple's 64-bit chip hit us in the gut, Dan Lyons, writing for HubSpot.
[01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:10.020]   It says, "Not just us," the Qualcomm employee unnamed said, "Not just us, but everyone,
[01:30:10.020 --> 01:30:11.020]   really.
[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.180]   We were slack-jawed and stunned and unprepared.
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:15.300]   It's not that big a performance difference right now."
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.140]   It says, "Most current software won't benefit.
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:21.460]   But in spinal tap terms, it's like 32 more.
[01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:23.140]   Now everybody wants it."
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:28.780]   And this is from Mark Granger, who's probably one of the better programmers in the world.
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:35.100]   He said the A7 processor is running out iOS 7.
[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:40.940]   It turns out that even though the A7 processor is 64-bit, in that it takes 64-bit pointers
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:46.540]   and registers iOS 7 can only provide 31 bits of address space via its kernel.
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:54.580]   That means iOS 7 is not actually a 64-bit OS, even though they said it has 64-bit kernel.
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:55.860]   He's been digging into this.
[01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:57.260]   He does a lot of development.
[01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:03.700]   So anyway, the processor is capable of that.
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:08.780]   And of course, an update may change that, but it appears, at least as of the last couple
[01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:11.660]   of weeks, it's still running 32-bit.
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:16.220]   The biggest deal of that has always been that Apple theoretically has one chip that
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:19.620]   they can put in any class device outside of a desktop.
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:23.020]   So they have the same CPU they could have on a sub-top box, on a phone, on a tablet,
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:26.300]   or even on an ultrabook-style laptop.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:31.580]   And that is such a great equalizer for internal and external development.
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:36.300]   It certainly isn't a reason for anybody to go out and buy a phone to get a 64-bit processor
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:37.380]   to get the A7.
[01:31:37.380 --> 01:31:42.300]   But is the reason why 2014 is going to be really, really interesting?
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:45.860]   If you were merging the two OSs, it would be a good step.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:47.540]   Well, maybe this may be no.
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:57.340]   But it could be as there-- I thought an interesting development of 2013 was how close now the 13-inch
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:32:00.660]   MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro are now.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:04.500]   That now they're-- the Pro is more expensive, but not that much more expensive.
[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:06.580]   It's thicker, but not that much thicker.
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:09.420]   It runs-- it doesn't last a long on battery, but--
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.420]   The-- sorry.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:11.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:16.300]   I was looking at this because I came across somebody who was very, very determined to say
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:22.460]   that it was 50% less thick, as opposed to saying that it was thinner.
[01:32:22.460 --> 01:32:26.620]   And I'm like, my hands are hovering over the keyboard saying, is this another one of those
[01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:30.060]   complaining that a tomato is not a vegetable thing, so we just let this one pass.
[01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:31.060]   It's less thick.
[01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:36.260]   But I'm saying that now we're asked-- there used to be a really big, serious distinction
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.700]   between the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air.
[01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:43.180]   Now it's sort of thing where someone could be easily be upsold from the MacBook Air,
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:46.060]   or someone could easily be downsold from the MacBook Pro, depending on what their needs
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:47.060]   are.
[01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:52.260]   And so if they decide-- if this is nothing but, you know, sort of December, there's no
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.260]   news.
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:55.540]   I'm going to lean back in my chair, stroke my beard, switch my whiskey, and think about
[01:32:55.540 --> 01:32:57.540]   interesting things sort of statement.
[01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:01.220]   But if Apple decided they wanted to go even more extreme with the MacBook Air and put
[01:33:01.220 --> 01:33:06.220]   more distance between this device, its battery life, its portability, its durability, its
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:07.380]   heat, everything.
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:10.420]   It's even its price and anything else.
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:13.460]   One way to do that would be to simply say, it's going to run macOS, but we're going to
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:16.820]   design it like an iOS device.
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.980]   So then we necessarily have to merge the two operating systems.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:26.100]   They could simply say that we are going to-- it wouldn't be as easy as FED to complete.
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:30.460]   Logistically-- I mean, macOS has always been set up to make it easy to facilitate a switch
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:31.460]   to a new CPU architecture.
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:35.620]   So it's not a small thing, but if they really did decide that in five years' time, they
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:39.580]   want their laptop line to be built on the same framework as iOS.
[01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.460]   They decided it was worth that trouble.
[01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:42.460]   They could really do that.
[01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:46.140]   Interesting thing to me is that once in a while you see the advantage to Apple's business
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:50.180]   model, like with the retina display, LG and Samsung and Sharp all make displays.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:52.980]   There's no reason they couldn't have done that first.
[01:33:52.980 --> 01:33:57.700]   Samsung makes the chip for-- they actually fab the A7 processor.
[01:33:57.700 --> 01:33:59.380]   Qualcomm makes their own processors.
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:03.260]   Intel makes their own processors, but Apple goes to 64-bit on mobile first.
[01:34:03.260 --> 01:34:06.420]   And part of it is because they don't care how much the processor costs, as long as they
[01:34:06.420 --> 01:34:10.180]   make money on the entire phone, where Qualcomm cares very much how much profit they make
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:11.420]   on the processor.
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:16.540]   But it's one of these advantages to putting this-- the A7 is in every iPhone 5S, every
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:20.860]   iPad Air, every iPad Mini, and that lets them buy huge amounts of scale.
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:28.260]   And there's absolutely versions of MacBook Air-like products running with a series processor.
[01:34:28.260 --> 01:34:31.980]   The thing with this is an investment in the future, the forward-looking phone.
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:34.980]   It's one of the strengths, I think, of the way that Apple does their business.
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:39.340]   Yeah, I mean, look at-- the more that I use, like, all the really cool camera phones of
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:43.580]   the past-- of the second half of this-- of 2013, the more I appreciate that the killer
[01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:50.180]   feature of the 5S's camera is that CPU, the ability that they can do things in a fraction
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.540]   of a second that would have taken a half a second or a full second, or in any way would
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:57.580]   have been prohibitively long, the ability to simply say, "You don't know that we're
[01:34:57.580 --> 01:35:01.540]   actually taking four different photos and making our best guests from the four, but that's
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:05.820]   exactly what we're doing because we have enough-- we can take enough high-resolution photos
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:10.900]   in sequence and then make enough determinations and make a synthetic photo from those four
[01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:15.900]   that in that same amount of time as our competitors' phone is taking one shot and simply showing
[01:35:15.900 --> 01:35:20.140]   you what the JPEG came out like, we're actually doing about 20 minutes' worth of hand-built
[01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:22.220]   photo shopping to make this lens.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:26.500]   That is a very conventional lens, look like something a lot more sophisticated and a lot
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.500]   trickier.
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.500]   So that's--
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:30.940]   That's one of the interesting-- one of the most interesting thing about Apple is they
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:33.380]   ask the same kind of questions that Andy does.
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:35.660]   We have a limited Z index on this phone.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:38.340]   What can we do with the processor instead of with the optics?
[01:35:38.340 --> 01:35:40.060]   We have all these components to make a computer.
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:41.580]   What if we open them up and lay them flat?
[01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:43.140]   How thin could we make the computer?
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:48.060]   Then you get a MacBook Air and it's that willingness to ask these-- out of the box questions that
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:50.500]   lead to some of the interesting products that we have.
[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.940]   And all the really cool things that I've been seeing, like, Prince, the photo behind
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:58.700]   me was taken with the Nokia 1520, which I've been messing around with, that Nokia is doing
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:36:00.260]   fantastic things with cameras.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:04.460]   And I even said that in this show, but I'm very, very excited about their attitude towards
[01:36:04.460 --> 01:36:05.460]   it.
[01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:06.540]   And one of them is exactly that sort of thing.
[01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:12.980]   We can either-- we can either do what Samsung did is essentially take a stock 8 megapixel
[01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:18.540]   still camera and simply add phone features to it, or we can figure out a way through
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:23.380]   leveraging a really impressive processor and a really impressive operating system that
[01:36:23.380 --> 01:36:26.340]   handles imaging to figure out how to fake those effects.
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:31.540]   The fact that you're seeing here is it can do focus bracketing as an option so that the
[01:36:31.540 --> 01:36:35.660]   light-tro camera that has this really complicated light field stuff that's not really good for
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:39.380]   anything except for demonstrating that here's what I did with the $5 million Adventure Capital
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.340]   you sent me, thank you very much.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:45.860]   The idea of this feature, the Nokia camera, is that in the space of a half a second, hold
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:49.300]   this camera still, but in the space of a half a second, we're going to take a sequence
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:51.060]   of photos bracketing the focus.
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:55.860]   We're going to move the focal point from up close all the way to the very, very back and
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:37:00.340]   store all that data so that when you decide that, oh gee, the background isn't in focus,
[01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:03.380]   I really wanted the background to be in focus, you can tap the background and it will build
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:05.580]   you a version of this in which the background isn't in focus.
[01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:09.380]   But the really cool thing about this picture is that there's also a feature that says,
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:11.300]   just make everything in focus.
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:15.900]   And then after only about a half a second of percolation, it will create a synthetic image
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:19.940]   that looks perfectly natural in which everything from the foreground all the way to the deep
[01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:21.980]   background is in perfect focus.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:29.140]   As if I was in Rockefeller Center with a camera on a tripod out of like F-16 aperture, so
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:34.220]   I have that maximum, maximum depth of field, instead of simply shakily hand holding something
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:38.180]   in the middle of a huge, huge crowd late at night where there's practically no light.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:41.180]   That's the sort of, that's the sort of juice we're going to, hopefully, going to see more
[01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:44.540]   of the idea that, well, we don't actually have to redesign this whole, if we have a
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:49.500]   good enough camera, if we have a good enough CPU and afford an ambitious enough set of
[01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:55.580]   thinking about how we're going to solve problems in the future, we can fake almost anything
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:59.780]   the user wants and make it as good as what the user would have gotten had we built something
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:02.420]   bespoke for that feature.
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:06.340]   And I definitely think that one of the places that phones are going to have to continue
[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:11.380]   to distinguish themselves, and I think Nokia's ahead of everyone on these is the camera.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.660]   I mean, that's what everybody is.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:16.780]   I mean, I don't know where else you take a lot of these phones.
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:18.180]   The screen size, you can decide.
[01:38:18.180 --> 01:38:23.100]   It's a subjective thing, but I think that people are now shooting, I mean, 90%, I don't
[01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:24.580]   know what the percentage is it.
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:29.740]   I saw a percentage that was like 85 or 90% of all the photos that are uploaded to stuff.
[01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:31.700]   Well, are from a phone.
[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:32.700]   Oh, our camera starts.
[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:33.700]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:34.700]   Our camera phone.
[01:38:34.700 --> 01:38:37.460]   And so the issue is, is that that's going to continue to be, I think, a hotter race in
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:41.660]   some cases than point and shoots or SLRs or anything else is figuring out how to make
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:47.500]   those, you know, how to be able to shoot in almost no light at high resolution without
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:48.500]   a light.
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:54.060]   I'm kind of curious about that because it's hard to convince somebody that they actually
[01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.460]   need a proper camera.
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:59.900]   There's given that most people are now shooting not for an 8 by 10 enlargement.
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:05.500]   They're going to be hanging on their on their wall and moving on the and taking with them
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:09.380]   as they move from their apartment to their first house to their second house to the
[01:39:09.380 --> 01:39:11.700]   downside house that they buy when the kids move out.
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:17.420]   Now they just as we were talking about how great this guy was.
[01:39:17.420 --> 01:39:18.420]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.420 --> 01:39:19.420]   Yeah.
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:25.620]   This, by the way, is the problem specifically with Skype is that it makes very high calculations
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:26.980]   on the bandwidth.
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:29.380]   And if that bandwidth changes at all, it doesn't have any way to.
[01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:30.380]   It fails.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:31.380]   It just stops.
[01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.380]   It just goes, oh, I can't do that.
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:33.380]   This is the flicker.
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:36.460]   Let's just look at the most popular cameras in the flicker.
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:41.220]   I think flickers are probably a fairly, it's a big, it's a big database.
[01:39:41.220 --> 01:39:43.220]   So the most popular cameras in the flicker community.
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:44.220]   Look at this jump here.
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:47.180]   I'm not sure when they don't have a timeline, but there was some jump.
[01:39:47.180 --> 01:39:49.980]   I guess when the iPhone five, no, because it'd been out for a while.
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:50.980]   I don't know.
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:55.740]   iPhone five, number one, four S number two, four number three and then like five D mark
[01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:56.980]   two, number four.
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:58.980]   Like way, but like not way behind.
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:02.300]   Even in the same way that's when the flicker came out.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.300]   Exactly.
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:04.300]   Oh, maybe.
[01:40:04.300 --> 01:40:05.300]   Look at that.
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:06.300]   Look at the way.
[01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.980]   No, go, go, go to the camera.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:08.980]   Still it.
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:09.980]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:15.500]   It's like fan of the top five camera phones for Apple and a distant fifth is the Samsung
[01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:18.460]   Galaxy S3, which has been flat.
[01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:20.020]   By the way, five S jumped up.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:23.820]   Of course, as it came out and became more popular people, but that's the camera you
[01:40:23.820 --> 01:40:24.820]   have.
[01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:25.820]   And the thing is, it's a good camera.
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:28.460]   I don't see Nokia on here, actually, which is odd.
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:31.460]   It's such a small section.
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.460 --> 01:40:33.460]   Yeah.
[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:34.460]   That's what I'm talking about.
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:41.940]   I hope that people appreciate that there's going to be a time maybe 10 years from now that
[01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:45.420]   they wish that they had a better camera than the one in their pocket.
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:49.740]   So every time so I love to obsess over camera tests, I love to figure out what can this
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:51.700]   phone do, what can't this phone do.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:54.580]   At the same time, I have to keep in mind that a lot of people just don't care.
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:58.740]   It really is not not only they they don't care to such an extent that they're willing
[01:40:58.740 --> 01:41:03.660]   to take a crappy camera phone picture and make it crappier with really stupid filters
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:05.140]   before they put it onto Instagram.
[01:41:05.140 --> 01:41:06.900]   So it's like, okay.
[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:07.900]   Yeah.
[01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:11.420]   But I think that there's a lot of times we take pictures and you know, no matter, you
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:13.260]   know, you're, I don't know.
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:18.180]   I'm saying that I think everybody should want, should want the best photos they can possibly
[01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:19.180]   take.
[01:41:19.180 --> 01:41:21.180]   There is a point at which like here's the level of.
[01:41:21.180 --> 01:41:26.260]   But I think that the photo above that the photo that the thing that sells, I think the
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:31.100]   thing that would distinguish a phone for me is someone's birthday party with the only
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:35.340]   the, with only the candles and it says, this is what your kid looks like with this camera.
[01:41:35.340 --> 01:41:38.140]   And this is what your kid looks like with the camera that you own right now.
[01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:40.660]   You know, when you take the picture when he, when they're, you know, blowing out the candles
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:43.060]   and one is a mess and the other one looks great.
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:45.060]   And that's what, that's what people need to know.
[01:41:45.060 --> 01:41:46.060]   They can do with their phone.
[01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:50.780]   Oh, so when I'll point out, if you go to Flickr and look at the images taken by each,
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:52.860]   this is his ear iPhone five images.
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:54.540]   Oh, and they take great photos.
[01:41:54.540 --> 01:41:58.060]   I'm just saying that people are getting good photos, even with no apps with that iPhone
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:41:59.060]   five.
[01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:00.260]   It is just like, but what, what an average person.
[01:42:00.260 --> 01:42:04.500]   Well, the iPhone five is consistently the, I wouldn't say that I think that the 10, the
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:10.220]   Nokia 1020 and the iPhone five S are tied for best camera phone for different reasons.
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:14.660]   But in terms of shot for shot consistency, I don't think anything could beat the five
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:19.060]   S I'm consistently impressed with what is getting out of that tiny little sensor in that
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:20.060]   tiny, tiny little lens.
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:23.980]   And I think one of the reasons why people don't think they need a real camera is because they
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:25.460]   get these snapshots and they're phenomenal.
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:27.620]   These are, these are limited.
[01:42:27.620 --> 01:42:32.380]   Just to be fair, Lumia 1020 photos and some very, very good photos as well.
[01:42:32.380 --> 01:42:38.500]   The key difference is that the 1020 can get pictures that no other camera can.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:41.980]   And they're, they're, when, when I was comparing, before the five S came out, when I was comparing
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:45.140]   it with the iPhone five, it was humiliating the iPhone five.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.020]   The iPhone five wasn't anywhere in this cameras class.
[01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:49.020]   Yeah.
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:52.500]   Right now there's still a lot of circumstances under which you're like, okay, well, would
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:53.580]   have been nice to have a real flash.
[01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:54.580]   I don't have a real flash.
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:58.620]   Like I can't take this picture or it would have been nice to simply tell this camera,
[01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:03.180]   look, I need you to use a really, really short shutter speed.
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:04.980]   I know you're going to want to hold that shutter open.
[01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:06.700]   I'm telling you, don't do that.
[01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:11.660]   You really, whatever you have to do, but do not expose this for longer than one hundredth
[01:43:11.660 --> 01:43:12.660]   of a second.
[01:43:12.660 --> 01:43:17.260]   That, that simple fact leads to so many more like really good pictures from the Nokia that
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:19.140]   the iPhone just can't handle.
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:25.660]   Here is a, here's a one two thousandth of a second shot aperture f 2.2 from a Nokia
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:26.660]   1020.
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:28.260]   I don't, you couldn't do that on any other camera phone.
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:31.780]   I can't even, I could do one two thousandth of the 1020.
[01:43:31.780 --> 01:43:35.860]   And it's not even these like these freakish like one and a, okay, okay, if you're going
[01:43:35.860 --> 01:43:37.900]   to do a specialty soda like freezing a raindrop.
[01:43:37.900 --> 01:43:38.900]   Yes, of course.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:43.660]   It really is things like just in general photography, the iPhone does something, the
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:46.660]   iPhone five S does something weird that I've been trying to figure out.
[01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:49.580]   I've been talking to a lot of people to try to get at the truth of it.
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:53.380]   There are a lot of circumstances under which it will choose like a one 20th of a second
[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:58.780]   or one 40th of a second shutter speed when it's clearly had faster shutter speeds available.
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:03.780]   And that's the reason why this picture, the picture of this person is sort of in focus,
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:05.100]   but not really.
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:11.180]   That's the reason why the background is acceptable, but that's not really tax sharp.
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:14.620]   And that's just even when you don't manually override it in the Nokia, the Nokia seems
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:19.980]   to have been taught that look, try to go for short for shorter speeds if you possibly can.
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:25.540]   I don't know if it's a problem where I, Apple knows that the, this, that the iPhone has
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:29.620]   problems with higher ISO's or whatever, but it really is baffling sometimes.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:33.260]   I just wish that if there's one feature that Apple could add to the iPhone that if I,
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:38.300]   if I could buy, buy caveat and since they do one thing, it would be a simple addition
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:41.700]   to HDR, square, whatever, have an option.
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.340]   Simply say action.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:46.820]   That's simply said the user doesn't have to know that that's going to try to go for
[01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:48.540]   short shutter speeds over long.
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:52.460]   But if they did that, they would have fixed, I think half of the photos that did not come
[01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:57.540]   out well on the, on the iPhone five as Google Chrome has a Google has announced that Chrome
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:01.420]   apps are now available as they have been for Windows eight for some time for Apple.
[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:04.500]   These are desktop apps that run offline outside the browser.
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:08.820]   You actually get an app grid.
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:10.580]   They have a DJ program.
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:13.940]   They have a video editing program.
[01:45:13.940 --> 01:45:20.820]   Of course, Google stuff 500 PX Plex.
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:27.260]   Very interesting that Google has really kind of invaded the app ecosystem on the Macintosh.
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:29.140]   You want to make your MacBook into a pixel?
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:30.140]   Do you can do that now?
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.540]   Basically, that's what it is.
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:33.540]   It's a Chromebook.
[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:35.260]   These require Chrome, of course.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.380]   So you have to first install the latest version of Chrome.
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:41.020]   The other thing that has been, that came out recently, and I don't think I'm using an
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:49.220]   oddball version of Chrome, you can now say, okay, Google to your MacBook and it will start
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:52.460]   doing searches and so forth if you have Google running.
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:57.980]   And they have a little, this is Google voice search, hot word beta.
[01:45:57.980 --> 01:46:00.980]   Something to have been installed at some point.
[01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:02.300]   I don't know if that was me.
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:04.020]   I might have done that.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:05.020]   I don't know.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:06.820]   I got a little microphone on my menu bar.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:07.820]   Does it work?
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:08.820]   Yeah.
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:11.660]   Okay, Google.
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:18.700]   Tell Alex Lindsey that he is my best friend and if he would just give me that Mac Pro that
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:23.740]   he bought for a million dollars, I would be very grateful.
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:28.140]   It just does a search, doesn't know text messages.
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:29.140]   All right.
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:30.140]   We're going to go ahead.
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:35.340]   Actually, actually, you should, while we're all around speech and before we go to PICS,
[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:38.780]   Siri now understands questions that you're directing at Santa.
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:39.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.780 --> 01:46:40.780]   Really?
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:44.980]   It will, it's, I don't know what they added or what they added the front end, but now,
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:48.780]   I don't have the whole list in front of me, but you can do things like say, Santa Claus
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:53.700]   real and now Siri knows, I shouldn't tell, I shouldn't do a website web search on Santa
[01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:56.420]   Claus, not truthful because it might be a kid.
[01:46:56.420 --> 01:47:01.260]   So that's part of the repertoire of things that's, that Siri is a notes as an exception
[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:03.620]   and knows that, okay, this is my chance to be more personable.
[01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:07.460]   See now, now where it gets really scary is when you can say, Siri, what am I going to
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:08.460]   get for Christmas?
[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:09.460]   Ooh.
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:13.420]   And then Siri knowing all of your friends and all the things that they purchased on Amazon
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:17.380]   tell you, okay, well, you're, you know, you're a little, you're a little feature.
[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:18.860]   Yeah, that's a good, a cool feature.
[01:47:18.860 --> 01:47:19.860]   I don't know.
[01:47:19.860 --> 01:47:23.540]   But then in the end, it'll just go and then if you've been bad, it just, you see a coal.
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:28.140]   You know, red, red, red, or fortunately, we've been Santa bring me a Haswell Mac mini.
[01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:29.140]   Yes.
[01:47:29.140 --> 01:47:30.140]   Yes.
[01:47:30.140 --> 01:47:31.140]   We'll take it.
[01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:35.540]   10.9.1 is that Leo fixes Gmail other mail issues?
[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:36.540]   10.9.1.
[01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:37.540]   Yeah.
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:38.540]   Maverick's point.
[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:39.540]   All right.
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:45.020]   Let's, you know, if Gmail issues, I thought were fixed earlier, but, uh, they need to be
[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.020]   fixed more.
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.020]   They need to be fixed additionally.
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:48.020]   Yes.
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:49.020]   So here's the good news.
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:50.860]   10 a is still running great for me, by the way.
[01:47:50.860 --> 01:47:51.860]   You'd never upgraded.
[01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:58.900]   We don't upgrade updates are available for your computer, digital camera, raw 10.9.1.
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:00.580]   All right.
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:01.580]   Let me update it.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:07.580]   While we're doing that, let's talk about personal capital dot com as your life gets,
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:13.020]   as you get older, take it from me and your life gets more complicated, your financial
[01:48:13.020 --> 01:48:14.020]   life anyway.
[01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:16.620]   Uh, you know, more credit cards, more loans.
[01:48:16.620 --> 01:48:21.660]   Of course you've got checking accounts, one hopes retirement accounts, credit cards.
[01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:27.100]   Uh, it makes it harder and harder for you to keep track of what you've got and how to
[01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.780]   invest it.
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:33.900]   And I was very lucky to have interviewed last year, Bill Harris, who's a former CEO of
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:35.380]   PayPal and Intuit.
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:40.380]   We were talking about financial businesses and so forth and he had just founded personal
[01:48:40.380 --> 01:48:41.380]   capital.
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:42.380]   So I immediately signed up.

[01:49:08.420 --> 01:49:10.140]   with a financial advisor.

[01:50:08.020 --> 01:50:09.020]   that.

[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:22.700]   And for our picks of the week who wants to start, how about you all the way over out
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:24.260]   there in a liver pool?
[01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:27.460]   I feel bad because you've been kind of out in left field there.
[01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:30.260]   Don McAllister, screencast online.
[01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:31.260]   Right.
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:35.380]   Well, my pick is an existing gap that people probably used and might have used and gone
[01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:37.300]   away from, but they really need to revisit.
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:40.060]   And that's our movie, believe it or not.
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:44.180]   I've been doing a couple of, well, prepping for some upcoming tutorials and I've gone
[01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:46.020]   back to why I move you to have a look at it.
[01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:51.220]   And I've been really, really impressed with it on the Mac and especially on iOS as well.
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:55.060]   It's one of those applications that blows you away when you realize just what they've
[01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:59.740]   accomplished in putting iMovie onto an iOS device with the touch capabilities.
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:01.900]   And it's sheer power now.
[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:06.860]   It's got all sorts of things that you can do with iMovie on iOS, connected clips and
[01:51:06.860 --> 01:51:09.980]   picture in picture and transitions.
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:13.740]   It really is a wonderful little video editor and we're worth checking out.
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:16.300]   And of course, it's now free if you buy it with an iOS.
[01:51:16.300 --> 01:51:20.980]   If you buy an iOS iPad or iPhone, you get iMovie for free.
[01:51:20.980 --> 01:51:25.460]   And the Mac version as well, it's sort of taken a lot from Final Cut Pro X.
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:29.380]   Lots of new features in there which are bordering on professional, some of them, and very easy
[01:51:29.380 --> 01:51:34.020]   to use, but well worth revisiting if you've used it in the past or say you used iMovie HD
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:37.300]   and then your arms went up when the new version came out.
[01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:39.420]   It's tremendously improved and it's very, very good.
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:41.660]   You know, it's funny you should say that was just talking with Lisa.
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:44.820]   She wants her son, her son's interested in video editing because he does YouTube.
[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:45.820]   Right?
[01:51:45.820 --> 01:51:46.820]   And everybody wants to make YouTube apps.
[01:51:46.820 --> 01:51:47.820]   And she said, "We should get Final Cut."
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:48.820]   And I said, "Wait a minute.
[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.820]   No, I think you should really start with iMovie."
[01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:52.380]   That's a great way to learn.
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:54.420]   And timeline editing is timeline editing.
[01:51:54.420 --> 01:51:55.900]   If you learn it, am I wrong?
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:56.900]   Well, it's very different.
[01:51:56.900 --> 01:51:59.820]   I mean, iMovie and Final Cut are different than all the other ones.
[01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:00.820]   I mean, it's a different--
[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:01.820]   You'll be coming to it with Final Cut.
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:06.580]   But if you learn iMovie, it's designed so that you can move from iMovie to Final Cut.
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:07.580]   Right.
[01:52:07.580 --> 01:52:09.500]   Is it hard to move from something like Final Cut to Premiere or--
[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:10.500]   It's very different.
[01:52:10.500 --> 01:52:11.500]   Yeah.
[01:52:11.500 --> 01:52:12.500]   It's a very different ecosystem.
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:13.500]   Interesting.
[01:52:13.500 --> 01:52:17.820]   So it's very similar to iMovie and Final Cut operate in a very similar fashion.
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:23.860]   But for to go to a traditional timeline is hard.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:27.420]   I do think that a lot of what you're learning is editing.
[01:52:27.420 --> 01:52:32.140]   Well, I mean, what really makes a great edit is the creative end of the Walter--
[01:52:32.140 --> 01:52:33.140]   You're getting an eye.
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:35.820]   --level of figuring out what's good timing.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:39.820]   I think that that's way more important than figuring out what to hit.
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:43.820]   And I have to say, I use Final Cut 10 and I love it.
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:45.140]   And so I'm with you.
[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:49.740]   I think iMovie is better and better and a really great place for people to start if they want
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:50.740]   to start video editing.
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:51.740]   Yeah.
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:53.940]   It's more difficult if you come from a traditional video editing background or thing.
[01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:55.300]   We know it's fixed lights and stuff.
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:58.740]   But with iMovie now and this sort of moving timeline, it makes it so easy.
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:02.900]   You're just dropping clips in and some new keyboard combinations that you can use to
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:06.100]   insert clips into the timeline and drag and drop.
[01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:10.340]   And it really isn't a nice application now and it's very powerful.
[01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:14.500]   Edmonton Euler Guy and our chatroom wants to know, what do you use instead of iDVDs
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:16.300]   since that's gone?
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.300]   What are DVDs?
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:20.740]   Well, you can burn with iMovie though, right?
[01:53:20.740 --> 01:53:21.740]   Can't you?
[01:53:21.740 --> 01:53:22.740]   No, not with iMovie.
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:27.020]   You can with Final Cut Pro, but you can't Pro Cut 10, but you can't with iMovie.
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:28.020]   So weird.
[01:53:28.020 --> 01:53:29.020]   The whole move is what's--
[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:35.140]   I mean, they've got the new iMovie theater in iMovie now and that's a way of--
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:38.980]   once you've created your video, you can export it to iCloud and then you've got it on any
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:44.180]   iOS device on your Apple TV and also on your iOS devices as well on your Mac.
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:48.940]   Of course, you can then share that with people, but you share it as an attachment, a mail attachment,
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:50.340]   you can drop it to people.
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:54.100]   It's very much a digital distribution mechanism now rather than looking at the physical distribution
[01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:55.100]   mechanism.
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:57.700]   Mr. Tom McCallister, Screencast online.
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:02.460]   Don't forget the SCO Tutor app for your iPhone or iPad.
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:06.660]   You can find it all at screencastonline.com and it is a really great way to learn how to
[01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:09.940]   use iMovie and everything else on a Macintosh.
[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:13.940]   Well, the new iMovie tutorials will be out probably in about two weeks or so.
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:14.940]   Good.
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:15.940]   Good, good, good.
[01:54:15.940 --> 01:54:16.940]   Just in time for Christmas.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:21.300]   And SCO Tutor for Mac, iPad and iPhone.
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:22.300]   Great way to learn.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:24.220]   Yeah, there's some apps that I've got on the app sort of the way.
[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:29.260]   We are in the process of bringing a new app out in the new year with the single app which
[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:33.300]   will have all the tutorials and that you can just pick a mix from.
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:34.300]   Excellent.
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:35.300]   Thank you, Don.
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:36.300]   Thank you.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:37.300]   Always a pleasure having you on.
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:39.260]   Nice to be here.
[01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:41.540]   And let's get our pick from Renee.
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:43.300]   If it's that beanie I wanted.
[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:44.300]   Where'd you get that?
[01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:45.300]   An Apple store near you?
[01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:47.300]   No, that's the Apple Company store in Cupertino.
[01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:48.980]   You have to go to the mothership for those.
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:51.940]   But I've got something you might like just as much, Leo.
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:53.860]   One of our favorite things has been updated.
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:56.300]   The Hue app for iOS got an update yesterday.
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:57.300]   Ah!
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:59.180]   It's redone for iOS 7.
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:03.740]   It now has a handy sidebar navigation system.
[01:55:03.740 --> 01:55:05.740]   No longer uses those pull-ups and pull-downs.
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:06.740]   Hey, God.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:07.740]   Yeah, this didn't work with the...
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:09.220]   No.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:10.220]   And you can create...
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:13.260]   If you set your lights just the way you like them, you can immediately save from that
[01:55:13.260 --> 01:55:15.180]   screen and make that a preset.
[01:55:15.180 --> 01:55:19.340]   I use them in my studio here so I can, for example, with one button just turn everything
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:20.340]   off.
[01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:22.980]   And then you hit the podcast button and it all comes right back on.
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:25.140]   And the right color and everything.
[01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:26.140]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:29.060]   It's much better than the previous app was.
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:31.140]   It works with all your existing Hue lights.
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:32.140]   And they've been expanding.
[01:55:32.140 --> 01:55:34.180]   They went from the original bulb.
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:35.180]   They now have these Hue...
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:37.180]   You're the flat ones yet?
[01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:38.580]   Do you have the flat ones?
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:39.580]   Yep.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:40.580]   Oh.
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:43.060]   And you can get them standalone or you can get them that go into sockets.
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:47.420]   They even have exclusive to the Apple Store, a Disney version with Mickey Mouse ears that
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:51.380]   will time in with stories you read to your children.
[01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:55.500]   And they have long Hue light, sort of like rope lights that you can put around your doors
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.140]   or in your cabinets.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:00.220]   They're really making a big sort of ecosystem out of these.
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:03.020]   And you can control all of it from iOS or Android.
[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:04.980]   I have a shameful admission.
[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:07.500]   We moved a month ago, a little more than a month ago.
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.300]   I have my Hue's in a box.
[01:56:09.300 --> 01:56:11.980]   I haven't figured out where I want to put them.
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:12.980]   Everywhere.
[01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:15.820]   I have nine Hue's.
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:19.660]   And I don't know, the bedroom, the Dan, I don't know where to put my Hue's.
[01:56:19.660 --> 01:56:21.220]   I have two back there.
[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:22.220]   It's all here.
[01:56:22.220 --> 01:56:24.020]   Two here, two blooms on the side.
[01:56:24.020 --> 01:56:26.060]   I guess they never burn out, right?
[01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:29.540]   So you might as well just replace the lamps bit by bit with Hue's.
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:32.580]   And I just after talking to you guys about it and my friend Kevin was it.
[01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:33.780]   I got Sonos as well now.
[01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:36.980]   So all the lights and all the music are controlled from one iPhone and it's glorious.
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:37.980]   Isn't it awesome?
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:38.980]   Fantastic.
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:40.380]   And I guess one of our brothers is.
[01:56:40.380 --> 01:56:41.380]   One of our brothers is.
[01:56:41.380 --> 01:56:42.380]   I mentioned malicious hackers.
[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:44.380]   Everything inside his house could be a mess.
[01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:45.380]   My outside.
[01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:46.380]   I don't know.
[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:47.380]   I don't know.
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:51.020]   When he told me it was all his short list of things that he wanted to keep after he reviewed
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.020]   it.
[01:56:52.020 --> 01:56:53.020]   And that's good enough recommendation to me.
[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:54.540]   I'm really interested in it totally.
[01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:55.860]   Total home automation.
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:56.860]   Now I can do it.
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:56:58.380]   I'm not moving again ever.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:56:59.780]   They're taking me out in a pine box.
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:01.540]   So now I can.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.540]   Which isn't very long.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:03.540]   Just like Iron Man.
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:04.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:07.620]   You know, if you have NFC tags on that pine box, they'll be able to track you all the way
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:08.620]   through involving you.
[01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:09.620]   For the very old.
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:10.620]   Yes.
[01:57:10.620 --> 01:57:13.980]   Pretty soon with with with with with your Bluetooth, Ellie, and your I beacon.
[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:16.460]   And I'll just turn the light hue lights on wherever you are.
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:17.460]   Here comes Leo.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:21.020]   And then I'll set it up so that I'll put a put a little, a little Ibicon on my son's
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:22.020]   when he runs around.
[01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:23.260]   There's little red lights before he gets there.
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:24.260]   So I can.
[01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:26.860]   But this too, like the hue supports geofencing.
[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:28.500]   So when you get home, your lights will just come on.
[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:29.500]   And when you leave, they'll just go.
[01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:33.180]   I mean, there's a lot of really interesting things when the Internet of things starts to
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.180]   become intelligent.
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:35.180]   Yeah.
[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:36.180]   Yeah.
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:37.180]   And you can use if this than that.
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:38.180]   Yes.
[01:57:38.180 --> 01:57:39.180]   Which is nice.
[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:41.220]   One of our producers actually has.
[01:57:41.220 --> 01:57:45.260]   I was just going to say has has if this then that hooked up so that one of his hue lights
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:48.540]   blinks when there's weather warnings and you know, it's.
[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:49.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:50.540]   I'm just trying.
[01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:53.140]   You know, I need I only have nine bulbs.
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:54.140]   I guess I need more.
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:56.020]   Oh, just throughout the house.
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:57.340]   The first third problem.
[01:57:57.340 --> 01:58:03.700]   Once again, the new hue app is here free if you if you spend all that money for use.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:04.700]   Yes.
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:05.700]   Mr. Lindsay.
[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:06.700]   Pick of the week.
[01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:07.700]   You got two picks.
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:08.700]   All right.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:10.180]   One pick is so we've been working on.
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:11.500]   I think that's pronounced Tupac.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:12.500]   Tupac.
[01:58:12.500 --> 01:58:13.500]   Okay.
[01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:16.260]   So we've been we use a lot of microphones.
[01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:19.780]   So one of the things I'm going to be doing a lot of on my picks is when we're trying
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:23.580]   to build build stuff, I have a tendency to buy like a whole bunch of things and then test
[01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:27.300]   all of them and try to figure out which one makes sense and I think about sending them
[01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:29.860]   back and then I just keep them.
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:36.060]   But what we're looking for is a handheld mic that was USB by handheld.
[01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:39.420]   So not a yeti, not something, you know, something someone could hold up while they're, you know,
[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:43.700]   in an event that sounds relatively good, but it's USB.
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:46.860]   So someone doesn't have to figure out how to use an interface.
[01:58:46.860 --> 01:58:52.940]   And so far the best one that we've found and we bought a bunch of them is this.
[01:58:52.940 --> 01:58:57.660]   It's an audio technica, ATR 2100 and it's got a little on off switch.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:59:02.300]   You can of course have zero latency, you know, headphone on the bottom.
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:04.980]   Here's one of the cool things though is it does have if you decide you want to go up,
[01:59:04.980 --> 01:59:09.740]   it does have an XLR, you know, output so that you can hook it into a mixer.
[01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:13.340]   If you decide you want to grow a little bit or you need a longer cable.
[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:18.460]   But again, we've been really, I mean, I went through a lot of really bad mics that were.
[01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:22.740]   And I think this is in the, I believe it's in the $60, $70 range.
[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:27.420]   But it's, you know, I wouldn't say it's the same quality as something like a yeti or something
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:32.700]   like that as far as, but as you're in definitely not a high all, but it's more like an SM58.
[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:35.100]   I've you, we've been using these for a while now.
[01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:36.100]   These little handheld.
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:37.100]   Yeah, audio technica.
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:40.100]   So the show is well, I've got mine hooked up.
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:42.100]   Is that what you're using?
[01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:43.100]   The 2100?
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:45.260]   Yeah, it's really, I use it with the XLR connection.
[01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:46.260]   And it's great.
[01:59:46.260 --> 01:59:47.860]   I use it for the screencast now as well.
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:48.860]   It's really good.
[01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:50.860]   Yeah, because we've been trying to figure out what we send out to someone if we've got
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:53.820]   like a group of people that want to be in a hangout specifically.
[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:56.820]   And we don't want them to have an open speaker with a lab or an open mic because you get
[01:59:56.820 --> 01:59:57.900]   echo and everything else.
[01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:00.100]   And so I think this is the one we're going to.
[02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:01.980]   So I'm glad that you're using that one as well.
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:02.980]   So it's really good.
[02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:03.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:03.980 --> 02:00:04.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:04.980 --> 02:00:05.980]   There you go.
[02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:06.980]   And very flexible, which is nice.
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:07.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:08.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:09.980]   It's great.
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:13.860]   I just have to say this because QuickTime 7 Pro.
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:15.260]   Is this still around?
[02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:18.700]   Still effing bitter about QuickTime 10.
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:23.580]   So I was like, you know, someone was like, well, you can do a lot more with QuickTime 10,
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:25.460]   like two days ago as well as I opened up QuickTime 10.
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:28.360]   And they have added a lot of features and it still sucks.
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:31.060]   So anyway, you have to--
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:32.060]   Where do we find it?
[02:00:32.060 --> 02:00:33.060]   I'm at apple.com/quicktime.
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:34.060]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:36.780]   If you just search, you can still download QuickTime 7.5 or 7.7.7.
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:38.260]   We have a package of it.
[02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:41.980]   And I don't know if you can buy the upgrade anymore to Final Cut.
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:42.980]   I mean, to QuickTime Pro.
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:45.500]   Yeah, I think it's about $30 a thing.
[02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:47.100]   Can you still buy it?
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:48.100]   I think you can.
[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:49.700]   Yeah, it's like $30 worth every penny.
[02:00:49.700 --> 02:00:54.740]   Still, like when you're trying to just do a quick edit, clip things out, I use it every
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:55.740]   day.
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:01:00.180]   In fact, I have all my movies, all my QuickTime movies on my Mac are set to-- by default,
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:02.980]   they don't open QuickTime 10, which makes me angry when it opens.
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:04.340]   Like, as soon as it opens, I get angry.
[02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:06.140]   I have to go and take a riddle in.
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:07.140]   You know?
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:08.140]   No.
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:09.140]   So I have a lot of features.
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:10.140]   I have a lot of cool features.
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:11.140]   I have a lot of cool features.
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:15.940]   They have, but the trimming still is horrible, and the export is still opaque.
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:19.860]   And it's just-- there it is.
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:20.860]   There it is.
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:22.340]   There you can still buy QuickTime 7 Pro.
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:23.700]   You can still buy it.
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:24.700]   Still buy it.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:32.380]   And if you're wondering how to quickly trim your movies in a way that actually works,
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:34.860]   that's still the quickest, easiest, cheapest way to do it.
[02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:38.900]   It's got lots of little features of being able to extract channels and trim channels
[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:40.140]   and add things on top.
[02:01:40.140 --> 02:01:44.780]   And it's such a great app that Apple just totally threw into the trash with an update.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.420]   Anyway, not that I'm bitter.
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:50.220]   It happens-- seems like it happens a lot, to be honest.
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:52.220]   It just speaks about it.
[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:53.220]   It's a bad campaign.
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:56.700]   If you go to the Apple store, that's where you-- the app is stored at Apple.com.
[02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:59.140]   You can actually still buy QuickTime 7 Pro.
[02:01:59.140 --> 02:02:01.660]   I mean, if they-- literally, they've got rid of a quicktime X.
[02:02:01.660 --> 02:02:05.020]   They got rid of QuickTime X and re-released QuickTime 7.
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:06.940]   I would-- I'd be happy.
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:07.940]   - Shoppe, it's a short show.
[02:02:07.940 --> 02:02:10.180]   There's nothing about QuickTime 10 that I would miss.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:12.500]   Andy and Aco, your pick of the week.
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:13.860]   I have two.
[02:02:13.860 --> 02:02:19.260]   One is-- we talked about one beloved and Aco household family tradition being Patrick Stewart
[02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:20.420]   reading at Christmas Carol.
[02:02:20.420 --> 02:02:25.340]   Another one is the unannounced David Letterman Christmas show.
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:31.460]   Every year, they have a tradition in which-- it varies a little bit, but they're almost
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.420]   always the same three components.
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:40.020]   Number one, Paul Schafer tells his story of watching Cher on the 1974 Christmas special
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:41.060]   saying, oh, holy night.
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.340]   And does his impression of Cher.
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:49.780]   Jay Thomas tells his story about driving the Lone Ranger back from a radio show appearance
[02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:51.100]   while stoned.
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:55.500]   There's the late night quarterback, Holiday Quarterback Challenge in which Dave and Jay
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:02:59.860]   try to throw footballs at the top of Christmas tree and knock the meatball off the top of
[02:02:59.860 --> 02:03:00.860]   the tree.
[02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:02.180]   Trust me, it works.
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:08.460]   And then the most important one of all, darling love sings Christmas baby, please come home.
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:12.500]   And they put-- it's like they-- if anything looked cheap on the Letterman show for the
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:17.220]   previous three weeks, it's because they knew that they're going to be hiring 40 more musicians,
[02:03:17.220 --> 02:03:20.660]   they're going to be putting costumes on every member of the band, they're going to be renting
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:25.620]   the snow machine, they're going to be making a special, you will tie backdrop.
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:30.780]   It sounds as though I'm being sarcastic, but after seeing them do this for about the
[02:03:30.780 --> 02:03:35.180]   time, I think they even started on the NBC show in the late '80s.
[02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:37.580]   And they've been doing it every year, every since.
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:42.300]   And to me, it's not-- it's part of the Christmas celebration that I hear darling love sing Christmas
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:44.380]   baby, please come home.
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:46.660]   Now I've checked the CBS site.
[02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:49.900]   It's going to be this Friday because darling love is in the lineup.
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:55.900]   I am informed by a reliable source that Jay Thomas unfortunately cannot appear due to recovering
[02:03:55.900 --> 02:04:00.580]   from some sort of a neck surgery that he's not quite-- he's not able to participate in
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:02.380]   the late night holiday quarterback challenge.
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:07.100]   So he's on the-- he's on the DL this year, but it'll still be very, very much worth it.
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:08.340]   That's free.
[02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:13.020]   If you don't have time to see it or if you miss it, you will be able to go to YouTube
[02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:18.420]   and you will see the 10 years, 20 years of darling love singing Christmas baby, please
[02:04:18.420 --> 02:04:19.420]   come home.
[02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:22.700]   And you will understand why in this household it is quite so beloved.
[02:04:22.700 --> 02:04:27.260]   The second pick though is Anki Drive, which you certainly heard of.
[02:04:27.260 --> 02:04:34.020]   It was the race car blue to that league game that was demonstrated at the WWDC over the
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:35.420]   summer.
[02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:41.540]   I like it's a better pick for me as a Christmas under the tree gift than it would have been
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:47.700]   like in October or September as a just thought we'd buy this and thought we'd give this to
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:50.380]   the birthday gift because it's a fun, fun game.
[02:04:50.380 --> 02:04:55.420]   I don't know if you if if if people remember it is the game where you are is physical race
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:05:00.060]   cars on like a vinyl track where the cars have little optical sensors, they can sense
[02:05:00.060 --> 02:05:03.500]   their position on the track and the whatever cars are not being controlled by people with
[02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:09.460]   phones, they are actually being controlled by the game with a certain level of of AI
[02:05:09.460 --> 02:05:10.460]   involved.
[02:05:10.460 --> 02:05:11.740]   So they move intelligently.
[02:05:11.740 --> 02:05:15.020]   They try to block other cars intelligently.
[02:05:15.020 --> 02:05:19.300]   And it really is very responsive and really it's awesome.
[02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:23.700]   It's not only that, it really it really does try to pull in the idea of slot car racing.
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:28.140]   I obviously you steer by turning the phone, but it's not the sort of thing where oh I
[02:05:28.140 --> 02:05:31.500]   oversteer to now it's off the track and I have to walk over and pick it up when you
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:34.060]   actually steer because it knows where it is on the track.
[02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:37.340]   It just interprets that as okay, he wants me to go on the inside.
[02:05:37.340 --> 02:05:38.900]   No, no, he wants me to go to the outside.
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:43.060]   Now he wants me to do this that the other also these cars can shoot at each other and
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:48.340]   slow each other down because the batteries in these things actually have it was really
[02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:52.740]   well thought out because these are these are the when you the $200 kit comes with the mat
[02:05:52.740 --> 02:05:55.780]   and two different cars.
[02:05:55.780 --> 02:05:58.020]   And the cars these are the actual charging.
[02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:01.740]   It's not only the car carrying case, but it's also a charging station.
[02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:06.900]   So that's just a standard micro micro my standard micro USB, but it also comes with an adapter
[02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:10.900]   that can charge both of those cars and a third one at the same time.
[02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:14.660]   And so these are real cool.
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:18.500]   And it's as you can see it docks into this and it gets a gets a hard connection.
[02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:22.260]   And you can see in the bottom where you can see these optical sensor, which reading the
[02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:29.380]   track, it gets about eight minutes of life off of every charge and about a 20 minute,
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:31.340]   maybe 15 minutes to recharge.
[02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:35.340]   So it's not like it's going to stop you for the entire day to reset.
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:43.340]   So I have a six year old and a short a short life on these electronics is actually a feature
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:44.340]   not a bug.
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.340]   Yes.
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:47.780]   You want them to be like something that lasts like three hours.
[02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:49.260]   You will use it for three hours.
[02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:50.900]   And so yes.
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:55.620]   So as a result, because the last eight minutes, there isn't a straightforward racing game
[02:06:55.620 --> 02:06:56.620]   for it yet.
[02:06:56.620 --> 02:07:02.220]   The game that it plays is again, pursuit, intercept, destroy, where you get points every time you
[02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:04.300]   shoot and slow down.
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:08.500]   Every time you shoot another car, you get points every time you and you can slow it down so
[02:07:08.500 --> 02:07:09.740]   you can get around it.
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:12.620]   Meanwhile, these other cars, even the autonomous ones are doing the same to you.
[02:07:12.620 --> 02:07:14.620]   And again, they're not just simply looping around the track.
[02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:15.820]   They know where your car is.
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:17.760]   They know where it's where itself is.
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:20.380]   So it's making really, really smart decisions.
[02:07:20.380 --> 02:07:21.420]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:22.780]   You can it comes with two cars.
[02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:24.400]   You can purchase additional cars.
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:28.340]   Each one has its own individual personality on how it drives.
[02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:32.980]   And again, anything not being operated by a human will be operated by by robot.
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:38.300]   Now the other thing I really like about this is that there's so much they can do with this
[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:39.600]   in the future.
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:42.820]   Most of the expense of this additional cars are 70 bucks.
[02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:47.220]   So given that this is a $200 thing, you get two cars with a think of it as $140 worth
[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:50.400]   of cars and then $60 for the mat and stuff like that.
[02:07:50.400 --> 02:07:54.160]   But the thing is they can add they can update the app and add more games.
[02:07:54.160 --> 02:07:56.920]   So they've wanted to do a pure racing game.
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:59.000]   They could do a pure racing game.
[02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.040]   If they wanted to come out with a larger mat with a trickier course, they could do that
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:04.040]   too.
[02:08:04.040 --> 02:08:10.160]   So I don't feel as though this is like a you know, your traditional Sears 1978 wishbook
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:14.160]   slot car set where once you take it out of the box, whatever you can do with it out of
[02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:17.140]   the box on Christmas day is the only thing you can do with it.
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:20.660]   I think that definitely buy it because you're happy with what it does right now.
[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:24.900]   But I think it's certainly likely that next year you'll as the months go by, you'll see
[02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:26.580]   more features and more games.
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:30.860]   And it also really made me think about how cool if they if this thing works out for the
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:35.180]   company and they continue to develop this again, the only the only bummer of it is having
[02:08:35.180 --> 02:08:39.260]   to, you know, stop and recharge these things when they run out of juice and the game is
[02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:40.260]   over.
[02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:43.300]   It would be great if they could do I would love to see them do version two be like a
[02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:47.040]   l'amonde style game where it's actually you have like a racing team, so to speak up two
[02:08:47.040 --> 02:08:48.400]   or three cars.
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:53.800]   And when it runs low on on on battery, you pit out it goes into like a wireless charging
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:54.800]   station.
[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:56.080]   So it's just now it's on this pad.
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.600]   So now it's charging for 10 minutes.
[02:08:57.600 --> 02:09:00.480]   And then your second car can peel out and take over the race.
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:04.080]   So one can be like that pit stops.
[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:09.480]   So anyway, so it's it's a lot more fun than than you think you've the idea of going around
[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:11.800]   in a circle with a little bit of a bend in it.
[02:09:11.800 --> 02:09:15.920]   As I said, I think it takes a special you need to have a special kind of pocketbook to buy
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:19.400]   $200 gift that is only a racing game.
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:23.900]   But it's the it's the perfect kind of Christmas present where I'm sure it'll be played for
[02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:26.260]   53 hours straight.
[02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:28.580]   December 25 26 27.
[02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:30.340]   It will tail off of it after that.
[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:33.560]   But leave me anytime there was more than two kids in the house.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:35.460]   And one of them has never played this game before.
[02:09:35.460 --> 02:09:39.140]   It will be you will be you will be asked to move the coffee table off the middle of the
[02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:42.020]   phone for floor. You will be laying down the mat and they will be playing this game.
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:44.180]   How big is the mat?
[02:09:44.180 --> 02:09:47.100]   It's about the three feet.
[02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:49.060]   More than five on this table.
[02:09:49.060 --> 02:09:50.060]   Yeah.
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:51.060]   Thank you, pro.
[02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:54.700]   And by the way, I just want to point out Alex and we thank you for taking your time
[02:09:54.700 --> 02:09:55.700]   describing this.
[02:09:55.700 --> 02:10:00.540]   Both Alex and I purchased it during your your pitch.
[02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:04.420]   You'll have four cars you could do like no, no, we both bought extra cars.
[02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:07.940]   We have eight cars.
[02:10:07.940 --> 02:10:08.940]   It is it is great.
[02:10:08.940 --> 02:10:12.300]   So I was going to make it my pick last week and I was really, really determined to say
[02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:15.900]   now is there a way that can set up a computer in the living room because I don't have room
[02:10:15.900 --> 02:10:17.340]   in the studio to lay out the mat.
[02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:22.060]   So I really want to just be like sitting in the middle like we'll bring it.
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:23.540]   I'm going to have it for New Year's Eve.
[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:25.940]   We're going to do it during our New Year's Eve broadcast.
[02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:26.940]   Bring your car.
[02:10:26.940 --> 02:10:29.220]   I'm glad that my son doesn't watch this show.
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:30.220]   I know.
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:32.380]   I'm glad my son doesn't watch either.
[02:10:32.380 --> 02:10:33.380]   It's a great gift.
[02:10:33.380 --> 02:10:36.660]   And I'm saying that if all this company does, they don't change the software.
[02:10:36.660 --> 02:10:37.660]   They don't change anything.
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:42.780]   All they do is come out with a larger mat that's about the size of a king size bed.
[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:47.780]   And that's just a huge, huge surface that that would be that would make it even even
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:48.780]   50% more fun.
[02:10:48.780 --> 02:10:49.780]   I phone only though.
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:51.420]   We got to mention iPhone iPod.
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:55.980]   I touch as the most fun things happen when things you can hold with your hands.
[02:10:55.980 --> 02:10:57.380]   So they actually happen with the iPhone.
[02:10:57.380 --> 02:10:59.100]   No, no Android.
[02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:00.100]   No Android.
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:01.100]   So make sure if you buy it.
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:02.260]   iPod touch to right.
[02:11:02.260 --> 02:11:03.260]   Yeah.
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:05.500]   If you buy it for your kid or whatever.
[02:11:05.500 --> 02:11:07.700]   Would you use an iPad?
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:08.700]   I think so.
[02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:09.700]   It shouldn't.
[02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:11.180]   All it requires is Bluetooth, LA and iOS.
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:12.180]   OK.
[02:11:12.180 --> 02:11:13.980]   And so I'm guessing that I haven't tried on my iPad.
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:19.260]   I might be a little less fun to hold it like this because it's just because I'm, you know,
[02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:22.260]   we're that generation where at some point we were at a friend's house and we did get
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:24.460]   to play with their awesome slot car set.
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:27.460]   And so we're not think we're not holding it like this.
[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:28.460]   We're holding it like this.
[02:11:28.460 --> 02:11:29.460]   Right.
[02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:30.460]   Right.
[02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:31.460]   So we want something small.
[02:11:31.460 --> 02:11:35.000]   Go to fly.com if you want to find out more about it.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.820]   Slokar, you know, thank you for the Canadian flag.
[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:38.820]   I'm sorry.
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:39.820]   I'm sorry.
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:42.460]   You just said both of you.
[02:11:42.460 --> 02:11:48.420]   What's funny is when we first moved to Petaluma, there was a slot car store like storefront
[02:11:48.420 --> 02:11:52.660]   where they had a giant slot car layout and you could go and do it.
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:53.920]   I wish they'd stayed in business.
[02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:55.400]   That would have been that was fun.
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:56.400]   I remember that.
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:57.400]   Remember that?
[02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:01.140]   No, I remember doing that in in in Nautrona Heights, Pennsylvania.
[02:12:01.140 --> 02:12:04.720]   I've had three or I've had many or newer will also work with.
[02:12:04.720 --> 02:12:08.620]   It's Anki, not Janky, says Pizza Plus.
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:13.020]   Well I was going to make a quick pick, but I'll do it real quickly.
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:16.180]   It is now out for Macintosh.
[02:12:16.180 --> 02:12:22.140]   It is I would say the best game I've ever played on the PC was an Xbox and PlayStation
[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:23.140]   game as well.
[02:12:23.140 --> 02:12:26.980]   Bioshock Infinite, $40 available on the Macintosh.
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:29.460]   Finally, you know, it takes a little while to port these over.
[02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:34.420]   You do read the requirements, the system requirements before you buy it, but it is an
[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:36.820]   amazing first person shooter.
[02:12:36.820 --> 02:12:39.380]   Really, really stylish and gorgeous.
[02:12:39.380 --> 02:12:43.180]   If you played the first two Bioshocks, this one is even better and you're now in the sky
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:44.500]   floating in the city.
[02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:45.500]   Love this.
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:47.260]   You see your Mac Pro and 4K monitor play it on Leo.
[02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:50.900]   I am hoping to play this on my Mac Pro before the end of the year.
[02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:51.900]   Yes.
[02:12:51.900 --> 02:12:52.900]   Yes.
[02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:53.900]   Great game.
[02:12:53.900 --> 02:12:55.820]   Oh, apparently iBooks gifting just went live.
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:56.820]   Whoa!
[02:12:56.820 --> 02:12:59.220]   You can finally gift your iBooks.
[02:12:59.220 --> 02:13:01.220]   You mean books you've already purchased?
[02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:04.620]   No, so previously you couldn't do gifts on the iBook store.
[02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:07.500]   Like you could on the App Store and the iTunes store.
[02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:08.500]   And now apparently that works.
[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:09.500]   Now you can.
[02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:10.500]   Yep.
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:11.500]   Thank you all.
[02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:12.500]   It's been great fun.
[02:13:12.500 --> 02:13:15.540]   Happy holidays, Don, and to you and Barbara.
[02:13:15.540 --> 02:13:18.100]   And I hope you have a wonderful Christmas.
[02:13:18.100 --> 02:13:19.100]   Same to you.
[02:13:19.100 --> 02:13:20.100]   Same to you.
[02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:24.740]   Coming over to, you're going to be a serious this year.
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:25.740]   I will not.
[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:28.340]   We will have a team there, but I'm going to manage to avoid that.
[02:13:28.340 --> 02:13:30.020]   Are you going to, you're going over to see?
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:31.020]   Yes.
[02:13:31.020 --> 02:13:32.020]   Yeah, welcome to the new media expo.
[02:13:32.020 --> 02:13:33.020]   Yeah, I'll be at that.
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:34.020]   I'll be at the media expo.
[02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:35.020]   I'm keen on there.
[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:36.020]   So we'll see that.
[02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:37.020]   Is that before or after?
[02:13:37.020 --> 02:13:39.220]   Before they do it before at the Rio.
[02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:41.460]   So the people can go to that and then stay for CES.
[02:13:41.460 --> 02:13:42.460]   I'll probably wander over.
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:44.060]   We'll be setting up where to end the streaming.
[02:13:44.060 --> 02:13:47.780]   I'm doing a number of things I think on Monday at the new media expo.
[02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:48.780]   Great.
[02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:49.780]   I'll see you then.
[02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:50.780]   Yeah, look forward to it.
[02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:52.300]   That's the, you know, that's, I have to go.
[02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:53.940]   It's the trade show for our people.
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:56.020]   I used to go and then they just stopped calling me.
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:57.020]   Oh.
[02:13:57.020 --> 02:13:58.460]   And then I'll do a podcast anymore.
[02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:00.900]   You have to get an invitation.
[02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:01.900]   Thank you, Don.
[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:02.900]   Screencast online.com.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:08.500]   Andy Inaco, the Chicago Sun Times, the Celestial Waste of Ban with the, it's, now somebody said
[02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:10.500]   I was saying the name of your show on five by five wrong.
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:11.500]   It's a not goes on.
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:12.500]   Manac, isn't it?
[02:14:12.500 --> 02:14:13.500]   It is the a not go on.
[02:14:13.500 --> 02:14:16.700]   Oh, it's a single not, not possessive.
[02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:17.700]   The Inaco.
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:18.900]   I'm on the neck.
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:22.340]   I pride myself on being non-prepresessing.
[02:14:22.340 --> 02:14:24.220]   There's no possession involved.
[02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:29.180]   And also, also if you, if you're just tuning in, this is a good week because I will tomorrow
[02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:35.220]   night I'm recording my official detractors commentary of, of, of, of, of, uh, White Christmas,
[02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:36.220]   the movie.
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:39.940]   So if you want to, if you can download this episode, play it alongside White Christmas
[02:14:39.940 --> 02:14:41.500]   on Netflix and here.
[02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:42.820]   Oh, that sounds like fun.
[02:14:42.820 --> 02:14:44.580]   Everything that I like and for you.
[02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:45.580]   Sisters.
[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:46.580]   Sisters.
[02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:47.580]   Is it that one?
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:48.740]   No, that's, that's it.
[02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:49.740]   Okay.
[02:14:49.740 --> 02:14:53.140]   Never where they're such devoted sisters.
[02:14:53.140 --> 02:14:57.420]   Danny, you and I could maybe do that for New Year's Eve for our show.
[02:14:57.420 --> 02:15:01.540]   Now, okay, if you're, if you're saying the version in which Bing Crosby and Danny Kay
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:04.460]   are pretending to be those two, that would work.
[02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:05.460]   Yes.
[02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:09.820]   If we have to wear the full gowns as though I'll say no, because, because I've always
[02:15:09.820 --> 02:15:11.820]   wanted to sing while wearing sock garters.
[02:15:11.820 --> 02:15:15.180]   I love Danny Kay.
[02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:16.820]   That's a great movie.
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:20.020]   All day in is the other one, the original with Fred Astaire.
[02:15:20.020 --> 02:15:21.020]   That's a different one.
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:22.020]   That's the one.
[02:15:22.020 --> 02:15:25.380]   I like that one more because for God's sake, Fred Astaire and also his, his, things perform
[02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:26.380]   so White Christmas is better.
[02:15:26.380 --> 02:15:31.220]   Of course, if you get, you have to get the edited version without the Lincoln's birthday.
[02:15:31.220 --> 02:15:36.500]   That's the problem with all day in is it's not just Christmas is every holiday, including
[02:15:36.500 --> 02:15:39.940]   a blackface Lincoln's birthday.
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:45.780]   Not just the most horrifying, just not, not even the, okay, I've seen Al Jolson, you know,
[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:47.460]   okay, I'm ready for this.
[02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:50.260]   And you think it's the, okay, everything, the worst has happened.
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:54.260]   And then another character comes on and you're like, oh, I can't get any worse.
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.500]   Hey, it was that was the time.
[02:15:56.500 --> 02:16:00.900]   I was with the time throughout this TV and finding what it's.
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:04.380]   Alex Lindsay's travels have ended for the holidays, I hope.
[02:16:04.380 --> 02:16:05.380]   Yes.
[02:16:05.380 --> 02:16:07.620]   My next travel is actually just to LA for with the family.
[02:16:07.620 --> 02:16:08.620]   Good.
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:09.620]   Stick around for a little bit.
[02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:10.620]   Maybe we'll see you next week.
[02:16:10.620 --> 02:16:11.620]   Yes.
[02:16:11.620 --> 02:16:12.620]   I'm here.
[02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:13.620]   Actually, are we doing a show next week?
[02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:15.620]   No, that's our best of Christmas Eve.
[02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:18.220]   Yeah, it's Christmas Eve one week.
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:19.220]   Wow.
[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:20.660]   You and I just did our Christmas shopping.
[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:22.660]   Didn't you notice that?
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:23.660]   Exactly.
[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:24.660]   On the show.
[02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:25.780]   So I won't be here next week.
[02:16:25.780 --> 02:16:31.580]   So not next week, but the week after maybe New Year's Eve, we are doing a special Mac
[02:16:31.580 --> 02:16:32.580]   Break Weekly on New Year's Eve.
[02:16:32.580 --> 02:16:33.580]   I invite you all to come.
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:35.180]   We'll be doing our slot cars.
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:36.180]   Yes.
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:37.180]   Nice.
[02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:39.180]   And you can you do yours remotely?
[02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:40.940]   We'll do mine remotely.
[02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:42.660]   Well, we should promise to drink.
[02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:47.820]   I've still got a bottle of whiskey from a friend in Ireland sent me the green pot whiskey.
[02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:50.660]   I will drink heavily during because it will be New Year's Eve.
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:51.660]   It's going to be fun.
[02:16:51.660 --> 02:16:55.980]   We start our New Year's Eve broadcast 4 AM New Year's Eve Day, 4 AM Pacific, 7 AM Eastern
[02:16:55.980 --> 02:17:01.420]   time New Year's Eve, December 31st.
[02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:06.500]   And we go right through January 1st, 2014, 4 AM, our time 7 AM Eastern time.
[02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:07.820]   It's a 24 hour broadcast.
[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:09.980]   I will be awake for the entire thing.
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:14.140]   That we'll be celebrating with people all around the world at the top of the hour.
[02:17:14.140 --> 02:17:17.380]   In some cases, at the bottom of the hour, and thinking one case a quarter after the hour.
[02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:18.860]   When does it start again?
[02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:23.780]   Well, in order to make that happen, we have to do the very first time zone, which celebrates
[02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:27.340]   it the entry into 2014 at 4 AM, our time New Year's.
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:28.980]   Can we start drinking in the morning now?
[02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:29.980]   You can drink at any...
[02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:31.980]   Yeah, by the way, I know that...
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:32.980]   No, the normal thing is that...
[02:17:32.980 --> 02:17:33.980]   You can come early.
[02:17:33.980 --> 02:17:34.980]   I could do it early.
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:35.980]   You don't...
[02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:37.780]   We're not taking over your night.
[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:38.940]   You can come here in the morning.
[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:40.940]   I can start making drinks like...
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:44.180]   It starts in the Kamchatka Peninsula.
[02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:47.380]   That's where the year begins, or New Zealand or Fiji.
[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:54.260]   That's at 4 AM Pacific, 12 midnight UTC, 12 noon, I'm sorry UTC.
[02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:58.260]   Then Norfolk Island, New Caledonia, Australia, Japan, China.
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:00.780]   I had big plans for that bar.
[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:01.780]   You kind of come.
[02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:05.900]   Leo, I'm going to make a suggestion that is going to increase the awesome, or increase
[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:09.580]   the fun for you in at least 20 percent.
[02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:12.940]   Different signature cocktail for every time zone.
[02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:17.300]   You think I will be alive at the end of this 24 hours?
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:19.540]   I guess I can do 24 cocktails in 24 hours.
[02:18:19.540 --> 02:18:20.540]   You'll be...
[02:18:20.540 --> 02:18:23.700]   You have the choice you can be alive and feeling no pain at the end of 24 hours.
[02:18:23.700 --> 02:18:28.220]   The really, the challenging one is going to be Myanmar.
[02:18:28.220 --> 02:18:33.140]   Well, there's one, two, three, there's like five in two hours.
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:36.660]   In fact, it's the two hours leading up to Macbreak Weekly.
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:46.460]   9 AM Pacific, we've got Thailand, 930 Myanmar, 10, we've got Bangladesh, 1045, we've got
[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:51.340]   Nepal, 1030, we've got India, and 11 AM, we've got Russia.
[02:18:51.340 --> 02:18:53.940]   So that's like six cocktails in half an hour.
[02:18:53.940 --> 02:18:58.460]   Well, at least promise me you'll do the Jerry Lewis thing where you'll have a tuxedo with
[02:18:58.460 --> 02:18:59.620]   the untyped vote.
[02:18:59.620 --> 02:19:02.100]   I ordered a tuxedo.
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:04.420]   I'm going to sing, "You'll Never Walk Alone" at the end of it.
[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:05.420]   It'll be amazing.
[02:19:05.420 --> 02:19:08.340]   Start parading stage hands at least 20 minutes in.
[02:19:08.340 --> 02:19:10.100]   This guy, I love this guy.
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:12.740]   She's the Ava Braun of our state.
[02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:13.740]   No, we have to.
[02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:14.740]   I eat.
[02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:15.740]   You saw when that's next.
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:18.380]   That's the Riker on stage who awkwardly hugged her so that if you prove to the audience that
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:20.380]   no, no, no, we're all big, very effective at all.
[02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:21.380]   We're all friends.
[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:22.380]   That's called her a Nazi, doesn't mean that I'd never...
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:23.380]   Ava Braun!
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:24.900]   You see my little cocktail glasses, right?
[02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:25.900]   Those little ones.
[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:28.140]   I could take a little one.
[02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:33.480]   So there are a total of 27 times as we will be doing TNT at its regular time, then Mac
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:37.420]   Break Weekly, then the Gizwiz before you buy all about Android and NSFW.
[02:19:37.420 --> 02:19:41.500]   I'll be there for all of those shows, but we also will be broadcasting in between.
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:42.500]   And then we'll do slot cars.
[02:19:42.500 --> 02:19:44.020]   We're going to do Dungeons and Dragons.
[02:19:44.020 --> 02:19:45.020]   We're going to have music.
[02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:46.020]   Awesome.
[02:19:46.020 --> 02:19:47.020]   Lots of surprises.
[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:48.020]   Which version of Dungeons and Dragons?
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:49.580]   I think D&E 5, I think.
[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:51.740]   I was thinking Warhammer 40,000.
[02:19:51.740 --> 02:19:54.540]   Oh, we could do Warhammer instead.
[02:19:54.540 --> 02:19:56.020]   Do we have the figurines?
[02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:57.020]   No.
[02:19:57.020 --> 02:19:59.020]   I mean, somebody's got a painting right away.
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:00.020]   I'm always done it virtually, I don't know.
[02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:02.100]   Somebody's going to get to do some painting.
[02:20:02.100 --> 02:20:05.300]   We have a Hobby Lobby in Petaluma.
[02:20:05.300 --> 02:20:07.540]   And thank you for being here also, Renee Ritchie.
[02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:11.260]   Imore.com, Crackberry.com, all of those great sites.
[02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:12.420]   You're going to CES.
[02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:17.900]   In fact, you and Callie Lewis are taking over the South Hall stage that we usually do our
[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:19.180]   shows from.
[02:20:19.180 --> 02:20:23.380]   So a big CES coverage from Geekbeat TV and I'm more.
[02:20:23.380 --> 02:20:24.380]   That'll be fun.
[02:20:24.380 --> 02:20:25.380]   I'm glad you're doing that.
[02:20:25.380 --> 02:20:26.380]   It's going to be...
[02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:27.380]   We'll be all the best homage to you.
[02:20:27.380 --> 02:20:28.380]   We can, Leo.
[02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:29.380]   No, it'll be great.
[02:20:29.380 --> 02:20:32.260]   In fact, I wish I could be there for that because that's going to be it.
[02:20:32.260 --> 02:20:33.260]   But I'll be watching.
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:34.260]   Absolutely awesome.
[02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:35.260]   Yep.
[02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:36.740]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[02:20:36.740 --> 02:20:38.060]   We do Mac Break Weekly.
[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:42.340]   Even in a day where we had no news, we ended up extending this for two hours and 19 minutes.
[02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:45.020]   There was a lot of rattle.
[02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:48.540]   It's worse when there's no news because we then we could talk about anything.
[02:20:48.540 --> 02:20:49.540]   Exactly.
[02:20:49.540 --> 02:20:50.540]   There is no roadmap.
[02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:51.540]   We are just simply...
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:52.540]   We start off rills.
[02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:55.740]   This is when listeners get to hear jazz Odyssey.
[02:20:55.740 --> 02:20:56.740]   Yeah.
[02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:57.740]   This is our version of jazz Odyssey.
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.700]   This is our answer to, are these guys really ADD or not?
[02:21:02.700 --> 02:21:06.020]   We do it normally 11am Pacific 2pm Eastern time.
[02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:10.660]   That's a 1900-8 UTC on Twitch.tv.
[02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:11.940]   And we're not moving this show.
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:14.580]   So starting in the new year, everything will be the same time.
[02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:16.940]   Some of the shows are moving, but not this one.
[02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:18.700]   So we look forward to seeing you in here live.
[02:21:18.700 --> 02:21:22.100]   If you can't get here live though, on-demand audio and video is always available after
[02:21:22.100 --> 02:21:23.740]   the fact.
[02:21:23.740 --> 02:21:27.100]   We're at twit.tv/mbw.
[02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:29.340]   And of course you could subscribe wherever.
[02:21:29.340 --> 02:21:32.740]   Find your net casts are offered and get it for free every single week.
[02:21:32.740 --> 02:21:33.740]   That way you won't miss one.
[02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:35.340]   My strong encouragement.
[02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:41.660]   We also appreciate it if you enjoy the show and you know Apple aficionados that you share
[02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:46.260]   it with them because it's your recommendations frankly that do the most for...
[02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:47.260]   We don't mark it.
[02:21:47.260 --> 02:21:48.300]   We just let you tell your friends.
[02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:49.900]   So please share the word.
[02:21:49.900 --> 02:21:51.700]   We are here for you.
[02:21:51.700 --> 02:21:52.700]   Thanks for joining us now.
[02:21:52.700 --> 02:21:54.100]   Get back to work everybody.
[02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:55.300]   Break time is over.
[02:21:55.300 --> 02:22:05.840]   [Music]
