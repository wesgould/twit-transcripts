[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:50.200]   This is MacBreak Weekly, episode 44, a very special edition.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.400]   WWDC deconstructed and joining us now to talk about it,
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.640]   two people who were at the keynote.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.840]   Actually Andy was not at the keynote.
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.920]   So I take that one.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.720]   I was not, believe it or not, I was-- even though it took place
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.360]   early in the afternoon here in Boston,
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.920]   I was asleep until about an hour and a half.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.760]   An hour and a half ago.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.800]   And then who slept through the keynote?
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.520]   I woke up to a brand new world.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.040]   It was cool.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.680]   We're reading every single brain dump of the keynote all at once.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.520]   It's actually easier that way.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.360]   I felt like McCoy, you know, when he wore that special hat
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.680]   that allowed him to reattach Spock's brain,
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.280]   I just kept muttering through about 10 minutes.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.920]   It was really cool.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.080]   He slurped the keynote moments ago.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.760]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times and via Hobbit Square.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.880]   Merlin Mann, also not at the keynote.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.440]   This is going to be a very informed experiment.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.440]   I saw lots of white people typing about it in real time.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.480]   So I feel like I was perfectly perfect.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.000]   Perfect.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.680]   Where were you?
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.200]   Steve has now moved seven inches to the left.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.640]   And there's a song playing.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.080]   Where were you?
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.320]   I just got back from your old stomping grounds
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.600]   of Providence, Rhode Island, the Providence area.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.600]   So you literally just got back in.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.800]   I literally last night I have had so many bi valves
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.400]   and crustaceans that I need to get new pants.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.440]   But I'm back and I'm very excited to talk
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.320]   about these exciting developments.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.320]   Well, finally, somebody who actually was there,
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.200]   Scott Born of the ApplephoneShow.com.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.160]   For somebody that he's talking like Marvin the Martian.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.560]   Maybe I know--
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.880]   My name is Marvin the Martian.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.160]   I'm one of that's his excitement level or what?
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.760]   Joining-- hello, Scott.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.720]   Hello, hello.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.720]   And joining us in a few minutes, John Gruber,
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.560]   who is in a session right now, but will get out and will join us.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.760]   And he was also at the keynote.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.680]   But the truth is you really can read it all,
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.280]   whether it's on Angadget.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.240]   Where did you get your coverage from, Ani and Akko?
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.840]   Where did you choose to read up on it?
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.040]   Basically, through Apple Insider, Macworld, and Mac Central,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.360]   which is actually an offshoot of Macworld,
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.680]   they have good live boards.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.920]   So you stuck with the Apple-centric media
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.360]   to find out what was going on?
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.680]   Well, because you need a certain amount of granularity
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.880]   when you're trying to experience a keynote in near real time
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.600]   or, in my case, on like three hour tape delay,
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.000]   you need to get people who are used to typing really fast
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.440]   and not saying things like, wow, there's
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.400]   a mysterious bulge in his back pocket.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.520]   I think it might be the tablet-- oh, wait a minute.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.560]   This is microphone pack.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.040]   OK.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.520]   Never mind.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.360]   I know.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.880]   I'm not sure what kind of frames he's wearing for classes.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.080]   It looks like OK.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.560]   Thank you.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.600]   There's a little over analysis going on.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.880]   Well, Scott, you were there.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.360]   I'll tell you what, I think probably the best way
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.400]   to handle all this is just to go one by one
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.600]   through all the announcements.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.480]   But before we do, Scott, overall,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.360]   what was your sense of the keynote, the crowd, Steve's
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.360]   glasses, anything, any impressions you'd
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.760]   like to share with us?
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.680]   Well, it certainly wasn't as exciting as a Macworld type
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   of thing.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.000]   But for WWDC, I've only been to one other one.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.160]   It seemed pretty jazzed, at least initially.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.200]   And there was a lot of positive energy.
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.720]   There were several points at which the crowd erupted.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.360]   And the hands-down best line of the keynote in terms
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.960]   of crowd reaction was when Steve says,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.520]   and it's shipping in October and the basic versions 129,
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.160]   and he paused, and then he said, and the professional versions
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.000]   129.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.800]   And the enhanced versions 129.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.000]   And he was running through this thing
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.080]   to make fun of all the versions of Vista.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.600]   And you couldn't even hear him, because the crowd had just
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.520]   drowned him out with applause and laughter.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.240]   So that was the big moment.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.760]   The crowd was underwhelmed by the iPhone via Safari
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.120]   announcement, because several other times
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.880]   when he would announce things they clapped.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.680]   And when he announced that, there
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.040]   was a guy sitting next to me who was a web developer who said,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.280]   you who real loud.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.480]   But other than that, nobody booed, but nobody went nuts.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.040]   So maybe that was what they were looking for.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]   We'll get to that in a second.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.120]   I think that was the thing the developers in the audience
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.760]   were most anxious to hear, whether third party apps would
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.240]   be supported on the iPhone.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.040]   I might disagree with you a little bit.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.480]   Not I wasn't there, but I have to say,
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.400]   to me, the Macworld talk really was not anything hugely
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.040]   substantive.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.000]   It was just like, oh, cool new things that are coming.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.600]   This at least gave us some insight into some details
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.960]   into what Leopard was--
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.800]   Well, you can--
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.760]   OK, well, given that January was the iPhone keynote,
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.680]   that got people again.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.880]   That really talked about--
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.720]   We got people excited.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.360]   Talk about having to replace your pants afterwards.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.960]   That was pretty good.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.160]   Yeah, but on the other hand, I don't know.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.640]   I wanted more substance.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.720]   I want to know what's going to happen on the desk job.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.200]   And I think that in the way I'm more interested in what's
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.520]   happening with Leopard than I am with the iPhone.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.240]   Let's go through it from the beginning to end.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.440]   They kicked off with-- it's what sounded like a pretty funny--
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.520]   I was listening on Ustream, so I wasn't able to see anything.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.680]   But it sounded like a pretty funny little ad featuring
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.160]   John Hodgman, the I'm a PC guy, dressed as Steve Jobs
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.160]   in a black, turtleneck, and jeans.
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.480]   It just shows how much body type has to do with making
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.800]   that look work.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.200]   Black is slimming and it's in hides food stance.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.160]   It's the perfect geekware.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.480]   He comes out and says, hello, everyone.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.520]   I'm Steve Jobs, which, of course, gets a laugh.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.880]   I've got some big news this year.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.320]   I want the whole world to hear.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.840]   I quit.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.600]   Yes, that's right.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.040]   I'm resigning, effective immediately.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.320]   And shutting down all of Apple.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.240]   I didn't have a choice.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.000]   He says, Vista is performing so well.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.880]   It's all tens of dozens of copies.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.800]   Leopard was going to get lost and all that.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.960]   Wow.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.880]   And I've got my iPod killer, a brown Zoom.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.120]   It's time for Apple to wave the white flag.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.880]   Don't shed tears.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.000]   Just take those big brains out of the Moscow Pony Center.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.200]   Anyway, and he's capitulate to a Redmond, obviously, a joke.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.520]   Was that funny, Scott?
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.520]   I thought I had those very--
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.960]   He got a very good reaction.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.080]   He's like a whatever one.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.920]   Steve came out right away, which then the big applause.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.760]   Right.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.760]   Everybody's happy to see Steve not in a black turtleneck,
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.240]   by the way.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.760]   He was in a red shirt of some kind, or red turtleneck.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.840]   Maybe that is.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.760]   Oh, well.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.360]   Slightly different.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.120]   Are we turning into the e-channel like red carpet coverage?
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.680]   The shoe is our buy Tiffany with American buckles.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.840]   I was waiting for an old kind of has-been comic
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.000]   with much plastic surgery in her daughter
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.480]   to give us the fashion.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.360]   Oh, my God.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.000]   He's wearing a red turtleneck.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.600]   Greg Johnson, we have to wear it.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.560]   Greg, turn to the left.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.520]   So he says the biggest WWDC ever.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.040]   WWDC is for developers, worldwide developer commerce.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.440]   In fact, journalists really don't get to go in.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.160]   As I remember, at least the last few,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.440]   you could go to the keynote, but that's it.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.800]   You had to go home.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.680]   That's the reason why I've yet to go to a WWDC,
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.600]   because they really-- or at least the last time I looked into it,
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.520]   they are really a bit twitchy about when you're
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.120]   wearing your journalist hat and when you're
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.200]   wearing your developer's hat.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.280]   I do have developer's status, but it
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.840]   would be an itchy experience if I were sitting in on some sessions.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.640]   So that's why I'm here in Boston with another $800 in my pocket.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.760]   Paul O'Lieny comes on stage from Intel.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.000]   This time, not wearing a bunny suit, although they very kindly
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.120]   showed the video of him wearing a bunny suit, which
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.320]   is kind of humiliating.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.760]   MUB!
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.920]   It was a bad, bad costume.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.080]   I was five years old.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.400]   Stop showing it at parties.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.480]   It's just a pro forma.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.600]   Thank you and a polished, sealed commemorative disc.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.400]   I don't know what that is for, but Apple's happy about Intel,
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.720]   and Intel's happy about Apple.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.960]   And they ought to be, I think.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.600]   Big announcement.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.960]   First big announcement, EA is going
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.640]   to do some games for the Mac.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.320]   Does that make a big difference, Andy and Akko?
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.160]   I'm not sure.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.240]   I mean, I really think that that's a ship that's long since
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.920]   sailed.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.600]   I don't think that Mac can really get back the gaming community
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.680]   until somebody makes an absolutely killer must-have game
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.520]   that's Macintosh exclusive first.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.080]   If they said that, by the way, next version of John Madden
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.120]   is going to be Mac only for one month earlier than it's
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.720]   going to be available every other publish.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.720]   I will never happen, but that'd be the kick of the pants
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.320]   that the game development needs on the Mac.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.960]   I mean, right now, I can't tell you how many--
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.680]   as I was going through hitting that part of the keynote,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.200]   I was wondering, gee, how many keynotes have I sat through
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.360]   that had a big, ambitious thing?
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.200]   Oh, and gaming is finally coming to the Macintosh now
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.080]   that this game is signed.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   Now that this developer community has signed up,
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.880]   now that we're supporting this toolkit,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.280]   so this really is a very-- this is one of the few areas
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.440]   in which when Apple makes an announcement,
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.760]   you're like, that's nice, boys.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.680]   Let's see what actually ships in a year.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.560]   Whereas everything else, you're like, oh, wow, iPhone.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.280]   Oh, wow, weppered.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.280]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.000]   Isn't that one benefit of PCs, though,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.040]   is the idea that the stuff really
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.400]   is getting a lot cheaper and a lot faster.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.480]   And games actually come out on it.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.040]   Right, but I mean, just in the sense
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.600]   that if you are somebody who really wants
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.040]   the most cutting edge of this stuff,
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.400]   it's just a hell of a lot cheaper to do on a PC.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.080]   You're not going to be able to see that stuff.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.240]   You're getting updated that quickly
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.400]   and getting faster that quickly on a Mac, right?
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.240]   I mean, you can't--
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.640]   Yeah, and check it out.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.160]   And it's not just the games.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.520]   It's the fact that you can roll your own just killer,
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.720]   like Soviet ICBM of gaming on Windows,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.440]   where you get your own card and you get your own--
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.200]   you upgrade your bus and all these tweaks
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.480]   to make sure you can kill as many fake people
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.320]   from across the globe as possible.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.960]   Whereas with a Macintosh, you're essentially
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.240]   getting what you get.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.120]   Maybe you can put in a slightly better video card,
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.720]   but your hardware tweaks are not really available.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.640]   And I think that's what's going to continue to keep away
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.840]   the really hardcore gamers.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.920]   The people with the half inch that calluses
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.320]   on their shooting fingers.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.800]   Although I'm bringing in Trooping out John Carmack and IID
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.640]   to say they're developing a game for--
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.000]   Well, you see that's the problem for Mac.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.240]   PC, PS3, and Xbox.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.200]   It really is more significant.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.720]   Not so much as, hey, now gamers are
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.760]   going to be coming to the Mac.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.040]   So much as the machine they use to goof off on at work,
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.840]   they can now goof off on at home.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.040]   So they can play Madden on their real machine,
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.840]   so to speak, for gaming.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.560]   But they can also, when they're on their Mac book
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.200]   or when they're on their little work processing iMac,
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.120]   they could use it at home too.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.320]   Again, I just really don't see gaming
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.600]   in that scale happening on the Mac anytime soon.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.840]   So I guess it makes sense.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.480]   The first announcement you make is the least important, right?
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.560]   In order of importance, it's--
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.480]   It looked like it had some pretty cool eye candy to it,
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:09.980]   though.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.800]   Yeah, I'm looking at the pictures on Engadget.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:13.200]   There's no video as far as I know up,
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.720]   but I'm sure Apple put it up eventually.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.200]   Yeah, it looks pretty.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.720]   Did you ever see the Sting, Leo?
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.360]   The Sting with the--
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.760]   Yeah, the George Royall movie.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.440]   Paul Newman.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.560]   Paul Newman.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.440]   There's that great scene, though, where they're going to--
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.760]   I think they call it a wire back then.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.360]   But when they had to--
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.640]   they would basically relay a game by somebody
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.920]   would read it over the teletype.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:34.920]   Yes.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.640]   And then they would enact it with like--
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   Three seconds later.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.140]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.640]   A horse race, right?
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.560]   Given what a sophisticated age would live in,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.920]   that's really what this feels like for me.
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.560]   So it's like--
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.200]   OK, three seconds later.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.080]   I mean, you could all maybe Comedy Central
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.760]   could do something where they'd have people like ad
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.480]   living, like kind of acting it out on stage in real time.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.960]   Yeah, actually, actually, I think that--
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.120]   No, you just gave me an idea.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.160]   This is how the Mac community or Apple
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.000]   could really finally embrace developers, rather,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.040]   the game community.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.320]   IChat has this really wonderful screen mirroring feature.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.200]   So basically, all they have to do is buy a million dels,
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.280]   keep them in Apple, and basically allow anybody
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.240]   to just launch IChat and play any game they want
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.880]   for Windows via mirroring.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.720]   There you go.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.280]   Now, there'd be about an eight second latency,
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.720]   which might make sure your game is kind of--
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.160]   It's not the funnest thing in that.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.560]   I think we should do--
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.000]   Next year, Mac Break Weekly, let's
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.240]   do a reenactment of the keynote.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.120]   No, that's a great idea.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.560]   We can have cheesy slides.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.000]   I'll dress up at a turtleneck.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.200]   And I play John Hodgman.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.840]   Yeah, it'll be fun.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.280]   I want to be the guy in the front row with a neck
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.640]   beard who's really excited about everything.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.080]   Everything that I say--
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.560]   Just be able to jump up and go, woo hoo!
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.800]   That describes almost everybody in the front row.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.320]   They are a good travel.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.480]   The strategic CEO who comes on without a clue
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.280]   and drones on for eight minutes about infrastructure.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.240]   Yes, you could be three-by-five guard.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.720]   Three-by-five guard, man, we'll call.
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.880]   Every time I clap, there's going to be a cloud of Cheetos dust.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.920]   A little poof of orange dust that comes up from the storm.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.080]   It's announcement.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.840]   All right, so moving along, he gets to leopard.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.520]   Now, I have to say, I was impressed by the leopard
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.920]   announcements.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.440]   Well, first of all, he says-- and I
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.680]   think this is actually significant--
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:23.280]   that 66% of all the Mac users are running Tiger, which
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.480]   is pretty good uptake.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.400]   You couldn't say that for Windows by any means.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.360]   I mean, I think there's still a lot of Windows 95 users out there.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.080]   Yeah, I mean, then Microsoft have to officially announce,
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   dudes, we are withdrawing support for Windows 2000.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.480]   Please stop using it.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.400]   It's eight years old.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:38.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.600]   Get out of the building.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.520]   We're knocking it down tomorrow.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.080]   Apple fans seem to upgrade.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.800]   And I think they will upgrade to leopard significantly improved.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.600]   It looks like 22 million active OS X users.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.320]   Does that seem like a surprisingly large number?
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.480]   22 million?
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.180]   Is that right?
[00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.060]   That's what Job says.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:58.700]   Pretty amazing.
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.940]   15 million of them using Tiger, 5 million panther,
[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.020]   and only 2 million are using something older than panther.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.860]   I think it's extraordinarily high to me.
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.060]   Yeah, well, I mean, would he lie?
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.860]   Well, he doesn't lie.
[00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.540]   He just speaks.
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.900]   And then the distortion field is what causes all of us to hear.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.180]   He said 5 million, but it came out 15.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.340]   Maybe that's it.
[00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.900]   He might have Michael Moore the numbers a little bit,
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.940]   where there's sort of a truth, but he
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.460]   got to really dig with both hands to find it.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:27.300]   It's going to be.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:27.660]   I don't know.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:28.260]   I'd like to find out.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:28.740]   Let's find out.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.060]   I don't know where that number comes from.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.420]   He didn't say we should find out.
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.260]   300, it's being of big numbers.
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.500]   300 new features in leopard.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.740]   He showed 10 of them.
[00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.900]   And some of them were ones we had not seen before,
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.340]   including he says a new desktop.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.740]   It didn't look that different.
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.460]   It looked like the old desktop with a new desktop picture.
[00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.060]   It lost the chrome look.
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.420]   And you get to use your own picture.
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.420]   And I don't think there's that big a difference
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.540]   from what I can tell.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.620]   I do like the new features.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.500]   I think the stack is kind of interesting.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.260]   Yeah, but I mean, it's really not like a complete remake
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:03.940]   of the desktop.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.100]   It's a little-- it's a little--
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.660]   I think it's short on depth and kind of high on pretty.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.820]   Merlin, did you look at the pictures?
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.340]   Are these things you can do with third party apps now?
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.380]   That's a great question.
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.660]   I mean, boy, this should just become
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.460]   my standard proposal on this stuff.
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.820]   That you really can't tell just by looking at a still phone
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.700]   if somebody took with their phone to decide
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.460]   whether this is going to be great.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.220]   But I did watch the-- like a total dork,
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.220]   I went to the apple.com/mac and watched the little demo
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:33.900]   several times.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.100]   And it looks really cool to answer your question specifically.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.300]   It looks, on the face of it, to me, like new ways
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.900]   to kind of present and browse information.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:46.460]   I'm not sure that it's really functionally different.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:49.460]   And I really doubt that it's heavily rewritten.
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.500]   I mean, it struck me as a nice way to leverage what they're
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.380]   doing with graphics right now in a way that's really exciting
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.220]   to look at.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.380]   But to your question, I mean, you're a Pathfinder man, aren't you?
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.140]   I use Pathfinder--
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.140]   Are you a Pathfinder guy, Andy?
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:05.980]   No.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.540]   OK.
[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.540]   But it amazes me.
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.180]   Craig, Craig Superston, it seems like every time I'm
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.820]   trying to run, I see somebody else using Pathfinder.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.220]   Because a lot of us are very frustrated
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:19.420]   with how we get from A to B, even with Quicksilver and P.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.700]   People are unhappy with the Finder.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.300]   In fact, one of our Mac wines, you said,
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.980]   I don't like the Finder.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.700]   Yeah, you know, I've got to say, that one's
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.060]   kind of getting gray around the edges.
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.180]   I should really go back and kind of articulate what that is
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.460]   and quit being in such a dork about it.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.420]   But it is frustrating to me that it's a file management
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.420]   system.
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.980]   The way that it's really conceptualized from the bottom
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:39.980]   up hasn't evolved much over the years.
[00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.940]   Well, my problem with the doc was it was so sparse.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.140]   And you couldn't really put much in there.
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.060]   And I think stacks, in a way, makes that doc much more
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.500]   functional.
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.500]   Go ahead.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.020]   Sorry.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.260]   No, no, no, go ahead.
[00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.980]   Well, I was just going to say that, believe it or not,
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.420]   when I was reviewing Windows Vista,
[00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.020]   that was one of the features that I wrote about saying,
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.100]   gee, I really wish that Apple would steal that feature
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.860]   for the next version of Mac OS.
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.940]   Because I like to be able to zap directly.
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.340]   My allegiance is not to individual applications
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.620]   that are running to individual projects that
[00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:12.100]   I'm using.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.860]   So the ability to zap right to the document I'm working on
[00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:17.660]   is a really big deal.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.100]   But also, there's nothing wrong with making things look
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.900]   and work pretty, because that's actually a feature.
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.820]   So if they spend a certain amount of their time making things
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.060]   look better, animate better, look a little bit slicker,
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.300]   be a little easier to use, that's fine.
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:32.580]   I guess just the only slight response to that
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.900]   is that making things look pretty
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.860]   is a problem that they are extremely good at solving.
[00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.860]   And so I think that given that that's their hammer,
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.460]   they tend to seek a lot of nails.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.780]   And that's why something that can be--
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.860]   in our famous Mac break demo, Leo,
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.140]   that I think frustrated my friends over at Coco Tech
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.540]   a little bit with how we blew out what you can do with Pathfinder
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.660]   in the dorkiest of conceivable ways.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.780]   It's not-- it is a pretty app, but it's a super functional app.
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.300]   Maybe it's pretty app.
[00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.860]   It's not a pretty app.
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.620]   But it's not pretty in the app functional.
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.820]   Right.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.300]   Yes, it's pretty in the BB edits.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:08.940]   And it's about a tool.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:11.020]   But I mean, what I need to do, I need
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.100]   the shortest distance possible--
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.460]   this is a term that I started using a lot with my friends
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.780]   on the OmniFocus team.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.740]   It's to shorten the distance between cognition and completion.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.860]   So whatever I do on the Mac, I increasingly
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.660]   want to find the shortest path I can take between occurring
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.660]   to me and then either getting it done or making a placeholder.
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:29.020]   And that goes for the Finder too.
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:32.300]   So for me, like seeing-- graphically seeing--
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.860]   large icon for the contents of a text file.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.580]   Well, for me, that's cool.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:39.220]   But what I really need is a way for me
[00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.580]   to never have to do things twice.
[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.420]   I don't spend a lot of time flipping through anything
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.220]   on a Mac, except photos, really.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:44.780]   And I guess I too.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.460]   Merlin, Merlin, I'm sorry.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.700]   I thought you were done.
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.500]   Can I ask you a question, though?
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.460]   Yes.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.620]   Why did you not ask me if I use Pathfinder?
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.340]   You're not the Pathfinder type.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:57.500]   I'm going to be honest with you, Scott.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.260]   I would never in a million years imagine you being a Pathfinder
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:00.900]   guy.
[00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.740]   You're just very intuitive that way, aren't you?
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.500]   But no tell me.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.980]   Are you a Pathfinder guy?
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.460]   I don't even know what it is.
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.540]   No, I'm doing it.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:11.420]   OK, you got me born.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.380]   That was funny.
[00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.260]   We know you too, well, Scott.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.220]   No, but Scott actually is more like the prototypical Mac
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.700]   user who uses Safari, uses Finder, uses Mail,
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.580]   is not seeking out third--
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.380]   in my sense, most Mac users is not seeking out third party
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:28.900]   applications.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.900]   They trust Apple to do it.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.180]   And they stick with the kind of the uniformity
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:34.220]   that the Apple interface gives you.
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.460]   Well said, friend, well said.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.140]   It's a system.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.420]   And it's a system, let's be honest.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.700]   It's a system you can trust.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.780]   If you come in, especially--
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.100]   I see people come over from Windows probably a couple
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:42.700]   of times a month.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.300]   Where's the apps?
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.140]   Where's--
[00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.620]   A lot of them come over in their thrill.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.020]   They just go, Indian, I take this, and I drag it to there.
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.900]   And I'm very happy.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:50.820]   And then I clean this up.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.740]   And I change this photo.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.900]   And they're happy.
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:53.860]   They're like kindergarten.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.740]   It's just having fun with the stock pools.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:57.260]   And it's awesome to watch.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.820]   It's just that, like I say, I mean, once you--
[00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.300]   I don't know.
[00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:01.140]   I don't know if it's a key thing.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:01.980]   I don't know what it is.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:02.820]   It might be an ADD thing.
[00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.900]   But it's kind of long story short.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:07.300]   I had to use this to really see what it looks like.
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:09.300]   But I think about things again, I always come back to stuff
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.100]   like the drop stack in Pathfinder.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.060]   I wish we had something like that.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.100]   That's, to me, the single most powerful tool in Pathfinder.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.620]   Look at all of these aftermarket hacks that people have.
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.420]   Things like, oh, what's that drawer program that
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.020]   flies off from the side that everybody uses?
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.860]   Well, that's what I was thinking with stacks.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.060]   That's kind of what this is like is--
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:27.180]   Your jimbo, yeah.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:27.740]   Not your jimbo.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.060]   The pop pop funder.
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:29.740]   Or what is it?
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.260]   Sorry.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:31.780]   Drag thing.
[00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:32.300]   Drag thing.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.700]   That's the one.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.380]   Yeah, but stuff like that.
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.620]   You just look at the way that, like, God, you can always
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.780]   tell what people want to turn the finder into by what
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.740]   they're using to compensate.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.820]   Well, and that's why I think this--
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.740]   this may get them there.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.140]   I think this and the previews everywhere, this new using
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.420]   cover flow--
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.260]   I'm not a fan of cover flow, frankly.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.540]   I don't use it very much on iTunes.
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.500]   I'm not sure this is the best metaphor.
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.300]   But they're going to use cover flow for the ability
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.500]   to preview all these docs.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.820]   What do you think about that?
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.340]   Well, I mean, first of all, just to close off
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.940]   an earlier subject, one of the reasons why I've never really
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.020]   gotten into Pathfinder and other little apps like that
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.540]   is that I like the simplicity of the doc.
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.460]   I hated the doc when I first saw it.
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.620]   I double-hated it the first time I used it.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.180]   But when I realized that, wait a minute,
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.060]   this is just a very cool, very simple, very general tool
[00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.420]   that I can then customize just by exploiting built-in features.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.980]   This is the idea that I can just drag my apps folder into the doc.
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.380]   It'll become hierarchical just by the virtue of the fact
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.700]   that there are things inside the folder inside the doc.
[00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.460]   Allow me to get an extra level of sophistication.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.020]   I like these third party tools.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.420]   I certainly like Quicksilver and the rest.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.620]   I just hope that it doesn't cause people
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.780]   to continue to hate something that's really, really good,
[00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:48.260]   because it didn't click with them the first five seconds.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.820]   They didn't give it at least a full day.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.220]   You're right.
[00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.460]   I mean, one thing I think about it is I don't really--
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.020]   I probably don't leverage the doc as much as I could for stuff.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.460]   I mean, you can do stuff like I presume
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.460]   you could do things like throw some of our folders down there,
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.620]   things that I don't do.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:04.380]   I don't know enough if I were you and I had the AppleScript skills.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.540]   I would probably be making a million awesome folder actions.
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.700]   But that's the one thing I always wish I'd learn more about,
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.660]   because you can do so much with folder actions alone,
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.060]   let alone getting into Automator and stuff like that.
[00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.860]   So your points will take in.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.380]   But yeah, again, everything that they make,
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:22.380]   you just want to just hold it in your hand
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.940]   and see what it looks like and see how you use it.
[00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.140]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.020]   I agree.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.820]   I think when I look at this, I think we won't know till we get it.
[00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.180]   But I think this is very promising looking.
[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:37.420]   What I like about it is that they didn't reinvent--
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.380]   a lot of people are saying they reinvented the dock.
[00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.740]   What I like about it is that they kept the simplicity of it.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.340]   They didn't screw it up for people who just
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.340]   like it as an application launcher.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.420]   Just add a little extra depth to it and I'm good.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.660]   No, no, but it does do is I mean, maybe you and I
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.820]   disagreed a little on this Leo.
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.340]   But I thought those iPhone ads were just freaking great.
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.620]   And between iPhone and--
[00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:58.460]   I don't disagree.
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:59.260]   I thought they were great.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.980]   I just think that they were deceptive.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.900]   Oh, and that there's other-- yeah, no, you're right.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.300]   But so if you were going to go out there and try to woo people,
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.460]   you know, I mean, having stuff like that cover flow thing,
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.620]   that is pretty sharp in terms of the whole over-founder factor.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.060]   Nothing like that, and this I can tell you right now.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:18.780]   Not without buying three more computers and it was some kind of,
[00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:19.660]   you know, molding process.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.700]   Having a render farm.
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.620]   Well, I read a book.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.580]   And he--
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.620]   What's those six notebooks that you for?
[00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.060]   Oh, they're just rendering page previews.
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.300]   Don't make it in their minds.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.740]   And he did point that out.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.100]   Because of direct audio, core animation,
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.780]   all of this built-in support in the operating system,
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.820]   things like cover flow are much easier to implement
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.020]   than they would be on any other operating system.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.540]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.580]   I'm really keen to get my next copy of the developer builds.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.900]   I really want to see how well cover flow works.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.500]   It's actually very, very close to the way
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.380]   that I tend to interact with my own data.
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.300]   I love spotlight.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.980]   I love the ability to search things for me, which were faster,
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.940]   but hey, what do you want to do?
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.620]   But so much of what I do isn't simply
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:57.540]   doing a search for something or using keywords.
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.500]   It's saying, well, that kind of looks like the document
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.100]   I'm looking for.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.460]   Oh, I remember I put it sort of somewhat there.
[00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:04.700]   So many times I have to process lots of data
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.540]   that I haven't touched in about a month.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:08.540]   I don't know what's in that folder until I actually
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.500]   paw through it.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.180]   So the ability to get all these really sophisticated previews
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:16.100]   of what's actually in the document very, very quickly
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.340]   is really, really attractive.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.900]   Now, the downside will be if it doesn't work as well
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.100]   as it works in the demo, it has to be absolutely liquid.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:26.300]   One of the reasons why I don't use spotlight much anymore
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.180]   on my PowerPC based notebook is because my god,
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.820]   I'll pop it up and it'll take like eight seconds.
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.980]   Eight seconds isn't a lot of time,
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.940]   but it's still too much time for me to lay my hands
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:36.440]   out of it.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.700]   You want to find it right away.
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.260]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.900]   It's not transparent.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.020]   It doesn't become invisible to the kind of what
[00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:42.580]   I'm saying.
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.300]   It doesn't become invisible to the thing that I want to do.
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.860]   I got a bug here.
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:50.460]   If you're on a Mac Pro and you click on Spotlight,
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.220]   you should be able to immediately hit enter
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.340]   to have it go to show all and open in a window.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.020]   You should never have to sit there and wait.
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.300]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.100]   Where it's got to sit there?
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.140]   You have to search for something.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:02.660]   Of course, it's got to find something
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.660]   before it will let you pop into that mystery window
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.100]   that I love.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.100]   It's crazy.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.860]   But that's what I want to go back to what I'm doing.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.060]   But I can't go back to what I'm doing.
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.780]   I disable Spotlight on all my machines
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.700]   because I just don't find it functional enough.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.060]   Me too.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:17.420]   I open one very informative rattle just very quickly.
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.420]   Sure.
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:19.900]   I'm curious.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.620]   You're in the finder.
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.740]   How do you generally speaking view your windows?
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.500]   Command one, view as icons.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.700]   Command two, view as a list.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.660]   Command three, view on columns.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.500]   I do columns because I do what Steve does.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:33.140]   How about you, Andy?
[00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:37.220]   Are you a column guy, icon, view, or list view?
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.180]   It really sounds like a--
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:41.180]   Personality test.
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.340]   No, it sounds like a new word game question.
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:44.420]   Couple over two.
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.180]   What part of you did your husband say you normally use?
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.340]   Anyway.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:54.300]   I guess you pick whoopee in Command three, column view,
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:55.140]   is my guess.
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.820]   If you're going to use it, use the make whoopee.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:01.300]   I actually-- I switched between list view and column view.
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.900]   I actually tend to spend more time in list view because I spend most
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.420]   of my time needing to sort based on what my most recent deposit
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.700]   into this folder was.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.140]   Or I need to see, oh, wait a minute.
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:15.380]   That's the 400K JPEG I drew from this, not the 10 megabyte
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.860]   original raw file.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.220]   As a matter of fact, I use column view most--
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:22.460]   I use column view in cover flow mode, really.
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:25.260]   It's the way I need to walk through a directory structure,
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.220]   and I need to get preview.
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.260]   So that's why I'm really--
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.700]   Is it icon view the default, ironically?
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.620]   Yes.
[00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:33.460]   It's the worst of the three-- the least useful of the three.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.580]   It's very nostalgic, I think, yeah.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.500]   And the column view comes from next and next step.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.460]   And I think that my sense was, as I remember
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.860]   when he first introduced it, this is the way Steve wants it to be.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.260]   When I did next step, you didn't have--
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.300]   this is really the way it was.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:51.660]   And I think that the other two are concessions
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.060]   that Steve's made to use ability.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.660]   I think he really thinks-- and I kind of
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.220]   agree with the column view is the most functional.
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.100]   One of my favorite downloads ever for the classic Mac
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:03.460]   was Greg's browser, which was an implementation
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.660]   of the next style browser on the Mac OS.
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:06.780]   I used it as a finder replacement,
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.700]   because it was just so useful.
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.100]   I remember Steve the first time we saw OS10 saying,
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.620]   this is going to take some getting used to.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.700]   But I think once you use it for a while,
[00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.260]   you'll see how useful it is.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.740]   And there are definitely flaws.
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.860]   I mean, stuff tends to go off onto the right,
[00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:21.900]   unless you have a very wide screen.
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.220]   The columns are never wide enough.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.380]   You can't see dates, and you can't see file sizes,
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.260]   as Andy points out.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:29.020]   The Pathfinder really specializes in column view.
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.180]   I tend to do-- I'm curious to hear what Scott uses.
[00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.100]   I tend to do column view-- or excuse me,
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.420]   list view, but I'm working my way into column view.
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.540]   One nice thing, Andy, just for what it's worth.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.020]   I believe Pathfinder will let you, first of all,
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.460]   it remembers how wide you want a given window to be
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.740]   in column view.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.220]   And second, you can also sort by date in column view,
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:49.620]   which I guess--
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.900]   I'll definitely give it another try.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.380]   I mean, believe it or not, I don't even
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.980]   have Quicksilver running on most of my Macs,
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:58.260]   and as much as I love it.
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.180]   Well, here's the reason why.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.940]   Because it'll say, well, I'd like it a lot, Shadyboard,
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.100]   because there's a new version available.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.060]   So I'd like it even large.
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.460]   I'm saying, OK, well, fine, I'll drop everything,
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.260]   including the column that's doing 45 minutes.
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.940]   So I can download and install a brand new version of your app,
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.180]   just so I could launch a file that I could launch--
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.380]   just as easily, not just as easily,
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.780]   but just as well from any other app.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.500]   And then I wind up not reinstalling it.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.220]   That's the most unknown.
[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.460]   And that's something that happens in so many different apps.
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:24.980]   I know there's a new version, the old version is working fine
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.580]   for me temporarily, untillable, cause a brain
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.460]   to land on my computer and cause doom and destruction.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.660]   Please don't stop working arbitrarily.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.540]   That's the only thing.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.980]   In the interest of for Alkorsake,
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:38.220]   I'm going to point out that you can't
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.780]   have it automatically install the updates without asking,
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:41.740]   and that's what I have it do.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:42.740]   Unclit.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.340]   And just one--
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.340]   And then you don't even see it.
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.020]   Unclit is too many.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.580]   No, it doesn't even ask me.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:49.020]   Check for updates weekly.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.740]   Install updates without asking.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.540]   It just does it.
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:53.180]   Download updates in the background, install updates.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.300]   It's in the preferences.
[00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.740]   But I understand what you're saying.
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.900]   And for a while, there seemed like there
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.460]   was an update of the day on Quicksilver.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.140]   I don't know what was going on there.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.020]   Isn't that one of the biggest problems, not just in the Mac?
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.020]   Every program, really.
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.020]   It's very frustrating.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.420]   Well, no, not just what I was talking about,
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.620]   but something brand new, the idea that if you disconnect me
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.100]   early on, I'll just forget that you exist.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.020]   And you fix it, you made it much, much better.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.340]   It's not that I'm on principle not using your app.
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.860]   It's just that I've forgotten about you.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.260]   And I need someone like you guys to say, oh, by the way,
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:22.260]   this doesn't work that way anymore.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.140]   You should check it out again.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.140]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.700]   I have to say that I don't use the Finder that much
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.900]   because of Quicksilver.
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.500]   Yeah, I use column mode, but I don't need column mode all that
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.500]   much.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:33.900]   I rarely dig into my folders.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:36.500]   Does this really work well for file management for you, though?
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.940]   Well, I just open the dock I want.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.620]   Well, no, I'm talking about moving folders.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.900]   I'm talking about setting up directories.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.900]   I'm talking about setting up something
[00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.900]   as cool as smart folders.
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.820]   That's that old debate about whether you should enforce
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:52.660]   hierarchy or just do a flat file and use the search tools
[00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.660]   like Quicksilver to find what you want.
[00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.300]   And I don't do much hierarchy anymore.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:00.340]   I think hierarchy is so, you know, 1999.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.380]   That's what makes it so handy is you having stuff like being
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.980]   able to take a good idea, like having that little sidebar
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.940]   in the Finder and being able to just take that to another level.
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.420]   So on Pathfinder, I feel like I'm always
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.020]   pinning Pathfinder, but the ability
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.940]   to have multiples of your sidebar.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.860]   For example, I've got one called troubleshooting,
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.620]   where I can open up a sidebar that's
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.620]   got links to all my troublesome library folders,
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:23.460]   my preferences, and all the applications
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.620]   that I'd like to use when I'm troubleshooting something.
[00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:27.460]   So I don't have to go have that, you know,
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:30.300]   go invent the wheel every time I want to go do that.
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.900]   Also, just all the little ways of doing things,
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.460]   like being able to create easily creating a text file or RTF
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.340]   right from the Finder.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:41.060]   It sounds kind of dumb, but you end up using it all the time.
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.100]   And having a terminal built in, I know
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.300]   that it's crafty for some people,
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.180]   but if you just need to do one really quick thing,
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.100]   it can be super fast.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:48.780]   Let's move on.
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.380]   We've got a lot to talk about.
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:50.940]   What about Scott?
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.700]   We didn't find out Scott.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.060]   Oh, Scott, what do you use?
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.180]   List view.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.540]   List view.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.740]   That's sort of by date, sort of by date or name.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.820]   Based on actually a recommendation from one Merlin man,
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.980]   I start by date because it sounds like problems.
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.780]   Because then I can find the things I most recently added.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.740]   OK, I'm done with that.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.420]   Now, next week, the RATO will be, I will ask you
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.500]   how you search your mail.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.740]   I think it's a great question, actually.
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.220]   I'm very interested in it.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.860]   I thought I'm glad we talked about it.
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.580]   When I watch people really fly with column mode,
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:21.140]   it makes me think that I really want to start using it more.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.380]   You know, you keep having to renew your knowledge.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.180]   Well, we'll have all of those plus cover flow.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:25.940]   That's one change.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:28.580]   He said a new Finder, but it doesn't seem like it's that different.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.260]   That's crazy.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.180]   It's a new sidebar.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.380]   What's new in the sidebar?
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.260]   Now you can search for--
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.740]   I was unclear on this.
[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:38.420]   Much nicer and more powerful.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.180]   Now you can search other Macs and servers within the Finder.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.620]   You've always been able to share files.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.860]   It's now really easy to browse and share files with computers
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.620]   in an OKR network.
[00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.460]   If that really works, that's going to be badass.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:50.100]   This back to my Mac thing?
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:51.060]   Yeah, back to my Mac.
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.060]   I'll give you $129 just for that feature alone.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.100]   What does this do, Andy?
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.460]   What does it do?
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.580]   Basically, what it does is it remembers,
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.700]   you know how if you have Home Broadband or any others,
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.620]   if you don't pay for a static IP address,
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.940]   it's impossible to be in a hotel room in Delaware
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.340]   and access your Mac back in Boston by file sharing.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:11.220]   If you have a .Mac account, .Mac will essentially
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.980]   remember whatever your IP address of your home Mac is,
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.660]   it'll remember it.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.300]   So it's dynamic DNS through the .Mac, basically.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.220]   Oh, you sound so sexy when you use the technical journey.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.660]   Ooh.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.020]   Basically, it's almost like a DNS service for your local Mac.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.340]   It'll find-- it's actually very--
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.820]   it's like what the sling box does.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.100]   You don't have to care where it is.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.220]   It'll find it for you.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.220]   That is awesome.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.900]   And let's show up as a shared folder
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.820]   and you can get any file out of it.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.180]   It's remote access.
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:38.180]   It's just shared fold.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:38.820]   No, no.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:40.460]   File sharing.
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.460]   Well, that's just--
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.980]   Will you be able to use the .Mac that way, Andy?
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:45.580]   It's new.
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.020]   I've only talked to one person about this feature
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.020]   and things were a little bit sketchy.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.620]   If you think about anything that you could do with a static IP
[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.940]   address on your home Mac, you could do it with back
[00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.500]   to my Mac, technically.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:58.220]   That's the information I'm getting, although it's--
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.140]   And it's a crypto.
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:32:59.580]   It's encrypted.
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.460]   You can ask the Sage-in?
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.060]   Yeah, it's-- well, it says it's encrypted.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.860]   So it's already an encrypted tunnel.
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:04.220]   I don't know.
[00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.780]   If you can ask the Sage-in, that's pretty badass.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.260]   That would be awesome.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:09.780]   Now you're playing ball with the big kids.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:12.740]   And you have basically giving you a terminal session.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.180]   Also, think about what it could do if it allows you
[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.700]   to use internet sharing from your home Macintosh.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.820]   So you can get all the devices that are on your network
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:22.460]   anywhere in the world and it's secure.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.980]   That would be double frosted chocolatey goodness nougat-filled
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:26.340]   badass.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.100]   And it brings us into that next feature, which it appears--
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.820]   again, I've watched this demo that's always seen.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.260]   But it appears that they're saying you can finally
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:38.100]   use Spotlight to search other Macs on your network.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.620]   Or what it says-- the way they said it was,
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:41.700]   I think they said you can search other computers.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.220]   Yes.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.420]   So in the demo, did he--
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.420]   Scott, in the demo, didn't he pull up a Windows machine, too?
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.940]   I think so, but I've got to tell you,
[00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.940]   I kind of slept through that part.
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:51.780]   Because here's my thing.
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.140]   So did I, Scott?
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.420]   It says, it says, here's even a Windows machine up in the attic.
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.180]   I can even go on Windows machines.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:00.580]   Doesn't even have to be plugged in.
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:01.540]   No network card or anything.
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:02.380]   You'll find it.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.540]   Look, it's fine in the attic.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.100]   It's a great time to use--
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.460]   You have eight and nine sets of your pockets
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.740]   and two Canadian quarters.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:10.740]   Spotlight, no, no!
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:12.900]   Since I don't use Spotlight, I didn't really pay that much
[00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:13.300]   attention.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.260]   I apologize.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.060]   No, but that would be a nice feature.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.380]   I think I would use Spotlight more if it were faster
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.180]   and more functional.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.460]   And here's my thing.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.940]   If it can go search my raid, I mean, when I search--
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:24.980]   so for me, I've got my stupid iTunes libraries.
[00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:25.980]   Excellent.
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:26.540]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.220]   Like where you go and search finds it on everything.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:28.820]   That would be awesome.
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.700]   That would be great.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.460]   That would be great.
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.500]   And I think, frankly, Apple needs reasons for people
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.380]   to buy a .Mac.
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:36.500]   It's not a great deal right now.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.140]   So one more thing, one more reason.
[00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:41.740]   Let's see what else.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:45.780]   That's it for a new feel for the new finder in Leopard.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.340]   Easily share other computers, cover flow built in.
[00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.380]   Quick look.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.820]   I think this is something that is very powerful.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.580]   That was cool.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.780]   That got a lot of--
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.300]   I actually heard people gasp when he showed that.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.420]   Well, that's going overboard.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:00.420]   You know, that keeps--
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:00.980]   What can I say?
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.820]   Oh my god, I can see a thumbnail.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.260]   So the idea is previews of all the popular file types,
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.580]   which they didn't list, of course.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.380]   But you don't have to open the app.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:15.020]   And I think that actually goes to some of the things Andy was
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:15.540]   saying.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:17.420]   Andy doesn't care what application he's in.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.380]   Andy cares.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.820]   So Merlin shots.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.580]   Shall I or would you like to?
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.300]   What?
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.620]   Say that this isn't Pathfinder.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.660]   I know I didn't want to be it.
[00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.700]   It's in path-- this exact feature is in pathfinder, by the way.
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:31.620]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:32.140]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:32.980]   And you can watch a movie.
[00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.740]   You can listen to an MP3.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:35.660]   You can--
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:37.980]   It's actually-- the truth is, the reason it's in pathfinder
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.300]   is it's built into the Mac.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.780]   And I mean, this is kind of--
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.780]   How hard is it to open preview?
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.700]   Right.
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.980]   Well, see, the thing-- OK, now, unfortunately,
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.740]   everyone put pity upon me because around nine weeks ago,
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.780]   I switched to Leopard, the developer version,
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:56.100]   as practical as possible, my 100% every full-time OS.
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.100]   And I'm using a quick report.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:59.500]   And that's why you had to reboot before we could do the show.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:35:59.980]   Shut up.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.260]   Again, I'm not set to top it.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:05.820]   I want pity.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.380]   I'm not one of these strong people who doesn't want to be pityed.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.500]   Please, pity me.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.660]   Can goods use clothing in good condition,
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:13.500]   send them to Leo, give me a scare of a twit.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.300]   No, that's fine.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.500]   I'll catch them along.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.980]   But yeah, how hard is it to launch preview?
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.100]   Not very, but not having to launch anything at all.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:21.980]   That's even easier.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.140]   I'm using nice feature.
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.340]   When I'm going through-- when I'm looking through a folder of photos,
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.660]   I'm playing media.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.580]   I'm looking at movies.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:30.540]   So off, I was actually just the other week.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.900]   I was watching a Klaus Nomi documentary.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:36.500]   And I was 10 minutes into it before I realized, oh, wait a minute.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.860]   I should be launching iTunes for this.
[00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:40.740]   But I've been just sitting back and watching it in Quick Look.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.820]   And that's slick and that useful.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   How do you get to Quick Look?
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:44.940]   Is it part of the finder?
[00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:45.740]   What happens?
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.540]   I don't understand.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.940]   It's a right click.
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.540]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.380]   It's a quick click.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.220]   So you right click on a file, and then there's a quick look
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.260]   as one of the things, and you can just look at it.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:55.700]   Exactly.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.380]   Not modify it, but you can watch a movie.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:03.740]   It actually launches a very, very slick looking viewer interface.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.300]   Kind of a browser.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.980]   Yeah, it actually looks a lot like-- no, no, no, no.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.300]   The browser looks a lot like aperture.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.140]   Recon full screen.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.140]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.300]   Right.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:14.900]   So it doesn't look like you're just checking out something
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.500]   in the finder.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.820]   I've just quick looked a picture I took two weeks ago,
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.780]   and I'm seeing a large version of the preview.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.500]   I'm seeing all the technical data that came with it.
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.220]   If I click this really cool slick translucent full screen
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.340]   button, it does away with the entire interface.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.540]   I'm just looking at it in a very, very high detail.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.220]   At which point I can add it to iPhoto.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.020]   I can flip-- if I've selected more than one photo,
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.900]   I can page through it like a slideshow.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.820]   It makes it very easy to forget that you're still
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.380]   in the finder.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.660]   It makes it feel like just a basic service that's
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.260]   available to everything.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.020]   So it's definitely one of those things where I didn't have
[00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.380]   no idea how much I'd use it until I was forced to use it,
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.500]   or the forced-- well, until it was available all the time,
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.100]   rather.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.900]   Yeah, it seems like a very useful thing.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.460]   And actually, a little more smoothly integrated
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.580]   than the Pathfinder preview.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.860]   So there you go.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:01.020]   64-bit from top to bottom, including a 64-bit cocoa layer.
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:02.460]   This is where I--
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.860]   Don't tell me the people oud over 64-bit.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:05.360]   I know.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.860]   I don't have to think they're pumping something.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:09.220]   What they oud over is when he loaded that picture really fast,
[00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:09.720]   right?
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.380]   True.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.220]   Yeah, that was cool.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:17.940]   But people around me anyway, that wasn't something
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.740]   they paid that much attention to.
[00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.660]   They were still buzzing about the quick look thing.
[00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.780]   Oh, interesting.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.260]   Well, and rightly so, because the only reason
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.820]   this demo makes any sense is because it was a 4 gigabyte photo.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.940]   I mean, the real gain in 64-bit is that you can access a lot
[00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:32.580]   of RAM.
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.900]   I mean, it doesn't make things faster in and of itself.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.700]   So there's a little disingenuous of Steve's say,
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.420]   look how fast this photo loads.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.700]   Yeah, loads could be faster there,
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.860]   because it's 4 gigabytes.
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.700]   Well, I put it to you this way, Leo.
[00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.820]   Is 64 not a larger number than 32?
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:48.820]   Yes.
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.220]   Twice as big.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:49.540]   There you go.
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.060]   We've-- we've just justified its existence.
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:52.580]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.420]   I will tell you, one guy sitting next to me said,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.660]   well, they'll really get my attention when it's 128.
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.260]   130, they've got my money.
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:02.660]   133.
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.340]   Well, it does give them bragging rights.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.180]   I mean, Windows is still 32-bit.
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.180]   There's a 64-bit, but nobody uses it.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:12.060]   I so don't want to drink with those people.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.900]   If they're buying, I'll drink with anybody.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:16.220]   I'll just get stolen if he's buying 120.
[00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.780]   God, what a dull thing to be about.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:18.700]   I think it was a joke.
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:20.340]   I think that was a good joke.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.300]   Oh, in that case, part of the arc.
[00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.780]   Don't you think?
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.740]   I think that's a funny joke.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.660]   He'll get my attention when it's 128.
[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.220]   To me, that's more like a--
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:27.860]   Yawn.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:30.300]   If he was serious, then I think you're right.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.580]   Let's be charitable and say he was joking.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.500]   But I don't know.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.820]   He had one of those neckbeards, so I wasn't sure how to take him.
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.700]   Was it a clip on?
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.180]   It's got a clip on neckbeards.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.660]   He was laughing because barbecue potato chips
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.220]   were falling out of his neck.
[00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.620]   So, I'll say that for later.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.380]   I've amused myself again.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.060]   Now, I didn't see this, but it looks like it was a pretty cool
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:54.060]   demo that you showed the Apple TV interface.
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:56.220]   Oh, my God.
[00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.700]   This is using core animation and showing how--
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.660]   so they have-- in the Apple TV startup window,
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.140]   they have all these little movies,
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.940]   thumbnails, thousands running.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.380]   And they're all playing at the same time.
[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:08.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.140]   That's pretty cool.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.740]   Definitely catering to the 12 and 13-year-old market.
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:17.300]   They're just nothing lasts more than 90s, like 1.8 seconds.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.980]   I'll be impressed with it's a 300 by 400.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.300]   Who has time to watch an eight-second preview?
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:23.340]   Come on.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:25.780]   That actually what I thought would be cool
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:29.780]   is in this world of ADD-dominated podcast hosts,
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:32.980]   you could literally watch hundreds of quick-time videos
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.700]   all at once.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.700]   You watch a whole season of the fire at once.
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.340]   You'd be like a situation for entertainment.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.540]   And it'll make just about as much sense.
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:43.820]   Anybody want to say anything--
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:44.540]   Watch that.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.020]   More about core animation is just basically built-in animation.
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:48.700]   I don't know.
[00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:49.780]   What does it do?
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:53.260]   It basically allows you to take out any application you're
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:54.780]   working on and, with one day's more of it,
[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.620]   make it exponentially more awesome.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:56.900]   Right.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.380]   I love core animation.
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.180]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.820]   But again, this is really what's the strength of OS X.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:03.940]   I don't know how much developers use it,
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:06.860]   but things like Quartz Core Audio, Core Animation.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.820]   These things are very, very powerful.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.780]   WebKit.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.100]   Well, one thing to remember about all these things
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.980]   like core animation and core audio
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.380]   is that it is going to change a little bit the way people
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.300]   develop apps, for instance, with Aputure,
[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:25.500]   because of so many things being tied to the OS.
[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.820]   They kind of have to wait for OS updates
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.060]   to upgrade the program.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.740]   So that is one thing to keep in mind.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.180]   And it won't run on Windows either, which probably
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.340]   is a lot of the reason why they do this.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.180]   Now, I'm looking--
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:38.340]   Is that so good?
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.900]   I'm looking here and I'm seeing Solitaire on the screen.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.780]   And Minesweeper, I can only think one thing.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:46.260]   He's got Windows running.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.620]   He was showing the bootcamp thing.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.620]   All right.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:49.980]   That makes sense.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.820]   And he picked the lamest Windows apps
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.420]   he could find to demonstrate.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.420]   Look, we can do Office Solitaire.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.780]   Where's Minesweeper?
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.100]   So this is going to be built in.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.460]   It'll be free.
[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.060]   No more CD burning for the drivers.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:05.100]   The drivers are built in.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:05.780]   That's nice.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.300]   I noticed he did give a plug for both parallels and VMware,
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.500]   though, so they're not going away.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.500]   Nor are they going to be subsumed into Leopard.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.580]   Now, Scott, was the demo--
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.660]   Was he showing parallels or was he showing bootcamp bootcamp?
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.420]   It looked like bootcamp to me, of course.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.900]   I'm pure blood, so I couldn't do it.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:22.980]   No, it was-- I'll tell you.
[00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:24.180]   It was parallels because it's--
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.900]   Because it was the dock at the bottom, I was about to say.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.380]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.620]   That would be awesome.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.780]   Well, you know, parallels lets you
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.860]   run your bootcamp partition as a parallels window.
[00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.340]   So you can install into bootcamp
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:37.380]   and then run install parallels on OS X.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.700]   And you'll have the choice without another install of Windows.
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.700]   I think that's a very nice feature of parallels.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.740]   That's very the matrix.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.620]   I'm doing a virtualization of a virtualization now.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:47.580]   Oh, man, coherence mode in parallels.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.340]   Talk about matrix.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:52.020]   And now with this new parallels three, where you can choose
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.900]   which operating system you want to open and document in.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.580]   I mean, that's just awesome.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:58.020]   There really is no-- I can't see any reason to buy a Windows
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:58.820]   machine at this point.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:02.220]   I mean, you get a great Windows machine when you buy a Mac.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.380]   Careful.
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:04.220]   Careful there.
[00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:05.100]   Hey, it's Mac Break Weekly.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.500]   No Windows people listen to this.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.380]   OK.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.620]   I'm not going to ruin my rep.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.500]   And there'll be no Windows Weekly podcast this week.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.860]   If they lost their audio drivers about two days ago,
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.540]   don't worry about it.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.580]   Listen to anything.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.740]   Yeah, he showed coherence, which is kind of neat.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.740]   OK, spaces.
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.460]   We've seen this before.
[00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:21.980]   Nothing new.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.900]   It's the same spaces.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.820]   Any new announcements?
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.100]   No.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.500]   It's the same spaces he showed a year ago.
[00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:27.100]   All right.
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:27.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.420]   Can I just-- I mean, all you guys are smarter than me.
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.140]   I just-- you know, I didn't see anything
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:35.140]   to be terribly excited about by that.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.900]   I could never get my hand and my head around.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.940]   You know, this is another one of the things
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.420]   that one would have called virtue desktop.
[00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:39.900]   Virtual desktop.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.220]   Be or whatever.
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:40.580]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.540]   And I actually-- there's a number of them for the Mac
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.340]   that worked pretty well.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:44.700]   I'd like to watch some--
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.180]   I'm going to do my Matlock now, Scott Born.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:49.780]   Since y'all are out there a lot smarter than me,
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:53.300]   I'd like to watch-- I'd like to watch some really smart power
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:54.220]   users of this user.
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.980]   Because I tried it when the open source version of this.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.940]   And I was pulling my hair out after like three minutes.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:02.500]   That iTunes only lives in this one view that's--
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:02.860]   It's kind of weird.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:03.340]   --screens.
[00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:07.580]   But I could see it being handy if you totally work in modes.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.260]   But unless you can have two--
[00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.860]   I don't know what the word is-- instantiation
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.500]   so that application.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.260]   Or you know what I mean?
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.140]   It would make me-- which I guess defeats the purpose.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.180]   It came from the Linux world.
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.500]   And it's just--
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:18.860]   Screen.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.100]   It's like running screen, right?
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.140]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.820]   Oddly enough, I think it works--
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.700]   now you think that it would be of best value for people
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.820]   who have like MacBooks with small screens.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.860]   And my use of it, I really think it works best
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.380]   if you have a big cinema display.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:34.660]   Because it's just as you say, if you're in a mode of work
[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.060]   where--
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.100]   let's say I'm an aperture and I'm editing photos,
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.820]   but I also need to click in a Photoshop to do some more
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:40.460]   serious editing.
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.180]   Plus, I've got this new HDR tool that I'm using for other things.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.900]   If you can have every window in that space open and available
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.860]   with one click, it's a very useful thing.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.820]   As a way of burrowing through 64 windows on a small desktop,
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.700]   it's a much easier to simply command tab
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.500]   or use a third party tool to navigate between them.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:58.820]   I don't think I would use spaces to manage 64 windows,
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:03.340]   so much as to get my head into this problem of creating
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:07.820]   a document or laying out a book or editing a photo.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.420]   I don't think I work that way, and maybe you don't either.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:10.940]   I use--
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:11.860]   That's right, bikes.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.700]   Yeah, I use virtue desktops.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.420]   I mean, I have it, I paid for it,
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.660]   but I always turn it off because it just doesn't--
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.100]   well, for one thing, it confuses me
[00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:20.620]   because I'll have a set amount of different desktop.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:21.500]   And it's just, where am I?
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.380]   What am I doing?
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.540]   And I have a 30 inch display.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.300]   I just have a lot of windows open, and so.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:27.660]   3,000 plus widgets.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.660]   OK, woohoo.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.660]   Any more than correct time?
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:37.780]   I'll be impressed when there are 3 million.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:38.780]   Well, it was cool.
[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:41.220]   It was cool the way you could just do a snip right
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.060]   from a web page.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.020]   That part was kind of cool.
[00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:43.860]   That's neat.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.820]   Leo, you've become some kind of like a disillusioned
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.140]   Marlene Dietrich kind of care.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.820]   I'm so tired.
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.020]   I'm tired of being tired.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.100]   Another one.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.500]   Cigarette holder.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.260]   Little top hat.
[00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.700]   So Job says, I use dashboard many, many times a day.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.980]   I'd sure like to know what jobs is it for looking at Dilbert
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:03.460]   Cartains?
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.140]   What exactly is he using that for many times a day?
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.540]   Dashboard is lost on me.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:08.540]   I got to tell you.
[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.100]   I use Yahoo widgets because they're there all the time.
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.380]   I don't like having to press F12 to see my dashboard.
[00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:18.220]   Yeah, I mean, the only time I use dashboard widgets is when I
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.260]   can just drag them onto the desktop and use them
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:21.660]   alongside my rear-to-the-windows.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.700]   But see, the lip must test for me when I realized that the
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.100]   dock had sort of failed to catch with me just like the rest
[00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.540]   of you guys was when I realized that any time I need to look
[00:46:29.540 --> 00:46:31.860]   up a dictionary word, I'm launching the dictionary app.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.660]   I'm not going into dashboard.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.220]   Hey, let me ask you this.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.260]   Is there a way-- I know there's that way where you can do
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.700]   that secret foo with command drag close to make it stay?
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.820]   Is there any way that you can drill down to a dashboard
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:49.420]   widget and have it pop up without going into dashboard?
[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.580]   So here's a use case.
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:51.900]   Let's see.
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:54.340]   I want to use the stupid dictionary widget instead of
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.860]   going to someplace like, say, Google.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.060]   If let's say I want that.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:00.860]   Is there a way I can, in Quicksilver, pop up, bring up
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.100]   the dictionary widget, I hit it and quit it and I'm done.
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.940]   Do I have to go into that little alcove of functionality
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:07.940]   over in dashboard?
[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.540]   Or can I just have it come up somewhere and use it?
[00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:12.140]   Because that, you know, that would be really cool.
[00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:12.740]   I would use that.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.660]   So to me, that's why I use Yahoo widgets because they can
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.420]   live at different layers on the desktop.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.260]   It just makes sense.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.420]   They're there.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:20.220]   Well, we're also OK.
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.220]   And I'm going to send my second time with this podcast.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:24.860]   I'm going to send a little love to the Windows people.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:25.460]   They're humans.
[00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.220]   I heard you like the sidebar?
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:31.740]   I love the way the sidebar works in Vista because there's an
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.140]   option where you can say, look, I want to dedicate this
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.860]   section of my window just to widgets.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.700]   I want that because there's some things that I don't want
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:39.820]   that I don't want them be covered up.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.660]   I want to always be able to check on this eBay thing.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:44.380]   I want to always be able to check on the last five things
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.380]   and in gadget.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.980]   And that's the reason why some of the things are useless to me
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.180]   because they don't have their own little area where they're
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:51.020]   not going to be covered up.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:51.540]   I need--
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.540]   I think that was an insight.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.900]   Microsoft had that Apple apparently hasn't yet had, which
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.460]   is that most people have these wide screen displays.
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.700]   And there is real estate on the left and right side.
[00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:00.900]   Yeah.
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:02.500]   It would be like to me, it's almost like putting the
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.060]   speedometer on the back of the visor.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.820]   Like, I want to check my speed so I'll just flip this down
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:08.300]   for a second.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:08.820]   Exactly.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:10.340]   It's like a great analogy.
[00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.300]   That's exactly it.
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.660]   And I--
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:12.860]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:13.380]   Go ahead.
[00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:13.700]   Sorry.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.380]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:16.260]   I was just going to say that I actually--
[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.660]   I was like, three years ago, two or three years ago, I got
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.540]   so frustrated by this that I actually mocked up what that
[00:48:21.540 --> 00:48:23.500]   should look like and I gave it during a keynote.
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.500]   And a year later, that's what's appearing in Vista.
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.140]   It just really changed my job first to know that this idea
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:29.580]   that--
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.580]   not that I'm saying that it got for me.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.900]   I'm saying that this idea first appeared on Windows
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:33.660]   and out of the Macintosh.
[00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.580]   Like, that's not the way my universe works.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:36.100]   Right.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:36.660]   Right.
[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:40.820]   I'm not supposed to envy window users, except for the games.
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.140]   AACLD in iChat, that might be interesting.
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.740]   If iChat sounds a heck of a lot better, we might switch
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:47.740]   from Skype to iChat.
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.900]   That'd be kind of interesting.
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:51.580]   Tab to chats, photobooth effects.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:52.900]   I don't--
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.220]   Ooh, look, I'm in a mirror.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:56.500]   iChat theater.
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.580]   I don't know what the hell that would be.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.780]   When you go not to Mount Pilot, yeah.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.020]   And then backdrops, because frankly, I
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.660]   don't want to look like I'm here in my office and my jammies.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:09.260]   I want to look like I'm in the veldt.
[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.860]   So yeah, look, he put Phil Schiller in an aquarium.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.140]   I thought that was cool.
[00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.500]   When he stuck his tongue out through Steve Ballmer's picture,
[00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.300]   that got the most applause of that part.
[00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.940]   Yeah, OK, so I'm seeing Steve Ballmer's picture here.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:22.260]   So what did he do?
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.020]   He made it look like he was sticking his tongue out.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:26.060]   Oh, that's funny.
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:29.580]   You could do the clutch cargo talking thing.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.820]   But that wouldn't be good.
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:31.860]   I would do that.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.820]   The thing that was potentially interesting about all that
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.060]   was being able to share iPhoto slide shows and keynote
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.060]   presentations over iChat.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.380]   Oh, interesting.
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.140]   And that part definitely got my attention.
[00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.420]   Interesting.
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.700]   Yeah, screen sharing.
[00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.940]   That's going to be a really big feature, not just in support,
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:51.420]   but Justin, all these people who are the only person
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.780]   who knows how to get anything working on any computer
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.700]   anywhere in the family.
[00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.900]   I'm actually happy to hear about this,
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.860]   because iChat seems to me a long, neglected app.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:59.980]   In fact, I even said that on a Mac wine a while ago.
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.660]   And I'm glad to see that they're doing something with it,
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.100]   because it wasn't keeping up.
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.740]   I moved to Addium.
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.420]   So maybe it'll be time to move back.
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.380]   It sounds like some good functionality in there.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.180]   Yeah, the best feature is that it gives you
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.460]   a feature that's been on other chat clients for a long time.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.540]   The availability to be invisible but online.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.260]   So I can see everybody else who's out there.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:18.380]   And if I need-- oh wait, Merlin,
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:19.500]   I need to talk to him about something.
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.180]   But no one can chat me, even though I've got my own ways.
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:22.980]   Selfish of you.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.820]   So you see them, but they can't see you.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:28.060]   I need less technology to commit me to humanity.
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:30.820]   I need to make this wall thicker, damn it.
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.420]   You're like a personality leech.
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.060]   You only look like--
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:33.740]   Exactly.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:36.620]   A personality leech.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:39.500]   Hey man, I'm a personality metastasizer.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:43.020]   I send my little drones out to inflect--
[00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:45.820]   You know, bad, bad vibe cancer than other people.
[00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:46.540]   Oh, dear.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:47.060]   Oh dear.
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.300]   I like that in Addium.
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:49.540]   Addium makes it easy to--
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.660]   this might exist in iChat.
[00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.620]   But Addium has a neat thing.
[00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:53.140]   With a pulldown, you can say, I just
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:55.140]   want to be visible to this group.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.380]   Or I want to just be invisible to these people.
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:58.700]   That's how it should be.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:00.660]   That's the most important part of a chat.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.220]   J-random war dialer.
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.300]   Like, hey, what's up?
[00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:04.540]   You know?
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.900]   I mean, it really is an important feature.
[00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:09.380]   I mean, just this morning, I'm on dead--
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.540]   that's why I didn't go to bed until like noon today,
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.580]   because I was on deadline, like, up to the last minute crunch.
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.340]   And I need to have my editors be able to see me
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:19.500]   and get in touch with me if they need to get a quick chat.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.340]   And some guy, I chatted me like 10, 20, say, hey,
[00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.220]   I got a problem with this OS.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:25.980]   Keep helping with that.
[00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.940]   Say, no, I'm on deadline.
[00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:28.140]   It'll only take me one second.
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.660]   Yeah, but your one second is not more important than mine.
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.380]   One second, goodbye.
[00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.100]   So again, you need to be able to manage your--
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:36.860]   more access is not just more access.
[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.980]   More access is your ability to define
[00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.460]   what versions of the world you're willing to expose yourself
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.860]   to, so to speak.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.380]   Talk about masking.
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.540]   Add anyone given time.
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.500]   Time machine.
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.420]   We've seen this before.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.740]   That's number 10 he showed.
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:50.580]   That's going to be good.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.860]   Windows has it.
[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:56.260]   I mean, useful, probably very, very, very useful.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:01.180]   Maybe even like the most useful feature, but oh, I'm--
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:01.940]   OK, what else?
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.580]   I'm going through the list.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:08.020]   Oh, 129 bucks, even in the ultimate version.
[00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:08.420]   Here we go.
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.220]   Now one more thing.
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:13.020]   And now this is where the developers are saying, please,
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:17.620]   Steve, please open the iPhone, please.
[00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:19.780]   And he didn't.
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.180]   Safari was his focus.
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.140]   I don't know why Safari for Windows
[00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.860]   is something that should--
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:29.340]   Steve Jobs held off Leopard till October,
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:32.460]   because they were so busy working on the iPhone.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.500]   And Safari for Windows?
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.580]   What's the deal?
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.740]   I don't buy any of that.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:39.460]   I think that they were just working on Leopard.
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:42.380]   And they're using that as a very convenient reason to say.
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.580]   That probably makes sense.
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:46.940]   Although that was the item when I was getting caught up
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:47.420]   on the cover.
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.300]   That's the thing that I've reread twice, because Apple--
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.060]   if you think about Apple creating a third--
[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:55.460]   a multi-platform browser, that's like saying, well,
[00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:56.580]   what are they going to do next?
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.300]   Are they going to create their own brand of cola now?
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:59.340]   Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.020]   Firefox is there.
[00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.220]   It doesn't need to be done.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:02.940]   I don't--
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.060]   OK, well, it does.
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:04.540]   It will--
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.660]   What is the advantage for Apple?
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:07.860]   Why does Apple do this?
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:09.740]   Well, it goes--
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:11.780]   it's just a slightly orthogonal view of what we've
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.420]   been talking about since January, which
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:17.580]   is that this is the first time, as I sat there and wept,
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.380]   when we first talked about how there might not
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:20.660]   be third party ads.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.780]   We talked about the fact that this is the first time
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:25.780]   that a lot of people are going to be holding the Mac OS
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.180]   in their hand, and to be able to have that continuity
[00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:30.020]   between what they're doing on their phone versus what
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.740]   they're doing on the desktop seems to me
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.860]   like the thin end of the wedge to get them into an open view.
[00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.460]   I can see with iTunes, but a browser's pretty much a browser.
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:40.380]   Most of the browser experience isn't even from the browser.
[00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.180]   It's from the site you're on.
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.900]   But I'd like to think about one thing, though,
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.980]   that kind of made a click with me.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:49.140]   Realize that in the same, I think, half hour span,
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:53.180]   Steve talked about Apple supporting a new class of web apps
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.220]   that work through Safari browser on the iPhone.
[00:53:56.220 --> 00:53:57.780]   And then he said, oh, by the way,
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:01.460]   we're creating a Safari browser on Windows.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.540]   So do you think that this new class of web apps
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:06.460]   is something that isn't web standard?
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:12.860]   I think this is a way for Apple to subtly start
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:16.220]   putting their software making it available to Windows people.
[00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:19.100]   I think this is a strategic move, not a tactical move,
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:20.340]   meaning it's something that they're
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:22.660]   planning to put infrastructure in place
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:24.220]   so they can do something really cool next year,
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:26.460]   as opposed to simply releasing a new browser.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.060]   Now, as it is, I'm kind of interested
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:29.660]   in getting my hands on Safari for Windows,
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:34.140]   because one of the things I really just hate about Firefox
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:36.140]   is that it doesn't do any color management whatsoever.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:36.820]   Every time I'm--
[00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:39.100]   So far as the only browser that does good color management.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:41.020]   Yeah, I mean, I have to strike two different versions
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:42.340]   of every photo I post on Flickr,
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.860]   because I have to make sure it looks halfway decent on Firefox.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.300]   And I can't always do that.
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:49.020]   Also, it is a lot faster than Firefox.
[00:54:49.020 --> 00:54:51.100]   But based on the K browser, so probably,
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.020]   which is the Linux browser built in KDE,
[00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:54.540]   it probably wasn't too hard to port it.
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.060]   I just--
[00:54:55.060 --> 00:54:58.420]   It seems an odd thing to do, but now I'm getting it,
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:01.500]   because when you say it's a strategic idea,
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.780]   the idea is Apple's going to start developing apps
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.020]   that are Safari specific.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.340]   Well, yeah, what if--
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:08.980]   So look at it this way.
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:11.060]   What's the thing Mr. Alex Lindsey always
[00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.740]   has finally convinced me of anyway,
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.980]   is that it's not about the iPod, it's about iTunes.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:16.940]   And iTunes makes the iPod very powerful.
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:19.620]   Conceivably, what if Safari becomes the thin end of the wedge
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.140]   for the OS in general?
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.660]   Right.
[00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:24.300]   I wonder if it is in a way to start
[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:28.780]   looking at a Google-like approach to applications once--
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:29.900]   Oh, sure it is.
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.300]   Yeah, once they get Safari on the--
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.700]   Google-like machine, they can make their own documents.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:34.460]   Ooh.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:35.140]   Speaking of somebody--
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:35.660]   I like that.
[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.900]   Speaking of somebody, though, who is a believer,
[00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:42.980]   and strong believer in non-proprietary open source,
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:44.940]   this is just one more proprietary platform.
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.780]   I much prefer to see Google Gears and Firefox
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:52.180]   than I want to see Safari and unique apps that only
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:52.780]   run on Safari.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:53.700]   I mean, it's good for Apple.
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:55.460]   I'm not saying it's not, but I don't think
[00:55:55.460 --> 00:55:57.980]   it's good for the ecology.
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:55:59.460]   Well, if the-- I don't care.
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:00.060]   Again, I have to take--
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:01.260]   Do we need a new platform?
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:03.500]   We've already-- you know, Ajax runs on all browsers.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.740]   Let's do Ajax.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:09.420]   Yeah, but I only care about what I get out of a user.
[00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.020]   I really don't give a damn about the industry.
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.220]   Well, you should.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:12.820]   You should.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:14.220]   I'm not going to make my pitch for that.
[00:56:14.220 --> 00:56:15.020]   Because--
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:17.220]   How has the industry helped me get my work done
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.220]   in the next three hours when I only have too much work to do?
[00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.540]   But I don't care about proprietary standards.
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.620]   Long as the proprietary standard is the best standard,
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:27.500]   and it doesn't put my neck in a vice.
[00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:29.220]   I think that's a short-sighted.
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:31.260]   Now, I agree if you're on deadline, maybe you need
[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.460]   to be short-sighted.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:35.860]   But you also need to take the longer view that--
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:37.820]   Having this-- having another--
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.540]   First of all, we don't need another proprietary platform.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:42.740]   Well, remember that we're all just speculating
[00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.420]   about this being a proprietary new platform.
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:45.580]   So let's just be careful about that.
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.100]   True.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.260]   That would be the-- to me, that seems like the only reason
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:49.500]   you would want to even do this.
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.580]   If the apps that are Safari apps on the iPhone
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:56.540]   run on Firefox, what's the point?
[00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.900]   Well, also, what's the point of having an open standard
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.500]   that no one can individually control?
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:02.500]   This is one of the things that I think has consistently held--
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:03.740]   There's no point for Apple, but there's
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.100]   a lot of point for users.
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:05.500]   No, no.
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.820]   Well, no.
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:08.460]   This is one of the big problems that I've always
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.900]   had with open source software.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.180]   Occasionally, you need someone to take one step back and say,
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:16.340]   OK, how does my-- how does my Anastel approach this?
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:17.740]   How does this look to my Anastel?
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:19.140]   Ubuntu is wonderful.
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:20.780]   But if it doesn't-- if at any point,
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:23.180]   after you bring up a command line to get anything to work,
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:23.980]   you failed.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.540]   Don't ship it yet.
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:26.980]   And one of the greatest things about Apple
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.220]   is that they have the ability to steer things.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:29.700]   Yes.
[00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:32.260]   And the trains run on time.
[00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.780]   There's a-- believe it or not, I did not plan this.
[00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.260]   I've not met this man before.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:38.100]   I've just chosen my friend around the audience.
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:39.700]   But I was just-- I actually happened
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:41.980]   to cut and paste a quote from GK Chester's
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:44.340]   in this morning that turns out to be absolutely perfect.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.300]   He said, "Progress should mean that we are always
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.540]   changing the world to fit the vision.
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:50.540]   Instead, we're always changing the vision."
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:52.780]   And I really think that Apple is in the business of saying,
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:54.140]   look, here's this cool thing.
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.500]   We're going to put it out there.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.340]   Bring your preconceptions to it, but now it's out there.
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:00.620]   Now you can actually use it and benefit from it.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:02.580]   I think that too much of the rest of the world, sometimes
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.820]   open source as well, it's all about, well, here's
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:05.420]   a limitation.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:05.980]   Oh, I know.
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:07.620]   But if you like Linux, you're going to be able to use this.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:08.460]   Oh, I know.
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:11.660]   I know that it'd be better off for you guys, the users,
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:14.860]   if we made this really cool, insanely good proprietary
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.340]   technology that made things twice as good.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:17.780]   But it wouldn't be open then.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:18.220]   So I'm sorry.
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:21.860]   Please be happy with this 1998 style application.
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.460]   That's not good enough for me.
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:24.940]   Well, I don't think it is either or.
[00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.060]   I mean, you could have open applications that are insanely
[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:28.060]   good.
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:30.020]   Just that Apple's not going to make them.
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:30.540]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.060]   I'm just not willing to ding Apple for not making a completely
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.300]   open anything.
[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.460]   Always make the best solution, no matter what.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.180]   Well, I dig them when they're talking about the web,
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:42.060]   because that's the problem, is we need web standards.
[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:44.620]   I ding Microsoft for making it an Explorer, not support web
[00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.060]   standards.
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:46.020]   We got to support.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:48.060]   That's the whole point of the web, is that it's platform
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:48.940]   agnostic.
[00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:49.980]   Let me ask you this, though.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:52.660]   Where did you guys get that this is going to be proprietary
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.820]   in any conceivable way?
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:54.260]   Exactly.
[00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.860]   That's why I said that's why I said that's why I said that.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.660]   I read it.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.460]   We're speculating about HX apps that only work out.
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.260]   Well, what I read in the press release,
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:01.940]   but I read in the press release is, once again,
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:05.460]   I probably miss you so the word of the phrase, web 2.0.
[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:06.940]   But I can't-- don't have it in front of me right now.
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.540]   But the press release on the Apple site said specifically,
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.220]   this is going to be based on web 2.0 and internet standards.
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.580]   As long as it's standards based, I'm fine with it.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:16.740]   So I would take that mean.
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:19.500]   But I mean, at the same time, the other way
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:22.020]   to look at this is to go, wow, thanks, Steve.
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.980]   Your big one more thing was that we
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:26.860]   should use JavaScript to make web pages interactive.
[00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.220]   That's a great idea.
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:29.700]   You should get a name for that.
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.860]   Roll over buttons.
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.180]   Another Apple innovation, by the way we patented it.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.220]   I have an idea that you can electronically
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:38.980]   send a kind of mail from one Mac to another.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:41.900]   By breaking down information to a system of ones and zeros,
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.820]   we refer to this as Apple Open Binary.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.820]   Well, maybe all of this really is just
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.620]   to appease the developers and say, look,
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:50.660]   we're going to give you a way to put third party apps on the iPhone.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:53.020]   I mean, isn't that really what this is all about?
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:56.660]   I think it was a good compromise because from one perspective,
[00:59:56.660 --> 00:59:59.380]   if they completely opened it up, you'd have all the people going,
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.980]   ah, now it's going to be virus prone.
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.460]   And then they gave something up.
[01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:06.900]   I don't think this is the end of this conversation.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:08.500]   I think it's a first step.
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.340]   And remembering that you do allegedly
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:14.820]   have access to all the iPhone services like dialing
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.300]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.220]   So let's see what comes about.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.180]   How do you--
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:22.020]   I mean, I hate to be such a--
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.220]   so stuck in the past.
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:26.420]   But if I were to take an airplane from one city to another,
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.180]   how would I use that application while I'm in the air?
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:29.700]   Well, no.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.260]   And that's one of the things Google Gears does.
[01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:34.500]   It allows you to make these applications survive
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.380]   when you're offline.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.460]   And I think that that's completely doable.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.020]   You're saying-- so you Leo the Port.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:41.740]   You're saying, setting aside all this kind of political stuff
[01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.540]   that's associated with open source stuff,
[01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:46.180]   you're saying that there's a rich community of people
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.340]   out here or a rich community that's putting together all this
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:48.980]   stuff.
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.060]   Why kind of leave that behind?
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:51.700]   We can still--
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:54.020]   Well, and your point is absolutely well taken.
[01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.380]   They may not be leaving it behind.
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.540]   In fact, it doesn't look like--
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.380]   I have no reason to say they won't.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:58.860]   Yeah.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.180]   Safari is still one of the most standards compliant
[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.020]   browsers around.
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:02.540]   Absolutely.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.040]   Absolutely.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.040]   I don't think they didn't worry about it.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.140]   But again, I just think that I'm excited about the idea
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:08.420]   of a company saying, well, look, if we can make the user
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.140]   experience better by doing something that's
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.700]   proprietary, as opposed to just giving us a new technology
[01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:14.700]   that we can own locks, stock, and barrel,
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.620]   I just don't see that as a bad thing.
[01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:18.380]   While I poo-pooed initially the idea
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:21.220]   of keeping third party apps off, pointing out that, look,
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.660]   one of the strengths of the Palm platform as an example
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.020]   is that all is to tens of thousands of great third party
[01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:26.520]   apps.
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:30.100]   It doesn't compromise you're a trio because it's a Palm.
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:31.180]   But we're in a new era.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:33.820]   And maybe Steve is saying, well, we've
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.660]   got to sandbox these applications.
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.740]   We're going to sandbox them.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.420]   In Safari, we're going to make it as a platform that
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:44.100]   is every bit as functional and maybe even easier to develop
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:44.300]   for.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:46.300]   Because remember, when you develop a Palm app,
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:48.420]   you have to learn the Palm API.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:50.620]   Well, everybody knows Web 2.0 and Ajax.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.060]   There's a lot of developers.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.380]   Here's one other thing, though.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.500]   OK, so if this thing will work with .Mac and Sync,
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:58.500]   presumably, right?
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500]   It's got to take a problem, right?
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.900]   All those services are supposed to be available.
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.340]   I just want to take a step at a time, though.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:10.660]   If you have a .Mac account and you've got your contacts
[01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:13.980]   and you've got your calendar entries and you got--
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.460]   and maybe, let's just say just for the sake of argument,
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.860]   just for fun, let's say your .Mac web dev stuff,
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:22.140]   even though I know that's not going to happen.
[01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.060]   So then I guess, one way to look at this
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.660]   is Sync takes care of this.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.380]   So if, as I have understood from watching--
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.620]   That's how Google Gears works.
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:31.580]   You'll work in Google Calendar offline.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.580]   When you get off the plane, it'll sync up.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:34.660]   I'm just trying to come up with something
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.340]   that's plausible for the way that Apple comes to stuff.
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:37.260]   Totally doable.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:37.740]   Totally doable.
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.140]   So what you do is you go in there
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:40.300]   and you fiddle around with stuff.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.300]   You make all your changes.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.500]   And they sync.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.380]   And if, indeed, these applications
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:47.060]   do give you some kind of hooks into the services,
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:48.900]   into a dress book, into that kind of stuff,
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:51.340]   you could conceivably go in there, make notes, do whatever,
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:52.780]   like, write on a Palm.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.380]   And then that gets synced up next time around.
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.820]   Does that seem like a bomb in the way to do that?
[01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:56.980]   That they're going to do that.
[01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:58.780]   I believe so, yeah.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:01.980]   Now, I was worried that, with the iPhone release,
[01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.140]   only a couple weeks away now, that we would stop having
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:06.540]   to speculate and make weird wild guesses about what's going to happen.
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.020]   See?
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:08.420]   I'm glad that we've got new fodder for that.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.420]   I was speculating for months and months to come.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:11.700]   I want to point out new things.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:12.900]   I'd like to point out one of those things.
[01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:13.700]   Our careers as pundits are secure.
[01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:15.060]   I would like to point out one other thing.
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.460]   The dashboard widgets and Yahoo widgets, both,
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:21.020]   are written in JavaScript and CSS,
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.980]   that they are, in fact, web applications,
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.300]   or could be web applications.
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:29.260]   So if you can do it in a widget, you could probably do it on an iPhone.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:29.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.660]   And actually, this comes back to the point
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.900]   that I was making a few minutes earlier that you bring up
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.820]   all the tens of thousands of apps that are available for Palm.
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:37.660]   Most of them are really, really crappy,
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:39.860]   because Palm doesn't exert any kind of-- I'm serious.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.540]   But that's fine.
[01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:41.300]   They're there, though.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.660]   I mean, their choice is there.
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.140]   They're functional, but they don't drive anything forward.
[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.260]   Some of them are great, though.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:47.180]   I mean, and the fact--
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:47.780]   Exactly.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.620]   OK, maybe you have to have 10,000 bad ones
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.420]   and to get 1,000 good ones.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:53.220]   But you've got 1,000 good ones.
[01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.300]   Yeah, but you've got to look through the 9,000 bad ones.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.820]   Well, I don't think that this necessarily
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.660]   is going to ensure that these will be great apps.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:02.500]   There'll be plenty of crappy apps written around Safari on the iPhone.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.260]   Well, that's why I actually like the idea of Apple being a gatekeeper
[01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.060]   for iPhone apps.
[01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:06.620]   I want--
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:07.660]   Are they going to be--
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.700]   For 500 frickin' bucks, I want all my apps to be touch sensitive.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:14.300]   I want them to work really, really well, really, really slickly.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.820]   I don't want to see someone convert their own open source
[01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.220]   terminal-based text editor.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:22.020]   I don't want to have, like, V-I on my iPhone.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.900]   I just want to say hi to John Gruber, who's just joined us,
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.980]   by the way, via phone.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:26.900]   Hey, John.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:27.380]   Hello.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.220]   How is everybody?
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.060]   We're very well.
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.460]   And can everybody hear John?
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:32.220]   I can hear him.
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.940]   All right, so hold on a second.
[01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:35.940]   I'll figure it out a way to make that possible.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:37.700]   All right, now you can hear him.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:39.500]   And you can hear all of us, yes?
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.140]   I can.
[01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:40.860]   Right.
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:44.420]   So we've actually just gone through the list of items
[01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:44.860]   announced.
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.380]   You could hear us wrapping up with the kind of let down announcement
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:51.180]   that there will be no third party apps, but there will now.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:55.700]   That's-- I got to tell you that the consensus here at WWDC
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.860]   is sort of one of being insulted, I think.
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.660]   I think if they had just said, look,
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.780]   we don't have any API news to announce yet.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.980]   We do have a good web browser.
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:09.260]   You can write websites that run great on the iPhone.
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.780]   And we're working on stuff for later.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:13.220]   People would have said, all right, that's cool.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:16.140]   But the way that they're sort of pitching this as, hey,
[01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:18.180]   you can write cool apps for the iPhone too.
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.980]   They're called websites.
[01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.380]   It seems patronizing.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.980]   Yeah, I mean, it does not go over wealth.
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:30.180]   It's sort of-- to call it anything
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.500]   other than a mud pie sandwich.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:39.220]   You can't spin developers like that.
[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:40.940]   I've heard three different people say, hey,
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:43.020]   if it's such a great way to write iPhone software,
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.540]   how come Apple isn't doing it for their apps?
[01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:46.620]   Exactly.
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:49.300]   You were at the OS 10 state of the union session.
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.420]   Just got out of that.
[01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:53.700]   Anything to report from that?
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.300]   Not really, except that it doesn't seem--
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.060]   my big question coming out of the keynote was going to be,
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.100]   is there--
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.340]   if they're calling this the way to write software
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:07.980]   for the iPhone website, are they
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.700]   going to have any kind of help like a standard CSS file,
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:17.700]   standard graphics, to use to simulate the iPhone interface?
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.100]   And the answer seems to be no.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:21.620]   There's no mention of it at OS 10 state of the union.
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:24.060]   So they didn't give out an SDK or anything like that?
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.100]   No, no.
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:25.740]   It seems like--
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:27.100]   Do they demo?
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:27.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:29.740]   You're on your own for faking it.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:30.860]   Go ahead, Annie.
[01:06:30.860 --> 01:06:33.620]   I was just going to ask, did they demo an application written
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:35.940]   using this technology so you can get an idea of what
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:38.500]   one of these third party apps would look like?
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:41.260]   Yeah, they have an LDAP lookup thing
[01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.900]   that they wrote internal apps.
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:48.780]   I think a former palm developer wrote that.
[01:06:48.780 --> 01:06:50.620]   So can you-- now, the real question
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:54.060]   is they claim hooks into the iPhone apps.
[01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:57.020]   Now, does that LDAP application now suddenly
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.740]   appear in my email app so that I can--
[01:06:58.740 --> 01:06:59.740]   No, no.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.140]   It's all through the book.
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:05.780]   You don't get-- there's no extra icons in the home screen.
[01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:06.300]   OK.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:06.780]   It's all on your--
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.580]   When they say integrate with iPhone services,
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:10.340]   it's a one-way integration.
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:13.420]   Well, and it looks like you can do something with a--
[01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.740]   like, to place a phone call.
[01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:21.220]   It's like a call, C-A-L-L colon, then the phone number, URL,
[01:07:21.220 --> 01:07:25.020]   and then you click it, and iPhone will read that, I guess,
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.780]   like a Skype call to URL.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:27.860]   It's a protocol call.
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:28.820]   Yeah, it's a protocol.
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:29.340]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.540]   Well, that's good.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.660]   It means you could have an application where--
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:33.900]   Oh, it's a website.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:35.140]   I mean--
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:36.940]   Well, now, I don't know if you heard,
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:39.380]   but I was just saying, well, aren't
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.900]   dashboard applications in JavaScript and CSS?
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:44.940]   I mean, if you can do a widget, that would--
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:46.180]   but you can't get an icon.
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:46.740]   So that's kind of--
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:46.940]   Right.
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:50.620]   You can't get an icon, and so you can't--
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:51.540]   Why not?
[01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.980]   Why can't you get an icon?
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:55.820]   Well, I mean, let's see where we are in a year.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:58.460]   I mean, like I said, it would have gone over a lot better
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:00.420]   if they would have said we have nothing to say about that yet.
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.740]   But in the meantime, you can write websites that
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:03.940]   are optimized for iPhone.
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.220]   What's your reaction to the leopard features
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.700]   that they showed the new Finder interface?
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.140]   Coverflow Stacks.
[01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:13.980]   You know, this is-- where's the secret?
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:15.460]   I mean, apparently, the secret interface
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:20.740]   was the secrets from last year's WWDC were--
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.140]   It's coverflow.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.100]   New window theme in coverflow in the Finder.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.700]   And the thing that cracked me up the most was--
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.060]   it seemed like coverflow is the one thing
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:33.060]   that Jobs was really enthusiastic about in the keynote.
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.860]   And it just cracked me up, and he kept calling it
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:36.620]   very, very useful.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:36.780]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.300]   Really, really useful.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.780]   That's my reaction to it.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:42.260]   I don't understand the value, although I guess some people,
[01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:45.180]   including Andy, like it.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.700]   Now, they're talking about 300 features.
[01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:49.140]   Did they give you any more insight into those other--
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.140]   290?
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:51.140]   No.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:52.140]   Nothing.
[01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:55.100]   I mean, I'm really kind of surprised by how much--
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.660]   how little information so far there is more than what
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.860]   you would have gleaned from August 2006 WWDC in terms of features.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:04.340]   Right, right.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.020]   They are handing out, though, a new copy of Leopard, yes?
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:09.020]   Yes.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:11.060]   So presumably, I saw people installing it.
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:12.500]   I don't have it installed yet, but I
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.740]   did see people installing it.
[01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.700]   And there's somebody-- I heard somebody say,
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.860]   I mean, this is just an overheard conversation.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:23.180]   But apparently, there's a lot to talk about in ICal, which
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.660]   is new, and totally got cut out of the keynote,
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:27.340]   did not make the keynote.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.300]   Well, you'd expect that.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.220]   I mean, he only showed 10 features.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:30.860]   How about mail?
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:31.940]   Anything new there?
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:33.740]   No, not a word yet.
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:34.260]   Nothing.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:35.940]   Are you going to do a write up on daring fireball?
[01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:38.260]   What can we expect in terms of your coverage?
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:38.980]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:39.940]   I haven't thought about it yet.
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:42.780]   I guess something, some kind of pulse,
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.420]   what's the consensus.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:46.380]   But it's kind of hard.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.580]   There's not really a lot of news.
[01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:48.860]   The biggest news isn't for the Mac.
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:51.340]   The biggest news is for Windows, it's the party.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.820]   What do you think of that?
[01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:56.060]   I've kind of got the scoop on that, talking to somebody,
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.220]   that the ultimate-- I kind of have the reason why they did it.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:09:59.720]   Good.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:00.300]   We want to know.
[01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.300]   Why?
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.660]   Add money.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.460]   They get money from--
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.300]   Apple gets money from Google for every search that goes through--
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.620]   It's a profit thing.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:13.300]   And it's so much money that--
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:21.580]   Figure what's the-- if they've got five million users now
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:24.740]   or 5% of the market now, they're going to at least go to 10%.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:25.580]   I mean, at least--
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:25.940]   Right.
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.420]   And it's like, apparently--
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.260]   Oh, it makes a lot of sense.
[01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:30.500]   It makes Mozilla Foundation a ton of money.
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.060]   Right.
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:33.500]   That little Google search there.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.740]   So figure if they're making-- let's just say, 10, $20 million
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:41.340]   a year right now and add money, they're thinking that can go
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.620]   to 100 million a year.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.100]   Makes perfect sense.
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:45.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.780]   And then secondarily, all sorts of nice things
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:52.700]   fall out of it, where yes, if more websites ship with totally
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:56.100]   top-notch Safari support for Ajax apps on day one--
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.300]   That's good news, right.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.300]   That's good news for everybody.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.780]   I just would like to announce the new Twitter browser that
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:02.820]   will have a built-in Google search bar.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:05.100]   Everybody should be downloading that right now.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:05.980]   It might look familiar.
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:08.340]   It might look a little like Safari, but trust me,
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.300]   it's the Twitter browser.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.100]   I-- what I did-- Leo, I went ahead and downloaded that.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:15.660]   And I've made a links-compatible version of that.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:17.940]   It should be able to run on most text-based--
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.460]   Much faster that way.
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:20.620]   And by the way, more secure.
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.620]   I'm the top-notch service that allows people to just send me
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.820]   money in a box.
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:25.320]   Damn you.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:25.820]   Damn good.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.940]   No credit card fees.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:27.980]   No must, no fuss.
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:30.940]   Once again, you've topped us all.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.940]   It's all about the user experience for me.
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:34.100]   John, I'm sorry.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:35.380]   Where are you going to go tonight, John?
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:38.020]   You going to a party tonight?
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.500]   Yeah, I guess I'm going to go to the WebKit party.
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.660]   I mean, all of a sudden, that seems a lot more--
[01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:45.060]   I mean, that seemed like a good party to go to.
[01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.660]   WebKit's the place to be now, baby.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:49.940]   Yeah, it sounds like--
[01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:51.460]   You can drown your sorrows.
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:51.820]   WebKit's--
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.980]   Well, my big question at a technical,
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:12:00.020]   MIRD-WWC level is, how exactly are they doing this for Windows?
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.780]   Is it something that they're borrowing from iTunes,
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:04.980]   some sort of carbon-ish type framework,
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.620]   or is it some sort of--
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.340]   if it really is Safari on Windows,
[01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:12.260]   is it some sort of Coco for Windows thing?
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:15.140]   Well, as I understand, the WebKit
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.460]   is basically based on the K browser, right?
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:20.100]   Well, the WebKit, yeah, but what about the app itself?
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.820]   You'd have to write a UI on top of it.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.820]   I bet you Apple has some decent Windows developers.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.100]   How do they do iTunes?
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.180]   Is that on a native Windows app?
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:30.580]   Yeah, I mean, it's--
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:36.140]   but it's like a carbon-ish sort of C++ application.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:38.500]   Oh, there's kind of an interface level?
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.060]   Right.
[01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.060]   I mean, that's why iTunes is not--
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:43.500]   I mean, iTunes, the whole UI, is so custom anyway.
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:43.940]   Who knows?
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:44.900]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:46.780]   But it's technically, if you really
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.420]   want to pick the part and dissect it,
[01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:49.860]   it's a carbon application.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:50.820]   Right.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:53.580]   Well, I'm downloading Safari 3 right now for Windows,
[01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.820]   and I'll be using it full time, because I think Apple needs
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:57.260]   more of my money.
[01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:58.020]   Actually, it's not my money.
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.140]   It's Google's money.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:12:59.900]   Go ahead.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:00.300]   Use it.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.780]   Well, and the other thing they've done
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.060]   is they have made it an option that you can do a Yahoo
[01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.140]   search through--
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:05.780]   Sure.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:08.140]   I'm sure Yahoo pays affiliate fees, too.
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.540]   Well, I can only presume they added it,
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.380]   because they've got them bidding off each other.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.500]   I know it's Flock's default is Yahoo, so clearly.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.220]   Clearly, there is money to be made.
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:20.820]   John, we really thank you for calling in.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.540]   I know you'd probably like to get onto the developer tools
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.340]   state of the union.
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.540]   Yeah, I could do that.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:27.860]   We won't keep you.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:28.420]   All right.
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:28.940]   Thanks so much.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.980]   John Gruber is the creator, author of Daring Fireball,
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:34.100]   DaringFireball.net.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.620]   Great, great Apple blog.
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.500]   Everybody must read.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.180]   Thanks for talking to you.
[01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:40.180]   And we'll talk to you again soon.
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:41.740]   We'll get you on Mac break weekly soon.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:42.100]   Thanks.
[01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:42.660]   Thanks, John.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:43.180]   See you.
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.220]   Heck, we're going to wrap this up,
[01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.620]   unless anybody has anything else to say.
[01:13:45.620 --> 01:13:49.180]   I don't think we need to do our special picks,
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.460]   because I think in the interest of getting this thing out,
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:52.700]   it's already long enough.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.380]   I'd like to get it out the door so that people can get
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:56.900]   our thoughts on what happened today at WWDC.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.140]   Is that OK with you?
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:58.820]   Cool with me.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:13:59.580]   All right.
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:02.220]   We'll save our picks for next week.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.460]   I want to thank you, Andy and Akko, for joining us
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:08.220]   from the Dunscap Studio A.
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:11.700]   Always nice here at the top of the Smokehouse Ballroom.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.140]   Gets a little smoky, but boy, is that food good.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.580]   Great band, great band.
[01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.420]   Chicago Sun Times to read Andy's work,
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.180]   and of course, online at the colossal waste of bandwidth
[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.460]   at cwob.com.
[01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:24.380]   Scott Borne is doing the Apple phone show.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.660]   You must have one coming out this week
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:28.980]   to announce all of these new exciting developments.
[01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:30.660]   Yeah, we're going to be out there Thursday.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.180]   Andy's usually on the show with me,
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:35.060]   and we'll we'll we'll we'll jaw about this a little bit more.
[01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.140]   And one of the things we're going to talk about
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:39.500]   is the 6 p.m. release time.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.300]   That's that's one of the things we hit.
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.060]   We're going to I've already talked to Kevin Rose,
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:50.420]   and he is going to do a dignity from the Palo Alto Apple
[01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:51.620]   Store on June 29th.
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:52.940]   And they're we're going to wait in line.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:53.940]   I'm going to go down there.
[01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:58.260]   And we might do a little twit down there right before 6 p.m.
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.100]   So if anybody wants to join me down at the Palo Alto,
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:02.860]   or should we do our own at the Apple Store in San Francisco?
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:03.620]   Maybe that's--
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.700]   I vote San Francisco.
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.260]   It's local.
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:08.060]   Yeah, I don't know why they're doing it in Palo Alto.
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.420]   I just thought we could synergize on the vast twit audience,
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:13.060]   and he is going to have dancing girls, so.
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:14.900]   I can get his dancing girls.
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:15.420]   Oh.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:17.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:19.180]   OK, I think I'm going to call this show.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.740]   I can get his dancing girls, actually.
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:23.380]   Maybe Steve Jobs should have talked to you
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:26.340]   before he went on stage.
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:29.540]   That is applephoneshow.com.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:32.060]   And I will let you know about what we plan to do.
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:36.700]   But we will be somewhere at 6 p.m. on June 29th,
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:38.540]   probably streaming live via stick-
[01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:39.500]   As will we all.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:43.340]   God willing, I want to point out.
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.820]   I shouldn't-- I just had a peanut butter sandwich with bacon,
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:46.580]   so maybe maybe not me.
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.100]   Maybe not you.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:51.500]   Remember Elvis, with mayonnaise and banana on there,
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.300]   and that's a killer.
[01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.740]   Merlin Mann is a host of The Merlin Show at TheMerlinShow.com,
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.740]   and of course, 43 folders and a regular on many
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:03.340]   of these fine podcasts.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.660]   And I'm going to let you-- you're doing it.
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.500]   You want to plug your little thing you're doing?
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:08.180]   What is on me?
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:08.740]   What is on me?
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:09.220]   You focus.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.740]   You know, I should plug my little thing.
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.740]   Plug your little thing.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:15.940]   If you are attending.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.700]   My favorite money water song of all,
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.580]   plugging in my little thing.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.580]   I got to plug my little thing.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.100]   Uh-uh.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.100]   Hang on, just one second.
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:27.420]   Omni Focus is something he's working on.
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:31.140]   As an unpaid consultant, I might say, with the Omni Group.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:32.460]   I'm going to plug my little thing.
[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:35.460]   The thing I'm going to plug.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:37.340]   The thing.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:37.820]   Go on.
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:39.420]   Walk in.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:40.420]   For Apple Apple.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:47.740]   Well, you know, if you're at the WDC on a Wednesday night,
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:51.580]   you can see me demo Omni Focus at the Western Hotel.
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.060]   Damn.
[01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:56.660]   The plug my little thing's blues.
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:58.500]   Yes, anyway, I'm going to be at me.
[01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:00.460]   And let's see how it's going to be there.
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:04.620]   It's the Omni Group folks and Ethan from Kinklitz.
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.060]   And me.
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:07.060]   Yes.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:08.380]   Ethan's Koonover and me.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.700]   And we're going to just have a little kind of Birds of Feather
[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.140]   offsite hangout deal and talk about Omni Focus demo,
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:14.620]   the latest first.
[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.300]   He's Omni Focus based on Kinklitz.
[01:17:16.300 --> 01:17:17.260]   What is it?
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:19.420]   Ah, you know, this is a disclosure.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:21.260]   I work on this as a--
[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:21.780]   For free.
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:24.580]   I don't think you have to disclose it when you work for free.
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.140]   OK, fine.
[01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:25.980]   I don't disclose it.
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:26.980]   Maybe I don't work on this.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.420]   He's not getting any money from this guy.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:29.460]   So what the hell?
[01:17:29.460 --> 01:17:31.740]   I mean, if you're getting money, I want to know about it.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:34.460]   But if you're stupid enough to work for him for free,
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.060]   you really don't have to tell anybody.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.460]   If it's so adorable, we're pretending
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.700]   that we have ethical standards here.
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.220]   I love this.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:40.820]   We do.
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:42.940]   We do have ethical standards.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:43.420]   Exactly.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:44.020]   Keep saying that.
[01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:45.060]   That makes even better.
[01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:45.900]   We do.
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:53.340]   So Kinklitz says an Apple script for Omni--
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.300]   god, this is going to make the show drag longer.
[01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.260]   It's an Apple script for Omni Outliner
[01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.540]   that this guy Ethan developed that
[01:17:58.540 --> 01:18:00.700]   makes it easy to implement, make getting things done,
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.180]   like action management stuff.
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:02.740]   That's very cool.
[01:18:02.740 --> 01:18:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.220]   And it actually ended up-- well, let's be honest.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:08.340]   It ended up selling so many copies of Omni Outline.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:09.980]   I bought the Pro because you have to have the Pro.
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:10.740]   So I bought the Pro.
[01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:11.740]   I agree.
[01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.820]   Yeah, and so they were cool enough to say, hey, why don't you
[01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.140]   guys help us make this into a full on app.
[01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:18.620]   And so we've been working with them for the last few months
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:19.620]   on--
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.540]   as I said, I mostly sit in a lawn chair
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:23.300]   with the beer pointing and grunting.
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.220]   Well, come on.
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:27.700]   You're going to get a cut of sales or something.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:28.340]   I don't know.
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:28.900]   I don't know.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:29.400]   Come on.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.340]   They're going to give you stock.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.900]   They've got to help you somehow because--
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.300]   I mean, they paid my expenses for a trip there and stuff.
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:37.020]   But I mean, I'm not like--
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:39.860]   but anyhow, it's a really neat application.
[01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.180]   And you want to say how many focus
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:43.500]   you're either going to be really into it
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.660]   or really clueless.
[01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:46.340]   It's already got a huge kind of cold fall.
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:46.840]   Is it out?
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:47.580]   Or is it pretty?
[01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:48.940]   No, they're trying to throw rolling people
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:51.220]   into a sneaky peak beta a little at a time right now.
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:52.340]   But it's pretty mature.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:53.700]   It's looking good for--
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:54.540]   I can't wait to--
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:56.100]   So a lot of people haven't had a chance
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.140]   to see it really working in the wild.
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.060]   And given that it's in beta, there's
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:02.500]   new stuff rolling out every couple of days.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.340]   So it should be pretty fun.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.700]   And I'll be around throughout the week.
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:07.820]   I couldn't score a pass.
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:09.140]   So I'm not going to be at the actual show.
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.740]   But I might come to some of the parties.
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:10.940]   Cool.
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:11.740]   I'll be around.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:17.660]   That's 615 on Wednesday night at the Commonwealth room
[01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:18.860]   at the Weston Hotel.
[01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:21.340]   There's more information on 43folders.com.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.100]   Hey, before we wrap things up, a quick reminder
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:27.540]   that this show brought to you by as always audible.com.
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.500]   I have a great book for you this week.
[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:33.340]   Our Mac Break Weekly pick is a book
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:35.420]   I just finished that I love from Steven Levy, who
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:38.420]   is one of the best computer writers out there.
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.700]   He wrote the original hackers, the history of hacking.
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.140]   The MIT hackers.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:45.540]   His most recent book, I think it's his most recent,
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.500]   is called The Perfect Thing.
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.420]   I've talked about it on the show a couple of times.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:52.700]   It's a kind of a story of the iPod inside and out.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:53.740]   It's cultural significance.
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:55.260]   How it was designed.
[01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:57.260]   And a whole lot more.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.180]   It's an excellent book.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.460]   And it's just one of thousands of books
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:04.180]   you can get for free from audible.com when
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:10.340]   you use our special website, audible.com/macbreakweekly.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:11.540]   Lots of great books there.
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.500]   I don't know if you've listened to books before, audible books
[01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:20.580]   before, but it is a fantastic way to supplement your podcasts.
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.220]   These books are entertaining.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:23.980]   They're well read.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:27.980]   They're just-- I mean, I've been a member for years.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:30.500]   And I tell everybody I know about audible.
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:32.380]   Our Book of the Week, again, The Perfect Thing,
[01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:36.260]   How the iPod Shuffle-- actually, how the iPod Shuffles,
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:38.940]   Commerce, Culture, and Coolness by Steven Levy,
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.260]   read by Anthony Rapp.
[01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:47.420]   It's available for free if you go to audible.com/macbreakweekly.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:50.060]   And make sure you take a look at audible while you're there,
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.620]   because there's some great features.
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.420]   My next listen, which I use all the time,
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:55.860]   whenever I see here about a book like this that I want to read.
[01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:57.780]   I just add it to my next listen list.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:01.100]   And I get it automatically when the new month comes.
[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:05.420]   They've got subscriptions that allow you to affordably get
[01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.300]   a number of books a month.
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:08.660]   There's a whole lot more.
[01:21:08.660 --> 01:21:11.820]   And we'll be giving you some great tips, some great books
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.980]   from Audible as the weeks go by.
[01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:16.180]   Audible.com/macbreakweekly.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:18.300]   We thank them for their support.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.580]   So I want to encourage you all to come up
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.620]   with a Book of the Week, because we're
[01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:23.060]   going to do a Book of the Week every week.
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:28.500]   And whoever gets the best book wins a big prize.
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.540]   And the blues-- and the blues guitars, the islands.
[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.300]   I did the Holy Bible.
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:34.540]   I went.
[01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:35.620]   But do they have God reading it?
[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.500]   That's the question.
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:40.100]   Adrian Zamed from Hooker.
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.260]   It's Trump and Heston.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:44.220]   And the beginning, God created the heavens in the end.
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:45.060]   All right.
[01:21:45.060 --> 01:21:47.540]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:21:47.540 --> 01:21:50.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:53.700]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.280]   (upbeat music)
