[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   A special, a very special MacBreak Weekly,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   mostly because we don't have any hosts except me and Alex.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   We'd like to call it the one-on-one.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Alex Lindsey is here from the Pixel Corp, Pixelcore.com,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   the great guild of multimedia artists,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   learning and working in the biz,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   also Pixelcore.tv for the podcast.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Andy is in transit.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   He's in Wisconsin.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Merlin is on deadline.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   So it's just you and me, but we're going to take calls.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Sounds great to me.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So I'm opening up the "Twalk In Line" and as soon as the "Twalk In" is...
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   As soon as I can pick itself up...
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Well, I made a mistake.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Pre-show, I announced it, and now I can't get through.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   So...
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   But we do have some stories, some big stories that we might want to talk about a little bit, Alex,
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   starting with a massive lawsuit that broke this morning.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Apple suing HTC, basically asserting patent infringement
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   on both the Windows Mobile and the Android HTC handsets
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and presumably asking HTC to stop selling them.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   They say that the HTC VioLite says many 20 patents
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   that Apple has in the iPhone interface and hardware architecture.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   They've also filed a parallel complaint with the International Trade Commission
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   to block importation of these devices.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We saw this before.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Nokia and Apple did this whole thing.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Well, but I will admit that Apple said very clearly when they launched the iPhone,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   they were going to vigorously...
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   They had a whole bunch of patents that they were going to vigorously use.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Let me read you.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I admit, when I saw the HTC come out,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   when they were showing what it was doing, I was kind of surprised.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I was like, "I wonder when they're going to get the..."
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Really?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   With the multi-touch?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah, the multi-touch and all the stuff that feels like an iPhone.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I mean, Apple...
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Let me tell you what the patents that they're selling...
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I don't know what Apple can do it, but I can...
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   First Steve Jobs says, "We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   or we can do something about it.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   We have decided to do something about it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   This is Steve Jobs in a written statement.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steel bars."
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Patents include these 10 time-based, non-constant translation of user interface objects between states.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I don't know what that is.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   "Touchscreen device method and graphical user interface for determining commands
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   by applying heuristics.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Unlocking a device by performing gestures on an unlocked image."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It's funny because the iPhone doesn't use that, but the Android does.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Apparently, Apple still patented that thing where you draw a gesture instead of
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   entering a number as you do on the iPhone.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   "System and method for managing power conditions within a digital camera device."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Remember Apple had the QuickCam?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   They were one of the first early digital cameras.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Maybe this was from there.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Automated response to...
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So that would be long.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I mean, not long gone, but mostly gone.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Automated response to and sensing of user activity in portable devices.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That might be like putting it to your ear, you know, the accelerometer stuff.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   "GMSK signal processors for improved communications capacity and quality."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   These are all patents that Apple asserts are being violated by HTC.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   "Conserving power by reducing voltage supply to instruction processing portion
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   of a processor."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I mean, like Intel SpeedStep, yeah.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Object-oriented graphics system.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Apple must have patented that a while ago.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Object-oriented event notification system with listener registration of both
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   interests and methods.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   R's Technica has a list of all these with links back to the actual patent.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   If you're so interested that you want to see it.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I have to think that this comes on the heels of Google putting multi-touch back
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   into the Nexus One.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Remember, it didn't come with multi-touch.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   They decided not to go too close, and they got a little too close.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Right.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Well, you know, the rumor was, I don't know how true this was, that Google, because of
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   its close ties to Apple, decided not to do this.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Or maybe because they were worried about a lawsuit, I don't know, but decided not to put
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   multi-touch in the Nexus One in the States.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   They put it in Europe, in the States, and because of the Apple patents.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But then when Google and Apple got in that little shoot-in-war, you know, when
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Steve said that do-no-evil thing is BS, things like that, when they blocked Google
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Voice in the App Store on and on and on, I guess Google upgraded the Nexus One,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   2.12, update one, and added multi-touch.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   So maybe I don't see multi-touch in this patent.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I do say, I will say that this is a, well, it is incredibly well timed from Apple's
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   point of view from a cynical sort of way, which is that you wouldn't want to shut
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   production down at the beginning, you wouldn't want to shut it down when the hook
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   was all the way in.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   You know, and this is about as painful, I mean, this would devastate the market.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I mean, it would allow Apple to pull far enough away that no one would catch up and
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   be like iTunes.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You know, if they're able to actually, if it's out of action.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   If they're actually able to do it.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And there's a risk and this was the story that Google's rumor was Apple asked them not
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   to because they knew it was shaky and they were worried about a court challenge.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   They knew if they put multi-touch in, Apple would have to go to court, but Apple might
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   be a little afraid, especially if this multi-touch patent, which clearly has prior art.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I mean, there's a ton of prior art on it.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Multi-touch, the patent would fall and it would be, wouldn't it be worse for Apple if the
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   patent falls?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I mean, everyone, when you look at the HTC, everyone's obviously ignoring most of those
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   patents anyway.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   One of the things is that I think that Apple has nothing at this point.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   There was enough of them, enough lines were crossed.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   One or two by themselves, maybe not, but enough lines were crossed that Apple doesn't
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   have anything to lose at this point.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   They might as well just go for it.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Twenty, they're certain 20 patent violations.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And remember, only one or two of them would be enough.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   The thing is, is they're firing all of them.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   All in one.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And the ITC will say you can't import the thing because, in fact, they may be able to get a
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   temporary restraining order now.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Right.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   If a judge says there's enough merit in it, they could.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I wonder if the judge has to recuse themselves if they have a, I've found a lot of phone.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Or an Android phone or a Windows mobile phone.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   That kind of means that the only judge can rule on this is somebody who's using a flip
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   phone and has no idea what they're talking about.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Right.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   So it's, it'll be interesting.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   You know, I think that they, you know, Apple lives on their, on their patents.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And so I mean, you know, that's, I mean, and they don't live on them by enforcing patent.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   They live on by actually creating stuff with those.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   They're like IBM.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.160]   IBM, IBM has, has, has, hasn't been a dominant force in computing in years, but is still
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.400]   very profitable because they open a ton of patents.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.400]   Billions on their patents.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.200]   And, and that was a big thing for them was R and D that, that was an intentional business
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   strategy.
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.200]   So we'll see it's going to be.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.000]   We're, we're going to open the lines in a little bit.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I'm, I'm continuing to call talk.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.880]   And as soon as we get in on talking, we're going to start taking questions for Alex Lindsey
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.120]   and myself.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.600]   We'll give out the talking number.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.520]   Well, actually, I'm not going to give it out until I get in.
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.520]   And then I'll give it out.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   Having learned my lesson.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.560]   Meanwhile though, we're going to continue with the news in just a bit, but first a word from
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.200]   our friends at Citrix, the makers of GoToMeeting now on the Mac.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.000]   We did kind of avoid talking about this product on Mac break weekly because even though it's
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.320]   such a useful product, because we wanted to make sure it was a Mac-ish product and it
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.920]   is, it is.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.600]   Go to GoTo, you can try it right now free.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.640]   No, you just go to go to meaning.com/macbreak.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:34.400]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak and you'll install it now anytime somebody wants to have a conference
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:43.600]   call with you or wants to participate with you in training or, or collaborate on a document.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   I'm working on my night speech.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.360]   This would be a great way to rehearse the speech with somebody else.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   You just say, "Okay, fine.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.520]   Go to GoToMeeting.com.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.760]   Click to join a meeting.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.760]   Here's the ID."
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   And boom.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.560]   You can have your screen on their desktop real time.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.800]   So you can have meetings right from your computer as if you were in the room with the people
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.160]   you're meeting with that saves you time.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   It saves you money.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.160]   You get more done.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.160]   I use it all the time.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.480]   For sales presentations, for product demos, training sessions, collaborating.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.080]   $49 means as many meetings as you want as long as you want.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.240]   There's never a clock ticking.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.080]   And by the way, that also includes phone and voice over IP conferencing.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.080]   Free.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   This is really the future.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080]   Oh, it's so great.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.080]   We had nobody wants to travel.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.920]   We're doing more and more and more online meetings.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.200]   So it's not even just the travel.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.120]   It's being able to get a whole slew of people that could never take two days out.
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.120]   You have a one hour meeting.
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.880]   You don't have to ever go and show up in the same place.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   You just can't.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.880]   They're all over the world.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.400]   I mean, we're in global production market now.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.760]   GoToMeeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.760]   Join right now.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.760]   Would you get a free copy?
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:46.360]   And I think you're going to see why we say this is such a great tool.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360]   It's funny.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.160]   When we started the show, I forgot that Andy wasn't going to be here.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.160]   He's on a plane.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.880]   So I called him like 100 times.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.200]   And now I'm trying to call talking like 100 times and I can't get through to them.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   It's just one of those days.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.560]   It's just me and Alex.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.560]   That's OK.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:05.960]   Condi Nast confirms at least five magazine titles are iPad bound.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.880]   iPad and bound.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   Oh, and Nolan.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.880]   He's not a song?
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.960]   No, that's something.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.040]   This is from the New York Times.
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.040]   Wired.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.040]   Doi.
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.040]   GQ.
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.160]   There is an iPhone app already.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.520]   So that's no brainer.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.520]   Vanity Fair.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.520]   I like that.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.200]   That's a very visual picture focused magazine.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.560]   So that would be a logical one for the iPad.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   New Yorker.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.560]   I'm really happy about that.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.560]   That'll be interesting.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.920]   I get the New Yorker on the Kindle, but you don't, you know, and you do get the cartoons,
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.800]   but it's just not the same.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.880]   One of my favorite magazines and of and here you go.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.360]   This is the magazine I read.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.320]   It's my I think it was my magazine.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320]   Glamour.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:44.720]   So it looks like they're kind of testing a whole bunch of different markets.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.960]   Let's let's stick out.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   Well, Wired makes sense.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   And you've seen that Wired video.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:49.960]   Did you see that?
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   I thought it was impressive.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:58.520]   I think that I was I was talking to someone in this business and they're really talking
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.520]   about how photographers, you know, they're telling a lot of their photographers, we're
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.080]   saying you way overseas, you know, you're going to need to come back with video.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.520]   You know, like, you know, we don't have the budget and all of these magazines because
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.960]   of the iPad, because of all the stuff are going to require video.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.960]   I mean, all these still what used to be still.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   It's good for you.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.960]   It's good for companies like Pixel Corp.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.960]   Yes.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   This is what you do.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.800]   This is what we've been working on for a long time.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.480]   So you always talked about also the notion that there would be embedded links to advertisers,
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.480]   content and stuff.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.960]   And now with we did early test Mac break, episode four had embedded links.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   I mean, you know, right.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   And screwed everybody up.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:34.960]   They couldn't figure it out.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   They couldn't figure it out.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   Like, why would you do this?
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.320]   You know, it was early days, but now, but that used quick timer flash.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.560]   That version for episode four from Mac break video used quick time.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.240]   We had a couple other versions that still do it with quick time or did they take that
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.240]   capability?
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   It won't work with the new leopard.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.320]   It's the snow leopard kind of quick time X destroys a lot of that.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:03.040]   And so the so but what we're looking at is the the the the the the the the you know, the
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.200]   silver lining there is that we really think that I overlay is the silver and silver lining
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   is silver line.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.400]   No, it's we are going to be we're excited about the iPad.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:21.440]   So we're going to be doing iPad development and also looking at both the LP and DVD extra
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.400]   stuff and how we can use that inside of Mac break to make stuff more accurate.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:30.880]   You know, I would I think that, you know, I've been saying for some time that I think
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:37.680]   the iPad has a natural market about 15 different niches and it's going to be a huge seller.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.200]   This is just kind of making it a little bit stronger.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.920]   Would you know, it really would be a killer app on this.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.360]   If National Geographic published on the iPhone, I mean, the iPad and not just the pictures,
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.520]   but did this did the video because they have a lot of video.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.720]   They shoot video as they shoot the stills.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.800]   Oh, it'd be there's so we wouldn't you wouldn't you love that?
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.720]   Well, this is the big opportunity that the iPad provides for all of these publishers
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.920]   is something that is truly better than the magazine, truly better than the online version,
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.920]   truly better.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.920]   You know, it's a mixture of both of those.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.280]   This is really the first true convergent device that makes it easy to mix all the stuff
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   up together.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.880]   What I'm hoping is is that we're going to see what Apple really needs to do is they need
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.600]   to make sure that the authoring of this is easy because right now it's not.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.680]   And I think that really, what do you use?
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:26.640]   Well, I mean, we it's just HTML and CSS.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.280]   So it would be a content management system could do this.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.280]   It is.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.400]   It's just that it, you know, the thing is is that they have tools.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.320]   They have, whether it's IDVD or DVD studio pro, they have interactive creation tools that
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.520]   are available, you know, tweaking that kind of stuff.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.720]   Something like Zenio, which is already out there.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   It's possible.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.360]   It's just that they have all these publishing tools, whether it's pages or whether it's
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   keynote.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   I mean, it'd be great if I could use keynote to just punch out.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.360]   Hork Express.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.920]   Little, yeah, but you know, yeah, well, you want something like that for, you know, that
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.480]   lets you embed all that stuff.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.480]   Let's anybody do that.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.040]   What is the huge explosion of the usage of the iPad?
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.480]   What is now the default app?
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.760]   It used to be a page maker and then went away from all this.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.520]   It's really, is it Quark still?
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.640]   No, no, Quark has fallen behind.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.960]   It's it's, um, in design.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.280]   InDesign is what everybody uses.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.120]   That's an Adobe product.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.400]   Yeah, which means.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   Well, I, this is a big, you know, I think Adobe's starting to get a little twitchy about
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:25.160]   this because I mean, it's, if they made an InDesign plugin for the iPad, but see, I bet
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   you they want.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.160]   See, they are, they are, they are.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.160]   They are, they are.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   It does stuff for, for Flash.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.400]   You know, this is a tit for tat.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.480]   You say, well, Apple, you think of all the publishers you get who are currently using InDesign
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.680]   if there's a one button published to iPad.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.680]   They won't do it.
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.680]   But in order to do that, you have to put the Flash on.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.680]   Apple's not going to do it.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.680]   They're dogmatic.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.840]   Well, they just don't, beyond the technical reasons of memory usage and stability and
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.920]   battery usage and everything else, Apple, I think Apple is, in Google is the same, which
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.040]   is they want to commoditize or control.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.680]   You know, I think we've talked about the before, but they, you know, it's, so they want it
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:02.720]   to be available to everyone or they, or they want to have control over it.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.040]   Apple tends to want to control more and Google wants to tend to commoditize.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.680]   So you know, the solution is, is you release Apple releases in InDesign?
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.560]   Well, they have pages.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.400]   Yeah, pages could easily be it.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.480]   Well, but pages doesn't have any tools that publishers want.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.840]   But they don't need, I don't think that, I don't think that they, here's the deal is,
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.440]   I think Apple's going down the same, the same route of their, the disk is dead.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.200]   I think Apple's going down, paper is dead.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   Right.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.280]   I don't think they're, they don't stop using InDesign because it doesn't matter.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.000]   Just, just, just do HTML.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.280]   But what Apple has to do is provide a valid solution to publish for the iPad easily.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.640]   How kind he asked, apparently.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.520]   Well, no, you can, you can muscle through it.
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.920]   But here's the thing is, is it's just that it's how quick would adoption be if it was,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.760]   you know, really, really easy to develop for the iPad.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.760]   Right.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.200]   It's just that the adoption is going to be slower.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.320]   You can muscle through anything.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   You can get it all done.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.240]   It just, it requires a lot more thinking than it should, than it should develop the content
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.440]   for this.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.960]   According to a foolish analyst, foolish, I really don't like to report the analysts because
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.040]   the analysts have no idea.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.040]   They get used for PR.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.400]   Well, it's their business.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.640]   Let's say something crazy.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.240]   They write, yeah, it's partly PR.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.480]   Partly they're always writing these reports for their clients and their clients, you know,
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.280]   pay good money to find out.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.280]   Right.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.120]   According to, I never even heard of this one.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:22.040]   Cana Cord, Adams, analyst Peter Mysek wrote a research note on Monday in which he said,
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.440]   "Apple's Taiwan-based supplier, Han Hai precision could be facing it, could be, even, even
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.080]   couched it, might be facing a production bottleneck or a shortage of components."
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.540]   He says, quote, "an unspecified production problem at the iPads manufacturer, Han Hai
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:42.200]   precision, will likely limit the launch region to the US and the number of units to
[00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.880]   roughly 300,000 in the month of March."
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.880]   Here comes the lines.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:50.920]   "Far lower than the company's initial estimate of 1 million units, the delay in production
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:56.640]   ramp will likely impact the April's April unit estimate of 800,000 as well."
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.240]   Apple still hasn't told us anything about a release date.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   They said a month, right?
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   Or 60 days after the release.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.000]   60 days, which would be March 27th.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Yes.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Or something like that.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Something like that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   26, 27, something like that.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.840]   Well, there's, okay, there's, there are only 28 days in February.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.400]   They announced this January 27th, so that's four plus 20 is 32.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.920]   So there's 20, it would be March 28th.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.920]   March 28th.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.400]   According to my careful calculations.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.960]   Math is hard.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.640]   Math is hard.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.440]   So they would be late after that.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.160]   I think it's, I think from Apple's PR perspective, having less than you expected is probably
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.160]   better.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160]   This is a big line.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:42.120]   We style shortages, even if you didn't have it, you almost would want to do it.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.120]   And then it also covers up if there is a shortfall in sales.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.000]   If you don't, for perhaps get those million sales in the first month, okay?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   You have big lines.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   You have big lines.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.960]   And you know, I'm, I'll be honest, people kept asking me, "Oh, you're going to do the
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.400]   28 hours of, or 24 hours of iPad like you did 24 hours of iPhone?"
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.320]   Well, there were legitimate, you know, lines for the iPhone, but then the third generation
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.480]   iPhone, they'll show up at nine o'clock at night and there was no line.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.120]   And you could order it and have it delivered that day.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.240]   We don't know yet, but I would, well, see, this is a question.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.160]   If Apple does that with the iPad, and there's no reason not to because you don't have to
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.160]   do in-store activation.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.160]   It's just a device.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.160]   Right.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.920]   Then I will get on apple.com.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.920]   I will order it.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.560]   I will get it day of, I won't wait in line.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.920]   So I thought, well, I'm not going to do any coverage.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.360]   But on the other hand, if there's a massive shortage, we were going to have to cover it.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.960]   And if there are people fighting them, we're going to have to film that.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.360]   We're going to have to cover it.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.800]   So I mean, there's the process right there.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.000]   I mean, why things get covered.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I think they're better off having shortage shortages from a PR perspective.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.560]   It bums me out because I know I just don't know if I'll be able to get one.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.600]   We're going to take questions, but I can't get into talking.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.240]   So we'll do IRC questions.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.240]   So if you're watching live, this is only good, obviously, in any event for somebody watching
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.240]   live.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.440]   Live.twit.tv is where you can watch.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.320]   Of course, you can listen to twit.am.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.560]   In the chatroom is IRC.twit.tv.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.800]   If you get in there, we will start taking questions in a little bit.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.240]   A couple more news stories before we do that.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.840]   This is a very special.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.520]   Let's talk about making lemonade out of lemon.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.560]   Very special issue of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:20.280]   It's just me and Alex because, well, I frankly, I didn't plan.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.000]   Those who fail to plan, you know what they do, Alex?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   They fail.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.160]   Well, that's kind of a shorter version of it.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.160]   It's not quite the ball, mow.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.640]   I was going for it.
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.160]   Did you see that AT&T expands their 3G microcell to...
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.440]   It's like North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina, San Diego and Las Vegas.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:44.040]   Not the places that we need it like New York and San Francisco.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.040]   Sorry.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.320]   I just kind of...
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.480]   They'll have it in Austin.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480]   Not that I'm bitter.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.520]   They'll have it in Austin.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.680]   Not that I'm bitter.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.480]   Where are they going to do it?
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.200]   Not San Francisco.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   That's what I read.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.200]   That's all you care about.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.320]   I looked at it and I was like, "Not San Francisco and not New York."
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.920]   Yeah, I just don't care after that.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.840]   You know, it was like San Francisco, New York and then there was like all the other cities
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.600]   that were not me.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.520]   And I don't mean that just by those are the cities that I'm in a lot.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.480]   It's that those are the ones where everything drops out.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:20.760]   I mean, when I'm in, I guess in Las Vegas they drop out a lot.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.560]   So I can see Las Vegas a little bit.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.440]   Vegas, actually, as I remember from CES was really bad.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.520]   Yeah, it was really a spring test.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.520]   Yeah, it was a spring test.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.040]   But see, where I would be doing it, you know, South by Southwest is coming up in Austin
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.760]   in March 12th in Austin.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:36.760]   I'm going to be there.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:40.520]   We're going to be covering it live Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Thursday, Friday,
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:42.480]   Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.120]   That traditionally, in fact, last year was a disaster for AT&T because every single one
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.720]   of those geeks at the interactive festival has an iPhone.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.960]   So AT&T was scrambled, they brought in trucks with mini towers.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   Right.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.320]   I hope they're thinking ahead this time or maybe they're thinking, "Oh, well, that couldn't
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.320]   happen again."
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.320]   Right.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.160]   All that was just a once in a lifetime.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.600]   You could sell that truck, Joe.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.000]   We're never going to need that again.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.840]   Or are you going to have barbecue?
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   I'm looking for a--
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   I've been to county line.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   The original county line?
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.840]   Yeah, you know, we--
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   Up on the hill.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.840]   Be caves?
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.840]   No, I was up on the hill.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.840]   Must be the new one.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.840]   It's kind of on the hill.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.840]   But the original county.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.040]   So we did the screen savers from Austin about eight years ago.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.120]   And the county line invited us.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.920]   And we-- the entire-- it was like 30 people.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.920]   And they sat us at a long table.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.360]   This was-- they spiffed us.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.360]   It was very nice.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.600]   They sat us at a long table.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:38.240]   And they just brought brisket and chicken and all the-- and pulled pork.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.240]   And we chowed down.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.600]   And you couldn't move.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.600]   And then they said, "Okay, that's the first course."
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.600]   And they brought more!
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.600]   And you just--
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.600]   They kept bringing more.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   They kept bringing more.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.760]   I've never-- it was so incredible.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.600]   I used to wait tables at the county line.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.600]   Did you?
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   Not in Austin.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.600]   It was used to-- it was one in Colorado.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:55.600]   So I-- so I know like all the--
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.600]   So good.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.600]   I knew all the secrets and all the things to order.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.600]   And then-- oh.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.080]   Well, they just-- we didn't-- there was no menu.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.600]   They just brought stuff.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.600]   Everything.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.600]   Brisket, chicken.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.600]   No, the brisket is so good.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.600]   Beef, pork.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.600]   Get the good bread.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   That's all I got to say.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.600]   If you're down there and count line--
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.600]   Just bad bread?
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   Yeah, you can get the free bread.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   Oh, you know what they do?
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:12.600]   They give you a white bread.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.600]   Like, Wonder Bread.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   Like, they do this--
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   They do this here in Oakland.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   Kind of a rough neighborhood called Flint's.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.520]   And it's-- they're behind bars.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.360]   So you come and say, please, sir, could I have some barbecue?
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.240]   What do you want?
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.120]   And then they slide it through the bars
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.720]   after you slide your money through.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.960]   And there's a-- it's pile of barbecue with a piece
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.400]   of Wonder Bread slapped right on the top of it.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.240]   That's the bread.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.720]   So I'm taking-- that's not the good bread.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.200]   Well, they have a little loaf that you get for free.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.600]   And if you pay for it, you get the best bread you've ever had.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.920]   That's all I got to say.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.560]   I'm going.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.000]   But before we go any farther with that, let us
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.480]   say do a little commercial here for goodfriends@audible.com.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.360]   You know about Audible.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.400]   I tell you about it enough.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.360]   I would think I wouldn't even have to do a commercial.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.560]   You just could go out and get Audible.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.640]   But goodness knows, there's probably somebody out there,
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.160]   someone in this great wide world of ours
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   who doesn't know about Audible.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.000]   I heard that people read books.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.520]   Is that true?
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.520]   Yeah, I tried that once.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.360]   My eyes got tired.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.440]   Do your ears ever get tired?
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.200]   I don't think so.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:12.600]   Not really.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.480]   Your eyes get tired.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.880]   But your ears, no, they could listen all day.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.600]   Well, the thing is, I get through so much more of it
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.400]   because the problem with reading for me is unitasking.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   I don't want a unit to ask.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.040]   I want a garden.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.160]   I want to run on the treadmill.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:24.840]   I want to drive.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.880]   I want to do other stuff.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.440]   And read.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.320]   You can always tell when I'm listening to a lot of Audible
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.320]   because my house is very clean.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.480]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.000]   Look, if you're looking for a kind of an excuse
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.080]   to drive carpool or clean more often
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.160]   or spend more time in the gym, which
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.760]   is how I use it, Audible is a great way to do that
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:44.640]   because you want to.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.440]   You actually want to listen to your Audible books.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:52.040]   Go to audible.com/macbreak right now.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.360]   And you can just kind of take a look
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.920]   at some of the things they have on the Audible site.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.480]   There's 70,000 books, just a ton of them.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.960]   You know, there's a genre that has become very popular
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.680]   at Audible, which is merging classic fiction with horror
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.040]   fiction.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.880]   So you know, pride and prejudice and zombies.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.480]   You've seen that.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.480]   There's a new one in that.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.840]   Seth Graham Smith has done a new one in that genre.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.160]   It's Abraham Lincoln, vampire hunter.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.080]   This would be fun.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.160]   Indiana, 1818.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.360]   Moonlight Falls, the dense woods that
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.920]   surround the one room cabin, where
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.680]   a nine-year-old Abraham Lincoln kneels
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.440]   at his suffering mother's bedside.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.840]   She's been stricken with something
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.480]   the old timers call milk sickness.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.320]   My baby boy.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.280]   She whispers before dying.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.000]   Only later will the grieving abler
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.480]   and that his mother's fatal affliction
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.040]   was actually the work of a vampire.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.520]   When truth becomes known to young Lincoln,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.840]   he writes it as journal henceforth,
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.360]   my life shall be one of rigorous study and devotion.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.560]   I shall become a master of mind and body.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:59.720]   And this mastery shall have but one purpose.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.800]   He sets out on a path of vengeance
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.400]   that will lead him all the way to the White House.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.080]   Abe Lincoln, vampire hunter, you got it.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.960]   Oh, this is going to be great.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.160]   I never thought of it.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.200]   I never thought of it.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.240]   You guys never thought I would ever
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.280]   think of that.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.280]   I never thought that anyone ever think of that.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.400]   Oh, I love this.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.160]   This is so awesome.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.280]   You got to go to audible.com/macbreak.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.360]   Sign up for your first book.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.480]   I mean, really, these are fun.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.560]   It is-- we can listen a little bit of it, I guess.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.760]   Let me see here.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.880]   I know I got it.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.840]   I got the thought.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.840]   I got the thought.
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.200]   The author's penmanship evolved from the overcautious script
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.080]   of a child to the tightly packed scribbling of a young man.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.400]   I finished reading the last page,
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.120]   looked over my shoulder to make sure I was still alone,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.640]   and turned back to the first.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.280]   You know, in a horror book, whenever they look over their shoulder
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.400]   to make sure they're still alone.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.440]   That's when you have the music.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.040]   [HUMMING]

[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.040]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.200]   Play is, of course, in the iPod, the iPhone.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.800]   The will play on the iPad, I checked.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   It's part of the iPad specs.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.000]   But also on a ton of other devices, including GPS's,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.520]   Kindle's, Zunes.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.480]   I think you're going to love it.

[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.040]   We thank them for their support of MacBrick Weekly.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.840]   Let me look quickly and see if there's--
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:15.040]   I mean, this isn't traditionally not a huge news.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.960]   I did figure out what Steve Jobs should do with--
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.040]   you know what $40 billion in cash would get you?
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.160]   Is that how much they have in cash?
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.040]   $40 billion.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.600]   That's amazing.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:21.840]   Billion.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.280]   And Steve said he must--
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.960]   Are they going to Apple must think big?
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.520]   So they're going to do some acquisitions.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.200]   He said that they need to think about buying B-Bolt.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.880]   I have a Bolt suggestion for B-Bolt.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.040]   By my calculations, they have just about enough money
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.880]   to give an iPhone to every man, woman, and child
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.680]   in the United States.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.240]   Really?
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.040]   $40 billion?
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.000]   They're pretty close.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.920]   What would be the percentage in that?
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.800]   Well, just think of an entire consumer
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   market full of iPhone users.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.680]   They would make the money back in quantity.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.480]   That's turning their business model upside down, right?
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.040]   Their model is--
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.320]   at least in the iTunes store.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.240]   We don't make money on the music, but it sells iPods.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.600]   I presume that's true of the App Store.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:04.880]   They're making 30% on the apps, and there's nothing to download.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.480]   They're making a lot of money on the apps.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.520]   More than music.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.320]   Oh, I think so.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.200]   I think their profits are better on the apps than the music.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.240]   Why would it be?
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.920]   Well, because it's a tiny little app.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.480]   And they're--
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.720]   I think App Store is big as music, aren't they?
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.200]   Some songs.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.080]   Most of them are small.
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:18.800]   Most of the apps.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.640]   I mean, there's some big apps, but also there's apps that cost--
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.320]   you know, the price of apps--
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:24.800]   The price of apps--
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.160]   --is the price of apps as well, yeah.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.200]   Apps are creeping up.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.560]   You know, they used to be 99 cents.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.280]   Now, a lot of the ones you're buying are $199, $299, $299.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.000]   I noticed that.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.160]   Inflation.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.720]   It's gone from 99 cents to $199 or $299.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.000]   What is this world coming to?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.080]   It's the cost of living increase.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.000]   Well, people are figuring out that if you make a good application,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.040]   then it's worth the buck.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.400]   Come on.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.160]   Even a buck 99 is cheap, right?
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.440]   Or $299.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.320]   Now, once it goes over $299, I go, well, am I really
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.080]   going to use this?
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.480]   But I have to admit that anything--
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.120]   what?
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.080]   $99.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.040]   If I download it and it doesn't work at all, I kind of go, eh,
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.360]   I probably should have read the--
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.960]   if someone says it's good or it's on a list, the 99 cents,
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.200]   I'll just be like, eh.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.040]   But at $199, I start thinking about $299.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.720]   I really start going, OK, am I really going to use this?
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.360]   You know what they do on Android, which is really--
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:18.800]   I would love to see them do this on the iPhone.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.880]   When you buy an application on Android,
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.720]   it uses Google Checkout most of the time.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.080]   I mean, you just have to, but it uses--
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.680]   if you do go through the marketplace.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.760]   If you uninstall that application,
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.160]   I think-- I don't know how long you have a week.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   I don't know, three days, whatever.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.360]   If you uninstall it, it automatically credits you
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:35.920]   with a refund.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.600]   That's great.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.400]   So basically, they have a system to try before you buy any--
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.360]   I have.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.000]   If they did that with the iPhone, I would go crazy.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.520]   It seems like a really--
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:47.200]   this is why competition is good.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.960]   This is why I'm not crazy about these lawsuits,
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.360]   because at least as a consumer, you
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.440]   don't want Apple to suck the oxygen out of all
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.080]   these other guys.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.480]   You want these other guys to do well.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.600]   And because they innovate their way into new ideas,
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.840]   they put pressure on Apple to improve.
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.360]   Right.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.160]   Well, anyway.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.200]   Well, it went a lot faster.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.280]   I mean, I think there were seen better results
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.160]   since Apple's gotten more serious competition.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.800]   It's been four months since the 27-inch iMac was released.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.520]   I bought one and have been very happy with it,
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.640]   but so many people who reported yellowing screens,
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.840]   flickering.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.720]   So here's the good news.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.000]   Apple has addressed the issue.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   There's the official statement.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.560]   Quote, "We've addressed the issues that caught--
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.920]   they admitted it, which they hadn't done.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.160]   They finally admitted it.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.840]   We addressed the issues that caused--
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.520]   They probably talk about it until they figure out
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.720]   how they're going to get out of it.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.040]   And they say contact Apple care.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.280]   You don't have to have Apple care.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.720]   But if you have a 27-inch that is flickering or yellow,
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   this is the first time Apple's admitted it.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.440]   And presumably-- although I'll be interested to hear
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.360]   from people who have this problem--
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:57.240]   they've agreed to just replace it.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.960]   There is a catch.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.400]   Since the production halt, a few weeks back,
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.080]   Apple's forums seem a little quieter regarding yellow screens.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.400]   And flickering has already been solved by a firmware update.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.680]   Still-- and this is according to Gizmodo--
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:18.520]   that a number of people--
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.160]   they say 20 have written us since the production restart.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.440]   Some are now on their third plus iMac.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.440]   Wow.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.080]   Everybody that I've talked to that's got a 27-inch has been--
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.240]   I'm thrilled I haven't had one problem.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:36.000]   But that-- and EKizmodo even points us out.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.080]   Maybe it's 1/10th to 1% that have a problem.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.680]   But if you said sell millions of things,
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.040]   you're going to have thousands of problems.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.960]   There's a much people that are going to be mad.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.280]   And they're really mad.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.680]   So here's the question.
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:50.480]   Is it finally safe to buy an iMac?
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.760]   They link in here to t-a-p-p-l-o-x.com.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.720]   It's a website with a-- but basically, what is a test?
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.480]   It's a grayscale test.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.960]   And you should look at that at taplocks.com.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.000]   And if it's yellow in any way, it should just be plain gray, right?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.880]   This is-- send it back.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:13.320]   That's-- then you-- so you need to look at something
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.480]   that's going to tell you whether you got a problem.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.080]   And you want to do that early on.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   So--
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.680]   I think statistically you're OK to buy an iMac.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   I think--
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.960]   You're talking about-- I think it's less than 1%.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:30.160]   So I mean, I'm not trying to fly a plane.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.920]   So 99% is probably reasonable.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.840]   I'll take it.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.480]   Gizmodo's conclusion-- yes, it's safe to buy an iMac.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   Do the test on receipt.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.560]   If any part of the screen doesn't match,
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:47.160]   you're liking-- you're not safe to buy a MacBook Pro,
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.920]   though, because Leo hasn't bought one yet.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.760]   I-- you know, this is-- I'm starting
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.640]   to feel pressure from people who are saying, Leo, you got to buy--
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.840]   We're never going to get our--
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.840]   We're never going to get our MacBooks.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.840]   --to see.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.840]   We're never going to get the new MacBooks until you buy one.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.000]   Leo, just take one for the gipper.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.160]   You know, I'm-- I shouldn't say this,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:07.720]   because this is just going to stimulate more of the fever.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.680]   This close-- I want a 13 and my 15, which is not that old,
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.440]   maybe a couple of years old.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.640]   But you know, laptops take a beating, especially.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.320]   I'm not that nice to them.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.080]   It's darn act funny.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.880]   Have you had this problem where--
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:23.080]   were you clicking on the--
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.520]   Yeah, your track thing.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.200]   But your palm is resting on the case,
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.640]   and it's like it's-- like by pressing on the case,
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.920]   you're still clicking.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.000]   I haven't had that problem.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.560]   And I'm getting weird-- it's like the track pad's going or--
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.480]   So you have the whole track pad, the singular track pad?
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.880]   So I'm having trouble with--
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.280]   I haven't had time to take mine in,
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.720]   is that if I click on the sides of the trackpad now,
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.000]   about half the time it doesn't respond.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.080]   Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:47.880]   It's starting to go.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.040]   And then the middle one-- I have to try--
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:49.560]   That's it.
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.760]   It's starting to go.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.720]   So I heard--
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.400]   The rumor I heard was is that literally only 40%
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.440]   of these track pads make it through production,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:32:59.920]   you know, like through Q&A.
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.320]   So they're just very complicated.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:01.840]   Wow.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.280]   And to do the trackpad and the button at the same time,
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.560]   turns out to be a big pain in the butt.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.880]   But you know, that's what Apple does,
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.080]   is make big things that are painted butt for them.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.120]   So I'm willing to take my losses and buy a 13-inch,
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.400]   but I just was hoping for the new one.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.720]   Apple has been granted patents for the Unibody MacBook
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.080]   design, yep.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.640]   Trio of patents awarded this week
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.200]   two entitled Portable Computer Show
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.080]   the Design of the MacBook Air, which is two years old.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.360]   Two years old.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.760]   And another one called Electronic Device
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.120]   applied to the big aluminum MacBook Pro.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.280]   They applied for those patents when those came out.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.440]   So that's-- I'm not surprised.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.960]   I think that's a nice--
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.240]   I think the air is a nice-- do you think they'll kill the air?
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.040]   I don't think so.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.040]   I think it solves a certain--
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:48.880]   Is it market for it?
[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:49.720]   There's a certain market.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.240]   I mean, people who have them that aren't doing,
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.360]   trying to do any kind of graphics or any kind of real
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.040]   publishing, if you're just doing Excel or pages and numbers
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.760]   and those type of thing, I think the people that I've
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.600]   talked to that have them like that are really happy.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.000]   People in our industry that need to put video and blog
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.280]   and everything else more powerful.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:08.120]   It's a bit more powerful.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.280]   It's kind of the netbook of Macs.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.000]   It really is.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   I went--
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:11.320]   It's expensive.
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.320]   It's the Mac version.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:14.280]   It's very expensive and very stily.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.200]   I snuck upstairs.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.560]   My daughter-- I got her one for a trip to her stay in Europe
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.000]   last year.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.720]   And now she has a regular MacBook from school.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.840]   So I snuck upstairs and I said, I mean, you don't want that
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.080]   air anymore, do you?
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.120]   She said, get away from me.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.200]   She apparently does.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.320]   Who knew?
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.200]   So I am stuck.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   I'm ready to buy the 13th.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:34.800]   When do you think?
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.200]   When do you think new unibodies?
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:42.040]   One day after you go and buy one.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.080]   I think what you need to do is you
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.000]   need to be seen at an Apple Store, at least carrying--
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.280]   Oh, I think they're secured a camera with you.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.200]   Correct it.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.200]   And if you're picking it up and walk towards them
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.960]   and then just simply quietly put it down
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.520]   when no one's looking and walk out,
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.160]   that might be enough to fake Apple out.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.760]   But I think we're going to see it this month.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.040]   I just don't know exactly when.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.200]   Usually Apple gets priority on a lot of these chips.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.040]   And so it's surprising they wouldn't take more advantage of it.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:08.760]   Oh well.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.360]   We'll wait.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.320]   We'll see.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.840]   Should we start taking questions from the--
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.760]   Let's take some questions.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.040]   I cannot-- let's chat people.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.480]   I've made a mistake of tweeting about Twachin
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.680]   before I was in, and I just cannot get in now.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.600]   I don't know if it's-- you know, it's the way I'm doing it
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.040]   probably.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.640]   But it says I'm in Twachin.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:32.200]   Now it's going too fast.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.680]   Oh, I am in Twachin.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.200]   Never mind.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.360]   Apparently I am in Twachin.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.520]   All this time.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.200]   Well, that's what they're telling me.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.040]   Let me go look.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.640]   I have two extra batteries and one of my batteries are your
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.600]   question.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.480]   Let me go check out the Twachin.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.120]   Oh yeah, there are all these people in there.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.360]   No, so if you're in the unibody, you can't really--
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.160]   I mean, here's the deal with the unibody.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.440]   So repeat the question.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.160]   So the question was, he's gone through two batteries
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.560]   or he has two batteries.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.600]   I didn't quite-- everything was moving too fast.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.080]   But--
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:01.880]   Just go by fast.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.600]   Well, especially if you write a really long one,
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.240]   it's hard for me to keep up with it.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:05.680]   OK, I have to--
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.400]   Here, I'll read it to you.
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.640]   --have a due in held up like they--
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.960]   Also, I've got-- is this from Scott TD?
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:12.680]   Is that the one?
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.560]   I've got what is now a more than three-year-old MacBook
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:15.800]   Pro.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.880]   I've gone through two extra batteries now and each one--
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.760]   this is the one--
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.280]   and each one of my batteries requires servicing
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.640]   according to Snow Leopard.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.080]   That's right, Snow Leopard now tells you how much charge
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:25.760]   and stuff.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.760]   Have the new internal batteries held up as they said they would
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:29.920]   with the newer unibody MacBook.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.000]   So they have taken out the removable batteries
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.400]   and put in putting in non-verbal batteries, which
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.840]   gives them more capacity.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.920]   So-- and presumably better battery life.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.960]   Mine have held up fine.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.440]   I mean, the thing that-- one of the things--
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.080]   and I haven't figured out exactly what you're
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.840]   supposed to do about this, but I was talking to somebody
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.280]   who deals a lot with these batteries.
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.720]   And evidently, if you leave your computer plugged in
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.280]   all the time, it had a tendency to kill the battery over time.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.560]   Like, it's just not supposed to do that.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:01.120]   And so what I used to do with my older batteries
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.320]   is I would have one battery that was the battery that I had
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.760]   in when it was sitting at the desk all the time.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.680]   And then I had travel batteries, which I barely ever use.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.160]   I only use them when I need them to keep them fresh.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.840]   I have to admit, now I travel with one of the hyper-mac
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.560]   batteries.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.640]   Yeah, you have that big extra--
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.360]   It's from a little--
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.080]   I never know exactly how long my Mac is going to last.
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.840]   Because the other thing I do is I've
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.280]   bought plugs for every place that I am.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.080]   There's one that's here in the studio, and that's yours.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.720]   But then in my office, I have one in the house,
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.320]   and in my other office.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.760]   And so my computer's kind of plugged in all the time,
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:32.920]   or I have a hyper-mac battery.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.360]   And I can't really say how long it lasts,
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.440]   because I just never really depend on the battery.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.720]   Geo-Mick is on a--
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.320]   talking.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.400]   Hello, Geo-Mick.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.400]   Did he-- are you there?
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.640]   See, they say I'm on it.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.240]   Geo-Mick, hello?
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.920]   Let me try somebody else before I decide.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.560]   Way FM Guy 45.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.280]   This is a little bit like chat roulette.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.560]   Hey, way-- are you there?
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:03.480]   Way FM guy 45?
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.080]   Hello.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:06.160]   Yes, it's working.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.640]   What's your first name and where are you calling from?
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:15.080]   This is Adam, and I'm calling from Murphy's Broad Tennessee.
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.080]   Hang on.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:30.080]   I just wanted to say that I love the--
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.680]   in the way that I've had.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.000]   I love the idea of the iPad.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.600]   And I'm very excited for the launch, too.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.000]   You're with me on that.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.720]   Pretty much, yeah.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.160]   Did you have a question of any kind,
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.840]   or do you just wanted to say that?
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:51.800]   I just wanted to say that.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.480]   Thank you, because I need some support,
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.120]   because I'm the only one-- I'm hanging out here,
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.040]   all alone, with my love of the iPad.
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.720]   I don't think anyone else is going to buy it.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:01.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:02.240]   What else Adam?
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.720]   What else Adam?
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.600]   I just wanted to say that about it.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.480]   Thank you, you all.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:12.240]   Great to talk to you, Adam, from Murphy's Broad.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:16.840]   Now we can get-- oh, look, it's just auto on muting.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.880]   Z Williamson, hello Z. What's your first name?
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.200]   Where are you calling from?
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.920]   Or whoever's there?
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:25.680]   I heard a voice.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.360]   Speak to me.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.040]   If you all speak at once, I'll tell you which one is talking.
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.280]   OK, it's a guy laughing.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   It's you.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.520]   You guy laughing, you.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.440]   It's Geo.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.240]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.920]   And this is GeoMink?
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.480]   It is.
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.000]   It is.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.760]   OK, so apparently whatever is going on with--
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.480]   talking is--
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.960]   There's some delight.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:55.400]   Yeah, talking's the head of your audio.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.400]   Aha.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.920]   I don't even know how you could get ahead of the audio.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.360]   What are they hearing?
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.640]   It is.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.960]   They're hearing what we're going to say.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:06.040]   My stream must have breaks on it.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.560]   Yeah, yeah, don't listen to the stream if you're on "Tawkin"
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:14.800]   because "Tawkin" is actually much more real time than the live.tawt.tv.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   So what's your first name and where are you calling from?
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.960]   George.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.800]   North Carolina.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.320]   Hi, George.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.040]   Welcome to the show.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.600]   What can we do for you?
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.320]   I really don't have any questions.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.160]   I'm just-- I admire your work.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.040]   Thank you.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.880]   Enjoy your show.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.640]   And I find it quite educational.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.520]   Well, it's always good to hear from a fan.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.160]   I appreciate your calling in.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:39.920]   Well, thank you.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.480]   And have a--
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.240]   How do you hang this thing up?
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.640]   I'll hang you up.
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.560]   Watch this.
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.440]   Click.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.120]   Thank you, George.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:49.680]   Appreciate it.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:50.600]   We're going to take more calls.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.200]   This is working.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:52.960]   We have "Tawkin."
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   We'll take more questions from the chat room, too.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.760]   It's amazing, the technology.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:00.480]   But if you are listening to the stream, that's fine.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.560]   But if you're on the "Tawkin" phone,
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.360]   I would recommend listening to the audio.
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.080]   You're getting full audio on "Tawkin."
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.840]   And that's going to be a different delay, usually less
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.560]   than what you hear on the live.taw.tv, or even
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.280]   on our "Tawt.am" stream.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.680]   Hey, let's take a quick break, though,
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.880]   and mention the folks at "Carminite."
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.480]   Yes, they've gone Mac.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.200]   "Carminite now is Mac and PC.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.560]   If you use a coupon code "Mac break,"
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.720]   you can try it out for yourself free.
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.520]   Just by going to "C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.com."
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.320]   Now, let me tell you what "Carminite" is.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.880]   "Carminite" is automatic off-site backup.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.600]   As soon as you install "Carminite," it immediately
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.360]   starts backing up your precious data,
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.240]   the photographs, the emails, financial records,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.600]   your personal stuff, to the "Carminite" cloud, using SSL,
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.800]   so it's safe and transit.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.480]   You can choose to use AES-256-bit encryption as well,
[00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.600]   meaning it's really-- it's double encrypted.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:56.640]   It's really private.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   It is unlimited backup of everything
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.720]   internal to your computer.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.360]   It doesn't include network drives or external drives.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.680]   Everything internal to your computer,
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:08.400]   unlimited for less than $5 a month, which is an amazing deal.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.120]   But you could try it free.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.080]   I don't want you to do that.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.440]   I want you to see how it works.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.280]   And I'll tell you why, because it does rely
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.400]   on your upstream connection.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.040]   So if you don't have broadband, for instance,
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:18.440]   this might not be a good choice for you.
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.120]   And if you have very slow broadband,
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.760]   you might find that it had a lot of data
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.720]   that it takes a long time.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.800]   So I want you to try it free first at carbonite.com,
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.400]   use the offer code MACBreak.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:31.320]   If after playing it with it for a while, you say, this is it.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.120]   And I know you will.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.400]   I mean, that's what I use.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.560]   Then you get two free months if you sign up.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.800]   And as I said, less than $5 a month to try it.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:44.040]   13% of hard drives crash in their first year.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.120]   That's not even the most of it.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:48.200]   You know, about 43% of people say they've lost files
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.360]   that they consider irreplaceable every year.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.080]   And the thing is--
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.000]   Usually you use your errors.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.120]   It's not just drive errors.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.160]   It's also just--
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.680]   Well, but it's also what happens if you have a fire,
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.200]   what happens if someone breaks in.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.280]   Having it only in your house is--
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:02.960]   Even if it's in two drives.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.400]   Even if you've got to get off site.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:05.520]   You've got to have it on a cloud.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.640]   You've got to get off site.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.080]   That's carbonite.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.160]   Now, there's others for the MAC.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.680]   You probably know some of the names.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.840]   Just I want you to do a test.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.360]   That's why we do the free test.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.640]   And restore some stuff from them and from carbonite.
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:18.240]   And you'll see why I use carbonite.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.760]   It is so much easier to restore.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.680]   There's an iPhone app, which means you can get your files
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.480]   anytime on the iPhone.
[00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.800]   You can log into Carbonite and get it on any other computer
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.280]   as well.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.720]   It is very easy to restore.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.760]   And that's got to be.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.560]   That's key.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:35.400]   Automatic, off site, secure, easy restore.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   It's backup done right.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.080]   Carbonite.com, using code MAC break to try it free.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.520]   No credit card needed even right now.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.400]   More questions.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.560]   Do you want to take some from the chat room real quickly?
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:47.400]   Sure.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.800]   Is there a way to implement QOS rules for the time capsule?
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.440]   He says it really bogges down his MAC break pro
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.400]   when he's using Final Cut.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:00.040]   Bobby is apparently storing data on the time capsule.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.840]   I wouldn't use Final Cut with a network drive, would you?
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:03.280]   No.
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.240]   Seems like a bad idea.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.120]   You can use it on--
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.840]   I mean, if the drive is designed for it,
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:08.320]   but not just an ethernet.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.440]   Well, we use it on a sand.
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:09.920]   Right.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:12.000]   $20,000.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.880]   Well, we have a Drobo elite that they--
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.800]   With the ice cousin.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.640]   With the ice cousin.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.120]   And that's probably faster than the five machines.
[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.640]   To use as a scratch disk.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.360]   We're recording right now.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.520]   We have-- this is just a G5, the quad G5
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.280]   that I had lying around.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.720]   That's recording on Final Cut Pro,
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:31.360]   not to its internal hard drive, but upstairs.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.280]   But it's fiber channel.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.120]   I mean, so it's high speed connection.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:37.240]   And these are high speed rated drives.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.320]   And it was $20,000.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.280]   But on time capsules, not going to ever give you
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.920]   the kind of performance you need, even on gig a bit easily.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.960]   You don't want to be working off of your time count.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.320]   Whatever you're backing up to, in general,
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.160]   you don't want to be working off of it,
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.840]   because you don't want to be hammering those disks all the time.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.240]   That's supposed to be your backup.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:55.120]   It's supposed to sit there and wait for you and put stuff on it.
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:55.760]   That's what it's intended.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.080]   You don't want to be going in and out, in and out.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.280]   It's just not built for that.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.600]   Question from Web7736.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:02.760]   He said, here's your choice.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:06.200]   Spend $600 on an iPad with no pressure sensitivity.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.120]   Or my modbook, he wants to draw on screen.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.760]   If you're going to use it like you would use a Cintiq.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:17.360]   If you want to use a tablet to draw, you should absolutely--
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.040]   I don't think, even though they showed off
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.440]   the drawing application and stuff, the iPad is not going
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.840]   to be as good a drawing situation.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.640]   Well, and really, if you're really drawing,
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.440]   I mean, the thing is--
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:26.760]   You need pressure.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.640]   You really want to watch.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.440]   You want a Cintiq.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:29.240]   You want a Cintiq.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.080]   Well, the modbook is kind of like that.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:31.680]   It has some of that.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.680]   It's a little course compared to a Cintiq.
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.440]   Yeah, when you're used to a Cintiq,
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.800]   you're going to find the modbook to be course.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.080]   Of course, the iPad, most likely,
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.360]   is going to be a lot coarser than the modbook.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.320]   And there's things you can't do.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.000]   Like, for instance, one of the things
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.920]   that we're trying to figure out is
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.600]   we're kind of following Twitt's leadership
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   in being able to figure out ways to stream live from an event.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.880]   And you really need a whole computer.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:57.200]   And having some kind of screen-based CPU
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.880]   that can run Skype and hook to your camera and everything else,
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.240]   maybe someday the iPad will do that.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:03.160]   But that's another reason they have the modbook.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.760]   This is where I think people are confused.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.640]   I hear this all the time.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.200]   Well, it doesn't have a camera, it doesn't have flash,
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.640]   it doesn't have multitasking.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.280]   You want a netbook, or you want a laptop, or you want--
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.600]   If you want a computer, get a computer.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.480]   The iPad is not a computer.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.280]   It's good for what it does.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:19.160]   It's an appliance.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.080]   Now, the question remains, will somebody
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.400]   spend $4.99 minimum for an appliance?
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.400]   I think they will, but we'll find out in a month.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:27.320]   During the event, my son sent me the--
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.840]   You know, it's only $4.99.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.720]   You know, it's so funny, because that price is so much lower
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.760]   than what we were all predicting, like almost by half.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.920]   And that's what the iPhone cost when it came out.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.240]   That's less.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.400]   That's what the iPod used to cut.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.760]   I mean, this is not an outrageous price for what you're getting.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.040]   Right.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.800]   And it's for a certain segment of the market.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:51.400]   I mean, a lot of people watching this show are much more sophisticated.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:51.920]   They want to know.
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.960]   And they want something more complicated.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.280]   But for a certain segment of the market, again, my parents,
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.040]   my parents in law, my kids to some degree,
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.480]   my kids are pretty sophisticated,
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.040]   but they don't need to do much more than what their iPhone does.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.200]   They just need to be bigger.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:05.960]   Look, just wait.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.760]   I will buy one.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.640]   The minute they come out--
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:09.320]   And I'll let you know.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.520]   Well, maybe you wouldn't trust me.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:11.360]   But what would you do?
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:12.400]   I'm going to get one too.
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.840]   I might get one or two, three, four.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:19.040]   I like the idea of watching videos on it.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.520]   I like the idea of being able to read magazines on it.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.280]   I like the idea of playing "Scrabble" on it.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.960]   I really think that I could get away.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.880]   A third of my day could be on an iPad.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:30.880]   You know, checking me.
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.440]   We'll see.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:31.800]   Watching stuff.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.560]   We just don't know.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.000]   We'll see.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.440]   And maybe the screen is not as easy to read as a Kindle.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:35.680]   I don't know.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:36.920]   I'm going to have to put a part of it.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.360]   I'm going to take it to dinner.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.360]   I'm going to get a what.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.040]   And I'm going to die.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.320]   And it's going to be my new girlfriend.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:41.820]   Hi.
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.080]   I love my pad.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.000]   How you doing?
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.360]   What about-- we didn't actually mention this in the news segment.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.640]   HDMI on the Mac mini's.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.000]   Now, didn't they announce that before?
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.120]   I don't think that they've had it out yet.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:53.120]   I think that they--
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.120]   The rumor keeps on occurring.
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.280]   Right now, it's still DisplayPort, I believe, in DVI.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.080]   And you can get DisplayPort to HDMI adapters.
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:01.600]   Can you or not?
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.400]   You can't.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.360]   It'd just be nicer if you didn't have to.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.680]   And those DisplayPort to HDMI and finally are not
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.000]   painfully expensive or--
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.680]   that's been one of those things that it was just a bit
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:15.160]   of a rigmarole at first to get them.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.680]   And now, just being able to plug it in,
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.840]   I mean, the reality is DisplayPort,
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.080]   I think Apple thought it was going to be revolutionizing
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:22.440]   something.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.640]   And they've taken a lot of chances.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:27.040]   They were first with USB, one of the first with USB,
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.800]   one of the first with FireWire.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.680]   And they went out with the DisplayPort.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.640]   And nobody followed.
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.560]   So I think that Apple--
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:36.400]   I think DisplayPort is a bit of a dud.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.640]   I think it saves Apple some issues
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.600]   related to some of the security stuff that's
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.000]   required at HDMI and also some of the licensing in HDMI.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.440]   I think that's the reason that Apple hasn't done it so far
[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.320]   is because you could put HDMI on there.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.440]   But if people see it, they're going
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:54.240]   to want to play protected content on it,
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.760]   which means you have to support HDCP.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.240]   And now, that's that bag of hurt that Steve Jobs was talking
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:48:59.560]   about not wanting to get into.
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:48:59.840]   Right.
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.320]   So I think the DisplayPort was Apple's way around it.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.280]   They may be capitulating to some degree with that.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.560]   And what it'll mean, though, is if you have a DisplayPort
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.760]   and an HDMI port, what you're looking at
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:13.440]   is being able to play possibly being able to play some content
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.880]   out of your DisplayPort and not out of your HDMI port.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.600]   Exactly.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.720]   I mean, that's the kind of odd situation you could end up in.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.440]   So this is, again, still a rumor.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.600]   It'd be awesome, though.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:26.400]   I mean, we plug into big monitors all the time,
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.120]   and we really wish we'd have HDMI.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.000]   It would make-- it would make-- as somebody's
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.720]   playing out in the chat room--
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.400]   the Mic 171.
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:38.240]   It would finally make the Mac Mini a reasonable home theater
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.280]   PC.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.440]   Because you've had to cluge it up, you know?
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.520]   In fact, I have a DVI to HDMI.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.880]   Actually, it takes the optical out,
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.520]   and the DVI puts it into HDMI.
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.520]   And it was expensive.
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:50.560]   It's a couple hundred bucks, I think.
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.760]   I probably geffen somebody like that.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.000]   Let's take more talking calls.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.760]   Bruce R. Wilkie Jr. Wow.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:02.440]   Hey, Bruce Leo.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.120]   Hey, Jim and Leo.
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:03.600]   Hey, Alex.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.100]   I'm great.
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.640]   Where you coming from, Bruce?
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.680]   I'm in Central Virginia.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.180]   Great.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.440]   What can we do for you today?
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.440]   Central Virginia.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.920]   I'm very good.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.640]   Well, I've got-- I just want to say I love your show.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.840]   You guys are great.
[00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:21.560]   You're doing great things for people in the internet world.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:25.720]   But really, what I wanted to say is, how are you dealing
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:29.560]   with the fact that Apple seems to be pushing people around a bit
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.200]   with these patents?
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.080]   Do you think the S and Steel probably step in and say
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.960]   something because the patents that they seem to be having
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:41.280]   and seem to be trying to enforce?
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.880]   If you ask me, are wage broad and wage-use specific
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:49.800]   in order to generate some sort of competition?
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.720]   Well, first of all, because there's a lawsuit,
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.200]   the FTC is not going to weigh in at this point.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.320]   The way they would weigh in is with a suit of their own.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.080]   And so they'll let the courts decide this
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.280]   because there's a lawsuit going on.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.480]   I don't think it's any competitive.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.360]   If you have a patent--
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:06.000]   You're right to--
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.840]   You have every right to enforce it.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.200]   I can't think of a case where a company has
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.440]   been declared a monopoly and then its patents have been taken away.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:16.280]   And we're not lawyers, we should.
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.080]   So also, I put in-- and I think Scott would point out--
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:20.840]   if Scott was here, Scott Barnard would point out
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.200]   that if you don't protect your patents, you'll lose them.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:27.000]   So if you've proven that you let people use--
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.120]   That's true of trademark.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.320]   I guess it would be true of mine.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.600]   So if you know that they're infringing on your patent
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:36.480]   and you don't do something about it, when it comes up again
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.720]   and you want to actually try to use that patent later,
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.480]   you can't-- they'll say, well, why didn't you do it here?
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.400]   So that's the other issue that Apple's in,
[00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.000]   is that if they have all these patents, they're bound.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.520]   If otherwise, why bother?
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.560]   And to be clear, I mean, a patent costs--
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.680]   I mean, I had to deal with this a little bit.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.880]   A patent costs-- good patents are going to cost you $40,000
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.520]   or $50,000 minimum.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.720]   Yeah, you spend a lot of money--
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:51:59.760]   It's not $100,000.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.200]   So Apple's sunk some millions and millions of dollars
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.520]   into these patents, and that's how they protect their place
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:07.440]   in the pile.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:10.000]   Persona Nongrata saying, go to modelprice.com.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:14.440]   They have a DVI plus SPIDIF digital coax optical
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.160]   tostling audio to HDMI converter.
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.120]   For get this, $41.41.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.080]   Yeah, it's gotten a lot cheaper since we got into it.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.400]   Yeah, I guess--
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.840]   Well, it was expensive when we started it.
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:24.920]   Because it was like one per--
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:26.200]   Yeah, it was very expensive.
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:26.800]   So this is good.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   So I mean, for 40 bucks, you can take--
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.040]   And we showed some on Macbreak Video.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.800]   I can't think of the name at the right of the top.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:33.840]   We cover some guys that are doing some great little
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:36.520]   converters that are like $20, $30, $60.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.800]   I mean, so check out Macbreak Video.
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:40.840]   I don't have it in front of me what it was,
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:41.840]   but I'm recovering in it.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.920]   It was-- they were great.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.880]   Well, or go to modelprice, and you can search for this in the--
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.400]   I mean, I don't know how good it is,
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.760]   but that's a good price.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.960]   Chad Florian is with us on Twaken.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:56.560]   Chad, welcome to-- let's see.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.360]   I have to press the button.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.840]   Welcome to Macbreak Weekly.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.440]   Hello, Chad.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.280]   Hey, Leo.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.080]   Where are you calling from today?
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.720]   I'm calling for Tampa, Florida.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.360]   Great to have you.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:09.360]   I'm loving taking calls.
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.200]   I think this is really fun.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.280]   We're going to do this early.
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:11.880]   Absolutely.
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.080]   Do you have a question, Chad?
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.160]   Yeah, I was curious.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:21.280]   I haven't heard anybody mention the Amazon Kindle app
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.400]   on the iPad, and if they're going to release an actual
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.720]   major resolution application, so you can have all your Kindle
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:31.680]   books and iPad books and everything.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.200]   It's an interesting question, because as you remember,
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.320]   Amazon bought Stanza, which is another very good reader we
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.920]   love on--
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.160]   and so they have the Kindle app,
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.920]   plus they have Stanza.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.120]   And now, Apple did remember tell Stanza, oh, you can't use
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.080]   the USB port anymore, but that turns out
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:53.520]   that was because it was kind of an unofficial method.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.240]   It wasn't approved in the SDK, so they were just enforcing
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:59.320]   SDK rules, not necessarily hitting on Stanza.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.320]   That's where I think the FTC gets involved.
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.880]   If Apple says, we're selling books,
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:06.800]   so you can't put a book reader.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:07.880]   Of course, they do this.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.400]   Now they say you can't allocate functionality.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.640]   And you only get in trouble if you become the biggest name
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:12.120]   in town.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.560]   So if you use your size, I think that Apple can get away
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.240]   with a lot when they're not--
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.400]   That's right.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.520]   It's once they get to 70%, 80%, 90% of the market,
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.760]   if they do, at the beginning, they can do anything they want.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.160]   I mean, not anything, but they can be--
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:27.400]   So Amazon really is the 800-pound gorilla,
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.560]   and has to be more careful at this point than--
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.120]   At the moment.
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.080]   Than Apple does.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.040]   But there's no--
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.080]   I think that Amazon can make a pretty good argument that they
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.640]   could pretty much do what they want.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.600]   The biggest problem that Amazon has is Apple,
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.640]   because Apple's saying, you guys can make a little bit more
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.600]   money if you want to go ahead and make more money.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.520]   And it has Amazon.
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:47.760]   And it will give you more money, a higher percentage--
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:48.160]   Right.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:49.240]   --of your books.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:52.280]   In Amazon-- I did a bunch of the calculations
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:53.960]   on the average book being sold.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:59.360]   And the $9.99-- it could be argued that at $9.99,
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.320]   that Amazon's impressing that the publishers are actually
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:03.840]   walking away with almost as much money.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.480]   When you look at the print prices and the prices of everything
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.600]   else going on, if Amazon gave them 70% or 80%--
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.120]   or 70% instead of 50% or whatever,
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.680]   they're actually walking away with--
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.680]   When you think about publishing prices and distribution,
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:19.400]   you know, I mean, like actually printing prices
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.720]   and distribution and everything else,
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.800]   it's not necessarily that much less.
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.080]   But I can definitely see at $15, which is what
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.240]   Apple's kind of offering them.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.400]   I'd still do it.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.680]   Still have the cover price.
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.440]   Cop Mike is pointing out in our chat room
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:39.160]   that the Kindle app on the iPhone does not allow in app
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.760]   purchasing.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.080]   So Apple would still have an advantage there
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:44.200]   with the iBook store.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:48.080]   If Amazon didn't provide that functionality, the problem--
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.360]   Well, but then would they be allowed to?
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.920]   Here's the problem is that I think that the biggest
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.240]   problem that's going to, I think, run up for Amazon
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:58.120]   if they don't deal with it sooner than later is that a Kindle
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.520]   is a poor version of a book.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.800]   I mean, it's convenient, but it's not as good.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.040]   An iPad version will quickly become better than the book.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:06.840]   It will be in color.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.040]   For a lot of it will be in color.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.400]   This is the debate, though, is the interactivity and video
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.240]   and all kinds of other stuff.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.400]   It's going to be a different kind of book.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   It's going to be a different kind of media
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:17.840]   when it really starts taking off.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.440]   The Kindle limits what Amazon can really do with their books
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   to be in this static book-like thing.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.320]   And I think that's going to be a big challenge for them,
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.240]   more than anything else.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.560]   Hey, thank you for the call.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:37.640]   Take care, Chad.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.320]   Let's do-- you want to do a couple more?
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:39.840]   Let's return.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:40.360]   I'm having a fun--
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:40.880]   Sure, I'm having a book.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.600]   It's the clock here.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:41.960]   Let me just see.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.360]   I can't tell how long the show has been,
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.800]   because we started for like an hour ahead of time
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.720]   trying to get Andy on, even though he was on a plane.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.200]   And I'm more on.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:54.920]   Chucky J. Hey, Chucky J. welcome to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.640]   Where are you calling from today?
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.240]   Gentlemen, I'm calling from Gainesville, Florida.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.120]   Great to have you.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.720]   Excellent.
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.400]   Thank you for taking my call.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.960]   Sure.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.920]   I have a question about future-proofing.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:14.240]   Both of you guys are good for this question.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.000]   I'm thinking Final Cut Pro.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.480]   I'm thinking Premiere.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.800]   I'm thinking the iPads coming out.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.040]   A lot of things are happening in the next couple years
[00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:27.080]   with what you guys are doing in media.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.600]   And I'm working on kind of an amateur budget.
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.360]   I do a little bit of video work at work,
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:35.560]   but mostly that's not my job.
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.240]   I do a little bit of video work at church
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.440]   and other places.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:47.600]   So what kind of choices would you make or would you recommend?
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.840]   So that, say, two years from now, I'm not sorry.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:53.400]   I bought Final Cut Pro or not sorry.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:58:01.320]   I bought an HD camera that works off SD cards, those kind of things.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.520]   That's a tough one.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:08.440]   Yeah, I think that what you want to do--
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.720]   I mean, what we do when we buy a lot of equipment
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:14.560]   and what we do is we only buy what we painfully
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.320]   need to buy at that moment.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.080]   And then we try to make sure that it's
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:21.440]   going to be good enough for the amount of time we're using it.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:23.880]   I think what gets people in trouble, what has gotten us in trouble
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.120]   when we first started out and what people get people in trouble
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.320]   is they overbuy.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.720]   You never want to overbuy technology.
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:30.520]   So you always want to buy what you
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.360]   want to think about how you're going to possibly go.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.560]   But you don't want to buy a--
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.480]   like when we bought our Sony F950 now for a year,
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.440]   we didn't really get any work out of it.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:41.280]   Now we had to buy it when we bought it.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.160]   But that was tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.840]   Because you bought too far ahead?
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.440]   We bought a little-- it was a little further ahead
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.720]   than what we could afford.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.080]   And it caught up.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.200]   And it made sense in the long run.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.880]   But what I will say is that by the time we were really doing well with it,
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:55.840]   we could have put--
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:59.480]   if we hadn't done that, we could have put $1,000 down on a red.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:00.000]   Right.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.360]   And gotten red instead.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.360]   And so--
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.440]   Well, that's the trick is to decide--
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:07.360]   I mean, I don't think it's a bad thing to buy something like the red that's
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:08.720]   going to have headroom.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.440]   It's going to have the future.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:10.280]   But--
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:12.120]   You got to know where you're going to go with it.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.120]   That's what you don't know.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.520]   Is this going to be the next big thing?
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.520]   Or is this going to be something that we're
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.520]   going to throw in the closet?
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:17.880]   I mean, I think that you're going to be--
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:22.040]   you're going to be able to do a lot with either premiere or with the final cut.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.720]   They're both great editing apps.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.400]   Editing has really become something that is fairly stable.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.320]   We're not really changing the way we do it.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:30.880]   They all do it roughly the same way.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.920]   I know that our editors prefer final cut over premiere.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:39.720]   They kind of bristle at premiere.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.200]   But I think that it might be that they also started on final cut.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.200]   I know a lot of people that edit on premiere are used to really be bad.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.000]   And it's gotten a lot better.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.440]   And so there's not any sure fire one way or the other.
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:54.800]   I know that for us, most of our editing, most of our graphics are done in motion.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.160]   Most of our editing is done in final cut.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.920]   That's kind of that house.
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:04.800]   Because we're so Mac driven, it makes the most sense.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.360]   But I don't think that if you went the other way, it would necessarily make a mistake.
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:10.840]   It would just be a different direction.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.600]   What I would do is do it incrementally.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:18.200]   If you can get away with using iMovie for some of the first stuff, it's fine.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:21.480]   I know you probably look down your nose at me, but I think iMovie is pretty great.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:25.040]   I'm sufficient for 99% of what I want to do.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.040]   Yeah, I actually think that--
[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.200]   What would I miss if I didn't spend the money on Final Cut?
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:31.360]   What about Final Cut Express?
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.840]   Final Cut Express is a great place to go.
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.920]   It'll do-- for most of your just straight cut editing, it'll do everything that you need
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.920]   to do.
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:41.160]   Yeah, the reason I end up using iMovie is because I can understand it better.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.360]   As soon as you get to the Final Cut UI, it's tough.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.160]   If you're just doing-- if you slap it in a bunch of stuff together, I'm going to be
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.160]   just--
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.160]   I mostly do.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:49.160]   Right up with that.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.160]   And it's easy.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.160]   It's so fast to slap something together.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:53.360]   The problem that you get into is if you want to design some really-- like this little Mac
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.280]   break weekly, lower third that kind of flies in and everything else, you can get the ones
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.360]   that they have for you.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.280]   But what you can't do is do as much design work without doing a little bit of hacking
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:04.200]   to get it to work in iMovie.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.800]   So you'd use Live Type or what is that?
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.760]   Well, I just think that-- well, we design them in motion.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.920]   So we build all of our lower thirds in motion.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:15.200]   So you get motion with Final Cut Express, though.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200]   No.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.200]   No, you don't.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   You have to get the studio.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.720]   And the studio, I have to say, is the best deal going around.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:25.360]   I mean, $12.99, you have a color editing program.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.360]   Color is--
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.920]   If you need it, it's worth it.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.920]   If you need--
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.920]   We have three copies of a--
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:32.920]   Of studio.
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:37.000]   Plan that studio $12.99 each, and I'm going, and we've got more.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.560]   And so that's a lot of money.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.800]   But you get a lot of stuff.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.800]   But you get a lot of stuff.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:50.000]   And it's the-- that's one of our-- it's very high value there.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   You know, this has been a lot of fun.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.600]   I think, though, we better wrap it up, because, well, we've been here a while.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.600]   You got other shows.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.600]   I got other shows.
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   You got other shows.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   And other shows.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600]   And stuff.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   But we do want to do our picks for the week.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:05.880]   Do you have a pick besides Plants vs. Zombies, which we played for the first hour of the show?
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.000]   I was going to pick it again, because it was so good.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.400]   It's such a good game.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:13.800]   Alex and I, we were-- for those who weren't watching Live, we--
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.600]   I had this foolish notion that Andy was going to be here.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:19.000]   And so I kept calling him, and I kept waiting and putting it off.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.840]   But as we were waiting for his Skype to answer, we went through about three levels of Plants
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.760]   vs. Zombies on the air.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:27.760]   And it was fun.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.280]   That's a great game.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.280]   Very addictive.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.440]   I'm going to recommend-- do you want to do that again, or do you want to do something
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.440]   else?
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.440]   No, no, no.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.560]   So I want to-- I want-- did you-- I have a question for you, actually, first.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.080]   Did you recommend the Wii scale?
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:42.980]   The Wii, the Wii, the Wii, the Wii, the Wii, the Wii, the Wii, the Wii, the Wii, the Wii
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:43.980]   thing?
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.980]   Yes.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.980]   Not only did I recommend it, I use it.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.980]   I use it too.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.980]   Are you a Wii thing's going to--
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:49.240]   We're working on a new show.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.820]   And so I have a test one right now, and I like it.
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:52.980]   What are you going to call the show?
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.820]   The largest weight loss sky?
[01:02:54.820 --> 01:02:56.820]   No, it's for a whole bunch of--
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:57.820]   Well, that's good.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:00.220]   It's for using Mac stuff at home.
[01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:03.460]   So if you go-- so what's your-- mine is Leo's underscore scale.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:04.460]   I'm not scoring.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.460]   I should Twitter my weight.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.460]   Well, that's the whole point of it.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:10.940]   No, the whole point is just that I can stand on it, and then I have it online.
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:14.340]   It's not-- I would like to know what you thought is, because I don't think it's the
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.180]   most accurate scale I've ever seen.
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:19.340]   You know, I tested against my other scale, and I've actually found it to be identical.
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.340]   OK.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.900]   So I actually thought that at first.
[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:26.260]   As long as it's consistent, now I'm weighing myself every day, and it goes up and down,
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:27.260]   up and down.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.260]   That's just your weight.
[01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:29.260]   But that's my weight, too.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:30.260]   That's normal.
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:31.260]   You fluctuate like--
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:32.260]   Three pounds?
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:33.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:34.260]   No, not even usually that much.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.260]   Mine will go up and down three pounds.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:36.260]   In one day?
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.260]   In one day.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.700]   In fact, I'll go to bed at one weight and be two pounds lighter at one point.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.700]   OK, so that's normal.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:41.700]   That's because my body just does run so quickly.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:42.700]   Yeah, you shouldn't weigh yourself--
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:43.700]   I think I'm going to be right.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.180]   That's why they say don't weigh yourself every day.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.460]   But so I'm tweeting at Leo's underscore scale.
[01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:51.660]   This is expensive scales, 159 bucks.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.780]   But it does tweet.
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:56.260]   And it gives you a great website with lots of flash animation.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.260]   The interface.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.260]   There's an iPhone app.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.500]   There's an iPhone app, and I like it.
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:03.140]   I think I have a connectivity problem with it right now at my house, and so I'm trying
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.140]   to get that sorted out.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.140]   You know, it's kind of cool the way you set it up.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.140]   You put your little eye--
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:09.140]   So it's the sound that goes into it, right?
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.140]   I do so.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.140]   That's what's happening.
[01:04:11.140 --> 01:04:13.420]   So what happens is you put your iPhone into this little pocket in the back of it, and
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:15.420]   you hear this little--
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.420]   It talks to it.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.420]   They're like, hey, I have a little scale.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:19.420]   Do you want to talk?
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.420]   And it sets it up for the Wi-Fi access spot and everything.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.380]   Yeah, I just like, oh, yeah, you can talk about it, and we can talk.
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.380]   And so it's actually--
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.580]   I'm actually enjoying it.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:31.980]   I'm still testing it, trying to get this connectivity issue to work.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.380]   Now, so to be honest, I don't know if I recommended a Mac break weekly.
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.100]   I know I did it on GizWiz.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.660]   I don't know if I mentioned an Mac break weekly.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:43.260]   The other one that I've been enjoying a lot that I'm using a lot is the newest update
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.260]   of the NPR app has really turned out.
[01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:46.260]   They just updated it.
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.260]   What's new in there?
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.260]   Well, here's the deal that I used to.
[01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:51.700]   You can quickly get to a lot of the different shows.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:53.780]   You can add the shows to the playlist.
[01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:58.500]   You can also-- one of the other cool things about it is that you can stream from every
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.500]   station.
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.500]   I'm not sure if they had that before.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.500]   I just realized it.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:05.420]   But what's fun is listening to NPR from Gainesville, Florida.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:06.420]   I don't listen to that before.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.420]   I don't listen to that before.
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:08.420]   I don't listen to that before.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.420]   I love that.
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:11.460]   But it's actually working really well.
[01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:13.660]   I think that the way that they're handling the programming and being able to add to the
[01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.780]   playlist was improved from the original app.
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:18.620]   The original app was kind of like these are the stories we're going to-- these are some
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:19.780]   stories available.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:20.780]   Right.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.580]   And the organization of it has a working-- and there's just a couple of things that I'm
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:25.580]   enjoying.
[01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:26.580]   And then live air traffic control.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.580]   That's the other one that I've been seeing.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:30.540]   You know some live air traffic control?
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.340]   Well, whenever I'm on a United flight, I listen on Channel 9.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:34.980]   It puts me right out.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:35.980]   I love listening to--
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:36.980]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:41.420]   What's funny is listening to pilots get snitty with the air traffic control.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:44.500]   And the air traffic control is quietly telling me to back off.
[01:05:44.500 --> 01:05:45.660]   And it's all in the under--
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:46.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:47.660]   You have to know the blingo.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:48.660]   They really know what's going on.
[01:05:48.660 --> 01:05:52.900]   And they're trying to be polite, but they're saying, "Let my plane go.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:55.660]   Let my people."
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.380]   I'm going to recommend if you've ever used Echo Phone-- we actually talked about this
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.620]   on Twitter a little bit.
[01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.340]   Dwight Silverman was plugging this.
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:06.300]   If you've ever used Echo Phone on the iPhone-- it's one of the very popular Twitter clients
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:13.300]   on the iPhone.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.940]   It's kind of like Tweety or one of the other iPhones.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:17.140]   You look better than Tweety?
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.140]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.140]   I think it's pretty nice.
[01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:20.140]   I haven't been--
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.140]   It's very spare.
[01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.140]   Uh-huh.
[01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.820]   I mean on the desktop, not on the iPhone.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.420]   I use Tweety on the iPhone.
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:27.980]   But Echo Phone on the desktops.
[01:06:27.980 --> 01:06:29.740]   You see this is on a Mac and Tash.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.580]   What's funny is that I still use Twitter on desktop.
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:33.580]   Yeah, I use Brizzly.
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.780]   I guess I'm pretty old-fashioned.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:36.780]   That's pretty cool.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:39.500]   It has a little drawer where you can click on somebody's name.
[01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.420]   It'll show the drawer and it'll let you do things like reply to them, send a message
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.420]   to them.
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.380]   It'll give you their status update.
[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.180]   You can see a lot more about them.
[01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.900]   It's just an interface.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:52.220]   There's no magic in here that's not available on other Twitter clients.
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:55.340]   But it's just very pretty, very mackish.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:59.860]   Right now it's free because they're beta testing it.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:03.660]   I don't know if it'll continue free, but 0.99 is the current version.
[01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:08.860]   I really should move to this month.
[01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:09.860]   To this month.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:10.860]   We're more current.
[01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.860]   I'm still using Twitter.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.940]   I can go to twitter.com.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.260]   You know a lot of people use it.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:18.220]   You can tell, if you're on Twitter, you can tell what people are using.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.220]   It says.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:23.420]   I often, just to see what people are using, I will go to Twitter.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:25.700]   I will sign in here in my Twitter account.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:28.820]   Usually if I say something useful, it's on Twitter and then if I'm complaining, it's
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.540]   on my phone because I'm usually standing in lines.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.900]   I want some buzz applications.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.900]   That's what I want.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.540]   So yeah, you can see.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:44.820]   So this guy's using TweetDeck, TweetDeck, 4-square, web, web, Twitter feed, TweetDeck,
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:48.020]   TweetDeck, TweetDeck, TweetDeck, TweetDeck, TweetDeck, TweetDeck, TweetDeck, TweetDeck,
[01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.020]   a lot of TweetDeck.
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:51.020]   Here's an EchoPhone.
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:55.420]   Twitter feed, Seismic, Twitter feed, Uber Twitter, Tweetee.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.420]   So you can see it and go down there.
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.420]   You can see what people use.
[01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:00.060]   You can also click on it, which is kind of nice.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:03.180]   It'll take you to that site so you can see what's out there.
[01:08:03.180 --> 01:08:06.300]   But EchoPhone, brand new, you can take a look at it.
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:07.300]   Use Bitly.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.300]   I do use Bitly.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.300]   I love Bitly.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.300]   It doesn't use Bitly.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.300]   It doesn't.
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:12.300]   Everybody uses Bitly.
[01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.300]   ECHO, F-O-N.com.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.500]   Free right now while they're in beta test.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.500]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:19.300]   I thank you so much for being here on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.260]   Next week, we'll go back to our regular format.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:24.340]   I know we did two in a row that were kind of weird.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.340]   I know that.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.340]   I'm no fool.
[01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.860]   I can tell.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:28.860]   Any anacle will be back.
[01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:29.860]   We'll get Merlin Man on this one.
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:30.860]   We did a picks.
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:31.860]   I'll picks episode.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:32.860]   That was a good week.
[01:08:32.860 --> 01:08:33.860]   I enjoy it.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.260]   I would say 99% positive feedback.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:38.020]   1% really pissed off.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:39.940]   1% saying bring back Mac Break Weekly.
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:42.020]   And those people are going to write to me again this week because they're not happy
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:43.020]   about the call and I'm sure.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.020]   But we will go back to our next--
[01:08:44.020 --> 01:08:45.020]   Where's the clock?
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.140]   Clock right there.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.620]   Right behind me.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:53.580]   Alex Lindsay is at the Pixelcore.tv for the podcasts and a ton of podcasts coming up
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.140]   from PMA now, right?
[01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:57.140]   They're all coming out right now on this week of photography.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.860]   And so they're rolling out.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:02.420]   We are packaging them up a little bit together because we shot too many.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:03.420]   So we're--
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:04.420]   Really?
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:05.420]   You shot too many.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.420]   Really?
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:10.260]   We shot 27 and three hours and we thought maybe that might be too many to put out all
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:11.260]   together.
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.180]   So we're experimenting with packaging like threes and fours together.
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:18.300]   Three or four of them together at a time so that it's not quite so as much of an onslaught.
[01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.420]   And NAB, we're probably going to refine that to even-- we're kind of getting to this thing
[01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:23.740]   now where we know we can shoot them.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:24.740]   It's so great though.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:27.340]   If you're interested in that conference and you want to know everything that went on
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:30.180]   at PMA, you can go there and you look at all these cameras and stuff and you guys do
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.180]   a great job.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:33.740]   Well, one of the things that we started getting into because we shoot so many of these shows
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:37.980]   is now we're doing enough of them where we now back up and we-- I spent the day going
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.740]   through it and doing research and then we back up and what are the real stories here?
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:41.740]   Right.
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:42.740]   And then we're trying to import--
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:43.740]   But the--
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:44.740]   Do you have the T2I on there?
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:45.740]   I'm trying to.
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.740]   You know, I don't-- a Canon wasn't there.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:48.740]   They weren't at PMA.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.740]   What the heck?
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:54.100]   Well, there's some rumors about that they're going to have a big showing at NAB and they
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.940]   may be moving chips from the still cameras into the video cameras.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:58.940]   That's the rumor.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:01.980]   No, it's a rumor, not a fact.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.740]   But so we think NAB is going to be pretty exciting and we're going to be there in force
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.700]   and shooting probably lots of episodes and then we're going to try to kind of compile
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.740]   them back so people can really see what was hopefully important.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:13.740]   Twitter-- I'm sorry.
[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.340]   Pixel Core-- I'll get Twitter on the brain.
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:19.660]   PixelCore.tv-- PixelCore.com is where you should go if you're a multimedia artist or
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:23.460]   you would like to be working in that field where you can learn and get work.
[01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.940]   PixelCore, P-I-X-E-L-C-O-R-P-S.com.
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.060]   We invite you to watch our show.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:32.020]   We normally, if all goes well, we do the show 11 a.m. Pacific.
[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:37.900]   That's 2 p.m. Eastern Time, 1900 UTC at live.twitt.tv every Tuesday.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.620]   Please stop by and say hi, be in the chat room or maybe we'll use talking again and
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:42.620]   use-- I loved calling.
[01:10:42.620 --> 01:10:45.620]   I heard that I think we-- I think that could be a regular thing.
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:48.980]   We won't do it every time but we'll definitely do more of it, I love it.
[01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.460]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:51.460]   Now get back to work.
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:52.460]   Break time.
[01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:53.420]   It's over.
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.420]   [MUSIC]
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.420]   [MUSIC]
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:07.420]   [MUSIC]
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:10.000]   (upbeat music)
