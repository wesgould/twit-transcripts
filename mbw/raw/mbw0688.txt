[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.720]   And guess what? I'm back, sorry.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.040]   I'm here. Thank you, though, to everybody who held down the Fort You too,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.760]   and you, especially Andy and Aco, the beautiful WGBH of Boston.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.560]   And apparently now working for Pixar Studios.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.600]   Or you're waiting out for your Disney Plus celebration.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.520]   No, but I really like the false rumors I work for Pixar.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.040]   Is it really alive? I just failed to correct you?
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.600]   No.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.880]   Oh, there you go.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.440]   Welcome. It's good to see you. Thank you for filling in for me.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.840]   I appreciate it.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.520]   Good to see you. Good to see you back. Actually, I wasn't filling in.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.640]   It was the new hire. It was the Stig.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.600]   Oh, the Stig did.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.080]   Mac Break.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.040]   Oh, all right.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.800]   And he did a fantastic job.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.120]   Nice.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.000]   Yes.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.160]   Also, Renee Ritchie from iMoor.com and Vector. Good to see you.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.960]   Good. I was gone almost as long as you were, Leo.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.640]   I feel really bad, but I'm glad you're back.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.520]   Somebody had to make a trip to New York City for some reason.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.840]   We don't know.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.440]   Three of them. It was like three weeks in a row.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.560]   I don't know what their problem is.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.760]   Oh, God. Could they just go?
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.080]   So you went for iPod, AirPod Pro, AirPod Pro,
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.800]   and then their whole new privacy thing, and then Mac Pro.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.160]   Oh, geez, Louise.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.680]   Also with this.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.280]   And then they come back and Laurie and Alex are gone.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.320]   I don't know what's happening.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.680]   The team is back. In fact, Laurie couldn't make it today.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.080]   So we've got Dave Hamilton from Mac Observer.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.720]   Hello, Dave.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   Hey, thanks for having me back.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.480]   It's always a pleasure to be here.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.360]   This crew is always a surprise.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.400]   So it's always fun.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.880]   You never know.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.080]   You never know.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.720]   Speaking of surprises, I went in my office this morning
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.320]   and there's a box waiting for me.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.880]   I wonder what it could be.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.200]   Yeah. My new Surface X is here.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.760]   It's Pro X.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.840]   I'll let Dave go.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.120]   It's a 16-inch box for me.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.520]   Oh, it's a very small bezeled box.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.600]   Get it upside down there.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.160]   This is the new MacBook Pro.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.000]   I was a little bit mad because, as you might remember,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.120]   I had given up on this.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.600]   Ming Chi Quo convinced me it wouldn't be out until next year.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.840]   And I bought a different laptop as my purchase of the year.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.360]   But I'm going to send that back because this is the...
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.440]   I have a feeling, and you know, Renee, you have one, I'm sure.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.240]   And Andy, I saw on Twitter that you went into the Apple Store yesterday to bang on one.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.280]   Dave, do you have one or no?
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.800]   I don't have one.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.880]   I've banged on one, but that's a surprise.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.400]   So I neither banged or anything.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.000]   But it sounded from everybody's reports that this was the MacBook Pro
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.680]   we've been waiting for, that they fixed the keyboard, they fixed the thermals.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.320]   So the i9 in this is giving you its full juice.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.080]   New speaker system, which is supposedly really good.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.080]   Renee, you love it, I think.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.200]   Yeah, I've been using it for about a week now.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.600]   And it's like, the other way up front, I think the webcam is in a front to the machine.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.880]   It's still 720.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.920]   What's the deal?
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.520]   And it does nothing for...
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.480]   Like, if this camera was 1080p or 4K, I could use it for mobile video production,
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.160]   because the microphone, while not outstanding, is really USB.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.360]   It's pretty good.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.840]   It's pretty good.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.400]   Yeah, people have compared it to a Yeti or something like that.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.280]   It's certainly good enough.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.320]   And then the Wi-Fi 6.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.880]   You could do a podcast.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.000]   Those are the two dings.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.840]   And it's not Wi-Fi 6, which is weird, because even the iPhone 11 is Wi-Fi 6,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.360]   the new 802.11aX.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   One thing Apple does, so we ask something to complain about.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.520]   It's just that one thing every time.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.800]   You know, it probably has more to do with chipsets than anything else, right?
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.520]   Yes.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.280]   So everything else is my wish list.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.960]   Let's say they did everything I wanted them to do.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.160]   It really is the System 7 of MacBooks.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.600]   The logo is, it sucks less.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.400]   Now I got the darker one of the two.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.560]   Or Didi.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.080]   Yeah, that's slate.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.040]   It's not quite as dark as I expected.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.680]   It's almost aluminum, isn't it?
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.680]   Oh yeah, that's the darker one.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.240]   It is.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.160]   But it's the other one is really over though.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.040]   It's real pretty.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.480]   I think it's very nice.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.560]   Does the hinge change as well?
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.200]   I think it is.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.040]   It's just a little taller because the thing is a little deeper.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.640]   But you get space blocks,
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.680]   space gray sticker is Leo.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.560]   That's the important thing.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.280]   What?
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.640]   Oh, well that's worth it.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.680]   That's worth every penny.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.440]   And it's already booting.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:53.920]   It's already booting.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.520]   Yeah, look at that key.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.560]   For me, the separate escape key is also important because I use e-backs.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.760]   So I actually use an escape key.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.360]   So that's pretty cool.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   Apple shouted out Vim during the demo.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.680]   Or Vim or VI, absolutely.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.600]   Yeah, escape key is really important in VI.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.680]   Also, they've separated out the fingerprint reader.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.000]   So it's just kind of a separate button from the touch bar.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.080]   The keys, caps, I don't have to recapitulate.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.200]   Everybody knows all of this.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.360]   Oh, it's talking to me.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.960]   Hey, I see.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   Yeah, you haven't clicked the button fast enough.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.760]   Hi Siri.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.600]   It talks faster.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.560]   And you have those new arrow keys that are just like cold arrow keys.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.280]   And the way they should be.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.400]   You know, that's all anybody wanted was a 2015 MacBook
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.640]   with the new Intel processors, right?
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.760]   That's it.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.720]   Yeah, there were it's really all they had to do was say,
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.320]   let's take all the bad ideas we put in three years ago
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.200]   and not actively make it stink now.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.800]   Let's just we don't have to innovate.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.400]   We don't have to even iterate.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.000]   We don't have to have courage.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.760]   We just have to say, let's take a look at the design that has worked
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.600]   for every computer used by a human who types with fingers
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.880]   and emulate that instead of anticipating humans having different sorts of hands
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.160]   in the next thousand years.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.560]   So yeah, the the inverted T is a big.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.000]   I was kind of surprised by how.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.280]   How welcoming the new keyboard was simply about virtue of the fact
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.760]   that it doesn't seem like it's off balance.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.640]   And there was something about the touch bar that really just rendered everything.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.440]   Like it's tilted to the left a little bit having the escape key that's anchoring
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.040]   the upper left hand corner.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.760]   And as visual creatures, we start at the top left of things and work our way down and right.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.960]   So when there's something when the first thing you see on a keyboard isn't there.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.840]   That's discombobulating the again going back to a standard inverted T
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.920]   configuration of the arrow keys just let's make this familiar again.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.360]   They didn't have the keyboard is better.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.200]   I will I now I'm now so relieved that I no longer have to say that I there's no way
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.640]   in how I can imagine myself buying a MacBook anytime in the future because the keyboards of
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.400]   all the other Mac books were just like I'm saying a non starter.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.000]   This one it's not a great keyboard.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.520]   It's not even particularly good keyboard, but it's an adequate keyboard at least.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.240]   It won't it won't be the reason if I if if I don't buy another MacBook the key it won't be
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.320]   specifically because the keyboard which is not a deal breaker, which is it's it sounds
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:28.640]   like it's it sounds like the most faint praise backhanded compliment I could possibly make,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.360]   but really I'm just excited by the fact that okay we have a workable keyboard and that and that
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:38.080]   and that trackpad is that's got to be the biggest trackpad Apple has ever put on anything it is.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:44.880]   So I remember the last time I compared the trackpad to the iPhone and it was about iPhone size.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:50.080]   Let's just put the iPhone on the trackpad today and oh yeah it's it's it's it's considerably
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:56.320]   it's it's the iPhone plus an extra inch you know it's that's a big on the top that's a
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.360]   so it's the width of the iPhone's height and it's maybe a three quarters of an inch taller.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.840]   That's that's a big trackpad yeah I don't know.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.120]   Maybe this was Apple's planned all the way along though right put out roll out all these changes
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.600]   that everybody's gonna hate for three years and then when we rolled this machine out we don't
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.240]   have to worry about them complaining about no Wi-Fi six or seven because because because
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.880]   as we all know in business history new Coke was such a shot in the arm for
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.040]   Koko Classic it was worthy of emulation by the by the most valuable tech company.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.520]   All right I'm going to type on it the first time and I what I'm going to do is a password because
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.720]   passwords are my best way of judging accuracy on a keyboard because if I have to retype the
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:44.320]   password a bunch of times that drives me nuts and I have very weird passwords and I type
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.920]   it on camera so everybody can see me. Yeah I just did by accident.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.640]   It's okay it's just a Wi-Fi password it's not you you won't gain any real benefit.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:59.200]   Yeah it feels better it doesn't you're right Andy it's not the 15 it's not a Lenovo ThinkPad
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:05.840]   but the 2015 but it's good it's almost twice the key travel isn't it like 1.0
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:16.080]   1 millimeter yeah and I actually like the spacing so I think you know it's Ben Thompson on
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:23.440]   Stratecary had an interesting article today about Apple and the perils really he talked about the
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.240]   perils of being dominant he said I don't like to use the word monopoly as a technical term but in
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.400]   this in effect Apple has a monopoly on iOS and Mac OS products and he said the problem with that
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.160]   is people are going to continue to buy they've sold more than 90 million dollars worth of
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.800]   MacBooks since the keyboard debacle people are going to continue to buy you're not going to get
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.840]   the signal you would get if there were a choice because even if people hate it you can kind of
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:57.120]   kid yourself oh no they like it it's just a few lab mouths because they are buying it so there's
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.960]   a peril and I think that was his point to being so successful and we this is nothing new we've
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:09.920]   known this for some time so Ben is a genius so far for me to second guess him but and it's not an
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.640]   exact parallel but you have companies like Nintendo who you know they make the we and then they make
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:21.200]   the we you and then they come back and they make the switch and the danger is you know Apple takes
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.960]   these big swings Steve Jobs used to call them Babe Ruth swings and a lot of times they hit it you
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.320]   know they don't make very few phones they make very few computers they don't work like Dell or HP
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.840]   but when they miss you know that ball goes flying by them and that's the risk and I don't want them
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.000]   to stop swinging because a lot of times when they do take those swings they make really innovative
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   things like I think the Force Touch Trackpad that was a risk they made the best trackpads in the
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.560]   business and they re-engineered them and you can debate whether you like the size or not but I
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.640]   think from a technological point of view these new touchpads are way better than what they had
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.200]   before and they had the same confidence level going into these keyboards and they're one of their
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.360]   issues is that they get pushed back on almost any change if they don't change anything people say
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.640]   they're not innovating but when they do change things people don't like it because we're change
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.560]   adverse and sometimes they're going to be right and the new way is going to be better and after
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.400]   like a couple days of us getting used to it we'll say hey I kind of like this but when it's wrong
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.840]   they're still in the mentality of oh you know they're just still getting used to it and they're
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.160]   going to see the same things the same good qualities that we see in it they're going to see in it and
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.960]   that just makes when it's wrong it's like they double down on the wrong and then it takes them an
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.640]   extra cycle to get back on and rebuild a keyboard or something so in light of that this is a pretty
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.320]   amazing thing for a company like apple a dominant company a very very successful company to say yeah
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.200]   maybe we did make a mistake now they're not going to say that out loud because all the other MacBooks
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.360]   still have the whole keyboard but is it this is I think this is it's new coke unprecedented that
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:54.160]   apple would say okay we give they roll back on the ram too like they were all in on low power ram
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.360]   and just the lpdr4 did not come and it did not come and now they've gone back to ddr4 ram and
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.960]   they've had to increase battery to compensate for it but they've gone up to like 64 megabytes
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   gigabytes of ram eight terabytes of ssd they also you know they thought that we're going to get to
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.200]   10 nanometers and they thought we're going to get to 10 nanometers and we're still not at 10 nanometers
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.600]   and now they've redone the thermals and they could always burst they could always deliver the i9 at
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.480]   burst beads but now they can deliver it for longer sustain as well so in many ways it's it's a
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.760]   regression and it's a very pragmatic regression given the lack of advancement in the silicon that I
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:33.520]   think that they were counting for and they've also done a really good job in totally abstracting
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.440]   away that silicon so if you look at a modern Mac it's got a layer of metal onto it and most
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.760]   people wouldn't realize when it's hitting those gpu's or the cpu's and they're shoving a bunch
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:48.000]   of stuff onto the t2 chip now like hvcn code decode that doesn't still doesn't work well on intel so
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.440]   they're shoving all that onto the i was equivalent to an a 10 processor inside the computer and it's
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.400]   sort of it's sad because i'd love to see a mac where we did get 10 nanometer cannon lakes like
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.960]   three two two three years ago and i'll end ddr four two three years ago but i think this is
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:08.640]   this is them fixing their mistakes and also doing their best to work around the general lethargy of
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:17.200]   of x86 silicon it sounds uh it sounds like they uh for most the most part uh uh kind of
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.880]   are took the correct the turn in the correct direction is that a fair way to put it
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:27.520]   yeah yeah they turn away from the ground away from the mountains into the sky having having
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.360]   typed a little bit and i have to say a little bit on this keyboard yeah you're right Andy it's
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.400]   not the 2015 keyboard i did on i fix it they said oh yeah it's pretty much identical it doesn't feel
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:42.080]   like that the travels it has a different it has a different rut so the the scissor mechanism is very
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.000]   it's very very similar to the magic keyboard that comes with the iMac it they just had to reengineer
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.640]   it because the iMac keyboard is slightly angled and this one is flat right and what they ended up
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.080]   doing because they they still really really believe in in not having it be very loose if you hit it
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.240]   on the sides so they re-architected the rubber it's gone back to using a rubber dome and they
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.720]   re-architected slightly so that when you get to max when you get to max up key travel you got a
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.040]   punch a little bit to push it back down and that equalizes stability for them it feels pretty good
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:15.760]   it's not it definitely seems a little bit quieter uh you know i think it's i think you you nail it Andy
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:20.240]   it's good enough yeah it's not it's not a bad keyboard at all it doesn't distinguish itself
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.280]   either way and again after the past after the past few iterations i'm happy with it just not
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:30.240]   you know you don't you're you're hoping when you when you get behind the wheel of a new car
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.520]   that the steering wheel doesn't surprise you at all right you don't want to see any innovation
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.920]   there right you want to see a round thing that responds to you doing this to it and the keyboard
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.280]   is i think the exact same thing you really can't quote innovate and quote because you're you're
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:52.080]   taking away the best feature of that that component which is consistency and reliability uh in the
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:58.000]   face of whatever whatever mandate you think that you're pursuing there i point you to uh Marco
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:06.320]   armance blog post Marco uh dot or it was the most amazing thing he's pretty happy he said he had a
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:14.880]   list uh a wish list to fix the macbook pro many of which were not you know fixed but he said
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.520]   really it came down to the keyboard for me and they fixed that so he he says i couldn't be uh i
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:25.920]   couldn't be happier they didn't move the headphone jack to the other side and some of the things he
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:32.320]   was hoping for i'm on cloud nine look at this glorious keyboard and escape key inverted
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:41.120]   t-hero keys a millimeter of key travel uh it's funny it's it's funny that uh we we're talking about
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:48.400]   it as if you know the heavens have opened but uh the truth is i think a lot of people i'll include
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:54.960]   myself want to use macbooks we want to love macbooks we love macos and we want to use macbooks
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:02.320]   and for apple to do something so as ben tomsen called it user hostile with the keyboard uh
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:08.960]   was a real show stopper that was a shell just going like a microsoft makes a back keyboard you
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:13.200]   can just go buy a del or go buy right a Lenovo or go buy anything else with if you want to use
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:18.240]   macos you can't like you're stuck with whatever apple gives you right far greater responsibility
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.800]   yeah that and that's a real challenge it didn't that didn't upgrade for several years right because
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   of this and and held on hoping for this moment but not necessarily expecting it you know
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:35.680]   when it came like you a lot of folks i think thought we were into 2020 before we saw this and
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.480]   so i i mean i think they're gonna sell a lot of these but i think they would have sold a lot more
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.360]   of the previous iteration had they not taken this particular detour but you know we would have
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:51.440]   found something else to complain about oh we always will uh i i would have boycotted but i and i did
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.640]   keep my 2015 for many more years than i would have liked to but kind of as part of the job i
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:03.840]   bought the macbook i bought a macbook i9 macbook pro last year i bought a macbook air ended up using
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.360]   only the macbook air because that seemed to have the least undesirable keyboard but i'm i'm really
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:14.240]   i'm ready to retire all of the above for this one i should point out that there are some people
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.800]   who are really angry about like people who love the i like the butterfly keyboard i didn't love it
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.680]   but like my twitter feed is filled with the better not have changed the keyboard i can not
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:26.320]   go back to the old field i hated those old key and you know apple will tell you they have a
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.200]   they have a segment of people who really love it and i i really like it but i still maintain that
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.040]   it's not nobody hated the old keyboard and you can't have a keyboard again with one manufacturer that
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:41.280]   some people really like and others actively hate its breathing guts that's just not dannable
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.440]   for a single vendor product but there are a group of people who are angry and put out by the
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:50.160]   mushiness they return to the mushiness of the keyboard i think that's hilarious but they exist
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.120]   they yeah it has to be a minority
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:58.720]   no there the when you look at the actual numbers like again apple won't disclose them but these
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.200]   sold better than any what apple sold well but again that's what then time so i'm staying or
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.200]   they're going to sell well because there are people who have to have a man what's wrong is that
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:11.920]   they sold well like they sold astronomically better because there was a huge amount of people who
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.960]   wanted a macbook air pro but apple just did not provide a macbook pro on top of that but that's not
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:22.800]   a very large segment they sold well people really like them but they had i still maintain it doesn't
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.480]   matter if it's like 50 percent of people like them you can't have a keyboard that 50 percent of people
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.480]   hate but it doesn't work and i think that you you hit it on the head earlier by talking about it's
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:37.760]   harder for because apple really doesn't have any competition uh in the in the notebook or desktop
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:45.040]   space because let's let's face it you you you you can't buy mac OS hardware that that is not made
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.360]   by apple so it's very very easy to point to numbers and say well look we're still selling lots of
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:53.280]   them look how many pre-orders there are for the new one hey look look how excited people are for
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.720]   their our new our new innovative cylindrical mac pro see we're building things that we do
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.200]   our we do our research we do our homework we're not just simply doing style over substance we
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.880]   we're building things that people want but it's hard to get the numbers on yes but
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:14.560]   imagine that there was a simple very dull gray even beige metal box with the power with the power
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.920]   and the expandability that people wanted for three hundred dollars less then see how much you're
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.960]   in how much people are are are appreciating your innovation and how much they love this cylindrical
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:31.120]   design and the lack of a fan and the lack of upgradability so yeah that's apple it's apple is unique is
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.800]   unique there and that's but that's one of the reasons why we love them so much they do so many
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.040]   things that no other company could possibly do but of course that does come with problems that no
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.680]   other company really has to deal with and responsibility they put it on the spoon and we have to eat it
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:49.520]   there's no right like that's just how it is we don't get to hold the spoon we don't get to see
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.720]   where the spoon was before we just take it when they put it in our mouths and we say thanks can we
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:01.120]   please have some more please sir you know there you have some more i love it anyway i'm i'm very
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.960]   happy i haven't heard the speakers yet should i play the uh should i play something through
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.520]   it's like a mini-hole poddle you know it's really remarkable it's yeah especially how flat that
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:15.840]   damn thing is like we're still going through the interminable setup and and i'm trying to do this
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:21.280]   you know while we're uh while we're talking i'm almost done i think i just chose dark mode
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:27.600]   uh they put uh Dave could explain this better than i could but they put uh subwoofers back to back
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:31.600]   and drivers back to back to cancel out the vibrations while keeping the audio which
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.520]   sounds yeah because you don't want to you don't want a machine that's shaking
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:40.880]   while you're listening you know decanier so well no that makes sense right because if you put it
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.680]   out of phase then that way it would it would keep the thing from but you still it still sounds like
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:50.960]   bass correct yeah all right i have to think about it makes sense because i need to place i didn't
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.560]   realize they've done that that's pretty cool right yeah i need to play those two levels deeper on that
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   i forget what the what the scale is but it goes two levels lower on bass than the previous one
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:03.600]   uh immediately there's updates available of course and they said because they know where your
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.800]   head is in relation to it they don't they don't have to do everything that a home pod does because
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.320]   the home pod tries to fill the entire room it doesn't know where you are so it has to try to
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:15.280]   spatially place things but this has Dolby at most it has the the apple system the custom system
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.160]   that works to make non-atmos content sound more like atmos and it does all of it assuming you're
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.000]   generally sitting in front of it with your head you know positioned over it so it can play sound
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.600]   in three dimensions around you all right yeah uh i'm already a subscriber to apple music
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:36.560]   are you looking for conelio i'm just trying to get some connier as any as one does
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:42.400]   i was using to use leon's i think you some churching up well you know part of the problem is youtube
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:49.600]   now is really finicky about the use of any commercial music at all so it's the copa stuff
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   Leo can't even upload to youtube most days now because the copo warnings pop up so often are you
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:58.320]   are you're uh are your show's child attractive no but it doesn't say that like it's just like
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.720]   warning this warning that like you go to our new uploader new uploader's not working doesn't load
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:10.400]   in error i'm a little nervous about that we probably have kids uh watching and the laws are
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.680]   ambiguous which is the best thing you want when you would craft new laws about this kind of stuff
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:20.160]   all right all right what should i play uh let's see what did i listen to last night the beach boys
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.400]   that says shall i play some beach boys what it needs to have some big it wouldn't it be nice how
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:31.360]   about some yeah but i can't right you played some beach boys oh right you can't yeah classical
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.840]   yeah but even then there's eight to the eight to the eight to the eight to the eight to the twelve
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:40.160]   over two all right i'll give you i'll give you a permission to play a fling song leo i have the
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.000]   rights to uh to grant that permission because i i happen to know the songwriters okay okay
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   equal to non-apple music though dave is it you got to play my album you got to play rene's album all
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.200]   right that's right yeah flings bovine abduction is on apple music or at least it should be now i
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.800]   have to figure out how to turn up the sound with the touch bar oh yeah
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   sounds pretty good get ready here come the cannons
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:22.960]   oh you got another 40 seconds to 50 seconds
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:33.440]   i don't feel like i'm in symphony hall it actually sounds a little little tinny
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:41.440]   but i think for videos it's fine yeah you're not going to listen to this it's not vibrating
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:47.120]   but also the fact that you've got to crank it up and it still sounds good it is really it's
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:52.640]   cranked it's max yeah well i'm hearing it through all time the compression and everything too
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.680]   from here i'm not i'm sitting right next to you yeah here we go
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.400]   no apparently i got a non-canon
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.200]   an ocean there goes explosions on the 14th hole
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.360]   and 15th hole brian dorot marries looking at that ball on the edge of the cup
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.560]   it's got to be canon or it's not part of the official star wars universe it's not canon if it's
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.640]   not if there's no canon uh i think it's final
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:29.040]   no canon it's not canon so that's it the uh 16 i love that i have to say i love the screen as
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.520]   well as apple does an amazing job and this thing is just feels like you're almost looking at a
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:38.080]   desktop it's uh you go for the eight terabytes leo people were their minds were blown now the
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.720]   eight terabytes it's like four thousand extra dollars for eight terabytes so yes i was in a
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.880]   room with like jonathan morrison and a bunch of video producers and they just all kind of said
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.280]   i'm never i'm never leaving things on cfast cards again oh come on come on come on you just get an
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:57.600]   external thunderbolt three drive come on man i got two terabytes because that's my that's what i
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.400]   need for portability so i can mostly i'm going to use this for photography so that's that's so
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.720]   i can hold my my photo library and you know i have my new cameras got 61 megapixel uh i was
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.800]   thinking about that yesterday and last night as i was trying to figure out what i what i felt overall
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:18.720]   about the 2016 uh excuse me about the about the 2019 16 inch and one of them was that i'm uh there's
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.160]   rumors that in early 2020 we're going to see this this form factor and this new keyboard come to the
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.680]   13 inch model i'm really curious to see what configurations the 13 inch pro is going to be in
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.320]   because the only problem if if you want to call it a problem with the 16 inch model is that
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:41.200]   it's priced so it's really really powerful but it's priced so high that that that prosumer category
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:47.440]   the people who really need could get away with a good 1300 throttle laptop but maybe three hours
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.440]   out of the week they really do need a three thousand dollar laptop where and that's that's
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.600]   exactly where i am where for for the most part i can use an iPad i can use a Chromebook pretty
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.920]   much for most of the things i need a laptop for but there are times when i am doing video editing
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.480]   and there are times where i am doing Photoshop where i really just need that extra afterburner
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:10.640]   i can kick in when i need it however i probably wouldn't be buying a 16 inch macbook pro because
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:16.320]   for 2300 dollars that's a very large budget to spend on computing power at least in my office
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.840]   whereas if they introduce a 13 inch macbook pro that has the good keyboard and has obviously a
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.040]   processor upgraded and RAM upgrades but the minimum buy-in i can get in and out for $2,000
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:32.080]   including tax that would still be in the prosumer level at least where macbooks are concerned
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:38.400]   this is the uh is that a hundred kilowatt charger hundred it's i know that's got a
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.920]   something 97 i think because of course airlines will only let you bring a hundred
[00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:50.160]   uh kilowatt hour battery on what this one goes 100 watt battery 100 watt not 100 kilowatts
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.520]   then we could power a house that's that's Dave's uh wall his power wall that's saying yeah the power
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:00.560]   wall yeah no no so but but this is the biggest battery apples ever put in it's probably the
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.640]   biggest it's it's as big as the biggest batteries anybody puts on laptop you can't bring it on a
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:09.360]   plane if it's any bigger uh and you know this isn't that huge of a is it a little bit bigger than the
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.160]   old uh macbook 15 it's been redesigned it's about the same size but it's been redesigned so it's got
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:20.320]   more wattage i wonder if they're using are they using gallium arsenide on that i don't know because
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:25.760]   that's the new gan charges from anchor and others are more power in less volume it'll charge the
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.880]   whole thing in two and a half hours that's nice here jon i'll give you i'll give you the uh the
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.440]   end to plug the end point though i'm really curious of what they'll do with the 13 or 14 inch because
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:41.200]   they still use low power memory there which is still constrained to 16 gigabytes although if
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.000]   Intel ships the tenth gen chips by next year that'll go up to 32 at least but they're gonna it's
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.880]   out they make a whole bunch of different more portable centric choices on the smaller one and
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:58.400]   i hope that they hope that they they sort of can expand that a little bit as well uh what else is
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.240]   there to say about this said the price let's talk a little more about price this so i got
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:08.480]   it configured i did not get the fastest processor i get the second fastest processor because for a
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.440]   fairly big jump you're only getting a little bit more speed it looked like what you think that
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.640]   was nuts for nay what what do you what do you recommend if you're doing like um if you're doing
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:23.120]   video production um the new sustained speeds are nice and the bursty speeds
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.120]   a lot of modern chip architecture isn't the same as it used to be when you would just run a
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.920]   benchmark and see a number because the chips can alter frequency so fast now that if you're doing
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.680]   things that benefit from burst what can be anything as silly as loading a web page or or launching
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.520]   apps but if you're doing things like rendering i always say like just max it out if you're not
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.680]   doing video rendering or anything that has a high level of compute then you're fine so uh the
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:50.960]   choices are 2.3 gigahertz uh eighth eight core by the way which seems a little bit overkill i've
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:56.880]   never had an eight core processor on laptop ninth generation i 9 it will boost up to 4.8 if you want
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:04.800]   to spend 200 bucks more you can go from 2.3 to 2.4 gigahertz and boost from 4.8 to 5.0 i just didn't
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.960]   didn't seem it's kind of crazy when you're spending this much money on laptop it didn't seem like
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.200]   that was a worthy thing to spend money on but even the harshest critics this time are saying that
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.000]   the pricing are in line like the apple has priced this right oh like this is actually more affordable
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.160]   than a comparable laptop from Lenovo this is a pretty good price this this is not the breast
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:30.720]   the historically the macbook pros have been for a really wide definition of pros part-time pros
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:35.600]   aspirational pros this really is a pro level laptop there's nothing about this that you would
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:42.400]   not want to design and and okay yes i'll i have to complain about you can't swap in an ssd when the
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:47.520]   when your car one blows up but okay fine whatever but in terms of performance in terms of what it
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:53.920]   needs to do it really does great the only the only what does happen if my if my drive dies do
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:59.760]   do they do they have to desaw it i have to get all new motherboard would you have to get a whole
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.720]   logic board swap i haven't heard the i fix it tear down if that's part of a larger sub component but
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:11.440]   yeah ramen ramen storage are now on those fail you get a new logic board wow yeah and to be fair
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:17.920]   that's not apple is apple is the as at the vanguard of non replaceable components but there by no
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.640]   means unique even the all during this debacle for the past couple of years i'm gonna talk about
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:30.080]   oh my 2015 uh uh thing pad uh carbon x1 oh isn't it great isn't it wonderful even that has ram
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.640]   soldered onto the motherboard you can replace the ssd but you won't be able to do a ram swap or ram
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:39.600]   update but that is kind of a kick in the teeth that not that not that you would necessarily need or
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:45.040]   want to upgrade your internal storage after two or three or four years but these things do go bad
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.920]   and it really is a kick in the teeth of finding yourself having to replace a component that costs
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:57.440]   you a hundred fifty dollars just instead of going to new egg or amazon or even even an alley behind
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:05.120]   the walmart and pick up a one terabyte top of the line module for what 180 dollars 250 dollars it's
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:09.680]   like uh thank you there is you're going about it being talk to their
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:16.160]   i was gonna say tae and he's pointed out you're being it being a truly pro machine even that six
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:22.640]   core i7 on the you know quote unquote low end of this at 2,400 bucks or whatever that eat that's a
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:28.560]   capable processor for what most people would need most of the time and especially now that the
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:36.000]   thermals aren't holding it back um i think i think i i will stipulate i completely overbought
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.280]   i was i was i was happy i the macbook was too slow but the macbook air was fine i did not need all of
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:48.000]   this yeah i did buy uh instead of 16 i got 32 gigs you can go up to 64 for an additional 800 but i
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.800]   like 32 is my sweet spot these days i don't know why and the ssd is so fast like it's hard for most
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   people to tell when it's swapping and not anymore yeah i got the two terabytes although
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:03.040]   it is not unusual for as you get to these larger capacities that drives to slow down do we see
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:08.800]   specs that confirm that i don't believe they do i think they just they just double up on the band
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:14.320]   with more chips than that yeah because the way they do storage now it's not a card it's just chips
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.040]   run by the t2 so it would make sense that you're not going to have a penalty for a larger capacity
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.800]   one thing i was going to mention is and this is not from like this is not like apple would never say
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:27.920]   as officially but i've heard this from people in engineering is overall since 2016 macbook pros
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:32.800]   have been even including the kick the uh keyboard issues way more reliable they get yeah far fewer
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:38.240]   repairs and one of the trade-offs they made is that they saw way more incidents of short circuits and
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.720]   unseated chips when everything wasn't sure attached to the motherboard and when things fell they would
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.040]   suffer way more damage than when the computer was made into a solid so they felt the trade-off in
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:51.200]   terms of incident reports was better just to make them almost like a block of metal one of the
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.800]   reasons laptops they failed they failed big but yeah one of the reasons laptops notoriously you know
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.440]   shorter lived than the desktops is they get shaken around a lot they get thrown in yes suitcases so
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:05.760]   that makes sense anything to make it more stable is probably a good thing now here's a tougher
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:16.080]   decision for me and i again defer to you guys uh radion 5500 m with four or eight gigs of ddr six
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:22.720]   memory hundred bucks more for eight gigs i thought oh go for it leo you only live once never shop
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:27.760]   while you're hungry leo uh-huh that was my mistake four years never shop for computers when you're
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.800]   leo leo yeah the problem is i ordered this while i was visiting Dubai and since everything in Dubai
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.760]   cost a million dollars it didn't seem like oh that's the cab ride to the air just a hundred
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.440]   people buy and price it up uh what what kind of performance uh difference is this gonna make
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:50.160]   Renee is it is it a big deal uh the no the chipset itself is he again like if you if every moment of
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.520]   rendering time matters to you then you can play with those little things right but this chipset
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:57.360]   itself is so much faster than the last chipset and because it doesn't say vega pro some people
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:02.000]   were worried about that but no it is like we are getting significant improvements i was joking on
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.280]   twitter yesterday that i just i dragged the motion vfx plug in onto final cut and it played without
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.320]   stammering before it even rendered and that before it would like barely move so it makes a huge
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:16.640]   difference overall that's one of the things i've noticed when i'm reading reviews about this is
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:21.840]   that while there's some improvement on benchmarks when you get real world things like rendering
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:28.960]   video exporting video you see significant improvements and that's because of the system as an overall
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:33.440]   system not just one particular part of it benchmarks aren't as useful as they used to be and i and
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.600]   i know a lot of people still love to just download and and run them but unless you're like a nantec
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:41.360]   unless you're really good and they usually write their own custom stuff and it takes them a while
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:45.520]   to figure out how to hit those chips you you still you have no idea what those things are hitting or
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:50.240]   how long or what the interval between frequencies is it just does not give you good information but
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:54.400]   it makes for good articles and videos so and it's good it's it's a good time to remind people that
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.200]   apple has a two-week return policy and as long as it's in songs you take really good care of it
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:03.520]   you can't don't put stickers on it don't uh don't scratch it up in your in your book bag but you
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:08.000]   can take it home and take good care of it for an entire week and throw the worst that you can ever
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.960]   imagine at it just to see how well it'll do with your actual real world problems and then take it back
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:19.120]   if you're not happy so that's a really good thing to remember and it is true you get slate gray apple
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:27.280]   stickers if you order the shoe right there Leo that's well that's i still have the black ones i got
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:34.480]   uh from the uh mac proth five years ago so now i have all three colors did you order the new one
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:38.960]   Leo we have we have a better date on it now oh what's the date on the mac pro they said December
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.720]   they said December now and it's going to have also have the eight terabyte internal option
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:52.000]   i don't think i'll be ordering that as no price on the wheel still yeah as configured with the
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.840]   slower of the two i9s 32 gigs of memory the eight gigabyte 5500 m and two terabytes it's 36.99 that's
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:06.720]   the price on the one we're looking at right now so it is not actually the same price as a starter
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:12.960]   mac pro yeah you can get up to six thousand um but it's not cheap but i have to say uh again
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:19.200]   to reiterate it's comparable it is i don't you know there are windows pcs that will run you more for
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:25.360]   for comparable hardware so i i think apple isn't charging a huge premium on it's uh on its gear
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.840]   pretty nice i i'm excited can't wait to go home
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.680]   the question is uh we need your eyes and ears like in like in san hose and nearby do people like
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:43.760]   shame you if they see like you got a white sticker you got a great sticker oh he can only afford two
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.960]   or two colors of the of the mac they couldn't afford the rose gold uh well you know in this economy
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.720]   you know if you buy the new mac pro it should they should be gold they should be solid
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:38:00.560]   solid gold actual gold yeah the stickers should be actual gold leaf gold lemene yeah gold lemene
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.480]   yeah i think so no they should they should give you canned goods so you can actually afford to eat
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:10.000]   that ha ha ha ha steve le me gold uh did alex when he was here did he say he's gonna buy the mac pro i
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.960]   bet he did how many um how many is the question yeah how much how much can he get for his house
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:23.440]   that'll determine that'll determine uh all right let's take a break we have lots more to talk about
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:33.040]   including an apple event December 2nd what or no what but first a word from a new sponsor at least

[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.960]   we go
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   .com.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:43.360]   I have a theory you check me on this because this is not they've been doing this every year right
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:49.600]   this is not they do these awards for the best apps of the year.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   It's just a press release.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:57.680]   So I have this theory that Apple especially with the launch of Apple TV has decided they're looking
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:03.600]   at the Tony's the Emmys the Grammys the Oscars they're saying there should be a cookie.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.000]   Cookie.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.680]   What about a movie?
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.800]   Movie.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.200]   Yeah that's like Clara's the Gloris.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:15.200]   Clara's is movie I don't think the the you know who movie.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:15.760]   And Timmy's taken.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.480]   Yeah and Timmy's taken that's right Timmy.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:24.480]   So a cookie but I just think I think they wanted and I bet you Oprah will be there I bet you
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:30.240]   Jennifer Aniston I bet you they'll make it this glittery red carpet thing to celebrate the
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:35.280]   developers. What do you think? Am I nuts? Why are they doing a lot and they're doing a live right?
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.600]   You can I paint you a theoretical picture Leo?
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.360]   Paint me a theoretical picture.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:45.440]   So my guess my good guess about this is that it's going to be similar to what the Apple Arcade
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:50.560]   demo was at WWDC which is you know like it wasn't supposed to be it was it was
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.080]   not supposed to be disclosed it was like someone accidentally broke in bar go by posting it.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.400]   It doesn't sound like it's very big like there's a lot of there's a lot of people in
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.240]   mall. You mean they announced this by accident?
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.280]   No they didn't announce it they just they asked a few people to show up and it said please don't
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:10.320]   tell anybody on the thing and somebody tweeted it or a couple people tweeted it by accident.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.120]   Oh my god.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.480]   And now it's like oh they're going to have like new hardware coming in December.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.520]   So they didn't send they didn't send out invites and all this stuff.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:23.200]   They did they they they don't usually for stuff like this they did but it's like
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.840]   and I don't want to get in like too deep into the weeds on it but there are things
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.320]   this is not like a September event or an October event or even like a March event.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:34.560]   No well I think it's safe to say no new hardware right there's not this is not an iPad.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:39.360]   This is as far as my understanding is this is like the ADA is happening for a very small
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:45.360]   group of people in in New York. It's more like hey we rented we rented out a room we're going to
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.440]   have like a cash bar and we're derves. Come on if you got time after work.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.320]   I'm telling you they needed they they needed it.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.360]   They had it leaked. My guess is the next day you would have seen some YouTube videos and a couple
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.240]   like of the more socially focused bloggers.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.360]   Breaking my heart here.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.200]   Some somebody somebody would have
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.720]   someone would have found it an email in their inbox from a quote anonymous source with
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:13.920]   information close to the company saying that oh here's some really recognizable names that if
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.920]   you put this in the headline of your blog or your new site will definitely get you some clicks
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.600]   along with some Getty Images photos of this incredible celebrity.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:28.000]   Did I say did I say Black Widow. Oh it could be any one of the actors who played Black Widow in
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.720]   a movie in the past five or ten years but I can't say anything.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:31.760]   Here's your opportunity.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.280]   I get people excited.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.760]   Double down on the mistake. Double down on the leak and turn it into the cookies.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.320]   Get that red carpet. How much can a red carpet cost?
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:43.840]   Actually no no you know what forget even about the red carpet.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.160]   Just rent one of those like velvet ropes.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:51.600]   Like you got the cash bar you got like the hot pockets like slices and little bits
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.760]   and then you don't even have to tell anybody like who's behind that curtain with her
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:00.560]   and everyone will assume oh it's Oprah oh it's it's Diddy oh it's it's breaking all these
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.680]   fantasy and just hey that's how I got people to come to my first Emily sales
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:11.120]   sales thing you know you just tell people if people want to assume that fabulous celebrities
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.480]   are like in the living room not my fault let them assume let them assume
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.520]   I just don't anybody get their hopes for their expectations.
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.400]   So and there will not be this will not be the rollout of the Mac Pro and no no.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:27.920]   There will be fabulous celebrities in New York at the same time as you said.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:33.200]   That means certain of if this is anything less than the significance of Truman Capote's
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.840]   black and white ball at the Plaza in the 60s we have every right to think this is the beginning
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.040]   of the end for Apple.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.240]   There you said it.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:40.640]   There you said it.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.280]   All right never mind forget I mentioned it.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.840]   On the Mac Pro you know when when Trump gets his gets his tour of the the Austin plant
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.840]   I wonder if there's going to be like announcements from there because here's the deal
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:55.680]   get a red carpet for the president you can reuse it for the cookies.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.440]   He loves red carpets that's great he'll be just a happy
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.240]   like a little bit double and down on the cookies here Leo.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:05.120]   I'm serious it's a big opportunity for Apple.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:10.880]   So apparently November 20th the president goes to the Austin factory where the Mac Pro
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.320]   will be made to get a tour.
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.880]   Those facial expressions though.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:22.720]   Oh no look at Tim Cook he is you will never find a picture of Tim smiling next to the president.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.480]   I don't think those exist.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:30.240]   He he married he's the guy who married really really well and now he's the vice president of the
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.960]   most powerful brokerage for a New York City but he's now thinking about all the girls he really
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.080]   really loved and that he will never ever spend his life with.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.840]   Well lips are a little tight Tim.
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.480]   I'm only a bird and a girl.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:51.600]   But from a business point of view this is this is the right thing to do obviously.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.800]   Do you hear your responsibility?
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:58.240]   It's it's you know he was able to you know tariffs are a big headwind for Apple
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.640]   by saying well we're going to do this in Austin where they were going to do it anyway
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:10.960]   at the flex factory where they made the last Mac Pro that helped them get most not all but most
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.000]   of their tariff exemptions that they were looking for that saved them all.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.080]   I would say probably saved them a lot of money.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.120]   If I mean you have to share a sandwich with the president as a result well so be it.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.640]   You know it's just that remember it wasn't the Wall Street Journal that was
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:28.880]   rooming that because the terrorist Apple's going to was what's going to drop their plans to do
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.600]   US manufacturing and move production the Mac Pro overseas and it's only because they were able to
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.880]   get those tariffs exempted that they were able to bring that back.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:43.440]   So essentially what what calls me is that Trump is not let's just say he has a very
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:50.400]   creative grasp on facts and we're asked if this were Obama if this were George W.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:57.280]   If this were Clinton if this were George Bush senior they might they're always like okay well
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.120]   fine yes you're responsible for all these jobs you're responsible for but they'd be talking in
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.960]   terms of here is an economic policy that seems to be working and isn't this good for the country.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:12.080]   Where I'm so on I'm so on guard against him saying I'm the guy who all you people who have jobs
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:17.200]   here today I'm the reason why you're working and you should be thanking me right now and I'm
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:22.720]   wondering what happens when I mean that's that face you saw that that expression on Tim's face
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:29.920]   in that picture if he says things about how I brought Apple down to its knees they were all set
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:36.240]   to screw all of you over but I said no Tim no mr. Apple you're not doing that and at least and we
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:43.920]   could see Tim just explode. I just I said this on Twitter I'll stand behind it even though I said
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:50.240]   it kind of off the cuff like anything that that Trump says that is an out and out why that he
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:55.040]   that he's able to say because he's behind he's able to exploit Apple and exploit this
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:01.600]   this site to promote himself and his version of facts Apple's going to be partially responsible
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:06.080]   for that and if Apple just know what happened to that morning if Apple just let's yeah if Apple
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:13.680]   just lets that a bold mistruth go unanswered or even unacknowledged that's not a good smell on
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:19.120]   Apple. I acknowledge that their company they have to keep they have to keep in business the
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.960]   tariffs they're going to be doing much much better for their employees and for their customers because
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:27.200]   they have a very cozy relationship with the Trump administration all of that I absolutely
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.920]   acknowledge I'm just saying that the downside of that is a risk you got you got that stink on you
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:37.920]   that is not going to watch us for a number of years. I'm going to guess that the you know in the
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:46.320]   executive suite at Apple they've they've talked about that you know. How far do we how far do we
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:54.080]   let it go before Tim stands up and says no this is not how I can't imagine Tim Cook ever saying
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:59.440]   that there's going to be some way of signaling it you know maybe a press release later correct
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:05.840]   you know gently correcting but that's and but that is precisely the problem you you've now
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.800]   put yourself between a rock and a hard place. By the way the White House has not confirmed this
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:16.880]   so Tim Cook gets sick at the last minute and they bring back Dr. Dre to do the presentation with
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:20.640]   them. Yeah well that would be some because it worked really well with Kanye some figure
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:28.640]   more entertainers the better. Yeah anyway it'll it'll be a show now I'm going to watch because of
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:35.040]   what I said. I got to watch Tim's lips if they get whiter and whiter. Isn't he on Salesforce today?
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:42.400]   I think Tim is live on Salesforce today. Is he? Yes he is. Yes he is. Yes he is. Ah is that started?
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:49.040]   Should we cut to that live? No we should not. Okay you know how much customers sat you're missing
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.840]   out on right now Leo. No no if you get the Tim is pro Tim is doing his builds mentally and that
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:57.600]   will get you a copyright. I got to say did Steve Jobs do that kind of thing?
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:04.000]   Or was he just too prickly to kiss butt like that? I guess I mean he had Bill Gates on stage
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.640]   the giant Bill Gates on stage when they announced. Paul Madonna but yeah different
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:15.280]   relationships with IBM and Salesforce and SAP then Tim Cook does. Yes but this is a new world.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.320]   It's a new world. We got to see did you see that video from the guy from the mobile the mobile ad
[00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:25.280]   company talking about the negotiations with Steve Jobs? No tell me about it.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:31.440]   So like they're negotiating I think it was at 325 million and then he shows up to finalize the
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:38.160]   deal and Steve says oh it's going to be 275 million or we'll just ban your SDK from the app. Oh my god.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:42.640]   And then he made some mock-ups with brands that Steve didn't like and Steve's like go down to
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.360]   marketing and get some good brands like Disney and and then the guy said okay okay and then he
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.640]   accidentally packed up Steve Jobs laptop and took it with him by accident and had his phone off
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:57.600]   because he was working so hard and security showed up asking why he stole Steve Jobs. Oh my god.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:00.800]   Steve on the phone with him.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:08.560]   I'm sorry Mr. Jobs it just looks exactly like mine. You know I have a bad fire.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:14.080]   And if you don't want to see your entire bookmark file posted on the Reddit 10 10 minutes from now
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.320]   I think you'll give us 325 million. It's not a bad strategy actually.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:24.160]   If you think about it. Well Steve was fond of saying this is not a negotiation this requires a
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:29.600]   change of thinking on your part. So you know that's that's powerful.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.320]   That's where the day is. When you can back them up. You know there's been a lot of rehabilitation
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:42.240]   of Bill Gates lately the kinder gentler Bill Gates but this was a different era.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:49.040]   Jobs Gates they were predatory they were cutthroat and I don't know if you had to be that way but
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:53.680]   that's how it was. They went in and audited quick and saying they wanted to buy it and then as soon
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.840]   as they finished auditing it they left and made a competing product. Yeah yeah Microsoft money.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:03.360]   No this is part of these people's characters like well all the stuff that Bill Gates has been
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.400]   talking about about Android and Windows phone about saying oh you know Windows phone was good
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.520]   it should have been like the was done in the phone but I was so distracted by this antitrust
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:19.360]   suit and then like and then and so distracted by it I took my eyes off the ball because if I
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:23.840]   were paying attention there's no way that Windows phone wouldn't have trounced everything that was
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:29.200]   out there but oh well I suppose that because the because of that and because I decided to leave
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:35.520]   Microsoft and focus on charity we saved the lives of all those kids from polio so if so it was like
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:40.640]   the price of all those kids lives was us not winning winning with Windows phone so that's the
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:45.680]   sacrifice we but all these it's when you ever talk when you were getting talking back about the
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:51.280]   industry and about like the history of Microsoft you get back to something you realize that oh god
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.400]   they touch that wound that's yeah not ever closed completely. That's right that there will always be
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:54:03.040]   he's one one out of every 73 nights he still has that dream about that incident with Steve that he
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.840]   figured out exactly what he should have said two hours later but it was two hours later and
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:12.720]   Steve took a phone off the hook to deny him that that that possibility it was the this is
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:17.200]   there's a reason why Jeff Bezos is Jeff Bezos is a reason why Tim Cook is Tim Cook
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   on and on and on and that they're not terrible people it's just that they have something inside
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:26.880]   them that says that I don't care if this is a big financial risk I am going to have it this way
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:32.240]   on this issue and that's it and you're free to walk if you want to walk and you do that enough times
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:36.800]   people people don't want to walk. This is why I don't run my own business because I would be
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:42.960]   terrible to admit that I would be terrible. You're an artist Leo. I'm an artist. Exactly. So
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:48.480]   I had an idea a little later on I'm going to ask you guys to make recommendations for the first
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:52.960]   few things I should do or install on my new MacBook because I'd love to know
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:59.280]   what you each three of you I'm sure have some strong opinions about what apps I should put on
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.800]   here or what things I should turn on or turn off so I'm going to ask you about that. I just wanted
[00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:08.640]   to prepare you for that. Let me give you a couple more stories before we go on. I think a bum wrap
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:14.560]   but Goldman says we're going to recheck the credit scores after David Hennemire Hanson and his wife
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:23.040]   complained and so did Woz that women weren't getting the same credit offers as men with the Apple card.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:33.040]   I want to point out at a third data point my wife got much more credit than I did on Apple card
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:38.640]   and not because she's richer than me or we don't file we do file a joint return so
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.600]   but she got a much higher and I think it really comes down to that black box that is credit and
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:50.480]   about your credit history. Yeah right. I mean it's it's not a joint thing it's an individual thing
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:57.760]   and every bank looks at it a little bit differently. Yes we have our credit scores that's fine but
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:06.000]   that's just the credit reporting bureaus way of sort of tying it all together when say Goldman
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.600]   Sachs or Citibank or anybody else pulls your credit report they don't just get your score
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:16.400]   they get everything and then they get to choose how they evaluate it and they might actually
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:21.440]   assign a different score and then they also get to look at what have you done with us in the past
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:26.720]   that isn't on there and we know more about you right like there's so much about this
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:33.280]   Goldman Sachs I you know I used to work for Citibank and so you know a little bit about this I mean
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:37.280]   Coleman has part of the reason this is credible is because Goldman has the worst reputation.
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:42.080]   Yeah I mean yeah Apple's Apple talking about lying down with dogs and getting up with fleas
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:49.440]   Goldman you know almost single-handedly created the default credit defaults of the 2008.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:54.640]   Yeah but they wouldn't let us do that they're like they only do that for them.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:58.480]   They wrote a lot of bad credit. I said yours is a lot of bad credit.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:02.400]   Yeah and it's like a lot of investors and paid a lot of billions of dollars in fines as a
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:10.320]   assault yeah that was a well. Yeah it's just not a it's not a like gender is never like they don't
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:13.920]   know your gender they barely know. Well they could know it if they wanted to they could
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:18.400]   totally know if they want to I mean they have that data. They don't consider it but I can't imagine
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:23.680]   it would make sense for a bank which wants to lend you money that's what a credit card is
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:27.520]   to turn you down for anything but being a poor credit risk I mean that just doesn't.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:33.280]   Well but I think the number it's sorry Andy go ahead. No I'm sorry I shall let you talk
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:40.720]   I'm sorry. Okay I think that the the most important number here is well second to whatever your
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:46.160]   credit score says but let's say that you know you and your wife have the same credit score Leo
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:49.680]   and you probably don't. We don't think it's better credit score which is why she got more money.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:55.280]   They're not they're 50 points apart but. But she also may have put a different
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:02.080]   stated income on there and that's a huge factor right because. With the Apple card do you tell
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.680]   them income I don't know if you do you do do that you tell them you tell them you tell them
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:11.040]   I it's either monthly or annual income but yeah because my my it's crazy and hopefully
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:16.080]   me saying this to publicly doesn't change anything but I had always given my kids
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:22.160]   a card with their name on it that was just a clone of of one of my personal credit cards right I did
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:28.800]   the same thing. So I've got a really good credit rating and my kids as soon as they turned 18
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.120]   had credit ratings or credit scores that's love 800. That's why you do that.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:38.960]   Correct to give them some a track record to give them a track record but when my daughter
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:44.320]   applied to an apple card she she did not lie about her income but they saw her credit score which is
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.280]   you know eight something she told them what her income was and they were like yeah no we're not
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:54.160]   interested in it. They didn't even give her they turn it down. Yeah interesting but but she's a
[00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:59.200]   college student she has no one to speak of. So of course I'll turn her down. So Henry my son who
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:04.880]   I did the same thing with hoping to build them a credit rating he got turned down not by an apple
[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:10.080]   card but another credit card because there was a balance a fairly hefty balance on the American
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:14.720]   Express card that was in both of our names because it's my balance which I pay off every month and
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.280]   it's we use it for the whole company so it was I don't know $20,000 or something and they said no
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:24.480]   no you owe too much. So they turned him down. So I said no you got to apply after we pay the bill.
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:30.560]   Yeah I think your days that's right. But it's a silly it's that silly it's a and it is a black box
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:37.440]   now maybe when we talked before with AI and other black boxes that there are inadvertent biases
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:42.560]   that may well creep in and we know you know we know there's redlining in a lot of industries
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.760]   based on race and probably gender so it's not a conceivable. Did you see there was a
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:52.960]   sorry there was a really good tweet from Matthew Panzerino that just said this is not how that
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.440]   industry works but any amount of attention that we can draw to these black box algorithms for
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:05.920]   the better of all of us. Yes and I feel similarly in that the denying women access to credit
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.600]   access to financial services that's that's access that's absolutely gender neutral.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:18.400]   Denying women access to these products is part deeply woven into the history of this industry.
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:23.600]   And so if there is a question that women are not being given the same
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.200]   not being given the same sort of decisions.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.960]   Sorry decisions on credit are not the same for women as this for men. You have to investigate
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:38.160]   that. You have to force this company to explain why this is absolutely not not just simply not to
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.600]   simply explain that no this is why this is not happening but also yes if they have an algorithm
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.720]   if they have an institutional system that this institutional system was not created in the 1940s
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:53.120]   and no one has really decided to look at this to see if there is that kind of bias. So I'm
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:59.840]   perfectly willing to to believe in the end that this was just there's so many factors to be
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.360]   considered that some people are getting some people are not getting the credit they think they're
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.480]   going to they're going to get some people are getting more credit than they think they're going to get
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:13.200]   however our history in this industry of treating women like garbage is such that we have to take
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:17.680]   all of these claims completely seriously and if there's a responsibility for any institution that
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:23.280]   wants to maintain credibility Apple included Goldman Sachs included to absolutely not just simply
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:29.680]   wave their hands at it but to provide us with the data that makes Pete makes that makes the defense
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:34.480]   we can't simply trust them this is too important a concept we have to we have to stop this before
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:39.520]   this stone that's been rolling and crushing people for the past hundred years and it doesn't
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:45.280]   happen by simply standing out of the way and as was pointed out was tweeted I'm a current Apple
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:50.960]   employee and founder of the company it's the same thing happened to us to he was in his wife Janet
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.760]   10 times difference despite not having any separate assets or accounts some say the blame is on
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.400]   Goldman Sachs and this is the important part of this quote but the way Apple is attached
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:05.120]   they should share responsibility Apple can't you know what brush their hands and say oh well
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.840]   it's not us it's Goldman they they chose Goldman as a partner for this and so it's
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:15.680]   inappropriate Congress is going to even investigate so I said this I said this from the beginning that
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.320]   Apple thinks that they can say we're all we're only responsible for creating that really cool
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.200]   app and making that really cool titanium card that again this is another case of if they want to be
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:29.920]   in the consumer credit business there's a certain stink that they're going to acquire that maybe
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.640]   that maybe they're responsible for maybe they're not but they can't just simply say oh it's not fair
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:40.320]   that the decisions being made by this company that we decided to research and then enter into
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:45.680]   partnerships with I were doing bad things we had nothing to do with that so that's why I hope
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.600]   this is a good move for them to begin getting into consumer credit it's just like Facebook wants
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.280]   to get into banking just like Google wants to get into banking again Apple's not unique here but
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:58.480]   it's a weird fit for company that still wants you to think about kippies lying in fields dropping
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:07.600]   acid and visiting wash flams it's not their first thing it's not their first venture into consumer
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.560]   credit right actually when I was at Citibank they had a card with Citibank we're really
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:18.400]   going to be apple logo on the card yeah it was a Citibank credit card rainbow one yeah exactly
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:25.040]   well and Google wants to get into checking yeah yeah so I mean there's it's where the money is but
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:28.800]   you know I remember when apple announced or it was rumored that apple's gonna get into the
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:34.000]   cell phone business in 2007 yeah why would you get in that this is the worst business nobody
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.440]   nobody loves the cell phone company but sometimes yeah sometimes you have to do that
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:45.680]   if you want to expand and you got to expand if you're a company how angry people were with apple in
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.360]   the very beginning when you couldn't get service on like John Stewart was saying I can't use my phone
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.840]   as a phone and people didn't care it was 18 tears singular was an iPhone was an iPhone and even now
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:58.880]   like when new iPhones come out people get so angry at apple for UPS or FedEx not delivering them on
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:04.320]   time like right all of those things become apple's problem it's interesting it's unusual because I
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.840]   don't think it depends on the business but more importantly on the brand and apple's taken that on
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:17.040]   I think some brands you go well it's FedEx's problem if if Amazon if there's an Amazon delivery
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:22.720]   doesn't come through I don't blame Amazon as much as FedEx but apple is one of those unique brands
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:29.280]   where there's huge amounts of consumer trust and and we expect more from any apple product even if
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:34.240]   it's not their fault yeah this is this is you can't you can't it's I don't think it's the same they're
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:39.040]   just simply subcontracting a service that they that they have nothing to do with when it comes to
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.560]   deliveries and that's people if you're people complain to apple about bad deliveries with FedEx
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:51.200]   and UPS that's wrong well no we know what I'm saying is that it's sort the and the other way is like
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.080]   when you say that oh well gosh you mean that people who are assembling our products are being
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:00.560]   abused and put in high stress they're not being paid well and lots of labor laws being thought oh
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.840]   gosh isn't it horrible that this company that we innocently subcontracted with are doing that we're
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.120]   we're just as mad as you are no you can't say that you have this partnership relationship with this
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:16.240]   with this organization that you cannot do a credit card if you do not have a bank that's doing the
[01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:22.000]   financial financial end of it so that's I don't think that you can sit that I'm sure that Renee
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.560]   wasn't making a one-to-one comparison here but I just wanted to stick my aura in and just say that
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.680]   this is a much more intimate relationship and apple still needs it's it's a bigger problem for apple
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:39.360]   than bad deliveries agreed uh just a little programming note uh we don't think our power will be turned
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:45.200]   off but PG&E has once again announced that they are going to cut power in many calif northern
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:50.720]   california counties starting tomorrow we've looked at the maps and although the map is expanding
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.040]   we are not on it and we hope we will not be on it but if we suddenly disappear you know what to do
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:06:00.640]   we've been through this before we went during the fires last time I was on vacation I missed
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:06.880]   all the fun all the excitement but I was we were watching it and I'll have to say it was a
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.040]   headline news story even across on the other side of the world people were talking about the fires
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:15.680]   in northern california and I was worried about you guys and the smoke so I sent a text because we
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:21.120]   had just received the new molecule did you open it and and set it up see there is a good reason to
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:28.880]   have a molecule uh if it you know air can be air quality can be bad if there is fires nearby you
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:34.880]   really need a molecule molecule has reimagined the future of clean air we're really glad they're
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:40.800]   our sponsor because I had the brand new molecule in my office and that they took it out and they
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:45.360]   been using it yeah we opened it we opened it right up good I'm glad you didn't hesitate let's get it
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.240]   this is kind of cool because it's uh considerably smaller than the original their technology in the
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:55.040]   molecule has been verified by science it's been tested by real people including us they give the
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:01.760]   oh you put it back in a bag just to pretend I hadn't used it uh yeah you're so there was not fooled
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.800]   no matter the size of the room they use something I really like by the way we we we
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:14.080]   we have the first molecule in our bedroom because Lisa has allergies cleared that up amazingly it
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.280]   worked so well we got a molecule for our son in his bedroom then we got a molecule in the studio
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.760]   so we've had our molecules for a couple of years now it's we have the big one in here and it does
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:30.240]   an amazing job it's not just a filter it's not just a help epiphelter it is it is pico photo
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:36.240]   electrochemical oxidation it that no matter what size your room is you choose the option on the
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:42.160]   molecule that says how big the room is and whether it's a large room for the molecule air or smaller
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:49.440]   rooms this new air mini it will make that air so crystal clear and beautiful you feel like you're
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:57.040]   in a a forest breathing pure clean air pollen may be the blame for seasonologies it's not the
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:04.080]   pollens it's actually their tiny proteins that break off from the pollen that are responsible and
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:08.640]   air filters that catch the pollen aren't necessarily catching those proteins it can pass
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:13.920]   right through a traditional HEPA air purifier the molecules pico technology actually destroys
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:23.360]   those particles keep some out of your air and it is so amazing the molecule catches things that a
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:28.880]   HEPA filter can't look at these pictures on the website mold viruses bacteria they're too small
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.280]   they pass right through a HEPA filter you know what I worry about all the time formaldehyde from
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:40.720]   carpets volatile organic compounds from paint those are also captured by the molecule parents pet
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:48.400]   lovers severe allergy and asthma suffers you will love the molecule you'll be able to breathe again
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:52.640]   it was developed over 20 years by the director of clean energy research center at the university
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:58.800]   of south florida it's a patented system breaks down the pollutant to its basic harmless components
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:07.120]   viruses bacteria gaseous chemicals mold destroyed your air is clean your air smells great
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.000]   it's easy to use it's got a great modern design this is the new one there's it's all on the site
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.880]   all the papers this is the molecule mini easy to change the filter by the way I got to tell you
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:22.320]   um it's just you pop it up and it goes boom and you put in a new filter it will actually if you
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.000]   compare it with your phone automatically let you know that you need a new filter it'll even
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.480]   automatically order it if you want but you don't need to pair it with your phone uh 10 off your
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:39.680]   first air purifier either the molecule professional or the molecule mini molecule mole k u l e molecule
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:47.840]   dot com enter the promo code mac break 10 get 10 off you might want more than one uh i we have
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:54.080]   them now everywhere there are people and i'm surprised you picked this back up did you i guess
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.280]   the smoke's over so the molecule we've gotten the studios enough now but
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:04.400]   um it's great to have anytime the air is less than perfect it will be perfect if you have a
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:12.080]   molecule molecule air purifiers they're the best huge fan mole k u l e dot com promo code mac break
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:22.400]   10 speaking of bad air a total of at least 42 people have died from vaping related lung
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.960]   illnesses they think now it's uh the vitamin e acetate in some illicit
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   THC pods that's what the cdc is saying however apple is taking it pretty seriously they have
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:43.040]   removed all the vaping apps from the app store hundreds of apps uh they never sold vape cartridges
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:49.760]   from those apps but the apps can pair with bluetooth enabled vape pens and e-sigs to control the
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:57.040]   temperature and lighting uh maybe even more importantly uh in some cases the app would tell
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.440]   you what the pot is in the pen it's source whether it's legit whether it's counterfeit what it
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:09.200]   contains i think that's a real valuable service um is apple right to ban vaping app stand
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.240]   uh Dave Hamilton you look like a vapor i'll let you start
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:19.840]   thanks for uh i'm teasing growing me under the rack actually you don't you look young you look
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.800]   way younger than your must be age unless you look at a portrait of all it's just amazing i don't
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.000]   know he's never gets older he looks exactly the same he did 20 years ago i try not to you know but
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   i i don't understand this this reminds me you know watching this happen this summer where the
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:42.480]   cdc announced this you know scare first of all the amount of people that died from smoking cigarettes
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.120]   compared to the amount of people that have died from vaping is you know the the numbers of rounding
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:53.840]   error not to minimize what has happened to these people but it it sounds like it sounded
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:58.400]   immediately like somebody was cooking up like you know bathtub vape cartridges somewhere in
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:04.880]   New York state and thought that hey let's use vitamin e acetate that that's good for us that
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:09.440]   doesn't harm us well it does when it's vaporized into your lungs but they were geniuses and they
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.560]   didn't think about that i just i mean i do want to say no one should vape if you don't vape don't
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:20.240]   start vaping don't start if you are a cigarette smoker as my daughter is i strongly encouraged
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:25.600]   her and bought her jewel so that she would use that that's at least a little better than burning
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:31.840]   tobacco and inhaling it and i encouraged her also to quit yeah right and now on the other hand
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.720]   the real problem is many companies jewel stopped doing it many companies have candy you know cotton
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:41.920]   candy flavored yeah e-sigs and they're clearly aimed at young people and there is an epidemic
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:48.080]   at least i know in petalum in the high schools um our kid won't go into the bathroom at the high
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:53.440]   school because everybody's vaping in there it's a real problem so there are two issues here one is
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:58.880]   a vape pen i think is a is a better thing than smoking a cigarette but no one should use it if
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:04.080]   they don't smoke already and a lot of young people are choosing it it's cool somehow so that is a
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:10.720]   problem yeah don't start those are dark kids yeah this whole thing this summer watching the cdc
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:16.320]   announced that you know this vaping thing's terrible and then with it was like seven days right that
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:23.200]   it took for it to come out that this was you know somebody cooking these things up and it's
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:29.120]   vitamin e acetate that nobody who's responsible would ever put into a vape cartridge and it took
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:34.640]   months for the cdc to finally acknowledge that announcement it reminded me of what we all heard
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:40.560]   in the 70s or at least what i heard in the 70s that you know lsd stays in your spinal fluid for
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:46.800]   the rest of your life that was debunked after two weeks two weeks in the 70s is the only amount
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:52.400]   of time that that lasted yeah and yet people still believe it today yeah so this was one of those
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:59.040]   irresponsible cdc just kind of well we'll drag our feet and we'll let this sort of become a thing
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.440]   and then it what it was like last week that they finally came out and said oh by the way it was
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:10.800]   probably illicit THC vape cartridges that some moron was using well in fact this is why it bothers
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:15.040]   me that apple took these apps out of the store because one of the things these apps do is identify
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.760]   what the cartridges that you're using and if it's counterfeit there's actually i don't get it potential
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:24.160]   i don't get it took them out what so who wants to defend apple and it's a bigger issue too no it's a
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.880]   bigger issue too because apple's under huge regulatory scrutiny for the app store i mean both in
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:35.840]   terms of what we call it like actual you know eu style department of justice style but also
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.560]   just consumer sentiment in terms of who gets to decide these things and can Elizabeth Warren running
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.720]   on platform shouldn't have their own at least there's just a lot of attention on these things
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:49.600]   now and it seems to me like the last thing apple wants to do you know if vaping was illegal that
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:53.440]   would be one thing that would be a very easy decision so if like the government said suddenly
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.480]   vaping is illegal by all means remove these apps but it i don't as a consumer it's not something
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:04.320]   i want apple deciding especially when we go back to our old discussion about apple apple being
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:09.040]   the only one who puts a store on the iphone it's not like i can leave the google play store and go
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:14.240]   to the amazon store or you know some other or side load apps that that is the place for us and i
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:19.360]   think that that adds extra responsibility to apple and makes makes it unwise i think at the very
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.680]   least for them to do this never mind just vaping apps but to remove categories of apps in general
[01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:34.560]   yeah and plus if we drinking yeah yeah and plus if we if we are in agreement that games and other
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:41.120]   software are a form of creative art and i certainly believe that it is it becomes a little bit problematic
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:47.120]   it really creates a big issue for apple that given that they're the only place where you can
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:55.680]   get content that is non web based app content for the phone to basically say that no you are we are
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:02.400]   we will not allow this creative expression to exist in our universe and it's it's easy to it's
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:09.520]   easy to say no to things that are reprehensible and illegal or even just reprehensible but when
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.160]   remember a few years ago no i think it was like ten years ago there was a game that was a physics
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:21.040]   correct simulation first person shooter of dilly plaza of the assassination of john of kennedy
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.440]   and of course it was all over the news always horrible attorney this this horrible
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:31.600]   tormantic event into a game but the thing is it's i think that it's said okay fine if you really
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.080]   think there was a conspiracy here all the the top the topography is accurate all the physics is
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:42.080]   accurate here is the gun that will perform exactly as oswald's gun performed you tell me that it's
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.840]   impossible to do this from that place with this gun and people were saying actually no it's
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.040]   easiest pie i didn't i got it my on my second or third try and after not never having played this
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:17:00.720]   game before and this is so it will give you sort of it an idea of it was a way to teach people about
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:06.080]   an event in a way that maybe if you're conspiracy oriented no other way would be successful if you
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.880]   think that it's impossible great we will have you try to do this and you will see how easy it is
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.840]   that i've been i've been to the to the museum at the book depository where you get to stand in the
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:21.840]   window that is right next to oswald's uh snipers nest and that it's such a transformative event
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:27.760]   because it's like if you put three golf balls in my hand right now i could hit one of these cars
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:34.320]   driving by easily i don't have a scope i don't have a rifle so but imagine that about that being
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:42.080]   about a political movement imagine that being about a subculture that really wants to be honored
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:48.000]   and respected as any human being should be respected even though society says that they should not be
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:52.880]   heard and they should be erased if possible so imagine they're just being an app store policy
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.600]   i'm not speaking of apelom speak i'm just speaking hypothetically that says well we we don't approve
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:03.040]   apps that are political in nature or that are controversial in nature and essentially because
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:10.000]   of a rule like that you are again taking this this this this culture of our society that needs
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.320]   attention that needs a voice that needs to be heard and you're becoming part of the organization
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:21.120]   that helps them to be silenced erased and eliminated so that's that's why it's just a it's a broad
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:26.160]   problem i know we got into this just by talking about vaping it's which is i've i've never i've
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:31.760]   keep my opinions to myself but when i see people vaping it's like oh that there's so many if you
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.600]   ready to do something silly do something silly and creative don't do something that's just plain
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:41.600]   silly but but but this is the sort of problem that nobody anticipated at apple or outside of apple
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:46.000]   that when you are creating an app store that is simply to of course you have to have apps and you're
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.720]   going to be controlling the app market because you're the person who who defines what developers can do
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.840]   but you wind up being the gatekeeper for society for a whole bunch of different content and a whole
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:02.000]   bunch of different issues it's a huge responsibility and i do not envy them that's it i'm sure they
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.720]   take it they take it very very seriously but it's a very very difficult problem for them to deal with
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:14.480]   so i i don't know if it's related we've we've often been asked to do advertisements for e-sigs
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:22.720]   and uh i've always uh refused we don't do CBD ads either um that's not the same thing though as
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:29.760]   blocking vape apps in the app store or is it uh apple says uh uh we take great care to care
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:34.160]   care to curate the app store as a trusted place for customers particularly youth to download apps
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:39.520]   we're constantly evaluating apps and consulting the latest evidence to determine risks to users
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:45.280]   health and well-being this is from axios enafried uh recently experts ranging from the cdc to the
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.440]   american heart association have attributed a variety of lung injuries and fatalities to
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.240]   e-cigarette and vaping products going so far as to call the spread of these devices a public health
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:20:00.320]   crisis and a youth epidemic we agree and we've updated our app store review guidelines reflect
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:05.680]   that apps encouraging or facilitating the use of these products are not permitted as of today
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:11.040]   these apps are no longer available to download matthew mire's president of the campaign for
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:16.640]   tobacco free kids said the campaign for tobacco free kids applauds apple for taking this important
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:22.000]   step in doing its part to address the youth e-cigarette epidemic does it address the youth
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.960]   e-cigarette epidemic anyway cigarette apps huh i forgot to check do they ban cigarette apps like
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:32.400]   our normal cigarette apps is camel have an app on the app store i don't see any regular cigarette
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:37.760]   apps i would hope not i think alcohol related apps there's alcohol yeah and that's i mean
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:42.240]   i just want some consistency there you're addicted to alcohol and you stop drinking it it will kill
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:48.080]   you like like and that's okay like we can have that that's cool because society
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.600]   thinks that that's okay but apple is going to be our nanny and is going to decide what apps we can
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:21:00.320]   also just question when when they say this is this is we we want to discourage youth from vaping
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:05.360]   that's fine but i don't think this has that effect at all that there's a presence of that maybe it
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:11.040]   does you tell me does the presence of an app on the app store to uh that works with your e-sig to
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.280]   control its temperature or tell you what's in the e-sig does that encourage you to do it i don't think
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:21.600]   so uh it's certainly not going to stop people i honestly think i'll have zero literally not even
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:27.920]   point zero zero one but zero impact on vaping and its use who's going to quit because oh it's not in
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:33.520]   the app store i guess i can't do it leaf leafy and weed maps apps are still in the app store oh really
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:37.200]   so i mean that's just it i mean like there's very few people that have complained about the lock of
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:41.600]   porn on the app store since launch but anything passed that line and you start to like how far
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.360]   can they extend that no cigarette apps no e-sig red apps no drinking apps no cannabis like
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:51.520]   there just needs to be some consistency in some sort of like policy i think and i think you're
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:56.480]   right when you say this is this exposes apple to soparel uh it seems like a good thing it seems
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:00.320]   like everybody would applaud this i'm sure they thought they would when they did it but what it
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.880]   really it does highlight their monopoly in the app store yeah well it's like single ports but
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:09.360]   never let the dictatorship but it's still a dictatorship but if you want to eat a durian in the subway
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:15.040]   you ought to be able to eat a door no maybe not just choose some gum maybe not maybe not
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:21.280]   i think it's different than you declining cbd ads though leo because that's your like this is your
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:25.760]   show i'm not going to endorse them yeah you're not going to endorse it right that's the difference
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   is apple doesn't have to endorse so that but it is an interesting question does something the
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:33.040]   presence of something in the app store does that imply an endorsement from apple because that's
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:39.920]   what they think it's soon it will yeah if they keep doing this for sure yeah and that's the problem
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:45.600]   right like i mean the same thing is true if you manage say forums on your website if you start
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:53.920]   censoring people inconsistently suddenly now you are responsible for what everyone else says
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:59.360]   and you got it's a fine line right you get you have to be very clear about what you're going to do
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:06.080]   otherwise you now own whatever liability comes with what the next person comes and says a well
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:11.120]   hope you serve decision yeah well you serve decision yeah i i think this just
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:17.680]   there's there seems to be a theme running through this episode that uh for first we start talking
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:21.520]   about apple cozying up to trump well why the why are they why would they ever want to coz up to trump
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:26.560]   well because he's passing all kinds of he's making all kinds of rules and making life really really
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:31.120]   hard for companies and as a company they have to get the best get a position that allows them to
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:35.200]   continue to survive and continue to operate okay fair enough well why are they getting into business
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:40.960]   with with Goldman Sachs of all of all organizations well because they really want to get into financial
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:45.680]   services as part of their push their services there's a big big upside financially and for the
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:50.000]   future health of the company for doing that well okay i guess that's okay and then the then at the
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:55.520]   apple decision desk it's like there's a cut there there are vape companies that there are vape apps
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:24:01.920]   on our store that help people use vapes and our help kids uh administrate their vapes and
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.360]   trade and collect their vapes like pokemon i don't know what don't use vapes i don't know
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:10.000]   what apps are like but it's okay well what what is the upside for us having in our store
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.760]   there really isn't one and we kind of hate the way the look the way it makes us look
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:17.760]   we're having these things in the app store yep okay let's get rid of them i i i would totally
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:22.080]   understand that method of thinking again you you still have to criticize them for what you feel
[01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:26.640]   you need to criticize them for on all three of these things that uh that i've mentioned
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.880]   but i do at least see that look there's absolutely no upside for us or and we also don't think there's
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:36.480]   an upside for our customers to have vape apps on the store if we can basically wash at least the
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:42.400]   stink off of the this spot on our upper forearm by by dropping vape apps from the store that's
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:50.160]   one less piece of stink that we have to deal with um apple also my face some trouble in germany where
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:57.280]   there have been moves by a german german parliamentary committee to force them to open up apple pay and
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:08.400]   particularly open up nfc to rival providers it is not yet uh the law um well wait a minute this uh it
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:14.480]   was actually no i'm sorry it is it was added as an amendment to a anti money laundering law that
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:21.520]   was adopted late thursday by the parliament so this will come in effect early next year didn't
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.480]   mention apple specifically but says operators of electronic money infrastructure must offer
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:33.520]   access to rivals for a reasonable fee apple has pretty much locked down nfc for a long time just
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:40.240]   to apple pay now they've opened it up a little bit to nfc tags and so forth um does this change
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:48.800]   should apple open apple pay to other companies on in other countries i have a sliding scale on this
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.480]   stuff like i think initially it's okay for any company you know and all companies tend to keep
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:56.240]   proprietary what makes them money and to open up what makes their competitors money because that's
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:00.400]   that's just good business and i think it's okay for companies to be proprietary in the very beginning
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:04.640]   when you're trying to establish new technologies um and you're trying to there's just a lot of work
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.680]   to get these things going but i think over time the need desire and actual benefit of being
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:14.080]   proprietary evaporates so whether that's five years eight years whatever i think
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:19.360]   i have no problem with any company google microsoft whatever apple doing things that are tightly
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.680]   integrated because that's that's how you push these things out once they're pushed out though i
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:28.000]   think you absolutely have to open them up or else you you as a company also start to suffer yeah
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:34.800]   and they have opened it up you can use ubikis nfc now since the iphone seven you can now uh
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.560]   write and read tags i mean they've opened it up i can understand where apple may not want
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:46.400]   sam san pay to work on an iphone or google pay but from point of view consumers it would be a good
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:51.040]   thing huh it's going to become untenable at a certain point like again that going back to what
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:56.080]   we discussed before just about how the competitive markets work right now like again in the very
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:59.440]   beginning you have to have people have absolute faith in apple payer they're just not going to
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:04.000]   use it and you do that by locking everything down at the hardware channel level but over time
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:08.800]   even america will go contact even america will go contact payment you know that'll be it'll be
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:12.480]   it'll be ubiquitous everywhere and then the requirement for that ubiquity will outweigh
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.960]   the benefits and so i think you know they've started adding every year they've added more to
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.800]   nfc it was read only now you can write very limited things and i think you know next year
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.320]   they'll go to write more and then probably the year after that it'll be much more open that's
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:30.880]   my guess anyway yeah yeah but from your from a trust standpoint if they did say open nfc uh
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:37.680]   wide on day one somebody would take their iphone thinking they were using apple pay bring it near
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:45.840]   a sensor you know a terminal and now suddenly it's offering oh do you want to use samson pay here
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:51.040]   do you want to use google pay here you know they needed to make it simple and then that this is just
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:57.680]   how apple does things right they always start out very conservative with the applications for the
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:05.040]   tech and then once that becomes pretty solid and consistent then they start loosening up the chains
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:09.440]   a little bit and yeah okay you can do these other things now that folks understand now that we
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:14.800]   understand how people are going to use our devices with this technology in it now we can
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:19.280]   start opening up these other avenues here because we know that it's still not going to confuse
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.960]   things too much so uh apple tv plus came out uh november first while i was on vacation and
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:31.760]   have a chance to watch i've been watching since um you'd never you'd never guess what the biggest
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:37.600]   show is on apple tv plus not the morning clarity or yeah popularity not morning show
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:45.760]   not not Dickinson not yes Dickinson how'd you guess that so good it's so good well that was the
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:51.280]   show i thought i will i can i could safely live without watching it's the story of poet emily
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:58.160]   Dickinson as if she's an emo teenager yes but it works all right now i gotta watch it it is
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:04.480]   because like it's for if you want to target like emo teenagers it's either Dickinson or
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:08.320]   Sylvia Plath and you're not going to go for Sylvia Plath yeah the end of the game is not so good
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:12.720]   the thing that i found was so funny is that like disney plus launched too and i love the mandalorian
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:16.560]   like it just keeps getting better and better so good it looks good in the trailer but i don't
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.520]   want to pay another six dollars damn it so here's the thing like no matter what no matter what
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:28.240]   disney plus does it's going to be Star Wars and Disney and um and marvel and if you like
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.400]   prefer DC if you prefer Star Trek like you're never going to get anything but Disney brand
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:38.160]   is stuff apple tv surprised me though and that it is a wide variety of stuff like even the morning
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.400]   show which i didn't have like high expectations for has gotten way better than i ever thought it
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:47.760]   would and that the range of stuff from like uh for all mankind to this to like the coding thing
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:51.920]   for kids there's a greater variety of stuff on apple tv than i would have assumed when he told
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:58.800]   me they were launching it a year ago jeez louise it's not all good but the variety is i watched
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:04.640]   the morning show i've watched four out of the five episodes that have been released so far
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:08.720]   it's you're right it's getting a little better it's not really growing on me it's pretty awful
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:14.320]   um it's not erin's working i think a lot of people wanted it's faux erin's sort and that's what bugs
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:19.200]   me it's like they couldn't get sortin so they got somebody to write it like sortin with the walk
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:25.200]   and talk but it doesn't have the wit it's not sortin it's not sortin you could you know that's the
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:31.920]   problem that's that's the most distracting thing about it i agree you you think oh this is oh not
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:37.680]   quite oh so close but you could but you could say that it absolutely served its purpose
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:41.440]   which is that when they announced that they're doing an entire they're doing their own original
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:48.000]   programming they don't people at that point in the s history of apple tv what apple needed was
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.280]   they look at all of the people that you recognize and have loved in previous tv shows that are going
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:59.520]   to be making tv shows here on apple tv does it and i'm sure they hope that it's a hit but while
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:04.800]   they're having the while they're having the the debriefing on whatever lack of success the show
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:09.280]   might have had they will at least say that okay but it helped us launch this network and it also
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:15.040]   it helped people to come to the network and become fans of this other show of dikensin and other shows
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:20.880]   that we're there we're bringing in so i'm i'm sure that i'm sure that apple will succeed despite
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:25.360]   all this what they what they had to do with those if they had if they had no shows that gained any
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:30.880]   traction whatsoever that would have been horrible i mean did is we everyone's talking about the
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:36.480]   mandalorian that's it and that was something that disney needed great to have that huge library of
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:42.800]   of marvel disney pixar fox everything but then these channels all need to say that the stuff that
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:47.040]   we're going to deliver that we are creating for this channel that you can't get anywhere else and
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:51.200]   you have never seen anywhere else some of this is going to be super high quality stuff that you're
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:56.000]   not going to want to miss out on because the next day everybody is going to be sharing a picture
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:02.080]   from the end of one of the first episodes that makes you see oh damn i wish i had seen that yes
[01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.240]   now i can be talking to my friends about the meaning of this picture that now i have to see
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:11.280]   now i gotta now i gotta subscribe just because i need to see why this picture from this screen
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:15.920]   came into being oh you'll know why you'll know why that picture yeah but the other thing is the
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:22.960]   bit rate for both of them is absolutely stunning like apple tv and disney plus like in 4k HDR
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:26.320]   ridiculously good it makes all the other streaming services look like they were lazy for the last
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:30.400]   couple of years oh that's good that's a good reason to get it i guess i'm gonna have to get apple
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:35.840]   tv i mean i got apple tv plus that's free i guess and jennifer aniston like uses adult language in
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:39.120]   a way that i don't think anybody ever assumed an apple program would use so like right out the
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:43.680]   gate between that and and jason mamala they have dispelled any concern that apple would actually
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:50.320]   that kind of bothers me there are so many f-bombs in the morning show i feel like eddie q pulled the
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.560]   showrunner aside and said put some more f-bombs and we don't want them to think we're uh where you
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:33:01.680]   know weak sauce it felt like it was overdoing it yeah i mean it's the first dot the first line
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:06.320]   yeah it has an f-bomb and and by the way for all mankind they throw an f-bomb in there's only one
[01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:11.040]   but they throw it in early on and i think it's kind of i feel like it's apple although apparently
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.640]   isn't realistic i work with a bunch of people who work in those situations and they say that's just
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:18.480]   how they tell i've been in a tv control room it's it's worse it's far worse
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.320]   but so it is realistic you want someone to think about the uh the mr roger roger's movie isn't rated
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:33.440]   g it's rated p g and that got as soon as i noticed that i was like wow does that what did they actually
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:38.720]   throw in like one s word in there just to make sure that wasn't like lumped in with kitty fair
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:46.720]   yeah that's a good point um so all right your picks uh i will watch emily dickinson
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:54.080]   other picks from mapple tv plus is the gumblem show good i haven't seen it his oprah's show good
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:58.640]   and kind is good i actually like for all mankind i've been kind of engrossed in that i i thought i
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.200]   would hate it because damn it we landed on the moon first but it's actually i like it's an
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:08.720]   interesting i love waiting you you you get me as soon as you as soon as you have as an episode title
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:15.040]   like Apollo 18 Apollo 19 oh let's find let's find out what happened when they get the long range rover
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:19.520]   and they're able to do like the the overnight encampment like up to up to eight miles away from
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:25.520]   the landing site like and then what happens they get to do geological surveys eight miles away from
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:34.240]   the landing site okay it is for people like you and me and he who are nasa buffs who recognize like
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:40.080]   all the little there's all sorts of little you know easter eggs in there of real life nasa stuff
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:46.080]   give me k-missions i want my k-missions yeah it's pretty cool all right any other uh anything else
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.720]   that do you guys so and i guess i have to get disney plus i have a variety of i'm going to
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:57.200]   mispronounce his last name chamelon chamelon yeah chamelon the the trailer for his show looks so
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.280]   creepy i don't know how it's not going to be a movie but it looks so disturbing and creepy that
[01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:07.840]   i'm very interested yeah me too i love him well you see the trailer lio yeah it looks good it's not
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:15.120]   out for it's not out yet it's what it's a couple of weeks yeah yeah all right freak me out a little
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:22.640]   bit so i think so that by the way the numbers on uh Dickinson came from um not from apple obviously
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:28.240]   they're not telling anybody how they're doing uh from uh a research let me let me get the business
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:36.000]   insider article like typed it wrong here uh the people who do uh this kind of analysis uh their
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.560]   name would be i just want to get parrot analytics they also do uh app analytics but they have a list
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:48.320]   of the top ten most in-demand original streaming shows they do it by measuring something called
[01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:53.920]   demand expressions which is the company's globally standardized tv demand measurement unit that
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:57.440]   reflects the desire engagement and viewership weighted by importance so i don't know it's not
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:03.280]   really ratings dickinson the only apple tv plus show in the top ten for the week of number six to the
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:12.480]   12th yeah it's a lot of fun yeah so uh for all mankind was leading uh until two days before launch
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.840]   i don't know how they know that so clearly they're counting things besides streams but dickinson
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:24.400]   surged since it premiered accounting tweets you know they you know i hate to say it but that's
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.280]   what it sure sounds like doesn't it yeah how do you if you're if you're an agent for either the
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.640]   creators or the stars and uh writers of these series how do you enter into regan negotiation
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   without the numbers to back it up saying this is for your most popular this isn't the most
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:43.600]   popular series and therefore we gave you kind of a deal on the first season but we're gonna have to
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:47.920]   ask for a serious bump but without the numbers to say and here's here's how much you will suffer
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:52.800]   if we take our stars elsewhere it's i wish i knew how that business worked because it might have
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:57.840]   something actually like they're already shooting season two of morning show three hundred million
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:03.440]   dollars for season one and mandolorian i'm so excited laurie clio so i have it so i only saw
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:08.800]   the trailer it's worth it it's worth six ninety nine months i don't i don't want to i don't want to
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:13.440]   spoil anything for you but i'll just say lone wolf and cub and that's all you need to know lone wolf
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:19.840]   and so good also all i need to know is warner hair tzok yeah and he in the same page and nick nolte
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:26.960]   nick nolte oh you had me as nolte okay let me take a break and then we're gonna get picks and if you
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:33.200]   guys would help me out here what i should what by the first things i should do install set on my new
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:42.000]   macbook pro last pass obviously well that's not even a question yeah well frankly i have to otherwise
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.520]   i can't get anything else i don't know my passwords i showed it last pass is a sponsor we should mention
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:53.920]   i showed they brought to you by fresh books the another sponsor the number one all in one small
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:58.000]   business invoicing and accounting solution it makes running your business a breeze and i say that
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:02.640]   with actual firsthand knowledge because i used fresh books practically when they first started
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:08.800]   i was going up to canada and i was bemoaning the job of invoicing and mr mccarther told me oh
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:13.920]   there's this new company in toronto you got to try it and boy was she right it starts with the invoices
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:18.880]   you can completely automate the invoices and as a result of putting your expenses either in the
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.200]   invoices or into the app putting the invoices in you kind of know how you're doing you can know
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:29.120]   at a glance which invoices are outstanding who's overdue you can automatically send reminders
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.480]   to those overdue people the invoices are beautiful of course they're completely customizable you can
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:39.360]   have your logo on them they could change the color fonts and more uh but what's one of the great
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:44.400]   things for me that made a big difference uh was i could accept payments through the invoice you
[01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:52.400]   can now accept credit cards and that means you get paid on average like a lot faster twice as fast
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:58.160]   uh it also handles multiple languages and multiple currencies that was also important i had
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:03.040]   invoicing canadian dollars it did it all for me if you if you keep track of hours you can build for
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.680]   tracked hours you can have different uh hourly rates for different projects even for the same
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:13.680]   client you can track time against client or project or more you can organize your expenses no more
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:18.640]   you know store and receipts in a shoe box you just take a picture of them with the fresh books app
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.520]   it goes right into the fresh books app into the invoice if you're if you're billing for expenses
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:31.280]   it does all the tax categorization for you you'll stay on budget with an easy to read summary of
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:36.080]   your spending and the thing it was so huge for me you'll know whether you're making money or not
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:40.480]   one of us small business owners don't really even know until tax time you'll know every day because
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:46.080]   fresh books tells you the fresh books mobile app is great it's a great way to share with a team
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:52.880]   management duties uh communication duties and if you ever have a question about fresh books they've
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:57.520]   got the best customer service those nice people that i knew way back when in toronto they're still
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:02.240]   there and they'll answer your phone calls your emails they even have a live chat so look here's a
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:08.960]   good time to end 2019 on a high note hit the ground running in 2020 your tax accountant will thank
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:14.560]   you and if you're doing your own taxes you will thank you with fresh books go to freshbooks.com/macbreak

[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:28.160]   dot com slash mac break thank you fresh books for saving my life all right dave hamilton pick
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:37.280]   of the week sir uh well you asked for advice for your macbook yes oh yes and so for the love of all
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:44.240]   that is good and pure yes open up system preferences yes general yes and such
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:50.000]   show scroll bars to always because they need to be oh that's interesting
[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:54.320]   yes because it's this weird thing where there's sometimes there and sometimes not
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:41:00.640]   drives you baddie yeah i don't want to be bad i don't want to be baddie no okay so there and
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:06.080]   you do that so i'm doing that that is a very good bit of advice are you a dark mode or light mode
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:15.200]   or an auto mode um on my desktop machine i am a light mode person and on my laptop i let it switch
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:21.760]   auto okay so that makes sense because you're going around places and stuff yeah exactly i always
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:27.760]   turn on file vault it's interesting with a lot of the t2 devices i thought file vault was on by default
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:32.640]   on this one i had the choice of course the boxes were checked but i always turn on that full
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:38.640]   description anytime you have an ssd you should because it's uh harder to erase in fact almost
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:44.560]   impossible to fully erase an ssd so i've turned that with the t2 chip it just happens immediately
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.760]   yeah because the drive is already encrypted no matter whether that's on or off it's just whether
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:57.600]   the key is encrypted for you or just for the t2 chip very interesting that's why it happens so
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:05.280]   quickly right right anything else you want to tell me to do uh well one of my favorite apps is uh
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:11.040]   quitter you mentioned marco arment yes early or in the episode he provides this app called quitter
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:18.080]   for free you put it it lives in your menu bar that's where you configure it and it watches how often
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:25.840]   you or how recently you have used any given app so it's not about how long your system has been
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:32.240]   idle it's about how long any given app has been idle and then you can have it quit after 30 minutes
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:35.520]   10 minutes yeah because i often will find i still got something running in the background there
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.600]   that i forgot to turn off yeah like quick time player something that you know you forget to
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:46.960]   quit or yeah i find i use it for safari because safari choose up so much ram so i have safari set
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.840]   to quit after 120 minutes which means that when i come back to my desk in the morning it's not
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:58.480]   his wish fresh fresh fresh every day so quitter there's my uh my pick of the week uh because this
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:03.040]   has a touch bar i'm gonna put better touch tool on here right away because i just hate smart i
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:09.600]   hate the touch bar but at least it can do something useful if i put better touch tool play doom
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:17.920]   uh yeah i could play doom yeah something some useful um and the inaco what do you suggest
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:26.240]   uh i'm just gonna suggest downy the video downloader app by charlie minro okay because not not because
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:32.240]   it'll take advantage of the amazing power and sophistication of the 2019 16-inch macbook but because
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:40.160]   it's i'm reminded of every single day how much great abandoned content is up on youtube and up
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:49.040]   on daily motion and other sites that doesn't deserve to die and it's i'm sure that this 1981
[01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:56.640]   documentary based on a production of the taming of the shrew starring raul julia and maril street i'm
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:02.240]   sure it has not lapsed into copyright just uh lapsed into public domain just yet but it's brilliant
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:07.440]   and i never heard of it until i saw a pbs the documentary about raul raul julia and somebody took
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:13.200]   a library copy that was made for schools and put it up on youtube in two parts and i know that if i
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:18.320]   just simply bookmark it if i plan to watch it in two or three days someone will do a copyright
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:23.920]   strike it'll go away and but if you have it on if you get downy if it's a streaming site no
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:29.280]   matter what it is you can probably download it'll find the original mp4 file that's streaming from
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:35.200]   and download it and also it's good for i'm going to be on an Amtrak train for three or four hours i want
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.880]   to watch the i want to watch the latest four episodes of project banky or techmoan or whatever and so
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:46.160]   i'm just going to download this stuff so i don't have to chew up my net my uh my uh my uh my mobile
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:51.280]   wifi so it's and it's it's just such a really great piece of software all you do is you paste in a
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:56.720]   url uh and it will just simply figure it all out from there the worst that can possibly happen
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:02.400]   is that if it's like a site that requires a login first like if you if you have access to the bbc
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:06.720]   but you might have to log in to and show you credentials first but then as soon as you were logged in
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.040]   then we'll find the file and download it for you we'll do conversion if it's in web m and you want
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:15.280]   to be it wanted to be an mp4 format it'll convert to mp4 format whatever you want if you just want
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:20.240]   to strip out the audio so you can listen to uh like a live stream there was a live stream that
[01:45:20.240 --> 01:45:24.320]   lasted for two hours just a conversation between two people that you really really uh two creators
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:28.560]   you really really like and you just want to listen to it while you work out great it'll just get
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:34.080]   turned into an audio file for you uh 20 but it works for free and then if you want to keep it it's
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:39.120]   like 20 bucks and i've never it's one of those things where you really feel excited about putting
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:44.240]   20 dollars into into a developer's pocket because they built something that works really really
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:48.480]   great there are a lot of tools that kind of slap at this problem where there are tricks and
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:54.000]   techniques and special trick URLs you can use this is one one and done you install this app
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.840]   you got it if it's possible to download this from a streaming site you can download it from
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:03.120]   a streaming site with this tool nice you also had a hardware pick don't want to interrupt that
[01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:07.840]   oh just a just a quick one after i after i posted about my experience my pains of the
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:12.720]   new 16 inch backbook keyboard people were asking what mac keyboards do you like
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:19.440]   key recommend and my you my standard go-to recommendation is still uh the logitech k811
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:25.440]   a multi switch keyboard because this key the key switches are brilliant it's very very easy
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:29.120]   to transition from working on your laptop to working on your desktop because
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:34.560]   they're meaty really beautifully feeling switches but they're not like full clicky switches so they
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:40.080]   don't really throw you also you can pair to you can switch between uh three different pair devices
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:46.560]   at the same time so i have right right now i've got the setup to it's paired with my uh with my mac
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.600]   mini uh in the office it's also paired to my ipad and it's also paired to my phone and i have to
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:56.320]   switch between the three at any time you i just hit one of these three switches that uh that
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:00.240]   switch is the pairing to another device and you can do that on the fly i've done things where
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:05.680]   someone is texting me and i just simply like hit the f2 key and now i'm now i'm keyboarding into
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:10.480]   uh my phone's messaging app uh and it's not terribly expensive it's but less than a hundred
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:15.120]   dollars you can usually get for about 80 and i actually have a couple of these i have one that is
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:19.280]   that stays in the office and i've won that within a travel case that if i'm going to be out of the house
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.840]   uh for more than a couple of days and i've got a lot of writing to do i usually throw this in the
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:28.640]   throw this in the bag even if i do have my regular laptop with me uh and the other recommendation is
[01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:35.280]   definitely check out a mechanical keyboard this is my standard this is this is the one that's attached
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:41.680]   to like my my big desktop this is the WASD code keyboard they no longer make it but they have big
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:46.240]   keyboards just like it yeah that's the one i use i have two of them i love yeah and of course it
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:51.680]   makes these beautiful loud noises but it's if i there are times where i really do have to get through
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:57.200]   many thousands of words in a single day and what it really is wake up at eight turn on the
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:02.480]   writing machine at eight thirty and then realize that eight pm that you're still writing and you
[01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:06.960]   haven't actually eaten yet this is the sort of keyboard that i'm using all day long because
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:12.720]   they're super comfortable it's also super customizable you can choose what kind of switches you want
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.560]   uh what kind of feel how loud they are how much bounce they have they are they'll actually send
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:21.040]   you like a little Whitman sampler kit of like four different keys i've got that but i know it's
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:27.440]   so funny so you know cherry red versus cherry brown yeah and i want and i've sent a set of like
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:32.000]   different like uh different rubber rings just a set of dampening effect then you can basically mix
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:38.720]   mix and match and say okay great give me the 88 key style keyboard with cherry cherry brown switches
[01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:43.520]   and i also want the function keys to be gray i want most of the keys to be black but i do
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:50.320]   want the command keys to be red and i also want the pokemon logo uh gym logo to be on the space bar
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:56.160]   they can really customize it any way you want and because this really is this is the steering wheel
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:02.880]   of your life when you use a computer and so this is an opportunity to get exactly what you want the
[01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:07.840]   layout you want the size you want the colors you want the feel you want and if you are spending
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:14.400]   lots of days doing this if you're touching this every single moment of your of your working day
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.320]   you may as well be touching something that is exactly the way you want it to feel and the way
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:23.040]   you want it to work and so it's not they're not cheap i think they they start like 150 they go up
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.120]   to like 200 and a little bit more but i never regretted spending a couple hundred bucks for this
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:32.160]   keyboard because i've i've been using it for now for seven years or something still working strong
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.680]   now it's now the key caps are a little bit polished but i can always buy new key caps
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:40.720]   and keep customizing it so that's very nice very nice thank you Andrew
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:47.760]   Renee Richie any thoughts about i'm going to you're gonna install anything that i recommend
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:51.920]   anyway like bb edit all the basics i know you're all covered but i am going to recommend is once
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:59.920]   you get used to the speed of these laptops you are not going to go back so this is samson's x5 drive
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:05.520]   i have it i bought it when you recommended it before i got the two terabyte and use your
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:10.240]   favorite your favorite duper or cloner or whatever software i use super duper just because
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:16.560]   it's a dev nay and is is an amazing individual and makes brilliant software but once once your
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.120]   clones and your drive is working as fast as the internal computer it's like being velocetized on
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:26.480]   a highway you never have to get off at the exit you are always going 120 miles an hour really it's
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:31.360]   just such a better experience yes a t it's a thunderbolt three external drive bus powered so
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:37.440]   you don't have to plug it in i got it's expensive i you know it's not cheap i got this it's on sale
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:43.040]   round about these couple weeks Leo oh i forgot i paid for it yeah darn it i forgot it's black
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:47.200]   friday's coming up i should get a second one i got the two i got the two terabyte november
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.800]   yeah it was well but even so it was 1400 when i bought it it was down to 700 all year and i
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:56.400]   think it's probably going to go lower over the next couple weeks so keep an eye open i should
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:51:01.760]   yeah i should have a second one just in case speaking of black friday let's give the ritualistic
