[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.920]   And Alex Lindsey is on assignment.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.080]   I don't know what that means.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.440]   He's just not here.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.840]   He's on assignment.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.040]   Do we know where he is?
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.040]   No.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.680]   With that China somewhere.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.080]   We don't know.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.000]   Fortunately, we have a beautiful cast,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.800]   a stunning stellar cast of fine people to replace Mr. Lindsey,
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.720]   including, let's say, hello to Adam Christensen of the Maccast.
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.560]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.480]   Good to see you, Adam.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.240]   Long time, Mac, podcaster.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.000]   I've been doing it for a little while.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.160]   When did you start with Maccast?
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.440]   It was December 2004.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.800]   Yikes.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.200]   You beat us all.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.880]   Older than this show, that's for sure.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.720]   Well, it's nice to have you.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.120]   Thank you for being here, Adam.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.600]   Thank you.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.200]   Also joining us from the UK, Mr. Don McAllister.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.320]   Hey, Don.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.560]   Good to see you again.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.320]   You're good to me.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.760]   Good to be here.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.640]   He's looking more and more elaborate all the time.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.200]   Are there more wires than before?
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.160]   No, not really.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.400]   No, just had a-- I think I've just
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.200]   repositioned the camera, says it's not a different.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.960]   I'm glad we can see.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.200]   We can see.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.960]   We can only look in.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.600]   But I like to keep things fresh and I keep moving.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.200]   You're doing the Andy and Adko thing.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.520]   He's always messing with his studio.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.560]   Ah, right.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560]   Oh, well.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.360]   So it keeps me amused.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.080]   And right now, Andy and Adko is changing his backdrop,
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.760]   even as we speak.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.800]   But I've jumped in to catch him in the act.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.200]   Hello, Andy.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.520]   Actually, I thought I'd go to a 350 spot.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.040]   I'm using a pinhole for my hair light.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.960]   And I'm just not--
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.720]   I'm not getting real of the diamondism.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.440]   The separation would be background for around.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.880]   But we'll get there.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.280]   You need a go-bo.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   Exactly.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.120]   Don't be so thrifty.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.520]   It's a 750.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.240]   You should see--
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.160]   And so I could-- you get the modeled one
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.600]   that you can use in the adventure movie.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.600]   So I say--
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.040]   Sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.440]   I'm here in the Amazon rainforest.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.680]   I hope the havoto tribe doesn't see me
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.800]   because I've just stolen their--
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.880]   I've just stolen their golden idol.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.440]   They painted it blue so you wouldn't know it was gold underneath.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.240]   You can see the cultural influence
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.120]   of the havoto is upon Western society.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   Now, it's a subtle thing.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.000]   But it's there if you've got tenure
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.280]   and you're paid to look for these things.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.520]   Shh.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.960]   They always have the same animal sounds in those movies.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.200]   It's like one animal ever.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.800]   It's always the same.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.080]   So they bought the licensing form.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.080]   Exactly.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.160]   Hey, here's an unprecedented precedent.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.840]   Apple puts out a press release about what they're
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.680]   going to talk about next week.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.440]   Holy cow.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.240]   I'm getting something unannounced as well,
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.040]   not just something we were expecting, actually,
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.800]   something brand new.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.200]   The iCloud has actually been written on paper
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.400]   and they've announced it.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.000]   They said the i-word, yeah.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.440]   And they said Steve Jobs will be hosting.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.560]   In the press release.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.800]   Yeah, not that big a surprise, I don't think.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.680]   Because Steve does tend to make his appearance at these big events,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.400]   doesn't he really?
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.960]   This is now the one speech of the year
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.280]   that Apple schedules on its schedule, right?
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.840]   I can't think of anything else they do.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.800]   Now, well, another kind of three going on,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.920]   but there's only one that's presented as a formal.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.680]   We cannot possibly delay this.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.280]   We have to do this because there are about 5,000 people
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.640]   coming to hear us talk about things that are under NDA.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.960]   So we may as well, before we--
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.760]   before-- I think we would debt to all the developers who
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.840]   are spending money to attend the developer conference under NDA
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.120]   because I think Apple knows that by the time they start
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.280]   the sessions that all the developers are not
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.280]   supposed to talk about, they've signed agreement
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.920]   saying that this is being--
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.640]   this is advanced information we're given to you under NDA.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.520]   They know that the soonest-- that people
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.720]   can be live blogging it as soon as those words come out.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.120]   So they may as well precede the NDA stuff with an open one
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.200]   so that they can at least control the message a little bit.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.240]   But yeah, June is the only time when
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.840]   you know that Apple's going to have to deal at least some
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.520]   of their cards.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.040]   And so it's I think it's taking place
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   at the January Macworld Expo keynote
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.160]   that they stopped during years ago.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.760]   Steve Jobs, and quoting the Apple press release,
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.120]   Steve Jobs and a team of Apple executives
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.080]   will kick off the company's annual worldwide developers
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.760]   conference, WWDC, with a keynote address Monday, June 6, 10 a.m.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   We didn't even know what time it was until this press release.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.560]   That's right.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.520]   But they've lifted the kimono and they've kind of done
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.240]   the hoochie-koochie, not just merely a peek.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.000]   We're getting to see you a lot.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.440]   Wow!
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.400]   At the keynote, Apple will unveil its next generation software,
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:41.040]   Lion, the eighth major release of Mac OS X, iOS 5,
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.480]   the next version of Apple's advanced mobile operating
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.960]   system, which powers iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.920]   And iCloud, Apple's upcoming cloud services offering.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.560]   This is the first time they've uttered the iCloud word, right?
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.040]   Definitely.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.800]   What is iCloud, Adam Christensen?
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.520]   I think it's tools with an identity crisis, right?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.920]   Is it the music service?
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.360]   I think it's going to be a lot of stuff.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.400]   I'm looking really forward to seeing what Apple comes up with.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.160]   I mean, we've been hearing lots of rumors about the iTunes
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.960]   locker iCloud stuff.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.920]   I'm hoping they're going to show us more than we're
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.240]   hearing about in the rumors thing.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.560]   But yeah, I think a revamping of a mobile me, obviously,
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.680]   another rebranding, which is a bit strange.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.160]   But OK.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.360]   And then hopefully this locker service.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.840]   All the reports from the journal on down last week
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.720]   were that Apple has made a deal with at least three
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.120]   of the four major record labels.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.960]   And that's something Google and Amazon neglected or decided
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.120]   not to do.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.200]   So the presumption is that Apple will have something over
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.720]   Amazon's cloud music service and Google's music service.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.280]   Perhaps-- and I love this idea--
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.280]   a software tool or maybe just built in the iTunes,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.680]   it scans your library and says, I know what you've got.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.760]   So I'll put high quality copies of it on the iCloud.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.920]   You don't have to spend the time uploading.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.320]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.200]   They just let me redownload my purchase music from iTunes.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.760]   Even that would be something.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.800]   I've been wanting to be there for you.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.960]   Just watch.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.880]   That's the thing they won't let you do.
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.000]   Right.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.760]   So you're weak and have in the cloud, but you can't download it.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.640]   Don't say that.
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.320]   It's not up to Apple as we know.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.920]   It's always up to the music industry.
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.760]   But Apple's always been the only company that could really
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.240]   arm twist the music industry to any real extent.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.120]   What I'm really curious to see is assuming
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.800]   that everyone here agrees that it's going to be--
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.400]   you're going to be able to get access to music
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.640]   without physically having to re-upload it as long as they
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.840]   know that you actually have it.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.360]   But my curiosity is going to be I've
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.880]   got thousands and thousands and thousands of tracks
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.720]   that I ripped originally from CD.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.120]   As did Apple successfully get all these companies to say, look,
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.680]   can we just say that if Andy has a Beastie Boy's album
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.480]   and his music library already, we can just
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.800]   trust that he got it legally?
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.840]   Are we going to force him to produce the physical CD
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.440]   to activate his ability to stream that music back
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:11.320]   to his devices?
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.160]   I don't see the record label saying yes to that.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.240]   Because what they're really afraid of is that you
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.600]   napsored it, that you didn't buy it.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.000]   And we've already heard hints that they will take whatever
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.960]   quality you have and replace it with a high quality rip of it.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.280]   If you napsored it, not down your hard drive, but on the cloud,
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.080]   they'll put a high quality version of it.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   I don't know.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.440]   I think the whole emphasis changed now.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.360]   I think Apple are now the darling of the music industry.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   I think the term from being the bad boys who
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.600]   did the music industry over, although they actually
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.960]   rescued the music industry.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.440]   I think the music industry hasn't liked Apple for a while.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.920]   But now the Google and Amazon have sort of gone behind their back
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.040]   and started up this music locker service without approaching
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.880]   the music industry, or perhaps they did and were
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.000]   rebuffed or whatever.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.320]   But I think Apple now have changed the whole perception
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.600]   within the music industry's eyes.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.240]   They're sort of like the people who are working with them now,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.760]   rather than working against them.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.160]   So that's done a lot of--
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.280]   I'm sure there's been a lot of leverage that Apple have
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.160]   been able to do in the past-- even the past weeks,
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.240]   once these Google and Amazon have come through with their services.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.600]   Can you imagine the whiplash we're seeing in the music industry?
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.240]   First we love them.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.720]   Now we hate them.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.200]   Now we love them.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.160]   Now we hate them.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.120]   They can't make up their mind.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:22.880]   But I think you're right.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.760]   I think Apple, because they, of all of the three,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.520]   were the only ones to say, here have some money, presumably.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.800]   They are now the best.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.840]   But I have to think.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.080]   I don't know.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.160]   I'm assuming the worst.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.720]   I'm just assuming that it's going to only allow you to store
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.000]   stuff in the iCloud that you purchased on iTunes.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.680]   And it will look at that Earth Wind and Fire thing
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.480]   that you ripped two years ago and say, no, I don't know
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.480]   if you own that or not.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.360]   How could you prove you own that?
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.320]   That's what previous attempts do the service--
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.800]   And the three dot com.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.960]   Right.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.880]   And even then, it really wasn't very useful.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.240]   It would like to do that so long as you get at some point
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.040]   produced the physical CDs, the proof that you have ownership
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.440]   of it.
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.720]   And I'm one of the few people who, after he ripped his entire
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.160]   library, didn't sell off the CDs.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.280]   I actually have them cartons and stores someplace.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.440]   But you know what?
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.240]   If you're forcing me to essentially reinsert 800, 900,
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.360]   1,000 CDs, I bet that I can torrent these a lot faster.
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.760]   It's just not for my time.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   And we don't forget.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.440]   What was that study that someone did a while ago now,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.040]   saying that to actually--
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.240]   most people's music collection within iTunes is like one or two
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.320]   percent is actually music they've actually bought from the
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:41.880]   iTunes store.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.400]   The rest is stuff that they ripped just
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.680]   mentally from CDs.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.040]   So it's only allow those items that you've bought from the
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.880]   music store into the cloud.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.080]   I don't think that's going to work because no one will have
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.280]   anything in there.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:53.600]   Right.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.760]   Well, first of all, why would Apple care about that?
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.560]   Because that's just cost them money to have storage.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.960]   The record industry isn't going to encourage any kind of
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.320]   piracy or any kind of legitimization of pirated music.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.240]   And Apple's going to want to sell more music.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   So it seems to me that everybody except us--
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.320]   of course, we're always the ones that nobody cares about.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.160]   But everybody except the users or listeners win if Apple
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.560]   says, no, you had to purchase it from iTunes.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.720]   Well, that's a step too far.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.280]   You don't think they'll do that?
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.320]   I don't think so either.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.160]   OK, so Andy and Don both agree that next week, when iCloud
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.800]   is announced, it will use iTunes and look at your music
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.880]   collection no matter where you got that song, it'll make a
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.360]   copy of that song on the cloud for you.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.160]   I don't agree with that.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:49.920]   What I believe is that at minimum, you will be able to make
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.360]   songs you already have on your drive accessible to this
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.320]   cloud service.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.640]   Whether or not Apple decides to help you out by saying,
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.320]   oh, I've heard of this B.C. boys album.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.720]   I have this in the iTunes library.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.480]   So I'm not going to force you to re-upload it into the cloud.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.840]   We're just going to assume that we're just going to stream
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.880]   it directly from our own server.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.640]   But for Apple to simply say that the music component of iCloud,
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.800]   remember, we're talking about a service that is probably going
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.480]   to have at least six different parts to it.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.960]   The music component only works with tracks available on iTunes
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.880]   that you have actually purchased from iTunes.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.520]   That's the first 3,000 words anybody is going to write about
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.280]   this.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.600]   Well, that's true.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.400]   Adam, you agree?
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.760]   You think I'm the one who's saying that Apple's going to
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.160]   you do the most conservative draconian thing.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.080]   It's restrictive.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.240]   Yeah, no, I think I'm looking at it like they've already got
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.960]   these deals with the subscription services.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.720]   The question to me is will they allow you to download that
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:48.960]   stuff?
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.960]   And I don't think so.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.160]   I think you'll be able to re-download the stuff you bought
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.240]   through iTunes.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.600]   But--
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.760]   But you'll be able to stream anything that you have.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.160]   Stream anything that you have in there.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.400]   And there's going to be a fee associated with that, right?
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.520]   So I think you're going to have to-- it's going to either be
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.880]   bundled as part of your mobile me or iCloud, your loose
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.200]   subscription, or hopefully they'll even offer an option just
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.080]   for the music part for people to opt into for the streaming
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.960]   stuff.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.480]   And then that's how they pay the royalties back to the record
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:15.760]   labels.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.200]   And at that point, the record labels are already doing that
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.600]   kind of stuff with their entire music library.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.800]   Here, it's even more restricted because it's going to be what
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.960]   you have in your library.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.480]   And yeah, you could go out and get tracks some other way.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.840]   But at least the music industry is going to be getting some
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.920]   revenue for that.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.920]   Whereas without that, they're not getting any revenue.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.400]   Good point.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.440]   So it's a blanket amnesty in effect.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.160]   The music industry says, all right, reset.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.400]   Whatever you got, wherever you got it, as long as you continue
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.280]   to pay the $10 a month or whatever this iCloud service
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.600]   costs, we will allow you to stream high quality versions of
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:48.600]   it.
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   But as if you bought it--
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.400]   You're now licensing the stuff you took.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.200]   Yeah, because in effect, we're getting some pennies back for
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.520]   it.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.360]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   As long as they get something for it, it's kind of a blanket
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.920]   amnesty.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.520]   And they're saying, and now going forward, you damn well
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.320]   better buy everything.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.480]   Pirates, yo.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.480]   I don't know.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.920]   That'd be a big turnabout.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.400]   I mean, that'd be a big thing, I think.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:10.920]   Doesn't it?
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.520]   Now, here-- OK, I'm trying to think like a record
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.240]   executive.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.320]   But here's the problem.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.800]   Here's the problem.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.520]   I could see some guy going under BitTorrent
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.440]   there to get in a low quality copy.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.360]   A bad rip of some CD that I'm trying to sell.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.840]   They put it on their computer there, and they run iTunes.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.280]   And now I'm giving them a 320 kilobits AAC version of that
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.680]   song.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.360]   Perfectly good for free.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.360]   Yeah, I don't think it's--
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.080]   But what if she--
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.360]   That kind of be streaming no matter what they get?
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.360]   Yeah, me, heads.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.720]   I'm going to be a--
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.160]   Well, and I don't think the streams are going to be
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.640]   higher quality, right?
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.320]   You don't think they'll be higher quality, because that's
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.800]   the rumor.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.000]   You think it'll be a 320 kilobits stream?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.560]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.520]   No, look, the whole point is Apple has one copy of every--
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.960]   OK, Saturday night, Earth, Wind, and Fire, they got one
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.640]   copy.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.800]   And if you show that you had a copy on your hard drive,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.160]   that's the copy they're going to give you.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.160]   What are they going to do, Mike?
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.040]   I'll make it 128MB3.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.960]   No, they're going to make it something good.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.760]   256, what is it they sell?
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.360]   256 AAC, right?
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.040]   Right, right.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.600]   I would be surprised if they'll let you read download stuff
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.160]   that you did by download.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.440]   So it's going to be a snow stream.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.640]   Only stream it.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.160]   Right.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.400]   I mean, I don't think it's too much to feel like that.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.440]   It's like-- but Spotify's losing money,
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.480]   and I don't know how long Spotify's going to be in business.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.800]   They keep changing their rules.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.320]   Now they're working with Facebook.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.280]   It's clear Spotify's struggling.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.440]   It's a great service.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.160]   It's fantastic.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.280]   It's a great service for everybody, but the artist.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.800]   And that's the problem, right?
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.000]   OK, I think this makes sense.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Now, you've won me over, guys.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.280]   So here's what we think.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.040]   And by the way, iCloud will be more than music,
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.440]   but we'll talk about it in a second.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.560]   But the music portion of iCloud, when you run iTunes,
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.480]   iTunes will say you have all this in your library,
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.080]   those songs, 256 kilobit AAC versions of those songs
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.000]   will be available for streaming only.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.360]   I don't think you're going to be able to read download music,
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.480]   but maybe-- OK, maybe you will be able to read download music
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.600]   that you've purchased in the past.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.680]   You will certainly be able to download music as you purchase it.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.000]   You will have to pay a fee, probably a monthly fee,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.520]   just like a subscription.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.320]   And that's where you win me over, because it's
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.800]   like Rhapsody or Mogg or RDO.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.360]   You're paying-- it probably won't be--
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.560]   will it be 10-- how much will it be?
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:28.960]   10 bucks a month?
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.320]   I'm hoping they roll it into the mobile me subscription.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.520]   So I hope that stays at $99 a year,
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.320]   and you just get it as part of that service.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.760]   You agree, Andy?
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.560]   Yeah, I would-- I see this as an annual subscription
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.480]   sort of thing.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.240]   I'm not sure if they would do it as a monthly,
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.000]   because I think they want to show off that there's value
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.520]   in here.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.040]   And also, I think they want to sort of distance themselves
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.240]   from the idea that this is sort of like Netflix, where
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.040]   this is something that you're buying.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.640]   You're buying added and finite.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.920]   I think it's more like, we're going
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.120]   to give you a year's worth of service
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.480]   that you're going to really, really like.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.880]   I think they're going to get their money upfront.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.160]   100 bucks?
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.360]   Ah, $99.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.720]   It's-- it's--
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.680]   99, but I think closer to 79.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.800]   You can get on Amazon for 79 now, so--
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.240]   The thing that really makes it interesting
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.880]   is that there-- that two other companies have really--
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.480]   the big trifecta of huge companies that can actually
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.560]   make things happen.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.800]   And let's-- when I'm leaving Microsoft out of this intentionally,
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.960]   have already gotten into it.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.480]   And so that very much they know that their service is
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   going to be compared probably favorably
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.240]   to how well Amazon does it and how well Google does it.
[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:39.840]   And Amazon right now gives you free access to their cloud
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.920]   service as long as you're buying stuff through their stores.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.280]   That's factor number one.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.840]   Google is doing a service that is right now in beta,
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.960]   so almost doesn't count.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.400]   But for now, they're saying that you
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.520]   can put 20,000 songs up online without any access fees.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.240]   But remember that neither of these companies
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.160]   have to pay royalties for whatever--
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.320]   whatever sort of things are along their users to do.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.960]   So it's definitely going to be a pay service.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.680]   And it's definitely going to be more expensive than a lot
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.200]   of people are going to be happy with,
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.560]   which is people are expecting it to be free free.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.040]   Whether or not really it's going to be a separate service,
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.240]   I mean, I think iCloud itself is going to be much more
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.800]   than music.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.720]   And we still don't know what all the components are.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.080]   But Apple's approach, I think, would
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.200]   be rather than just split it off just as a music service
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.120]   would be to grab as many people into the iCloud service.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.640]   And the music is just one part of it.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.520]   And then that's going to affect the whole pricing structure,
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.040]   then.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.760]   Well, let's talk about what else might iCloud be in just
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.120]   a moment.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.680]   Adam Christensen, Don McAllister, Andy Ennaco,
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.920]   are here in Mac Break Weekly.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.960]   Episode 249 is on the air.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.880]   Hard to believe.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.120]   We've survived 248 episodes, but we have.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.160]   How many Mac casts have there been, Adam?
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.880]   300.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.400]   Damn you.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.240]   353 or something.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.720]   We'll never catch up, will we?
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.720]   Si.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.800]   This portion of Mac Break Weekly, the mere 249th episode
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.400]   brought to you by our friends at Citrix who
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.800]   do that great go to meeting stuff.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.160]   We love that.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.520]   Undo a go to meeting this afternoon, as a matter of fact.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.480]   We're looking at the new website.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.720]   And of course, nothing better for demonstrating something
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.600]   like that than go to meeting.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.600]   We've got some wireframes.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.080]   We want to look at them together.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:16.040]   I want to be able to go, what about this and do it?
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.200]   And he wants to go, well, how about that and do it?
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.440]   And we both see the same thing.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.680]   That's what go to meeting does.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.360]   It gets you on the same page.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.160]   It takes a teleconference of a phone conference
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.120]   and makes it something really engaging, really effective,
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.440]   really efficient.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.240]   And gosh knows, I hate meetings.
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.440]   So anything that makes a meeting better and faster
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.280]   is good by me.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.720]   It's all we do now is go to meeting.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.080]   I'm almost tempted when they want to have a meeting down here
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.320]   in the big room to go upstairs and say, I'll call in.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.040]   I'll go to meeting it.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.600]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.120]   Great for product reviews, demos, sales presentations.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.240]   You know what?
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.920]   The reason I like going to meeting for sales presentations
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.640]   is because you don't make your client jump through hoops
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.080]   to see your presentation.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.680]   Look, you're pitching on them something.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.800]   You've got to make it easy for them.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.080]   You've got to make it interesting for them.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.440]   Go to meeting is, you send them a link, an invitation.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.000]   Nice little email invitation.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.320]   It says, you're going to meet with Leo at 245 on Thursday,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.160]   and they go, oh, cool.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:09.640]   They have it.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.080]   It goes in their calendar.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.080]   The calendar has a link.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.000]   They click the link, go to meeting runs.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.080]   Even if they don't have the software 30 seconds later,
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.280]   they're seeing your computer on their screen.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.160]   It includes telephony voiceover, internet, or regular phone.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.280]   You get a phone number and a conference bridge and everything.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.840]   So it's something that even somebody you don't know
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.800]   will appreciate.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.920]   Say, yeah, this was good.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.240]   This was easy.
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.800]   Very often they'll say, what was that?
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.480]   I want to use it from now on.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.600]   Training sessions, weekly status meetings,
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.080]   all right from your desk or even better on your iPad.

[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.680]   All right, so music service, that's kind of a given.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:12.000]   Are we going to replace iWorks online service?
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.080]   Are we going to replace mobile?
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.720]   Me, what is iCloud?
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.560]   Andy, what do your sources tell you?
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.560]   Well, sources are kind of tight here,
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.760]   but there's a lot of evidence that's
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.440]   sort of out there for everybody to see.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.240]   We all know from published reports what's going on with Lion.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.320]   It's certainly also no accident that the purpose
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.520]   of next week's keynote isn't just bits and bobs here and there,
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   but it is about iOS 5, our first look at iOS 5 and Lion.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.800]   And we know that a lot of that stuff is a lot of the point
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.000]   of these huge new iterations of these two operating systems
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.600]   is to make the mobile experience and the desktop experience
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.080]   work together a lot more seamlessly.
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.000]   iCloud enabled, in other words.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.440]   Not just iCloud enabled, but just to essentially make sure
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.720]   that no matter where you are, no matter what device you have
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.360]   in your hands, as long as it's got an Apple logo printed on it
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.560]   not somewhere, and hopefully if you've got Apple software running
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.040]   on it somewhere that your experience with your iPhone
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:05.240]   will be almost the same as what you got in your desktop
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.760]   and what you've got in your iPad.
[00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.760]   To that point, now here's another penny that just dropped.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.400]   I think it actually just got out with, what was this,
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.160]   a couple of hours ago.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.880]   Today, suspiciously enough, Apple has released
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.200]   a new universal versions of the iOS editions of pages,
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.440]   numbers and keynote.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.160]   So now it works on the iPhone, it works on the iPod touch
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.040]   to me, this really tips off the fact that if you've got a keynote
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.400]   demonstration or a pages document on your desktop,
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.640]   you will be able to access it from anything
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.280]   and actually do anything you want on it.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   So these are just player apps.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:42.560]   The press release specifically spits out that you can create
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   keynote presentations on your iPod touch and I'm like,
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.640]   oh, okay, well maybe they'll encourage people not to put
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.800]   4,000 words of text in each slide if you have to tap it out.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   You'll let it out, let it out, let it out, screen.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.600]   - Let me understand this, I gotta wrap my head around this.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.880]   Does this mean full round tripping?
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.680]   Does this mean that the two programs are exactly the same
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.280]   on iOS and on OS 10?
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.880]   - I haven't downloaded it yet.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.840]   But I mean, that's technically full, yeah, seems to work.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:08.680]   - Really?
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.600]   So what does this mean?
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.600]   An upgrade to iWork on iOS so that it's equivalent to the Mac app?
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.960]   - I mean, they're updated versions of all three apps.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.280]   It's just that they're universal apps now.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.720]   So if you already purchased it for your iPad,
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.920]   you can essentially upgrade to the new one
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.600]   and now you'll have a version that will install
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   in every iOS device you have.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.600]   So it's still the same price.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:34.120]   - I'm unclear, you mean there was a difference in the past?
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.880]   There was an iPad version, I see what you're saying.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.320]   There was an, but was there even an iPhone?
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.760]   - No, there wasn't an iPhone version until today.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.040]   - So now they're, okay, now I get it.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.200]   There's an iPhone version of the iPad iWork apps,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.720]   numbers, pages and keynote.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.880]   - Can you note?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.680]   But this doesn't affect the desktop.
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:00.400]   - It doesn't affect it in that the desktop version remains unchanged.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.520]   If you're using the iWork apps on your iPad for the past year,
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.200]   that doesn't change. - Now you can get iPhone.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.760]   - The difference is that now if you have a file
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.560]   that you've created in pages or keynote,
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.920]   now it's just as usable, just as editable,
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.720]   just as playable, just as createable on the handheld device
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.640]   as it is on anything else you've got going.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.680]   - I got overexcited.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.360]   I thought we were gonna have round tripping.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.640]   This has always been kind of the issue,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.720]   is if you make something like keynote on the desktop
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.760]   and then you put it on the iOS, you lose.
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.480]   - I think keynote is a separate thing
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.840]   because there have been issues with keynote on the iPad
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.520]   because the fonts and the transitions and things
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.840]   didn't match it, marry exactly with the desktop version.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.880]   So I still need to try that out,
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.480]   but I did round trip a page of documents
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.680]   and that worked perfectly. - And 100%, oh, that's great.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.840]   That's good news.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.560]   - One of the bullet atoms on each one of these different items
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.960]   in the press release is about new document managers
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.360]   that affect all the apps for not just having this loose pile
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.800]   of files, but also being able to organize them.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.280]   And so they really are anticipating
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.280]   that you're gonna be using pages as a workspace,
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.040]   not just as a little low, well, isn't it adorable?
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.920]   You can copy this pages file from your desktop
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.680]   on your phone and it actually makes some kinds
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.200]   of weak edits to it.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.520]   No, they are really promoting this as this is pages
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.120]   for real on the iPhone.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.920]   - It's really good though, because that facility
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.760]   works on the iPad.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.560]   And basically what it is is instead of having that
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.680]   silly, just a single page view that you can flip through
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.040]   to have like your documents, you just get a long list
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.600]   of documents that you can flick through.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.000]   Well, now you actually get them in a matrix on a page.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.440]   And what you can do is to drag a document
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.480]   onto another document and that makes a folder.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.040]   So it's like Springboard, it's like with your apps,
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.480]   you know, you create folders on the home screen
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.320]   of your iPad.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.800]   You can actually do that with documents now.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.760]   So you can create multiple folders within the application
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.320]   and it works superbly well.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.520]   You can even pick up a bunch of documents
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.680]   and drop them on a folder.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.280]   Looks like I picked a bad day to give up iOS.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.360]   - Where's your Android now, Messiah?
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.920]   (laughs)
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.960]   - So, and if you already pay for iWork,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.240]   any of the three apps on iPad,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.280]   it'll now be on your iPhone on a Mac.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.960]   That's awesome.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.480]   Although a little weird, I mean, honestly,
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.400]   I'm not gonna write a document on my iPhone.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.800]   At least, but I will read, I could see reading it.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.320]   - Yeah, great edits.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.200]   - I mean, you're on the road, you're getting ready
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.640]   to do your keynote presentation
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.800]   and you realize you made a typo
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.600]   and you're gonna present it off your phone.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.160]   Well, you can make that edit real quick
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.000]   and it's cool.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.840]   - Be ready to go.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.920]   - Yeah, it does represent, doesn't it,
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.440]   an indication of how different their philosophy
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.320]   is apples from Googles.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.400]   Googles is always that, well, we'll give you a web app.
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:34.000]   We'll give you docs.google.com
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.480]   and every device you access this web app from
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.000]   will be able to let you have access
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.400]   to the exact same documents.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.680]   Apple is aggressively saying that there are things
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.520]   you can't do in user interface on a web app.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:46.480]   You know, as much as we like HTML5.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:48.160]   And our approach is we're gonna give you
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.480]   really great world class apps
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.720]   on every single device that you have.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.040]   So that's why my real interest in iCloud
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:59.720]   isn't so much the music, even though I really have become
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.640]   a fan of how Android streaming
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.400]   lets me have one library that's accessible everywhere.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.360]   But I'm really keen to see exactly how Apple decides to say,
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.080]   we're gonna have a cloud service that is fundamentally
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.800]   at the operating system level.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.000]   It's not a folder that you can interact with.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.720]   And it's not a set of apps that are intercompatible.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.000]   This is two operating systems that are fundamentally
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.280]   designed to be as intimate with each other
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.440]   through the internet as they possibly can be.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.720]   >> Yeah, that's one of the reasons-
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.160]   >> Yeah, any sitting on something that,
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.720]   my biggest hope for WWDC with respect to iCloud
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.160]   is that Apple shows off to developers
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.840]   a really impressive API for accessing iCloud
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.280]   and its file functionality through iDISC.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.160]   Some sort of integration that goes,
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.720]   probably even a lot of people have always said,
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.720]   and I've been saying this, that I want Dropbox-style
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.080]   integration for document management on my iOS devices,
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.960]   but I think it's gonna be even beyond that.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.960]   And I'm hoping it's a real simple API that developers
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.120]   are given to just start tapping into it
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.160]   with their applications.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.360]   And suddenly, you don't have to worry
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.760]   about this document management's thing.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.720]   If it's in your iCloud, you have access to it.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.360]   >> Yeah, remember the reason why Dropbox became the Godzilla
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.840]   is not necessarily because it was doing something brand new
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.440]   and cloud storage, but because it had open APIs,
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.840]   no matter what you were writing,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.960]   you could always integrate support for Dropbox.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.240]   So that's why every app that you buy
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.280]   has some way to share files via Dropbox.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.400]   So I think Apple definitely listened to that.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.280]   >> Historically, that's how you get Apple's attention
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.560]   is people start using it like crazy on iOS and they go,
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.400]   "Oh."
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.720]   (laughing)
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.320]   >> I think that's exciting, though.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.720]   Especially with the announcement today,
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.280]   is that I think it's the first time that Apple
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.600]   have actually announced both the operating system,
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.320]   new operating system for desktop and for mobile
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.720]   and the cloud service.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.720]   It's like, what was it, the perfect storm?
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.200]   All three coming together at the same time.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.640]   I mean, we've had upgrades to the OS,
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.000]   we've had upgrades to iOS,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.640]   we've had them all staged at different periods.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.360]   But now all three are actually coming together.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.480]   And that might be one of the reasons why they actually did
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.000]   at this such a late stage at pre-announce,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.440]   that they are actually going to, you know,
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.200]   tell them to give, sort of bring everyone in
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.720]   on the big secret and how they're actually going to bring
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.360]   all three of those trends together.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.920]   >> Here's an interesting story from CNET,
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.440]   saying that Apple's been working very hard
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.840]   to license TV and movies for iCloud.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.400]   Now this interests me.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.440]   You know, it's essentially a Netflix competitor
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.880]   in some ways, right?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.200]   Because now I don't have to download it,
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.320]   I can stream it for my cloud,
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.120]   I kind of have it there in my cloud.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.880]   I don't know if they're going to rent or buy or both.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.760]   >> Well, I think one of the major roadblocks
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.840]   for people actually subscribing to TV shows
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.400]   and renting movies is the fact that
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.440]   you've got your impulse that,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.560]   oh, I missed that really great Neil Gaiman,
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.600]   Doctor Who a couple weeks ago.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.960]   I want to watch that right now.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.360]   Great, 199 to rent, great click.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.440]   Oh, I have to wait now 90 minutes to two hours
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.640]   for this huge file to download.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.880]   So yeah, instant streaming would definitely
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.640]   increase their chances there.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.760]   >> There is an issue apparently according to CNET
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.720]   with the HBO window, they call it HBO,
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.480]   as a window between the time the movie comes out
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.920]   on in the theaters and the time the movie comes out on DVD
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.320]   where they get to have the movie
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.120]   and they're trying to figure out what happens now
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.160]   during that HBO exclusive window.
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:20.520]   And then CNET says ultraviolet will be used perhaps
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:24.600]   for this ultraviolet is essentially DRM for.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.040]   >> Yeah, ultraviolet is interesting
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.680]   because that's the one DRM to unite them all style DRM
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.280]   that all the TV networks and movie distributors
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.120]   have agreed upon.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.000]   So with at least you don't have to have eight different stores
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.440]   in order to sell content digitally.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.000]   So that would be an interesting move.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.880]   >> Historically, Apple has not done much in that,
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.240]   you know, in those kinds of realms.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.200]   They do their own thing.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:48.960]   They don't like to join any industry consortium.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.720]   >> Yeah, as they're whopping great Bluetooth support
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.560]   would excuse me, a Blu-ray support.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.400]   (laughing)
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.280]   >> Okay, that's a bad.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.760]   >> It's a bag of hurt.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.520]   >> Yeah, we won't think that no one's mentioned
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.440]   and all of the discussions about Lion and iOS 5 really is
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.200]   the Apple TV and whether that's going to have any place
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.400]   at the end of the month on Monday.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.040]   >> No storage on the Apple TV.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.560]   It's just a interface to the internet.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.880]   >> Well, it's got a gig of RAM.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.480]   So it's, you know, you can run plenty of applications
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.240]   within an Apple TV.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.160]   It's when they actually open up that platform
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.800]   and if it figures into their plans for iCloud as well
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.720]   on the Apple TV.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.120]   >> Well, it would explain why they've never added apps
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.880]   to the Apple TV.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.440]   >> Yeah, yeah, perhaps just waiting for the RAM.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.640]   I mean, they do seed the equipment, don't they?
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.360]   I mean, they've had it out for a year now.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.080]   So they've been selling them just on the basis
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.520]   of the limited functionality that they have.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.960]   So that if they were to switch on the tap and start apps,
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.880]   they've already got a huge install base.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.720]   >> That would be exciting.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.120]   You know, Google's doing that with their Google TV.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.280]   I think they had a lot of coverage on their Google I/O
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.080]   announcement, but they're going to put Honeycomb
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.880]   on the Google TV box, including the Android marketplace.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.920]   So they may be the first with apps on the TV.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.840]   I don't know.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.800]   >> Oh, now that the box that runs Android 2.3
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.000]   will be the box that has Android 3.1.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   (laughing)
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.240]   Make those shareholders happy.
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:10.560]   (laughing)
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.920]   >> So what happens to mobile me?
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.880]   It just gets subsumed by iCloud.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.680]   >> Yeah, I think so.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.520]   >> I think so.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:21.800]   And so my mail will now be, it was.mac.com
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.600]   and now it's at me.com.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.680]   Now is it going to be iCloud.com?
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.160]   >> Oh, I'm trying to stop.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.000]   >> I'm trying to stop.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.840]   >> Yeah, I got that.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   >> Jeez Louise.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:31.840]   (laughing)
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.680]   >> I don't know.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.560]   My Mac.com address is still work fine.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.680]   Yeah, you keep it, right?
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.480]   You don't have to give it up.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.080]   I mean, I hate to have everybody have to do the same
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:42.880]   musical chairs in order to be,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.200]   but I was John_L.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.120]   >> Right.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.080]   >> I got one of my chances that there's nobody else
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.800]   with an iOS device that has a,
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.120]   whose last name starts with an L.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:51.960]   >> Right.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.800]   >> They'll keep them all.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.840]   >> That's one piece of disruption that I didn't think
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.480]   Apple wants to be a part of.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:59.080]   They got into enough trouble, I think,
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.960]   when they just simply told everybody who's using
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.520]   iCal syncing that with a series of increasingly
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.880]   distressing emails, you have to go to our site right now
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.840]   and fix the update your calendars
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.880]   to the way we're doing it right now.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.640]   And one of the, I think one of the most useful metrics
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.400]   personally on how well companies doing is how many
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.040]   phone calls do I get from friends and neighbors
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.680]   and family members about, gee, should I worry about this?
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.360]   Should I do anything about it?
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.800]   I mean, during my doctor's exam today,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.560]   a lot of it was, a lot of it was like my routine exam,
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.720]   but as I'm being poked and proud,
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.880]   and I'm also giving a lot of answers as to,
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.240]   well, the difference between AT&T,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.960]   I know they're worried about going to Verizon,
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.280]   but I think Verizon's gonna have a-
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.840]   >> That should not be allowed.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:38.560]   (laughing)
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.760]   >> So long as he's got the needles in the knives.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.400]   >> I didn't really let him do anything he wants.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.520]   >> I was, I won't elaborate, but it was-
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.240]   >> You know, when you're banning over-
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.720]   >> You're just freaking coughing, I don't wanna hear,
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.600]   well, what cell phone should I get?
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.520]   I just don't wanna hear that, I'm sorry.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.240]   (laughing)
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.200]   >> I suppose Apple could stick with their whole app approach,
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.680]   and I'm just kinda thinking of this right now,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.400]   but I mean, they could just call it the mail application
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.520]   is still the mobile me application running on the iCloud.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.040]   I mean, they could take that kind of sense with it.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.880]   I don't see them wanting to change everybody's email address
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.560]   again, you know, again, or give them a third one.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.160]   >> What about, okay, let's blue sky here though.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.080]   What other things could they have on iCloud
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.920]   that maybe we hadn't really thought about before?
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.400]   I mean, it's a big cloud service.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.360]   Could they do something like go to meeting perhaps?
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.200]   Could they have a meeting service on there?
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.000]   >> Sure, they integrate-
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.520]   >> Echo?
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.000]   >> I was getting mixed up, what are they calling FaceTime?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.840]   >> FaceTime, yeah.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.360]   >> FaceTime and iChat are really,
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.720]   that's a weird thing that Apple has going right now,
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.760]   and they could bring that stuff together and make it,
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.560]   you know, a more of an online streaming style service
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.000]   if I'm just riffing right now,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.320]   but you know, it's really confusing right now to me.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.280]   Am I supposed to use iChat for video chat?
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.280]   Am I supposed to use FaceTime?
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.600]   What is it?
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   >> Yeah, but think about it even going more profound than that.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.000]   I would really love it if Back to My Mac
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.120]   worked a lot more consistently than it does right now.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.320]   >> I'd love Back to My Mac when it works, it's fantastic.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:12.120]   >> Exactly, if you've got Apple routers
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:15.200]   and you go to the coffee shop you normally go to,
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.640]   if you say, here's a brand new Apple router
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.200]   that I would really like you to replace
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.040]   your existing router with, don't ask me why,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.000]   but it would cost me to buy a lot more coffee
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.520]   and bagels from the future.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.360]   (laughing)
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.200]   That would be good enough, but imagine if there's enough
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.760]   development support behind the iCloud feature
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.840]   that your iOS device can not just do a VNC
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.240]   back to your Mac or your PC
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.320]   and give you a display window,
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.560]   but also essentially take over the full screen mode
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.200]   that's embedded inside that word processing app
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.400]   or that spreadsheet app or your home finance app
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.520]   and really reconfigure it to work via the internet
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.120]   on your iOS display.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.440]   Already, you can do some really cool things
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:02.120]   with just remotely opening an HTML view, a web view
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:05.600]   in something as simple as AppleScript.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.640]   And that's something that any dodo like me can do
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.200]   with existing software.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.080]   You imagine what could be done behind the scenes
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.600]   where the user doesn't know why he can get the regular
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.400]   stripped down, but a regular editing window
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.000]   from his home word processor running on iOS
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.760]   and he didn't have to buy an iOS copy of it.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.840]   This is just a feature that his home edition
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.840]   is lending to his iOS device.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.880]   That's the sort of stuff that I'm really interested in saying.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.640]   That's that level of intimacy.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.480]   - They could do some really cool stuff, I agree.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.120]   - Yeah, I mean, I know absolutely.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.760]   - That's the company likely to do this, aren't they?
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.480]   Because that's what happened with the iPad.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.480]   I mean, it would have been so easy for them to have just
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.960]   introduced the iPad with a standard file system.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.760]   I know they got a lot of heat because they didn't.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:44.920]   You know, they sandboxed everything off
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.680]   and they said, no, we won't go down the route
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.240]   of having a traditional class system, we'll do it our way.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.120]   I could very well see them extending that across,
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.520]   you know, all the platforms really.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.720]   It's sort of like they now have the opportunity to do that,
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.160]   especially if they've got this glue in the middle,
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.640]   which is the iCloud service.
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:03.880]   - Well, we'll find out anything we want to say about
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.560]   Lion or iOS 5 or one more thing
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.640]   because there's been a lot of speculation
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.760]   after this press release that if Apple is telling us
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.720]   all of this, won't there be one more thing,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.600]   perhaps an iPhone 4S?
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.800]   - I don't know.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.360]   I think that there's enough.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.960]   From what I know about Lion, from what I,
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.720]   there's from what little I know from iOS 5,
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.960]   all I know is the shape of it.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.000]   I don't need details about it.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.080]   - But there is a lot to say here, isn't there?
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:34.640]   - There's not only a lot to say,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.600]   but the sort of things you can't simply say,
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.080]   here's a side by side.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.240]   Here's how much more pixels is on this display
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.360]   than this display.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.400]   We're talking about things like,
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.800]   how do you get people to understand that,
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.080]   here's how version control is going to work
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.880]   as an operating system level thing,
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.960]   where not only will iCloud give you
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.280]   every single document that you have on your home machine,
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.320]   but also every single version of your document,
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.880]   so that if you need to rewind to your calendar
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.320]   to two weeks ago to what it was
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.400]   before you deleted this appointment,
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.080]   there's going to be a lot of very subtle things.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.600]   And I think that one of the reasons why Apple was so,
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.000]   took this unprecedented step into waiting
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.880]   until less than a week before the keynote
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:13.240]   to even declare there was going to be a keynote.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.760]   I, if I were to take a guess,
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.760]   is that they spent this much time really just
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:21.080]   workshopping exactly how to convey this message.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.920]   One part's are important enough that this is,
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.360]   we've got 90 minutes of the press's attention.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.520]   Here's the parts that are,
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.120]   here's what we want them to send.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.600]   Here's the song that we want everybody
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.340]   to leave that hall singing on the way back out,
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.400]   as opposed to the Google's technique
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.280]   and the Microsoft technique is,
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.720]   we've got lots of bullet points.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.480]   If we just talk really, really fast,
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.480]   and we just have people talking to sample 10s on stage,
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:44.320]   we can say all this stuff within 90 minutes,
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.040]   Apple's really going to have to pick and choose
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:46.960]   what their message is going to be.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.320]   I really think it's going to be a game changer next week.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.920]   - It's exciting, we will be covering it live.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.680]   It's actually put us in a little conundrum
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.560]   because some of us are going down to Los Angeles for E3,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.280]   which starts on Tuesday of next week.
[00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:03.080]   And the Sony and Microsoft press conferences
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.760]   are on Monday, competing with Apple Zone.
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.520]   - Good luck, good luck, Mr. Palmer.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.120]   - So, Steve, it's the Palmer's time to show.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.800]   (laughing)
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.440]   - Sorry.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.640]   - So I think what we're going to do,
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.200]   we'll do live coverage starting at 10am.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.080]   Normally this is when the social hour is on the air,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   10am Monday, Pacific, that's 1pm, Eastern, live.twit.tv.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.760]   Tom Merritt will anchor that coverage here.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.800]   I hope Andy you'll join us.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.080]   Are you coming out for this now
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.840]   that you know what's going on?
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.240]   - I don't know yet.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:35.480]   Right now, flights are really expensive.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.360]   Also, on the-- - Steve, the reason why
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.720]   I've got my, I've got a little in front of me right now
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.560]   is that I've, as of now,
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.800]   I still haven't been invited to this thing.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.760]   So we'll just have to see whether or not my press,
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.480]   if I could actually attend, if I actually showed up.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.400]   - I hope we haven't tainted you.
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.240]   (laughing)
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:54.160]   Oh.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.800]   - By your association.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.440]   - I've rejected four really, really funny
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.400]   but borderline filthy responses to that.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.240]   (laughing)
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.720]   I simply said that I'm sure that I'm sure
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:05.520]   that I've not been PNG'd for Apple.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.080]   - I hope not.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.000]   - And Adam, if you stop getting invitations,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.480]   let me know 'cause I never started kidding.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.240]   - Oh, you'll get them in the first place.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.080]   - Same here.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.240]   - All right.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.480]   - We can find tickets. - I'll be going.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.720]   - Are you gonna go?
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.880]   - Yeah, coming over on Saturday.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.680]   - I'll be right up on this week.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:25.120]   I was hoping to come in next week to do the show in the studio
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.200]   but because of the changes of the E3, et cetera.
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.320]   I think they said, "Oh, come on this week
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.040]   "'cause we won't be able to accommodate you next week."
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.320]   So, but yet, no, I'll be there.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.840]   I'll be at the keynote.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.720]   - I guess we'll do Mac break weekly on Monday.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:37.560]   - Yeah.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.600]   And then 'cause Tuesday, we're gonna be covering E3.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.800]   So, I guess that's what we'll do.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.440]   But, Don, I hope you will report in.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.920]   We'll have-- - Yeah, sure, yeah.
[00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.760]   - 'Cause definitely-- - Yeah, definitely.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.600]   - Guess I'm as late as last year
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   as soon as I come out of the keynote.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.440]   - Right.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.080]   - I'll give you a call. - Good.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:52.920]   Good.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.760]   Well, we're excited.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.920]   I mean, I think this is gonna be a big deal
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.520]   and there'll be lots of interesting things.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.320]   And I have a, I just, I have to think
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.360]   there's gonna be some surprises.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.160]   For instance, Apple TV, this iCloud could really change
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.920]   what Apple TV means.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.640]   And it could be the interface to iCloud and your television.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.280]   And I think that could be significant.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.840]   So I think there's more than just what this press release
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.000]   hints at.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.760]   iCloud may have some surprises for us.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.880]   - Yeah, this is, this is why I think there's been
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.400]   a lot of silence about what Google's been doing
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.640]   and what Amazon's been doing.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:27.320]   'Cause they, it's, this is the part which the Death Star,
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.360]   this is the part where both those copies say,
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.720]   "That's no moon, that's a battle station."
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.880]   (laughing)
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.760]   - Very interesting.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.240]   But we'll have coverage again.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.840]   I will probably start around 930 Pacific, 1230 Eastern
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.920]   live.twit.tv on Monday.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.400]   And I don't, still no word if Apple's gonna stream this.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.400]   They, they, you know, they've streamed some of their
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.920]   speeches recently and not others.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.080]   So I don't know, but if they don't stream it,
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.440]   what we'll do is we'll watch the live blogs.
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.680]   Maybe we'll try to find a pirate stream.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.000]   I'm in Los Angeles, it's not my fault.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.280]   And, and if we can, we'll bring it to you in some,
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.480]   some form or fashion so you can watch here live
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.320]   and find out what's going on.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.080]   Or listen, 'cause we also have an audio stream.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.840]   I don't know if people know that at twit.am/listen
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.560]   and that works on iTunes along with a lot of other
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.760]   ICE cast compatible clients like WinApp.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.360]   Twit.am/listen.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.640]   All right, lots more to talk about.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.600]   Adam Christensen is here from MacCast.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.720]   Don McAllister from ScreenCastsOnline, Andy Inako
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.600]   from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.920]   More to talk about in just a moment,
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.800]   but right now I want to tell you about the best way
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.320]   to send invoices.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.240]   I just got two tweets this last couple of days
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.880]   from people who got cakes, birthday cakes from FreshBooks.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.800]   I like that.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.280]   That's not the main reason to use FreshBooks,
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.440]   but it's a nice little feature.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.880]   The cake is not a lie when it comes to FreshBooks.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:54.000]   Go to FreshBooks.com and take a look at their service.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.520]   It's an, it's a, it makes invoicing easier.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.480]   And I speak from experience here because A,
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.120]   I'm a lousy invoicer, always have been.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.600]   And B, when Amber MacArthur told me about FreshBooks
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.920]   in 2004, I jumped on it, started using it,
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.440]   and it changed my life.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.080]   If you have to send invoices,
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.960]   you know what a pain that is every month.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.920]   You can sit down right about now, right?
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.760]   Last day of the month.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.280]   Oh, I gotta send out an envy.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.840]   I probably just brought down some people.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.520]   Yep, it's the last day of the month.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.760]   Wouldn't it be nice to go to,
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.840]   in fact, this is the time, go to FreshBooks.com
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:27.960]   and take a look at what they can do.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.720]   FreshBooks lets you upload your logo
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.080]   and then you send really a professional looking invoice
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.520]   via email.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.760]   They'll also print, by the way,
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.680]   stamp and mail invoices for an additional charge.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.440]   And I used to do that for some of the more old fashion clients.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.440]   But here's why the email invoice is so cool.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.200]   It has a button on it that says pay it now.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.720]   And your client can press that button
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.280]   and pay you with a credit card instantly
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.840]   or PayPal or authorized.net,
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.400]   in fact, they've got 11 different payment services.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.160]   According to their own user survey,
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.720]   FreshBooks.com,
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.920]   users get paid on an average of two weeks faster.
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.680]   It's not, you know, I find it's not the client
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.520]   doesn't wanna pay you.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.400]   They hate paying as much as you hate invoicing.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.560]   It's just a pain.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.400]   This makes it easy.
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.560]   In fact, you could collude
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.080]   and set up automatic invoicing and payments.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.280]   Love this.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.780]   Every month on the 31st, automatically,
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:20.840]   FreshBooks.com sends out your invoice
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.400]   and your client automatically pays it.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.320]   Oh, baby!
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.480]   Now we're talking friction-free invoicing.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.800]   Lots of nice features too, like the iPad iPhone app
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.680]   that tracks your hours and automatically pumps that
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.960]   into the invoice currency support,
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.760]   which is great 'cause I had Canadian clients.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.800]   I'm not sure Don, this would be useful for you too.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.860]   You invoice in whatever the native currency
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.360]   isn't automatically does the conversions.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:45.680]   It's really handy.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.520]   Looks good.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.480]   Works well.
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.640]   You never have to remember
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.800]   'cause they've got automatic late payment reminders.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.920]   I could just go on and on, but you know, it's free.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:56.320]   So you might as well try it free for the first three.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.760]   And for many of us, three clients
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.480]   is really all we needed for it.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.560]   May 31st is here.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:04.280]   Let's do those invoices at the FreshBooks way.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:09.080]   FreshBooks.com and use the offer code now?
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:09.960]   It says offer code Mac,
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:10.920]   but I don't think there is an offer.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.840]   If they ask you mention Mac break,
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.840]   but I don't think they ask you.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.160]   However, they are giving away a birthday cake
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:21.560]   every week to new customers.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.000]   So if somebody calls you and says,
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.840]   what's your address?
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:24.660]   Give it to them.
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:30.640]   FreshBooks.com, the secret behind easy invoicing.
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.520]   All right.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.280]   So we got the excitement out of the way.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.000]   This is very exciting.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.760]   Let's move on.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   Samsung.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.600]   (laughs)
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.800]   (laughs)
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:43.960]   - I know. - We had fun.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:44.800]   Go ahead.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.040]   We had fun with this on Twitch.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.920]   Samsung says, okay, Apple,
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.480]   you wanna see our stuff?
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.320]   So we wanna see your stuff.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.120]   Samsung has now asked the court to get Apple
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.360]   to give them the iPhone 5 and the iPad 3.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.200]   Just in case.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.120]   See, it turns out Apple asked Samsung
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.120]   to show them the Nexus 3 or whatever they're calling it,
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.720]   the Galaxy 3, which isn't out yet.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.160]   So Samsung says, yeah, but we wanna see yours too.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.440]   This is that lawsuit over whether Samsung
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.080]   stole Apple's trade dress.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.840]   Samsung is also saying,
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.960]   at least the Samsung exec is also saying
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.440]   that they don't consider an issue in any way.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.960]   They're not concerned in any way with Apple's lawsuit.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.320]   JK Shin says, we didn't copy Apple's design.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.820]   This isn't the Wall Street Journal.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.960]   We've used many similar designs over the past years
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.160]   and it will not be legally problematic.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:41.880]   In other words, they think they've got a good defense.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.200]   But as long as the lawsuit's going on,
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.600]   let's see the iPhone 5.
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.760]   (laughs)
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.000]   Somehow I don't think they're gonna get that.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:49.840]   - Good luck with that.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.840]   - Good luck with that.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.000]   This is interesting.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.440]   Amazon, I'll tell you, if you go to Amazon.com,
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.160]   it's not, at least I couldn't find it on the front page,
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:03.220]   but Amazon has launched a Mac App Store for the desktop.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.400]   But where is it?
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.400]   I'm looking on the, I don't see it.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:08.760]   - Yep, go to the right.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.040]   I think it's under your digital items.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.000]   - Your digital items.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.160]   Oh, well, that's of course your digital items.
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:22.760]   Your Amazon Kindle, MP3, Sir Games and Software.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.320]   Maybe it's in the Games and Software library.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.360]   Your Games and Software, I gotta sign in, let's sign in.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.680]   (sings)
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:35.120]   After you purchase, you'll find it.
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:39.200]   Well, anyway, if you know the secret URL,
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.640]   you think it's on here, where is it?
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.800]   If you know the secret URL, you can find it.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:49.760]   They obviously haven't committed a huge amount to this.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.080]   This is like a major thing for them.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.560]   I, every time I've gone there,
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:57.720]   I've gone through a link in an article.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.320]   Come on guys, help me out.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:02.120]   Your, you're all-- - I'm trying to find it.
[00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.920]   (laughs)
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:05.320]   - This is not a commitment.
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.400]   - Everybody went and looked and then went,
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.080]   "Ah, I've got the App Store on my desktop."
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.520]   - Well, if you search for Lightroom, let me see.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.920]   Because yesterday they had a great deal in Lightroom,
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.280]   120 bucks for Lightroom.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.440]   (laughs)
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.760]   - Shop software, don't they?
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:19.600]   - Shop software.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.800]   If I go to the Lightroom CD, wrong.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.200]   - You click the wrong link.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.800]   You click the My Downloads.
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.840]   You should, instead of clicking your Games and Software Library,
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.120]   click on Shop Software Downloads.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.000]   - Where do you see that?
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.120]   - Games and Software under My Digital Items.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.840]   (laughs)
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.040]   - Okay, your digital items, those are My Digital Items.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.360]   Games and Software, yeah.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.760]   - You don't have to be no fancy down,
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.200]   McCallus did a screencast.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.640]   - What's so difficult about this?
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:46.480]   I'm asking.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.960]   - Shop software downloads, is that it?
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.800]   - Yes.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.640]   - Shop software.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.480]   - There it is.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:52.560]   - You got a new client.
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.680]   - Well, sure, your arms get tired after a few minutes.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.520]   I found it.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.040]   So, I mean, but look, they got a whole page
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.520]   and everything, they just don't put a link up.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.680]   That's hard when you're Amazon,
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.160]   'cause you sell so much crap.
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.960]   - It's also interesting because I did a Google,
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.880]   excuse me, I did an Amazon product search
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.640]   for one of the products I knew that was up there,
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:12.120]   Office for Mac, and it gave me the,
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.880]   the treeware edition, it gave me lots of books about it,
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.640]   but it didn't give me the actual download for a while.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.360]   - But now, by the way, it is a good deal.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.400]   It's a considerable cut off the list price,
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.440]   about 20, 25% off the list price,
[00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:27.160]   if you download Office.
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.760]   Yesterday, they were offering Adobe's Lightroom
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.540]   for less than half the list price.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.960]   I guess they're doing the same thing
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:37.080]   that they do with the Android store,
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.440]   which is every once in a while,
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.000]   but see, I don't see a deal here.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.640]   The deal here is save $5.
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.360]   That's not compelling.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.120]   - It's just a page of software though, isn't it?
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.840]   It's not like the Mac App Store,
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.520]   whereby I let the download it and install it and integrate it.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.560]   I obviously can't do that,
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.360]   so it's just a page on a website.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.640]   - It's just, okay, but they are offering this stuff
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.720]   for download.
[00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:00.640]   I mean, I don't think you could download Office Mac
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.280]   before this, could you?
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.560]   - Probably not.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.560]   - I don't think so.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.360]   - Download size 890 megabytes.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.680]   What you can download this item for re-installation
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.080]   from your software library,
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.280]   the number of computers eligible for installation will vary.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.560]   So when you do buy this, you do have that,
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.800]   that's where I went, that first link.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.160]   You do have a software library of the stuff you've purchased,
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.600]   you can re-download.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.800]   I wonder how they'll handle updates,
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.760]   but this is, you're right, they can't do,
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.800]   it's not the Mac App Store,
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   but it's as close as Amazon could get.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.920]   - Oh, my house really is the app.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.000]   - Yeah, interesting.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.960]   - And it's certainly a nice response for developers,
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.040]   especially the major developers who didn't want,
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.680]   want to sell their software without having it
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:40.360]   or any real agreements with Apple.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.200]   - Right.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.040]   - I'm sure that Amazon's giving them
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.040]   a lot more attractive terms than Apple is.
[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:48.120]   - And it's good for consumers, like you pointed out, Leo.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.640]   I mean, they're offering deals,
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.760]   so we're gonna have options in places to go,
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.480]   other than the Mac App Store to get better deals on software.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:56.720]   And if it's easy enough to download,
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.920]   I think where Apple's gonna gain the advantages,
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.800]   the integration, and we were talking,
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.240]   when we were talking about iCloud earlier,
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:05.320]   I think that's gonna be the key of this WWDC keynote,
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.520]   is the integration of all this stuff
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.400]   and the seamlessness and the ease of use.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.120]   I mean, that's where Apple's gonna excel,
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:12.840]   but those people who want a good deal, yeah.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.920]   I mean, Amazon's gonna be a great store to go to,
[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.480]   and you'll be able to download your app from there
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.720]   and maybe save 20, 25%.
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.560]   - Right.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:23.120]   I do like the fact that the Mac App Store,
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.280]   the Apple version of the Mac App Store,
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.640]   has all your purchases on other machines,
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:28.880]   so you can install it,
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.560]   has does updates automatically.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.080]   I have to say though, it needs some work.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:33.120]   I've mentioned this before,
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:36.000]   the purchase list doesn't seem to be prunable,
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:38.120]   and as I buy more and more stuff,
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.040]   it's getting longer and longer.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.720]   It also doesn't seem to be in any order,
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.800]   so it's, you know, I mean, right now it's not a problem,
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:46.960]   but as time goes by,
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.360]   it's gonna get to be more and more of a problem.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.520]   There's little things like that,
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.080]   but I'm sure Apple will fix that.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.440]   - Oh yeah, the line's coming.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.720]   (laughs)
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.400]   - Have you, as anybody seen Lions version of the App Store,
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.240]   if it doesn't, in the beta, does it look different?
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:05.440]   - No, but there was something in the 10.6.8 release notes
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.680]   that just went out to developers
[00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.960]   that they did some tweaking for getting
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.640]   that Mac App Store ready for Lion.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.120]   So although a lot of people were thinking that
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.480]   that is the rumor that Apple might distribute Lion
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.640]   or sell Lion through the Mac App Store.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.440]   - Well they were doing that for developers, right?
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.520]   I mean, if you get the beta, it goes through the App Store, so.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.920]   - Yeah, my concern is that the Pachwong's
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.760]   is a bootable copy,
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.360]   I'm hoping they may be provide a tool
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:33.080]   to let me build one of those cool little USB
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.360]   decks to actually boot from.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.040]   - I guess there is an order to my purchases.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.120]   It's sorted by purchase date.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:39.400]   Can I sort by name?
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.560]   No, just purchase date.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.080]   So I have to scroll back through all the things I've bought,
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.320]   many of which are crap, by the way.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.680]   And I would just love to eliminate some of these,
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:50.800]   I won't many, many names,
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.440]   but I'd love to eliminate some of these programs
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.320]   because I don't really wanna see them in that list anymore.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:01.520]   - Yeah, I'm still, this doesn't just extend to the App Store.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.520]   I'm still surprised that the iTunes Store,
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.840]   so much of it is kind of unpolished.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.680]   - Right.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.200]   - And there's so many basic things you want to do,
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.480]   but there's no obvious way to do it.
[00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:11.920]   Like when you want to get full information on a track,
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.760]   it really should be move the mouse pointer over the item
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:17.640]   and get it hover link to just give you that full paragraph
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.440]   instead of the first 11 letters that get cut off
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.920]   because you're in a non-editable table list view.
[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:24.760]   So I.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:27.920]   - Oh, oh, forget Mac stuff.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.080]   Remember last episode, Andy?
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.160]   It was the hair episode.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.000]   - Yes.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.080]   - With Chris Breen and his hair and me and my hair
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.560]   and who else was on that show that had hair?
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.400]   - Mr. Gruber.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:41.560]   - John Gruber with the--
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.400]   - Mr. A.
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.080]   - Yeah, with a lot of hair on there.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.480]   So there was this company named Lanza.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:48.880]   My name is Ryan Brown.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.080]   I work for Lanza Healing Hair Care.
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.240]   Listen to your last Mac break,
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.520]   I heard you were talking a lot about John Gruber's hair.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:57.040]   So now everyone in the TwitCottage
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.480]   can have great hair.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:01.720]   - No, that's not really possible.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   - They sent me.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.720]   - Nice one to say.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.480]   - They sent me.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.360]   Wow.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.920]   I mean, a lot of hair care product from Lanza.
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:10.760]   I've never heard of them,
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.920]   but now I will be being ever,
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.640]   oh, look, here's a hair mask.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.720]   - Now they have the clarifying gel.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.840]   - I'm gonna put this on right now.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.560]   We're gonna see what it says.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:24.480]   It says, "Use twice weekly as our offer is needed apply
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.200]   "to damper dry hair, leave in for five minutes,
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.400]   "30 minutes for seriously dehydrated hair."
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.440]   Well, mine's very dehydrated.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.400]   Let me just put some of that in there.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.560]   And this is gonna really help the show.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:40.440]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.920]   All right.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:42.760]   - All right.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:43.840]   - Thank you, Lanza.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.240]   - Mm.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.080]   - Boom.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.360]   (laughing)
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:50.000]   It is a little Pee Wee Herman, isn't it?
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.840]   A little eraser head.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.680]   - Yeah.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.520]   (laughing)
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.760]   - I love it.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.520]   - Of course I call it a contribute to this section.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.360]   Kind of nice.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.280]   - You're done.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.040]   You're kind of left out, aren't you?
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.800]   Yeah, well, you know.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.000]   You want some hair care products?
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.240]   I don't think we have anything to see
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.560]   if they have anything that grows here.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.920]   Oh, how about this?
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.920]   - Give me a little, given how the successful last week was,
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:10.440]   I think it's time to go for the,
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.360]   I'm sure there's somebody who does like mustache, wax,
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.800]   you know, stabilizers, combs, beer trimmers.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.000]   - Let's go for it.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:17.840]   Maybe Lanza does.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:18.680]   - Maybe Lanza does.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.680]   - And then must, I think the kid.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.960]   - Look at, look at Adam's hair looks good.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.720]   You've been obviously taking good carrier hair.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:24.600]   (laughing)
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:26.160]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.320]   - I'm gonna send you, Don,
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:29.800]   we're gonna put this podcast up, or I must say.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.480]   - When you come, Don, when you come out next week,
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.960]   I'll give you this, this is Lanza's healing style.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:36.800]   - Okay.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.640]   - This'll heal your.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.240]   (laughing)
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.000]   - That's a tough taste.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.560]   It smells, but it smells good, doesn't it?
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.280]   Don't I smell good?
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:45.160]   - Oh, dear.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.720]   Starting to stiffen.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.980]   (laughing)
[00:55:48.980 --> 00:55:51.760]   Healing volume.
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.640]   This is like, this is like Christmas.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.440]   Anyway, and so this clip will be the answer to the question
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.120]   from every watcher of every podcast you do this week.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.600]   How, why was your hair look so funny
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.880]   that, or that podcast this week's?
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:05.560]   Well, because I did Mac break weekly just before it,
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:07.080]   and I got this impulse.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.080]   - Oh, you're right, I have another show to do.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.120]   (laughing)
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.160]   Oh, well.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:13.880]   - Can you do a Christopher Walken impression?
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:15.800]   If you want to do one before your next couple.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.400]   - This'll be good, this'll be the time to do it.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:18.800]   Well, thank you.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.200]   - Very concerned.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.280]   - I get a lot, thank you to Ryan Brown,
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.480]   and Lanza Marketing.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.960]   By the way, his email address is at me.com.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.400]   - So there, he's a Mac guy.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.200]   - No, I don't think that paper towel's gonna do it.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.480]   I think it's more of an issue.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   - Well, if only you had some substance
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:38.440]   that was handy for washing hair.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.400]   - Oh. - Wait a minute.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.200]   Hey, they didn't send me any shampoo.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.480]   - It must have.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.080]   There must be some shampoo here.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:49.640]   - So did you see the study by the Nielsen?
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:50.920]   (laughing)
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:51.760]   What?
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.080]   (laughing)
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:53.920]   - Oh.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.560]   - I'm just saying that's what Leo's gonna look like
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.600]   for the rest of the show.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.160]   - I'm just moisturizing my hair.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.560]   I hope you don't mind.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:01.640]   (laughing)
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:03.360]   Boy, it feels moisture already.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.920]   Oh, wait a minute, don't finish it until after I...
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.760]   No, no, see, Eileen was gonna finish for us
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.920]   by the finishing spray on,
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.680]   but that's not the time to do that.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.080]   We have to do that later.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:13.920]   (sniffing)
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:15.400]   It smells like coconut.
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.960]   (sniffing)
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.760]   That's the hair mask.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.560]   By the way, anybody wants to know more about this.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.560]   And I know you all too. (laughing)
[00:57:24.560 --> 00:57:26.120]   You might be interested.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:30.600]   This is the moi moi hair mask,
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.600]   just in case you wanna know from Lanza.
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.720]   I don't know how to get us,
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.680]   keep us in shampoo for the next six months.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.400]   Moving right along, the Nielsen Norman group,
[00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:42.280]   Jacob Nielsen, who's a usability expert says,
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:45.880]   they took 16 people and a bunch of well-known iPad apps,
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:48.760]   let 'em try 'em, and they say,
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.960]   these are too hard to use.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:53.040]   People can't figure 'em out.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.360]   That doesn't seem right.
[00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:56.160]   (mumbling)
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.760]   I agree with some of the stuff in there.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:02.000]   I mean, especially when it comes to gestures,
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.200]   and there's a little bit of a dilemma going on,
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.480]   I think with gestures,
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.120]   specifically some of the multi-finger gestures.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:12.080]   And part of the reason why I think Apple released the,
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.120]   you know, they have the new four-finger gestures
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:16.080]   that were released to developers.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.760]   I've been playing around with those,
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:22.200]   where you can slide up to get the background running applications
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.040]   and stuff like that.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.280]   And it conflicts with some applications.
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.640]   And there is kind of inconsistency.
[00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:28.840]   Developers can do different things
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.000]   with multi-finger gestures within different apps.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.200]   And so you kind of have to learn the apps a little bit.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.160]   So I don't know that study was really,
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:40.040]   you know, they're just throwing people into a brand new app.
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.760]   The ones you use, you get used to using,
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:42.880]   but they're still a learning curve,
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.200]   and I don't think that goes out of software.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.760]   So I don't know if that's anything different,
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.480]   but there are some dilemmas.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.800]   Part of the problem is that every app has a,
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.840]   like, you know, flip board is one of the things they used.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.680]   And, you know, it's, every app is a little different.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.520]   Right.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.280]   Now, now the argument is, well, a two-year-old could figure it out,
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.360]   but I think that that's because a two-year-old
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:02.440]   isn't like an adult who, adults trying to figure out
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.280]   how to use it.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.960]   A two-year-old is going, "Ha, na, na, na, na."
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.360]   Well, also because, also because a two-year-old
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.880]   doesn't have a, doesn't have like 20 years of their experience
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.040]   of what they're expecting an app to do.
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.040]   Well, that's true.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.360]   As my, I think it's gonna hit macworld.com.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:17.200]   It should either this week or next week.
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.360]   I filed this, this is like about a month, a month,
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.720]   a month, a month, a month, and a half ago.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:23.160]   I wrote a column, which I said that it's really about time
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:27.200]   for Apple to start including manuals with their gear again.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:29.600]   I'm not even talking about a big thick paper manual,
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.840]   but I think that when you amidst all the welcome
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.240]   to the brand new device videos that you get,
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.920]   there should be, oh, by the way, here is immediately
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.960]   without having to, without having to ask for it,
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.680]   here's some incredibly cool professionally produced videos
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.240]   that will watch through every single,
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:48.000]   to give you the five minute bootcamp on all the gestures
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.520]   you're gonna need to know, 'cause, you know,
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.160]   we picked up a lot of the stuff of what needed to know
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.000]   from that iPad.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   - Well, they kind of started that.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.720]   In the control panel for the mouse,
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:58.920]   I love the little videos that you get explaining
[00:59:58.920 --> 00:59:59.800]   how that works.
[00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:00.920]   I think that's a nice touch.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.120]   - I think that's more of an internationalization thing,
[01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.200]   as much as anything else.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.800]   But I'm talking about, given that we have these iOS devices
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:09.840]   that have to be tethered to iTunes before to do anything,
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.320]   I think that's a good time for it to say,
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.960]   "By the way, would you like me to download and install
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.160]   all these instruction, this five minute instructional video?"
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.560]   Because there are, I think, the first time
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.440]   that someone shows you, "Oh, why are you going
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.880]   "dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip, dip,
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:24.720]   "to try to scroll back to the top?
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.720]   "Don't you know you tapped them anymore?"
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.480]   Wow, how do you do that?
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.320]   - That's amazing.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.160]   - Everybody knows that.
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.520]   Well, I didn't know that until I actually,
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.600]   someone actually showed it to me for the first time.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.320]   - So there is a problem in the, there's inconsistency,
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.560]   as Adam says, you know,
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.920]   buttons are placed in different places.
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.280]   But the gestures, it's very,
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.320]   usually there's no visual clues.
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.120]   So, and that's, as Andy said,
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.640]   someone showed you how to do something.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:48.960]   You know, you, more often than not,
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.440]   you'll never be able to pick up on a gesture
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:51.880]   by looking at the screen.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.120]   So, you know, it's that sort of hidden complexity.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.600]   How do you actually tell someone,
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.240]   or how do you show someone what to do
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.720]   when there are no visual clues to do that?
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.280]   And I think that trips a lot of people up really,
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.360]   and they don't know they can swipe
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.240]   to move things out the way,
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.440]   or if they swipe, I actually want particular
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.840]   by a separate menu pops up,
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.640]   and I think that's probably the difficulty, really.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:09.040]   - It's funny, I got actually more manuals
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:11.440]   for these hair care products that I get for my magic touch.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.560]   (laughing)
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.400]   Too bad I didn't read it.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   See, I'm starting to look like that girl.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:19.320]   (laughing)
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.160]   - Harlow Thomas?
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.400]   Well, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.000]   I just a flip down a little bit more.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.240]   (laughing)
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.560]   - Also,
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.760]   Jan Winter, the Rolling Stone.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.680]   This was, I loved this article.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:37.840]   He's talking, he's talking to adage,
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.120]   and he says, oh, you know, people,
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.640]   these magazines that are rushing to put out iPads,
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.960]   people are gonna be reading the paper rolling stone
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.800]   for years to come.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.440]   (laughing)
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.080]   Especially with all the free time they have now,
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:53.080]   now that they're so close to retirement age.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.240]   (buzzing)
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.240]   - Just talk about a guy in denial.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.080]   It's, I mean, am I my wrong?
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.720]   I mean, isn't this, he says,
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.240]   what's your take on adage,
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.960]   and what's your take at selling magazines
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.600]   in the iPad and other tablets?
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.640]   - Jan Winter, who used to be hip, right?
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.800]   He's the guy who started rolling stone.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.120]   In fact, it's funny because at the beginning
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.680]   of the interview, he says, you know,
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.280]   I started rolling stone for 7,500 bucks.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280]   Nowadays, it started a magazine,
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.120]   his millions of dollars.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:23.800]   He completely ignores the fact that people are now
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.760]   doing the same thing he did on the web only,
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.560]   you know, instead of a zine,
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.840]   now you just do it on the web.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.360]   He says, it's the same thing pretty much
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.140]   that I've said about the web.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.880]   The tablet itself is a really fun device.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.840]   Some people are gonna enjoy it a lot and use it.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.240]   Some people aren't.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.880]   On this plane is private jet.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.920]   One person's traveling with a tablet.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.520]   One's not.
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.600]   I guess it's just two of them.
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.240]   - Well, because they're on a private plane,
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.520]   they hire people to read two of them.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.880]   - Yes.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.640]   There's a certain trendiness to the thing.
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.200]   And it's a great thing, but is it a good magazine thing?
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:57.440]   It's a good magazine reading device absolutely, he says,
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.800]   and where it becomes more convenient to read the magazine
[01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.360]   on that, that's got the advantage,
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:03.320]   but that's more convenient only if you're only,
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.880]   if you're traveling, if you're away from home.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.920]   Otherwise, he says, it's still easier
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.760]   to read the physical magazine,
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.280]   which is widely available on newsstands.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   Are there any newsstands anymore?
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:19.840]   On newsstands at airports and everywhere.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.160]   Well, the thing is he's not incorrect
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.640]   because given that if I want to read people magazine,
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:27.680]   it's only available in print for one thing.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.280]   Secondly, if it were available via subscription,
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.640]   step one is to spend at least $250
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.600]   on a color touchscreen tablet.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.200]   And frankly, as much as I'm curious to see
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.600]   why people were talking about Pippa Middleton's backside,
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.760]   I don't think I want to spend $250 for tablets
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.760]   to find out exactly what that happened.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.720]   - But a lot of people have tablets now.
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:50.240]   I mean, and more and more will.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.720]   He says it's going to take decades before people start.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.800]   - I think it's going to take years.
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.800]   It really, not decades, but a few more years.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.000]   It really is a generational sort of thing.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.400]   If not for the fact, in the other room,
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.840]   I've got a book, a paper book that I purchased via Amazon.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.120]   And the only reason why I bought it was because,
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.840]   number one, it was out of print for about 20, 30 years.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.120]   So I couldn't buy it digitally.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.600]   And B, I was indeed that interested in the book
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:17.720]   in order to actually buy a paper copy of it
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.440]   rather than just simply put it in the back of my head
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.000]   that some point if this comes back into print.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.520]   Or if some enterprising young chap were to scan it
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.440]   and then turn it to an illegal e-pub
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.600]   to download it that way.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.200]   So I'm not, I am, I am an old guy
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:35.200]   compared to about 40%, probably 42% of the population.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.800]   And even so, I don't like buying things on paper
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.000]   unless I absolutely have to.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.960]   So it's going to take a few more years
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.880]   for the entire generation to sort of fill up.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.040]   But until then-- - He does use
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.880]   the word of generational himself.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.440]   - Yeah, it's also until the revenue model for them changes
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.280]   in terms of the number of eyeballs
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.120]   and the revenue they can get for ads.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.680]   'Cause it's interesting 'cause I was thrilled
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:04:59.520]   that Wired Magazine, which I've subscribed
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.320]   to the print version for years,
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.000]   just did their subscription thing
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.120]   and I just signed up for it.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.080]   And I have access to all the digital versions
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.840]   which I like those better.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.480]   But my wife asked me,
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.920]   well, would you just get the digital version now?
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.680]   And I said, well, no, because if I get the print
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:15.920]   and digital, it's actually cheaper.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:18.000]   And I was thinking about why is it cheaper
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.840]   because they filled in me as an eyeball
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.360]   to sell ads to the print vendors
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.920]   so they can make their money, right?
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.240]   Or that's my theory as to why.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.760]   - All the other Wall Street Journal,
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.000]   I tried to cancel, you know, I said,
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.280]   I don't want the paper, I'm reading it on the iPad.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.640]   And they said, good, that'll cost you more.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.640]   And I said, wait a minute, I don't want the paper.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.480]   I'm reading it right.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.840]   Good, that'll cost you more.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.360]   - Because they need you as that number for their advertisers
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.840]   so that they can say we have this many print subscribers
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.360]   and this is what that's gonna cost, right?
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.520]   So when everybody moves over and everybody's on
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.920]   the digital version, then they can start charging more for that.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:52.240]   And then I think, so that's why it's gonna be years
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.400]   and it's a generational thing.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.240]   - No, I still think that's actually--
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.440]   - I always follow the money, right?
[01:05:56.440 --> 01:05:58.080]   You could follow the money.
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.960]   - Yeah, I don't think they've quite nailed the experience yet.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.880]   I still don't find a compelling thing
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.600]   to actually read a magazine on the iPad.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.200]   Although I do enjoy it, but I don't think there's any,
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.600]   there's been like a killer magazine app yet
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.840]   that really makes it, some are too sophisticated,
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:16.600]   some are too not sophisticated enough.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.040]   So I still think there's still a lot of work they need to do
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.040]   to make it into a really compelling experience.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.360]   - I almost think the problem is--
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.200]   - Let's make a good option.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.280]   - Is that it's magazines.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:29.080]   I think that new publications made sense there
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.920]   and it's trying to get these old publications
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.160]   into this new medium, that's maybe not gonna ever work too well.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.320]   That's like saying, well, how can we get film
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.440]   into a digital camera?
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.760]   It's just not, doesn't it make sense
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.160]   if you're gonna start the next Rolling Stone
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.400]   you don't do a print magazine to begin with?
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.360]   - Mm.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.720]   - No?
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.000]   Anyway, interesting.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.080]   It's worth reading, I guess he's not completely cracked,
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.360]   but it just felt to me like, well,
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.800]   here's somebody who doesn't get it.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.920]   - Yeah, part of it is just,
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.600]   it's the, you will only crack the digital transition
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.320]   when people can answer the question,
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.200]   is this going to be available in this medium
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.520]   and anticipate the answer's gonna be yes.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.840]   That's definitely the answer when you look at music,
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.320]   that's almost always the answer when you're looking at books.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.800]   When you're looking at magazines though,
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:17.520]   especially comic books, you're like,
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:19.280]   what's the point of even looking at this point,
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.760]   I'm pretty sure that I'm not gonna be able to find it digitally.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.840]   Let's do a speed round 'cause there's a lot more stories
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.000]   and I wanna get to your picks of the week.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   Does anybody give any credit to the rumor
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.840]   that Apple's next MacBook Air will not have an Intel chip
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:35.360]   in it but will have an ARM A5, ARM-based A5 chip?
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.200]   - No.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.040]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:37.880]   - Four no's.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.240]   - It's the perfect experimenting.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.720]   - Doesn't make any sense.
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:41.640]   - No.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:47.240]   - However, Intel is making a big deal at Computex
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:50.800]   in Taiwan yesterday about these ultra notebooks
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.000]   that are super thin, super light,
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.760]   they're really just MacBook Airs.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.400]   (laughing)
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.760]   Two pounds, same thickness as the MacBook Air.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.120]   I mean, everybody in the PC history
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.680]   is trying to make a MacBook Air clone.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.840]   But these will be based on the IV bridge chips,
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.440]   which are shrunk down versions of Sandy Bridge.
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:10.480]   - And that's what we'll see in the next MacBook Air, I think.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.840]   - And that isn't gonna be available till 2012.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:14.960]   So if you've been waiting on a MacBook Air,
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.480]   it's not gonna happen this year.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.320]   I agree with you.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.640]   - I might still see the Sandy Bridge versions,
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.480]   I think.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.320]   - You think?
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.160]   - I think so.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.840]   I think the truth for it now.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.560]   And the Thunderbolts as well,
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.960]   the Consellin' Off a lot of MacBook Airs,
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.800]   if they just include Thunderbolts and--
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.640]   - They just bought a MacBook Air, though.
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.280]   - I just don't want it.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.120]   - Possibly.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.280]   - Mac Defender, what do you guys think about this?
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:38.240]   There's a new variant now that says,
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.920]   you don't need the admin password.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:43.080]   This is the, really the kind of the coming A of Aged
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.320]   for the Mac platform, the first Mac malware.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.480]   It's spreading via poisoned Google image search.
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.720]   You get a pop-up, we've talked about it before,
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.440]   that says, you know, Apple Security Center,
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:55.680]   no such thing.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.240]   You have a virus, download our Mac Defender,
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:00.200]   anti-virus, it'll clean it all up.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.080]   Apparently, it's swamping Apple's tech support lines.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.120]   Ed Bot, who is a Windows guy, let's face it,
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:10.520]   says he talked to somebody anonymous at AppleCare,
[01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.680]   said it's practically all the calls we're getting.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.600]   And Apple's saying, we won't fix it for you.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.880]   They have published a tech note on how to do it,
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.200]   but they're saying we won't do it for you.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.240]   - I think that's 'cause 10.6.8,
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.800]   it was again in the developer notes,
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.160]   it has a fix for it and it's gonna scan and remove it.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.560]   - Yay, will it scan and remove this new variant?
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.400]   We don't know.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.080]   - Yeah.
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.960]   - It looks like the same sort of basic advice
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.840]   that worked with the old ones,
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.680]   gonna work with the new ones too.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.640]   - I've unchecked the, I personally unchecked the box
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:43.640]   and so far I've prefered it.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.480]   - Yes, turn that off.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.640]   - So it's automatically opened, trusted, safe things.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.760]   Which is the pain in the butt 'cause I really enjoyed it
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.800]   when you download PDFs, they open up bad things,
[01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.160]   but people are, yes, I self-censored
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:56.680]   so that we would still have our rating.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.920]   - People are strange.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.800]   When you've got strange hair,
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:04.880]   the kid who sold was his white iPhone
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.480]   is being sued by Apple.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:10.960]   Please, come on, really?
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:14.680]   Really isn't it enough just to sue Samsung?
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.680]   He's got, I mean, come on,
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:18.800]   this kid was selling what, it was a kit, right?
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.600]   That would turn your iPhone white.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.800]   - Right, do you have any back down now?
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.480]   Is it just a, it was just a season to sister,
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.320]   doesn't it, don't you?
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.560]   - Oh, they're not suing him, they're just saying stop.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.400]   - Yeah.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.480]   - Oh, well that's all right.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.000]   (laughs)
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.320]   Stop, I don't know why they would want him to stop though.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.560]   What's wrong with that?
[01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.160]   - Wasn't some question about whether he parts were sourced
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.960]   from or, ah, maybe he has, all right.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:41.960]   - Yeah.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:44.320]   - I shouldn't get in these legal things.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.320]   Anybody with hair like mine should not get involved.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.960]   Let's see.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.520]   According to Nielsen,
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:56.600]   Android's lead over iOS may have stopped growing.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:00.080]   We may have kind of reached a stable point
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.480]   where iOS, BlackBerry and Android
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.000]   all have kind of their market share.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.040]   Smartphones are 37% of all US mobile phones.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.240]   Wouldn't you think it'd be more than that,
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.840]   but that's all, just about a third of all mobile phones
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:15.120]   are smartphones in the US.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:19.280]   And Android's piece of the pie, yes, is number one,
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.200]   but it's no bigger in April than it was
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.960]   the last time Nielsen surveyed the field.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:31.520]   Google's held steady at 36% of the 37%.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.800]   Apple's got 26% of the 37%.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:35.160]   Am I confusing you now?
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.960]   And BlackBerry has 23% of the 37%.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.560]   And those numbers haven't changed.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.480]   - Yeah, I think we're seeing the boundaries of the advantages
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:51.280]   of having multiple handsets on multiple carriers.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:52.800]   That it wasn't gonna be something
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:54.360]   that was gonna take over the entire industry,
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.240]   but it took a while for enough good handsets to be out there
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.080]   running at least Android 2.2 or 2.3
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:02.600]   before it could seek its own level.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.680]   So I think it'll go up a little bit more,
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.520]   but I think it's not going to become the Microsoft
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.520]   in a Microsoft Apple sandwich.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.640]   iPhone owners are more likely than Android aficionados
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:17.800]   to download apps, stream music or watch videos,
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.320]   but individual Android users who do that kind of stuff
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.400]   tend to gobble significantly more data.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.320]   Nielsen analyzed 65,000 cell phone bills.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.840]   That must have been fun.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.480]   - Not a surprise because Apple makes that technology
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.320]   really, really easy for everybody to do.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.680]   So that flats out to a very, very smaller average.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.640]   Android people who know how to do it,
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:43.280]   they have overcome so many tremendous obstacles to stream.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.080]   They know that it is their intention
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:47.920]   to just keep all the five best doctor who episodes
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:51.800]   on a constant loop on their 4G bandwidth over and over again.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.920]   - Well, this should encourage people
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.840]   who are worried about the 5G bandwidth caps.
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.840]   The average Android user consumed 582 megs of data a month
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.760]   compared to 492 for the average iPhone owner.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.440]   Both of them well below the cap.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:11.000]   But do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   I think that covers everything.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:14.880]   Oh no, good news.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.920]   I guess if you follow Consumer Reports,
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.040]   good news for Apple owners.
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:22.920]   Apple laptops and Apple care dominated.
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.640]   Dominated the Consumer Report rankings for technology
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.720]   for computers, the Apple MacBook Air 13-inch,
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:34.200]   the number one 13-inch computer across the board,
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.600]   the Sony Viya, way below the next one up.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:41.400]   Apple care far better than any other tech support.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:48.120]   - I guess that's how much of a surprise.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.320]   - How much of a surprise?
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.320]   Look what consumers options are if they don't buy an Apple.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.320]   It's usually best buy an Oh my God.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:59.560]   Here's a knife with a serrated, rusted edge.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.760]   Take your pick of which one you want to go through
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.240]   between cutting off your own least used finger
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.800]   or actually trying to get the people at best
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:10.520]   buy to actually do something productive to fix your machine.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.600]   - Alaska Airlines dumping its flight manuals, giving pilots.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.800]   - An iPad.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   (laughing)
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:21.440]   - This is just, by the way, the iPad with good reader.
[01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.440]   - Mm. - Yeah.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.040]   - One of the reports I was reading says a big reason
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.480]   for that is just the savings and fuel
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.600]   because the waste of weight.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.240]   - 50 pounds of manuals.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.480]   - It's a legitimate thing.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.320]   - Yeah.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:38.960]   - They've seen those manuals been way up to 25 pounds
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:41.440]   and it's gonna be a significant weight savings.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.800]   - And not to mention fewer back and muscle injuries
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.200]   caused by pilots carrying flight bags.
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.040]   - Yeah. - That's what they say.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.400]   - You think of it. - That's what they say.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.480]   - It's still fast as a class one device
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:53.280]   so they have to switch off when they land
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.120]   and when they take off.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.840]   - That's not so good for a manual.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.520]   I'd like to read the manual right now, but we're landing.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.200]   (laughing)
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.280]   It will result in the savings
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.320]   about 2.4 million pieces of paper.
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:06.480]   That's good.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.960]   - Yeah, I mean, that's an immense amount of paperwork
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.680]   that just to keep those manuals updated.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.800]   - Can you imagine? - Is a huge expense
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.080]   and also a huge pain in the butt
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:16.360]   that pilots just don't like at all.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.640]   And also with less paper in those bags,
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.520]   it's more room they can have for smuggling watches
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.360]   and alcohol.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.360]   (laughing)
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.200]   - Enough alcohol.
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.160]   - So the pilots, the pilots union was 100% on board.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.240]   - They were happy about that.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.120]   - The most expensive iPad apps are $1,000.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:35.120]   There's one for people studying for the bar, bar max.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.160]   I phone an iPad, they allow law students
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.120]   to study for bar exams in California and New York.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.520]   I guess if you're trying to be a lawyer,
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.640]   a thousand bucks for an app is not so bad.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.760]   There's another one called Alchemist SMS,
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.560]   which is geared towards steel makers
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:51.900]   in the recycling industry,
[01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:55.400]   a tool for calculating costs for raw materials
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:59.680]   and solo wolf vision, also a thousand dollars.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.240]   I just wanted for the name,
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.080]   'cause it would match my hair.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:05.720]   It's a technology that allows control over
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.560]   wolf vision visualizers.
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.080]   They're high end projectors.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.200]   - I thought that wasn't that a Rucker Howard character
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.560]   in a 1987 pilot that wasn't picked up by ABC.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:19.320]   - Wolf vision?
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.000]   - Solo wolf vision.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.520]   (laughing)
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:23.800]   Damn it solo.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.920]   I know you think you got special powers,
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.720]   but you're gonna bring in that perk by the book this time.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.360]   (laughing)
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.400]   And you're getting a new partner.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.880]   - I work solo.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.640]   - Not this time wolf vision.
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.640]   - Rucker Howard is wolf vision.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.680]   - I am seeking representation for TV writing.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.840]   That's just disgusting.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.840]   I'm magic.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.000]   I can't even have to go, can deliver to your production.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.640]   - In a world where a man who looks like Wolverine
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:50.920]   can write television scripts like this.
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:54.720]   Let's take a break and we're gonna get our picks of the week.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.720]   I'm, who am I to say you look like Wolverine?
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:58.720]   - I don't know.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.320]   I look like it.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.440]   - You've kind of got the Wolverine hair from here.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.280]   - Oh, I've got it from here.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.000]   If your sideburns in my hair were set.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.200]   - I should do an ad for Lanza healing volume,
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.560]   which is what I've, no, I'm sorry.
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.960]   What do I have in my hair right now?
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.120]   - The mask.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:16.960]   - It's the mask.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.800]   - Thank you.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.480]   - You're obviously attuned to hair development.
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.560]   - Pay attention, yeah.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.720]   I'm doing moi moi hair mask, deep moisture therapy
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.180]   for dehydrated hair.
[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:32.600]   But that's not who's doing the ad.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.960]   This particular break, this break we're talking about
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.080]   audible.com.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.880]   I love audible.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.120]   I don't have to say it.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.360]   I know you've heard me say it.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:46.160]   It's the ultimate bookstore online because it's audio books.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:47.720]   And I gotta tell you,
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:51.160]   oh wow, interview with the vampire.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.200]   Now unabridged.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.440]   Oh, I'm a big an rice fan.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.920]   And I have to confess, I listened to the abridged version,
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.200]   but this is one of my favorite books.
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.440]   Simon Vance is one of my favorite narrators.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.280]   Look, here's the deal.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.840]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak right now,
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.520]   you'll be signing up for that gold account.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:10.000]   That's a book a month.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.200]   But, so your first book's free, your first month's free,
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.440]   and you cancel it anytime.
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   So in effect, you get this book for free.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.400]   This is a great book.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:18.160]   Andy, I'm sure you have some recommendations.
[01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:19.000]   I just love Simon.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.880]   Let me just listen to Simon Vance for a little bit,
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.320]   'cause he's very soothing.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:27.600]   - Confidentially, don't be afraid.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.240]   Just start to tape.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.400]   - Oh boy.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.840]   - And then he reached out over the length of the table.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.360]   - He's less than. - The boy recoiled,
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.920]   sweat running down the sides of his face.
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.680]   The vampire clamped a hand by the boys,
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:42.880]   children said, believe me, I won't hurt you.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.360]   - Believe me, I won't hurt you.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.600]   Hmm, I got it down with this.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.800]   I've read this book like eight times,
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:49.800]   but I still gotta get it.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.920]   It's such a good book.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:52.440]   Audible.com here.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.280]   This is the problem.
[01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.360]   You go to Audible.com,
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.920]   and you've got 75,000 titles to choose from.
[01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:01.240]   It's kind of hard to limit yourself to just one.
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.200]   So sign up for the gold account.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.480]   Try your first book.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:06.880]   It's free, and you know, what the hell?
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.960]   If you end up being an Audible listener,
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.120]   you'll be happy, because from now on,
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.240]   when you're in the car, you're at the gym,
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.280]   you're clean in house,
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   you've got great books to listen to.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.200]   I am a huge Audible fan.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.000]   What do you listen into these days, Andy?
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.600]   I don't know if you prepared a pick for us or not.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:25.440]   - No, no, I won a little bit deep catalog this time,
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:27.720]   'cause I was looking for my next book to download,
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.800]   'cause I've got a couple of them back.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:30.760]   - Wait a minute, this is a kids book.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.520]   It's a kids book, but it's a wonderfully written kids book.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.400]   It's Henry Hug is by--
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.240]   - I love it.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.080]   - Henry Hug is by Beverly Cleo.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:37.920]   - I love all very stuff.
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:39.280]   She's my favorite.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:41.120]   - Exactly, yeah.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.800]   I wouldn't be surprised if this was the first incident
[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.360]   of a lifetime of, oh my God,
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.040]   that was like the most awesome book ever.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.160]   I've got to now go by every single book
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.680]   that this character appears in,
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:56.840]   which George Lucas would then use to his great advantage
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:58.680]   with the Star Wars series for me.
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:02.800]   But it's narrated by Neil Patrick Harris,
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.360]   who does a really, really great job with it.
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:07.560]   The fact of the matter is though,
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.120]   there's so many times that I download these
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.480]   like 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 hour books.
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.440]   And sometimes there are always those spans
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:15.160]   where a great span that is a chapter
[01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:16.560]   you're not really interested in,
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.760]   but you got to sort of stick through it
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:20.120]   because that's where you get to the good stuff.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:23.360]   This, the great thing about a book like this is it's short,
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.760]   it's two and a half hours.
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:28.640]   It has a strong narrative with clearly defined characters
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.320]   with a beginning and a middle and an end.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:33.120]   This was not an author who was trying to impress you
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:36.040]   about her ability to crystallize all of humanity
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.960]   and its ineffability into a new shared experience
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.280]   that would elevate society.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.720]   No, she had an idea about a little boy
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.720]   who finds a dog named Ribsy,
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.160]   an enormous dog named Ribsy,
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:49.160]   and his problems in trying to get him fed
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.280]   and take care of him and make sure
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.360]   that he's a good dog and all this sort of stuff.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.760]   So it's not cloying, it's not stupid, it doesn't talk,
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.800]   it helps that Cleary was not writing a book
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.560]   to talk down to kids, she was just trying
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.800]   to tell a really, really good story.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.640]   Also, the chapters themselves are rather episodic.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.920]   So by the time you get back,
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.880]   this is essentially one week's worth of commutes
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:12.200]   to work and back in which you'll get through one chapter
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.200]   pretty much through every commute.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:16.280]   You'll be done with it by the end of the week,
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.960]   but you will be very, very pleased to say,
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:22.880]   after a day of, okay, so today I had to tell a family
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.160]   whose house burned down who lost all their pets
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.200]   that unfortunately because the envelope was postmarked
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:31.160]   in the wrong post office, I'm not giving them coverage,
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.800]   let's return to a simpler time when people were happy
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.000]   and things sort of worked out.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.320]   And I didn't think of myself as a total bastard
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.160]   who will do anything for to keep his job.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.120]   I don't think it worked in the insurance industry, Andy,
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.360]   but that's how I imagine it being.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.920]   If any of our listeners work in the insurance industry,
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.680]   I'm sure your experience is different.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:50.240]   I'm sure you're not the person who's very,
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:52.920]   you know, your boss does not come into your office
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.920]   saying, "Jekins, this kid isn't dying of cancer fast enough.
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:59.280]   Find a way to terminate the policy board."
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.880]   I don't care which one.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:02.800]   You know what, this is a kids book
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:05.080]   and they have all of the Beverly Cleary books.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.160]   These are the greatest books ever.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.400]   I read most of these to my kids.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.360]   If you've got kids or young adults
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.320]   in the family, Audible's great for them.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.160]   And some people might say,
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.640]   "Well, I liked reading my kids and I do too,
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.640]   "but giving them books they can listen to."
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:20.440]   We know from studies shows that they do read
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.720]   at a higher reading level quicker.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.360]   They fall in love with books and they listen more.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.160]   They've got the whole Ramona series,
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.520]   the whole Henry Huggan series.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.080]   She is one of my favorite children's authors.
[01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.680]   That's so cool, Andy.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.520]   Great pick.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.680]   I like Audible because you really can go deep catalog like that.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.200]   As a matter of fact, I first discovered
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.800]   that all these books were available
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.720]   when I was so disgusted by the trailer
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.680]   for the Mr. Popper's Penguins.
[01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:51.600]   Oh, what a great book.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.440]   Whoopee.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.920]   Again, a great book.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.920]   Again, I saw the trailer with Jim Carrey
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:58.560]   and I'm thinking, "Oh, I don't remember the fart jokes
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:01.080]   "or the time when Mr. Popper got hit in the nuts, but okay,
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.920]   "I'm sure it's in there somewhere."
[01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.320]   And so I looked for the Kindle edition,
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.680]   which is coming out in two weeks.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:07.920]   So I pre-ordered that one.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.000]   And then I saw a link to the Audible edition,
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.640]   which I almost bought, but I listened to the preview.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.400]   And unfortunately, this particular title
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.600]   of Audible is listening.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:19.240]   You don't get enough of a sample to find out
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:21.480]   if the narrator is really, really good or not.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:23.120]   Because if he settles it down from the tone,
[01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:24.680]   he adopts for the first couple of pages.
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.520]   That's fine.
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.760]   If he doesn't, then you click, keep clicking and say,
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.160]   "Oh, you're also suggesting, oh, Henry Huggan,
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:31.320]   "I love those books.
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.160]   "I'm so tired of it."
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:33.600]   You know, it's unfortunate because they put Jim Carrey
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:34.680]   on the cover of this book.
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:36.600]   But it's such a great book.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.800]   It's probably, anyway, get the Beverly Clary books
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:40.640]   in the Henry Huggan's books.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.080]   They're wonderful.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:43.040]   Good recommendation.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.160]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:46.080]   Now I've got a whole bunch of more books.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:49.880]   I got an Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:50.720]   Give it a try today.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.560]   You're gonna love it.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.400]   We just love it.
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:53.600]   It plays on your all your eye devices,
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:55.800]   but also on the Zoom, the Kindle,
[01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:57.400]   and many GPS devices.
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:59.720]   And even on your computer, I listen to books all the time.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:01.440]   In fact, sometimes now when I can't sleep
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.120]   instead of turning on the light and getting a book,
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:06.640]   I'll just plug my headphones into my iPhone
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.120]   'cause they've got a great iPhone app,
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.120]   and I'll listen, and it's great.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.120]   It puts me right to sleep.
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:10.960]   Love it.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.200]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.560]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.960]   Let's start with Mr. Maccast, Adam Christensen.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:21.800]   - You're gonna start with me.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:22.640]   All right.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.920]   I have, you know, it's funny 'cause everybody,
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.600]   a lot of people were really into Pandora,
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.520]   and I just really started getting into it
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:32.880]   over the last year on my iOS devices.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:34.760]   And I love Pandora,
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:38.960]   and I wanted to find something for listening on my Mac.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:40.360]   And so I did some poking around,
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:41.880]   and I think, I can't remember if I found this
[01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:42.760]   in the App Store or not,
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.280]   but there's a great application called Pyarchast,
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.400]   P-Y-R-C-A-S-T,
[01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.400]   and it runs as a little menu bar icon and also a little window
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:53.120]   and lets you log into your Pandora
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.840]   and access all of your Pandora
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.640]   while you're running on your Mac.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:00.000]   And then the other thing that I'm really into right now
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.800]   is all App Apple's AirPlay stuff,
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.360]   and I have an Airport Express connected to some speakers.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.880]   So I coupled this with sort of a side pick.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.120]   I'm gonna make a side pick here of Rogamiba's Airfoil,
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:13.440]   which will let you route audio from your Mac
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.440]   to an Airport Express, you know,
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.280]   Airspeakers or AirPlay device.
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.960]   And so I use those two when I'm sitting in my office working
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:22.600]   and stuff like that to put on Pandora
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.120]   in the background of my office,
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.720]   and it's just an awesome combination, so.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.800]   We really like that application.
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.040]   - We gotta get you a Sonos.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.440]   (laughing)
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.160]   - You can get rid of all that stuff and just does it.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:35.120]   But this is good, I'm gonna take a look at this,
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:35.960]   Pyrecast.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:38.400]   Now you can listen to Pandora on their web app,
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.240]   but this is better.
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.160]   - I wanted something that was just on the background
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.360]   on my Mac kind of integrated,
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.400]   and I like the fact that it was a little menu bar icon.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.720]   I can go up there, if I wanna check out the information,
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:51.640]   I can see it has a direct link to iTunes.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:53.800]   It's not running as a flash thing.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.880]   At least Pandora used to run as a flash app
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:57.240]   in the web browser, I think, right?
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.640]   - And who wants that flash running all the time?
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.360]   - He uses so many cycles.
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.520]   - Yeah, Pyrecast.
[01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.720]   - Pyrecast, yeah.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.680]   - I like it.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:07.520]   Thank you, Adam.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:10.880]   Andy, not co, you're Pick of the Week.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:15.960]   - My Pick of the Week is that most exciting of product,
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.320]   the iPad case.
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:18.320]   (laughing)
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.840]   Now, it takes a lot for me to actually think
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.000]   that an iPad case is cool, and I've seen all,
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.760]   I've seen all the cool kinds of,
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.160]   oh, look, this one's made out of the leather.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.680]   Oh, look, this one is designed to look like an Etch-a-Sketch.
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:34.680]   Oh, look, this one transforms into the head of Lewis CK.
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:35.640]   I don't care.
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:38.600]   It's nice and cool, but I'm not gonna spend 40, 50, 60 bucks
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.600]   on this sort of thing.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.720]   Until someone showed me what I believe,
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.480]   if you're buying an iPad case for the purpose of it
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.120]   being a really cool looking iPad case,
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.680]   you have to go to oboranddesign.com.
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:50.840]   - Oh, we have one of these.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:51.680]   I love them.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:52.520]   - I love them, yeah.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:55.720]   - These really cool leather covers,
[01:26:55.720 --> 01:26:58.600]   they have got about two dozen different kind of designs.
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.680]   - I just have to up the road to peace, Andy.
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.160]   - Yeah, some of them are very low to the ringsy.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:07.080]   Some of them are more Japanese style,
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.400]   some of them are Celtic style, but man,
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.440]   these are things are beautiful.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:14.040]   Leather designs, pewter fittings,
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:18.040]   you get little, they give you a little toys in the box,
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:21.400]   partly because they are charging 130 bucks for these.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:24.720]   But if, my feeling is that, again,
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:26.760]   if you're spending money for a really cool case,
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:28.560]   don't get a half cool case.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.320]   Get the one that will unfortunately bring
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.600]   all your work to a standstill
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.640]   because people want to know exactly,
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:35.920]   you know, where did you get that case?
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.880]   Oh my God, it's so cool.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.000]   And also, I suppose the fact that it's got
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.040]   like business card holders and a couple,
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:43.560]   and a pocket for papers in it,
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:46.920]   well, that means it's more of a business productivity tool
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.760]   as well.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.600]   - Absolutely.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.000]   - Yeah, it's acceptable.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.360]   - Factoring the $30, $40 you would spend for a boring case,
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.640]   and let's say the $80 you would have spent
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:56.760]   for a business card holder,
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:59.600]   and the $30 you would have spent for a pack of leather
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.720]   envelopes for your papers,
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.560]   and this is actually quite a bargain.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:05.240]   But once again, if you want something that's really pretty
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:07.360]   and really cool, why not get something that's actually
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.800]   really pretty and really cool as opposed to,
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:12.480]   otherwise it's not cheap,
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.480]   but I think it's also a very good failure.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.800]   - Oh, they're gorgeous.
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:16.640]   It really is a beautiful thing.
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.760]   - They're up the road in Santa Rosa, very near us,
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.360]   and they stopped by with one,
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.480]   which I use for a while, and Lisa's been using it,
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:23.840]   and they're just beautiful.
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:27.080]   - They could vouch for the quality and the,
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.440]   there's nothing cheap looking about these things.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:32.280]   It doesn't look like they just actually found a source
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.320]   in Shenzhen who just stamps these out of vinyl,
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.720]   and it falls apart after two weeks.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.200]   These really are very, very handsome,
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.040]   we produced them. - Absolutely.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:40.560]   - Good pick.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.120]   And I'm gonna let Don McAllister steal my pick,
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.080]   but I guess it really wasn't much of a surprise.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:47.200]   No, no, because this is a big story,
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.080]   and I want you to tell it.
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.880]   - Right.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.360]   - This is the, this thing is full of hype.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:54.800]   It's all about hype.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.640]   - It's all about hype.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:57.560]   - I'm fascinated, and I'm glad you,
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:59.240]   'cause I wanna know about this.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.240]   - Yeah, it's a brilliant application.
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:03.320]   Basically, it's two ex-Apple employees
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:06.400]   who've left Apple and have started up their own company.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:09.080]   I think they've done HTML editor before,
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:11.560]   but this is a brand new application.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.400]   Basically, it's a nap that allows you
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:16.200]   to create HTML5 content for the web.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.280]   So what you can do is you can go in,
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:21.560]   you can animate images,
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.880]   insert movies, you can create interactive buttons.
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.320]   Basically, you can create a full website
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:30.040]   with this package if you wanted to,
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.320]   but it's just really, really easy to use.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.520]   It uses keyframes, so you can sort of animate things
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.920]   very, very quickly.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:38.280]   Just throw in a couple of images,
[01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:42.400]   grab an image, start selecting keyframes on a timeline,
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.880]   and then the actual image will actually animate
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:45.800]   in conjunction with the way
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.320]   that you've actually set up the keyframes.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:49.360]   It sounds complex, but it's very, very simple.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.760]   Within 10 minutes, you're up and running with it.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.200]   It's very, very easy to do.
[01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:54.520]   So you can create content if you just want to do,
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:56.640]   say, an invitation or something that you just want
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:58.200]   to post on the web you can do.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.120]   If you want to create an interactive graphic
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.160]   or an animated graphic that you want to embed
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.040]   on an existing web page, you can do that as well,
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.240]   or create a standalone web page.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.040]   You can also upload to Dropbox.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.640]   So if you create an interactive web page
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:14.760]   or an animated web page that you just want to
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.240]   let people have access to quickly,
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.960]   you can actually, from within the application,
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.880]   export to Dropbox directly.
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.120]   Send people the link and then they'll see
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:24.320]   this beautifully rendered HTML5 piece of content
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.240]   that you've created.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.040]   And of course, with a B&A HTML5,
[01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:29.000]   it will work on your desktop, it will work
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.640]   on your iPad or your iPhone, work on Android.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.680]   So, you know, it's, get you away from having to go
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:38.280]   to something like Flash and learn and understand
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.680]   how to use all the different animation controls
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.840]   within Flash, you just basically do it
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:43.880]   within this application and it creates the content
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:44.800]   for you automatically.
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:45.960]   - That's how they've been pitching it
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:49.600]   is basically is a Flash replacement that works on iOS.
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:53.160]   - It's a great way to, even on the,
[01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.560]   they give you some predefined templates,
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.240]   you know, template sizes, they even give you sizes
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:58.320]   for like standard ad inserts and stuff.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:01.720]   So you could, at a push, create your own sort of
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.200]   animated ads and stuff if you want to put them
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.680]   on your website and they're not Flash,
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:06.360]   they're actually HTML5.
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:09.040]   But very, very impressive, very easy to use.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.560]   - Really, really, really interesting.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.040]   $30 right now, that's their introductory price.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.440]   I was a little scared off because I saw
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.960]   some negative reviews saying it crashed
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:21.240]   or I wasn't able to save it.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.840]   But you haven't had any trouble with it?
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:25.200]   - Not really, well, they've since it's only
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:28.280]   it's a version one product, but they've since released
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.920]   1.0.1 which has sorted some of the bugs out.
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.000]   But now I've been using it most of today
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.920]   and it's been fine, no problems.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.800]   - Yeah, but very intrigued by it.
[01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.520]   And I was going to make it a tentative pick
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:43.360]   pending, you know, some bullet more bullet proofing.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.080]   But it sounds like it's ready for prime time.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:46.920]   That's exciting.
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:48.240]   - Yeah, I think I'm actually going to do,
[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.520]   there are tutorials on the site,
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:51.600]   but I think I'm going to do a tutorial on it next week.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.920]   - Excellent.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.400]   That puts me over the top.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:58.720]   Don's at screencasts online, great screencasts
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:31:59.600]   for all sorts of things.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:03.000]   It's too bad we don't have the smile software people
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.160]   on this week because of course you do
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:05.680]   their great screencasts for.

[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.280]   at screencastland.com.
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.520]   I'm very, very pleased with it.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.000]   It looks much different from the original version.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.920]   - Oh, I haven't seen it, let me go.
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:16.640]   - Oh yeah, well, I only launched it last night.
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:19.800]   So it's still relatively fresh.

[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:33.400]   and he's been doing it for quite some time.

[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.520]   - We could talk about whatever the hell iCloud is.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:56.360]   - Indeed.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.200]   - And all of the rest.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.960]   Adam Christensen, I'm sure will be covering it.

[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.960]   Pyrecast got pulled by Pandora.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:11.800]   - Oh, that's nice.
[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:12.640]   - From the app store.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:14.160]   So my pick isn't there.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.200]   So I'm gonna throw this out for everybody.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:19.440]   There's a great game for the iPad called From Days of Wonder
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.320]   based on a board game called Ticket to Ride.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:22.360]   Go get that instead.
[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:25.440]   - Well, you can still get Pyrecast from the website though, right?
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.640]   - I don't see it there.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.160]   - Oh, Penndorm might have killed it.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:33.600]   Oh, that's, well, we hope you all got it before it got killed.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.200]   Oh man.

[01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.480]   It was a good pick.
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:44.920]   It was too good, apparently.

[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:09.600]   behind you there?
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.160]   - That is Bates Hall constructed
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.560]   as part of the new McKim building,
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.760]   which replaced the old Boston street address
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:21.040]   in about 1895, the construction was completed.
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:21.880]   Beautiful.

[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:25.600]   and other private countries.

[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.000]   so much in my life.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.920]   So much as to be able to say, yep,

[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.800]   (laughing)
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:43.640]   - Thank you, Andy.

[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.760]   the neutralizers for an entire week.

[01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:00.120]   - Is that like, you know, I switched to using a paste
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:01.400]   instead of a gel.
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.280]   - I could tell.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.840]   - You know, I like it a lot better.
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:04.680]   (laughing)

[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:14.720]   This is how I'm gonna look from now on.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:16.960]   He says, I didn't know you were a wolf.
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:19.160]   - What are you, there's nothing in here you would like.
