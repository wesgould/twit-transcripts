[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.000]   Renee's here, Andy's here, and a visit from the original Mac Break Weekly panelist, David
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   Pogge of CBS Sunday morning.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.200]   We'll talk about CBS's big scoop.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.000]   Something's going to happen tomorrow.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.800]   What will it be?
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.200]   David has a theory.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.600]   We'll also talk about the big success for Apple Macintosh's in the last quarter and
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.000]   what we might see in the quarterly financials coming up in a couple of weeks in a new way
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.800]   to use your Apple watch.

[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.600]   We have assembled a lovely team of experts to talk about absolutely nothing.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   Starting with, I hear his chartle already, Andy Inaco from WGBH Boston.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   Hello, Andrew.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.700]   That's exactly the sort of introduction I like.
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.200]   I can live up to those expectations.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.000]   We've got nothing to say, and we've got lots of things to say about it or something.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.200]   I like the color cut.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.900]   You're not normally the most colorful person, but you've got this beautiful colorful baseball
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.900]   shirt, and I just like that.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.700]   Yeah, this is my idea of colorful in that, "Oh, look, it's actually like desaturated
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.700]   colors.
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.700]   I can deal with that."
[00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700]   Yeah.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.700]   It's pretty.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.000]   I bought it for a community edition of Pippin eight years ago and found out that it works
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.300]   for my daily wear as well.
[00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.900]   We got somebody who could sing Pippin joining us in a second, but first, Renee Ritchie.
[00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.800]   From youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.100]   Hello, Renee.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.200]   Wearing Giants, Black and Orange.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.600]   Thank you.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.400]   I was going to say I could sing Pippin, but none of us would be happy about it.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   Sure.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.900]   You know who can sing and play Pippin?
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.000]   Really pleased to have him on the show this week.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.600]   Our old friend, he's been on MacPray quickly many times, but not in quite a while.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.400]   David Pogue is joining us.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.200]   Hey, David.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.100]   Is it season everything has its time?
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.500]   People are like, "What podcast did I just tune into?"
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.060]   I bet you were in Pippin at some point.
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.100]   I conducted Pippin, in fact, in college.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.100]   See?
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.100]   See?
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.100]   I mean, people probably don't know.
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.500]   They know David from, of course, CBS this morning.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.900]   It's Sunday morning, right?
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:13.900]   Correct.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.900]   CBS Sunday morning.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.460]   But, and before that, the Scientific American show and before, I mean, David goes way back
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.900]   New York Times, the missing manuals.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.300]   Little iPhone review.
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.600]   Yeah, that iPhone review that lives forever.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.160]   But David is also a Broadway composer.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.560]   And do you ever do the parody songs you used to do so at Mac World Expo?
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.040]   Do you do those anymore?
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.400]   I do all the time.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.160]   Whenever, well, there hasn't been much on the speaking circuit lately, as you all know.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.240]   But when I do talks, I always arrange to have a keyboard.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.920]   And at the end, I'll do some of my song parodies.
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.480]   And I've kept doing new ones.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.480]   There's a new Twitter one.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.300]   There's a new Facebook one and so on.
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.900]   He's the, I was almost said you're the geeky weird al yank of it.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.180]   It's a, he's the geeky weird al yank of it.
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.100]   So you're the, you're the even geekier weird al yank of it.
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.100]   You were on the very first Mac break weekly.
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.540]   So you deserve to be here today.
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.540]   That's a good place to.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.140]   Well, especially because I have a book to plug is now my opportunity.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.660]   Now would be a great time.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.120]   We should mention, Dave is not doing the missing manuals anymore.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   No, I'm not.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.240]   O'Reilly has said not people don't buy computer books.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.880]   Oh, sorry about the focus there.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:28.880]   Oh my God.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.880]   Oh my, there we go.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.720]   You got the anti jazz fans, that hand filter.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.640]   Do not wave your hands, David.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.120]   Keep your hands below the camera.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   Okay.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.120]   I'll just remain frozen.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   Don't move.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.520]   It's in focus.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.600]   I, so yeah, so we're not, I'm not doing any more missing manuals.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.220]   Instead, Simon and Schuster has snapped up the idea of my writing computer books.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.660]   Happy to announce Mac unlocked now shipping.
[00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.140]   It's exactly the same thing as the missing manual, but now called miss Mac unlocked.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:05.940]   And coming out in two weeks is iPhone unlocked and the, the ebook is already available.
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.380]   I already available.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.980]   This one's in full color.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.740]   The Mac unlocked is in black and white and they're both gorgeous and brilliant and funny,
[00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.740]   if I may say so.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.520]   And much better focused than this camera.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.560]   And in two weeks, it's the end of the world as we know it.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.260]   And I have pre-ordered your newest book, how to prepare for clients.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.260]   Yes.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.500]   How to prepare for climate change.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.500]   So kind.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.500]   A practical guide.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.840]   There it is to surviving the chaos.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.580]   And when you were on Twitter a few weeks ago, I mentioned that I had already, I had had
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.900]   this thought about six months ago, you know, things are going to change.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.180]   I should probably think about what that means and I went out and bought a couple of books.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.460]   The uninhabitable earth.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.460]   That was so depressing.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.100]   I had to stop reading that.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.740]   And the, what was it, the sixth, seventh, eighth extinction.
[00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.740]   I can't remember.
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:02.780]   Apparently, we've had extinction events before, but they were kind of the bummed me out.
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.180]   But I think yours will, knowing you, yours will be an optimistic look at the end of the
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.180]   world.
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.780]   The first uplifting book about climate change is about action you can take.
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.980]   It's about control over your situation.
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.900]   Yeah, it's exactly what I was looking for.
[00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.060]   So I'm really pleased.
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.300]   It says I purchased it on December 13th, as you can see, which is.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.300]   And I thank you for your support.
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.300]   We're on Twitter.
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.300]   And everybody can pre-order.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.740]   It comes out January 26th.
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.900]   So thank you for being here.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.140]   It's really nice to see you, David.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.140]   We really appreciate it.
[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.140]   There, as I said, and by the way, one more thing not about me and my self-interest.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.220]   I would just like to say that it's great to see Andy and not co again.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.700]   We used to do stuff all the time back in the Mackerel days.
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:49.700]   And my favorite conversation was the one where I asked him if he ever has trouble getting
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.220]   people to spell his last name.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.620]   And I don't know if you still say this, Andy, but what you told me then was it's very easy.
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.780]   When you ask, how do you spell in not co, you say the first three letters stand for,
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.780]   I have no idea.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.780]   Yep.
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.500]   No, it's great talking to you too.
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.740]   I had to share this story with him.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.900]   My dad used to pick me up from the airport when I'd go travel and drive me home because
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.140]   he was very much a dad.
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.060]   "No, no, no, no, don't pay for parking.
[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.060]   Don't pay for parking.
[00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.060]   I'll drive you home.
[00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.060]   I'll pick you up."
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.740]   And it was great because I'd be away from the family for a couple of weeks.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.380]   So I get caught up.
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.340]   And I'd say, "So, Dad, what's new?
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:30.340]   What's we doing?"
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.900]   And I said, "Oh, yeah, I bought a new digital camera."
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.660]   And I'm thinking, "Oh, well, gee, he didn't discuss that with me.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.660]   That's interesting."
[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.660]   "Oh, that's real.
[00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.660]   Well, which one you need to pick?"
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:40.180]   "Oh, I picked this Panasonic.
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.660]   It was recommended by David Pogue."
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.460]   You know, he really knows what he's talking about.
[00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:50.180]   So I email David, say, "Okay, I hope you enjoy your new dad.
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.340]   Here's his phone number."
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.540]   He works too hard when he tries to shovel, so try to get there early if you know it's
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.540]   good cheese.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.540]   That's so harsh.
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.540]   Sorry.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.340]   So all of the Apple news will happen tomorrow.
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.100]   There's a lot of rumor news, huge drum beat of rumor news.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:21.620]   But the biggest story, I think, Tim Cook was on CBS this morning, your show, talking about
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.620]   a variety of things.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:31.220]   Gail King said, you know, that we're talking about the chaos and so forth.
[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:40.500]   King said Cook was on CBS about a different topic, a big announcement coming Wednesday.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:46.380]   Tomorrow, King stressed it was not a new product, but their view was something bigger
[00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.220]   and better than that.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.220]   Now, it was down a lot, at least.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.580]   Well, we know it's not a new bag.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.820]   Well, there's only two things that Apple thinks is bigger than a product, and that's health
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.460]   or privacy.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:06.660]   More augmented reality glasses or the other big rumor, which is a car.
[00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.660]   That's a product.
[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.660]   Oh, it's a product.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.660]   Okay.
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.340]   So maybe not a viable product, but still technically displace is air.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.780]   Well, but okay, so maybe I'm over parsing it.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.700]   Not a new product might mean we're not announcing a new product tomorrow, but we might be talking
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.100]   about a new initiative.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.180]   The initiatives Apple has been taking lately have indeed sort of been around privacy and
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.180]   health.
[00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:36.260]   Remember, they launched the COVID tracing technology that 20 states have now adapted.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.980]   They've worked with Google on that.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:44.140]   So one of the theories is that it's a they're going to dedicate their Apple stores to be
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.660]   vaccination centers.
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.660]   Oh, that would be cool.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.660]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.660]   Free?
[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.660]   Yeah.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.820]   Well, yeah.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.900]   The vaccine is free to everybody, of course, and they would offer a place to do it.
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.140]   It would be organized and central and predictable.
[00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.140]   Interesting.
[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.300]   Interesting, which I think has been a big issue because there's a lot of vaccine that's just
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.740]   not getting to people.
[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.140]   A lack of organization, there's lack of a national in many countries, lack of a national
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.140]   initiative.
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.820]   They can't get it off the shelves.
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:14.940]   They're not properly following the dosage.
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.540]   And if there's nothing else that Tim Cook's Apple excels at better, it's logistics.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.100]   It's getting product delivered to people.
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.540]   So exactly right.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:26.460]   So that story, I think originated with Neil Seibart.
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:33.580]   He suggested that even though she could have done the interview from everywhere, she did
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.140]   the interview with Tim Cook, who was remote at an Apple store.
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.100]   She was at an Apple store, right?
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.740]   Or was he at an Apple store?
[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.900]   She was a huge store.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:50.460]   I gather that the implication is that Cook's going to either gave her that announcement
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:58.860]   and they'll air it tomorrow on CBS this morning or that he's going to do it in the morning.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.220]   It sounded like it was a prerecorded interview and that this was part of that interview.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.980]   So whatever it is, it's already in the can.
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.220]   Boy, I'll tell you, I wish we had something like that.
[00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.220]   Tomorrow.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.500]   Well, some big's going to happen.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.220]   Tomorrow is not going to go.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.860]   David Polk, two at.
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:20.660]   Can I say that also, he's worked with Nova on WGBH.
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.180]   I do tech on TVGBH every Friday.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:31.220]   So it's public broadcasting versus whatever self-interest you tour into.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:37.540]   So is it you feel like that's pretty sure what that is is vaccine?
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.980]   No, it's just a theory.
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:47.860]   But it's going to be some kind of non-technological outreach thing like Apple has been doing more
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.580]   and more lately.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:56.740]   The research kit stuff and the COVID tracking, I think it's going to be something socially
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.740]   oriented.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.740]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.060]   Yeah, that's for sure.
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.060]   Also remember that this is technically CES week.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.700]   And so if they were planning this way, way in advance, they could have said what do we
[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.740]   want to, if we want to have some sort of a presence in the media conversation during
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.460]   CES week, and we're certainly not going to be using this time to announce a product,
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:20.500]   do we want to clarify, do we want to make another push for our privacy initiatives?
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.660]   Do we want to make another push for our health initiatives?
[00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:26.940]   So it could be something broad as opposed to something specific, but really who knows
[00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.940]   at this point.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.940]   Can't wait.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.860]   We were going to put another billboard up in Las Vegas to talk about privacy.
[00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:32.860]   It better not be that.
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.660]   So now we have to refactor it and we're going to do a big privacy.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.180]   It would be great if they could somehow solve the waste problem.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:48.140]   I was reading in the Times about how the Moderna vaccine comes 12 doses per vial.
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.300]   I'm sorry, 10 doses per vial.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:56.860]   And so if they have first responder health people and then a couple of over 75 year olds,
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.620]   and then there's four doses left from that vial, they throw it away.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.220]   Which is crazy.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.300]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.940]   That would be really interesting.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:14.020]   Apple stores are not everywhere, but there are a lot of them.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:19.460]   Also the thing that would be a little bit of a, I don't want to say concern, but something
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:26.260]   that would be notable is that they don't exactly build Apple stores in low income communities.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.260]   Exactly.
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:28.700]   So rural areas.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.700]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.940]   There are 506 Apple stores worldwide.
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:39.340]   I don't know how many they are in the US.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.340]   So yeah, it would be.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.620]   That is a lack of people, right?
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.980]   Like they just don't have enough people to give the vaccine and they're going to start
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.780]   drafting dentists and all sorts of other people.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.740]   And if you can contribute from a massive pool of people who can be trained because they're
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.100]   trained to do technical stuff all the time, there's just lots of ways it could be Apple
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.300]   stores are in malls.
[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.740]   I mean, the Apple stores that are, you know, standalone like the fifth Avenue store, that
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.060]   seems doable.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.500]   But if you're in a mall, what are you going to queue up inside a mall to get a vaccine
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   doesn't seem like.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.500]   Like the iPhone launch.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   Very similar.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:19.180]   The other failure of this theory I have to say is that Walgreens and Rite Aid and CVS
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.180]   are also designated to do that.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:22.860]   Yeah, that makes more sense, right?
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:23.860]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:24.860]   And there's many more of those.
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.860]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:28.580]   Well, I got to go down out at the pharmacy this year.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.460]   It was so easy, so quick, so well done.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.540]   I don't think I'm ever going anywhere but pharmacy again.
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:33.540]   Good on Apple.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:39.560]   But they, you know, remember they started making face shields early on when the PPE shortage
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.220]   was happening back in the summer.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.220]   So you know, they're obviously on top of it.
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:46.900]   Tim Cook is very civic minded, unlike Steve Jobs.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.900]   They make math.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.140]   They're on masks now too.
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.140]   Maybe they're going to go for the big swing and say, you know what, we're fed up with
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.020]   with with anti-democratic processes in China.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.980]   We're completely pulling out of the market because we just don't want that hangover
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.980]   heads anymore.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.980]   Yeah.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.620]   Or maybe if they got their own vaccine.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.100]   The Apple vaccine to go with the Apple car, everything should be Apple.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.820]   Comes in a white serrated.
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.820]   Yeah, perfect.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.820]   Okay.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.820]   And you'd love to box.
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.460]   You'd have that you'd have the vaccine that's free, but then you'd have the aspirational vaccine
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.660]   that actually costs $500 more.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.660]   Vaccine, Max.
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:20.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:21.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.500]   So as you mentioned, David Pogg's review of the iPhone was seminal.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.020]   It is now the 13th anniversary, January 9th.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:35.740]   So three days ago was the 13th anniversary, not of the ship date, but of the announcement
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.220]   that famous Steve Jobs speech.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:42.660]   Were you all there at Moscone Center when Steve announced the iPhone?
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:44.660]   I wasn't there.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:46.660]   I was there.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.660]   You got it backwards, Leo.
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.820]   It's the 13th anniversary of the shipping, not the announcement.
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.660]   The announcement was in June.
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.660]   Oh, really?
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.780]   The shipping was in January.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.780]   Are you sure?
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.500]   No, he announced it.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   WWDC in January and it came out six months later.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.700]   No, he announced it in Macworld in January.
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.700]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.700]   Or Macworld rather, not WWDC.
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:04.700]   Yeah, Mac.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.700]   Right.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.700]   Okay.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.700]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.700]   He shipped it after Dub Dub.
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.980]   I was sitting next to Scott Borne, who was the guy who wanted an iPhone vest.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.900]   He was so sure that the note we didn't know for sure there was going to be an iPhone.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.860]   This is back when Apple really could lock this stuff down.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.860]   So we had no idea.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.220]   David, did you know you probably had an advanced preview?
[00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.060]   No, no.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.060]   I did not have an...
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:31.020]   I will share with you a story I've never told anyone that's really embarrassing and makes
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.900]   me look terrible, though, about that.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.580]   Apple gave four people the phone before...
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.380]   Two weeks before it was available to the public.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:45.220]   So that was Wall Street Journal, Walt Mossberg, New York Times, Me, and Stephen Levy at Newsweek.
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:47.020]   Headband from USA Today got the support.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:48.020]   As big as USA Today.
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:50.020]   So we...
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.540]   I remember this because I'm bidders to this day.
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.540]   Thirteen years later.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.540]   No, no.
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.540]   I know you are.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.540]   You are so wealthy.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.220]   And so it was so cool.
[00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.660]   I wasn't allowed to show anybody, but I could play with it.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.020]   I could learn it.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.300]   And one of the first things I had since being issued the phone was a speaking engagement
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.100]   in Lake Como, Italy.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.300]   So I took a red eye with this thing in my pocket.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.460]   Landed, got in a cab to the venue of the talk.
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.900]   Slumped down in the cab seat, fell asleep.
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.900]   Oh no.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.900]   Oh no.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.900]   The phone slipped out of my pocket.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.900]   Oh no.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.900]   In the taxi.
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.500]   One of four existed in the war.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.860]   Were you able to recover it?
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.340]   I got out.
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.780]   I got my tour of the venue.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.620]   I met the organizers and then realized it.
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.620]   And just got...
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:36.100]   My heart dropped out of my body.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.900]   And she said it in Italian, well, of course, you've probably got the receipt, right?
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.900]   And I did.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.900]   The receipt.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.900]   The phone number was on it.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:45.900]   We got it back.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.740]   I mean, he was really mad when he came back to the place.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.620]   I emptied my wallet to him.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.020]   And he said, "Please take this tip."
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.500]   But he was really infuriated.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.900]   He had no idea what it was.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.700]   That was some pager or something.
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.020]   So that's what I was supposed to get into a bad time.
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.140]   Any infuriated Italian we can all see.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.140]   Oh man.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:09.260]   Especially a infuriated Italian cabbie.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.260]   Wow.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.260]   Wow.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.260]   Unfortunately, Gizmo didn't exist back then, so they couldn't sell it to anybody.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.860]   Yeah, this is prior to the...
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.020]   I mean, it was three years prior to the iPhone 4 leak to Gizmodo.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.020]   That's right.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.580]   And fortunately, all the happy PR people who would be furious at me to know this story
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.580]   have now moved on.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.580]   Yeah, you're safe.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.580]   So I can now be full.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.580]   I'm not watching.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.580]   Oh my God.
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.580]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:38.340]   Literally, that would be a horrible feeling.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.820]   I thought my career is over.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.820]   This is it.
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.660]   No one's ever going to entrust me with anything again.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.580]   How well did that first iPhone work?
[00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:49.820]   I mean, it worked well, but you got to remember how incredibly limited it couldn't record
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:50.820]   video.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.820]   There was no copy and paste.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.140]   You couldn't send pictures by text.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:57.140]   I mean, of course, there were only the 16 apps.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.980]   There was only one home screen page.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.380]   There was no app store.
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.420]   You were limited to what Apple gave you.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.820]   So unbelievably limited compared to what we have today and yet people lost their minds.
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.020]   Well, David, did you...
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.020]   Go ahead.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.380]   I just want to ask, did you get to play with one like right after the keynote?
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.620]   Did you get a briefing?
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:16.620]   Yes.
[00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.380]   Did we each got a briefing?
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.860]   We each got 15 minutes to receive jobs.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:21.860]   Oh, my.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.860]   I got a briefing.
[00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:27.420]   I got a briefing with Jaws, but not Steve.
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:34.860]   But yeah, what do you remember about the January version of the device as it was working?
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.740]   I was just really hung up on there being no keyboard.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   I was really...
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.420]   I couldn't get past the fact that we're going to type on glass for the rest of our lives.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.020]   But in a way, I was kind of right.
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.500]   That kind of is the part that still sucks.
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.820]   This is your initial review.
[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.820]   Ooh, good.
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.820]   Is that Kelly?
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.500]   It's Steve Collin, the taxi driver.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.060]   Did the taxi driver tell you about Steve calling to ask how the phone was working?
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.900]   Hey, what's the matter?
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.900]   Who is this?
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.540]   Steve, I'm so impressed with David Polk.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.100]   He speaks fluent and very angry at that.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:10.020]   Look at the bezels on that.
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.260]   That's one of your kids, though, right?
[00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:12.260]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.660]   I think that is Jeffrey.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.660]   Jeffrey.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.660]   Who's now 16?
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:16.660]   Yeah, I know.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:18.860]   He was the youngest of the Pope, Brood.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.820]   Oh, isn't that great?
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:24.620]   Yeah, the time-centered photographer ordered our house in Connecticut to take these pictures.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:28.820]   Yeah, because you couldn't use your other iPhone to take that picture.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.020]   As everybody has done since, right?
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.420]   The old iPhone to take a picture of the new one.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:37.300]   The iPhone, you said, matches most of its hype.
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.900]   I love David's leads.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:39.900]   You're always the best.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.460]   Talk about hype in the last six months Apple's iPhone has been the subject of 11,000 print
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.460]   articles.
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:48.260]   Turns up about 69 million hits on Google.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.820]   Cultists are camping out in front of Apple stores.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.940]   Bloggers call it the Jesus phone.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:58.540]   All of this before a single consumer has even touched the thing.
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.780]   You said it's revolutionary.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.740]   It's flawed, which it was.
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:08.380]   But you recognized, unlike many, including Steve Bomer and the CEO of Blackberry.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:09.380]   Ed Coligan.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:15.020]   Ed Coligan, you recognized that this was an important new product.
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:16.700]   Not just because it was from Apple.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:22.700]   Yeah, I mean, the central conceit of this thing being all-screen.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.940]   That was the revolutionary thing.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.860]   That was the forward-looking thing.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:31.940]   Multitouch was super cool, although how much do we use multi-touch apart from zooming in?
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.940]   I don't know.
[00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:33.940]   But that was cool.
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:34.940]   I remember.
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.980]   That was the first time we'd had a chance to use pinch and zoom and all of that stuff.
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.980]   So that was cool.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.340]   Remember when Steve showed that on stage?
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:47.300]   The audience was like, "Shh, your audience lost its mind."
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.980]   You said the elastic.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:52.460]   You said the phone is so sleek and thin, which of course it is.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:55.100]   Actually, I should go get my iPhone, my original iPhone.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.300]   I haven't the other room.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.900]   The phone is so sleek and thin, it makes trios and Blackberry's looks obese.
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.900]   There it is.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.500]   Look at that.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   I don't know.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.900]   Is it really that much thicker than the iPhone 12?
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.900]   I wonder.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.900]   Let's see.
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:10.900]   Maybe not.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.900]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.420]   It felt a little pudgy in hindsight.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.100]   Yeah, it's a little thicker.
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:22.820]   Remember there's that story that Steve Jobs insisted on the rounded edges and corners and
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.620]   the engineers pushed back.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.780]   They're like, "Steve, that's dead space."
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:27.780]   You're wasting space?
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:28.780]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.780]   Yeah.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:30.780]   Yeah.
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.780]   Rectangular.
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.780]   But nature is round.
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.780]   But nature is round, Steve.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.820]   Let's also remember that because of that purely aesthetic decision, you couldn't just
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.340]   take a pair of headphones or an ear set and plug it in.
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:48.820]   You needed a dongle because the jackford was amazing behind that curve.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.820]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.540]   So you needed a special super skinny style of, yeah.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.580]   My understanding is that Johnny didn't want a headphone jack, but because they were the
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:01.580]   iPod company, that side eventually won the argument and they had to retrofit the headphone
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:05.660]   jack into the design because they weren't going to change the outer casing design.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:07.900]   And that's the best they could do for the first version.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.660]   And that's why it got much better in the second version.
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.900]   David wrote, "I've walked around with an iPhone in my pocket for two weeks, naked and
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:15.060]   unprotected.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.900]   The iPhone, that is not me."
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.900]   [laughter]
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:20.820]   Okay, no, let us.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:26.700]   You don't mention the moment in the Italian cab, but you're completely understandable now.
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.700]   It's hysterical.
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.700]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:35.460]   I think, remember Steve Ballmer of the CEO of Microsoft laughed at the cost of it, which
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:41.180]   then was half what it cost today, $500 and $600.
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.900]   And yet he said, "Nobody, nobody, nobody will buy a $500 talking."
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:47.900]   It's going to be the most expensive phone in the market, I like our chances.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:48.900]   Yeah.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:49.900]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.820]   So there are a lot of people who did not appreciate what was about to happen to them.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:24:00.900]   Blackberry thought it was fake, Mike, Elasirides, and Blanking on his partner's name, but they
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.380]   thought it was fake, that it was impossible that the whole thing had to be battery.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:06.980]   They were right, and the whole thing was battery.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.180]   But they just couldn't imagine that you would move keyboard and no pin, because that was
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.180]   their entire world.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.180]   Right.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:18.860]   And of course, we've learned since from a number of articles about engineers who were
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:24.540]   drinking heavily during that January demo, that the demo of that device, that device
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.260]   was barely functional.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.820]   It was completely rigged.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:35.740]   Each feature that he showed on stage was a different iPhone rigged just to perform that
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.540]   one stunt.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.260]   Oh, hysterical.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.260]   Yeah.
[00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:49.340]   There was a great New York Times magazine piece on the beginning of the iPhone that came out.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:54.620]   Let me see what Fred Vogelstein wrote it in 2013, six years later.
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:25:00.020]   And he's talking with an engineer who said, "Every time one feature would be demoed, the
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.060]   engineer who wrote that feature would have a tiny shot."
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.820]   Because they were all like, "There is intense pressure."
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:13.660]   And really, it's amazing if you watch the video, which is widely available on YouTube,
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.500]   of Steve introducing that new iPhone.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.780]   It went very smoothly.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:18.780]   It was incredibly impressive.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.780]   It was a golden path.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:20.780]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:21.780]   There was only one way he could do it.
[00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.300]   He was a master of keynotes.
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.060]   And that was, I think, him at the height of his craft.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.700]   It was probably one of the best he'd ever done.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.100]   I still remember that awesome, awesome moment.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:34.620]   I know you guys all have it by heart where he said, "We're introducing three new products
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:41.500]   today, a phone, an internet terminal, and a media playback device."
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.820]   And then he said it again, "A phone, an internet terminal, and a media playback device."
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.780]   And he gradually became aware that they were all the same thing.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.100]   Are you getting it yet?
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.100]   I could probably play that.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.100]   You can get it.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.100]   I could probably play that.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.260]   I don't know what we're going to do about the audio here.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:58.340]   I'll just turn it up really loud and point my mind.
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.180]   We're trying a new system with the Mac here, but I'll just play a little bit of it so
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.260]   you can hear it and watch it as Steve introduces it.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.020]   Oh, let me unmute.
[00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:08.020]   Oh, that's it.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.020]   That's it.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.020]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.020]   Let me unmute so we can hear it.
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:17.300]   And the engineers behind Tina were drinking too.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.700]   A phone.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.620]   And an internet communicator.
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.620]   An iPod.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.620]   A phone.
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.620]   Are you getting it?
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:31.620]   I still get chills.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.620]   These are not.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.620]   I know.
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:36.620]   Three separate devices.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.620]   This is one device.
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:46.620]   And we are calling it iPhone.
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:54.260]   And I, you know, it stops there, but I remember, you know, you're a journalist, so you're supposed
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.460]   to sit on your hands and not cheer.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.700]   I think we all leapt to our people.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.700]   You're a person.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.820]   Scott Porsdahl did an interview at the Computer History Museum the first time I've ever seen
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:05.420]   him do an interview since he left Apple.
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.100]   And he was saying that it all started with Steve having dinner with a friend of Lorraine's.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.260]   And her friends husband worked at Microsoft and he kept telling Steve, "Yeah, we got tablet
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.740]   PC coming with a stylus.
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.180]   We're going to own the future of mainstream computing."
[00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.900]   And Steve just got angrier and angrier and then came and told Scott that there's no way
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.780]   he's surrendering the future of computing to Microsoft and a stylus.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.300]   And that kicked off the entire Purple Experience Project.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:34.820]   That was the keynote where Steve talks about styluses and doesn't like it.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.700]   You have to whittle your finger down.
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.980]   I mean, there were all sorts of crazy ideas.
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.980]   Yuck.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.980]   Yuck.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.220]   And there's still to this day, there is no stylus on an iPhone.
[00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.220]   There is on the iPad.
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.820]   What would resist a stylus is too?
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.660]   Like you had to compress the two layers of the screen down in order for them to trigger
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.660]   a touch event.
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.460]   It was very different than what an Apple pencil is or a Wacom.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.460]   Right.
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:57.460]   Pen is today.
[00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.460]   Oh, that was awful.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:59.460]   No, they were awful.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:02.500]   Well, but it worked for what the technology had to be at that time.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.980]   And also the excitement in that room was that huge because it's not as though this came
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.380]   out of the blue.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:15.140]   It's maybe there were some controlled leaks or some they wanted to sort of like prepare
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.660]   the ground before him.
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:20.460]   Everybody knew that Apple was working on a phone and that the release was imminent.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:27.140]   And that at the time, because hosting their own events was not a very frequent thing that
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.940]   January would be a very, very likely date for that to happen.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:38.020]   I just think to remember the closest I ever came to switching my my broad excuse me,
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:43.660]   my mobile provider was long, long story, but it's horrible customer service incident with
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:44.660]   AT&T.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:50.780]   And then this was like in August or September of that year thinking that, okay, I really
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:53.340]   want to I really want to switch to some other providers.
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:55.900]   I'm so mad about how badly they handled this.
[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:59.780]   And then like the dad voice in my head came back and said, now, you know that the rumors
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.700]   are that AT&T is going to be the exclusive carrier for the iPhone that's coming up sometime
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.700]   in the next few months.
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.540]   Do you really want to shoot yourself in the foot by having to come crawling back and three
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.220]   months later to go and do that?
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.060]   So that's why there was so much energy in the room there already.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:22.700]   And then when you talk about how the power that Steve had to when he was when when he
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:28.180]   had something that he knew he had like all the cards in his hand that when he would he
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:32.500]   would the way that he would play those cards would just absolutely double whatever energy
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:37.260]   he was inside that room to to an amazing extent.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:42.060]   But the other thing I just wanted to say is that it's become part of lore that the devices
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.060]   were barely functional.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.060]   And that's true.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.900]   There was a girl there was a golden path.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:54.180]   But in my briefing after Steve's keynote, I had they they just let had 45 minutes and
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:59.820]   I just basically they put one of these iPhones in my hand and I basically said, okay, there's
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:00.820]   there's coffee.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:01.820]   Go have a cookie.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:02.820]   I just want to play with this.
[00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.820]   I'm surprised.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:10.580]   Well, I'm sure I got one of the ones that could only do Wi-Fi because I was mostly using
[00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:15.020]   I was going through the interface and I was playing with the Wi-Fi.
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.060]   That worked just fine.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.660]   Rarely did I get to like I remember that I wanted to like use the keyboard and see what
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.100]   the notes app was like.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:28.380]   And that was one of the apps that I tapped it and went to basically a JPEG of what that
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:29.780]   app would look like.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.580]   But the thing is they you're right.
[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:36.780]   It was they must have been confident in what what this thing was able to do with this one
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.620]   specific piece of hardware because it was fast.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:40.620]   It was liquid.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:41.620]   It did not stutter.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.740]   It did not crash whatsoever.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:48.500]   So it's not as though this thing was like that like that like that scene in a Tucker the
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:52.420]   movie where they're about to demonstrate they're about to show off this great new car.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.500]   But meanwhile while they're having singing dancing people on the stage, they're desperately
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.540]   trying to get the wheels to actually turn.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:00.140]   So it wasn't as bad as that.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.300]   But it still made hell of a first impression even like on the day of the keynote.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:08.100]   I have to tell you that I was talking about the original.
[00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:09.100]   Sorry.
[00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.100]   Go ahead, David.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.180]   Oh, I was just going to say I have to agree that one of the best things about it that
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:18.460]   we all take for granted now is the the Polish and the animations went on the 10th and then
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.420]   the anniversary of the iPhone a couple years ago.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:25.140]   I did a story for CBS Sunday morning where we tracked down the engineer who programmed
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.660]   the inertial scrolling.
[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.420]   So he's the one who came up with that idea that you can click and the list of gradually
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.900]   slow down as though, you know, by friction.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.340]   And I mean, there's filled with little things like that.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.940]   Those are the things that make the difference.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.500]   That's Apple right there in a nutshell.
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.500]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.420]   And that's what made it so much better than the early Android phones and stuff.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.860]   They would try to sort of recreate that, but they didn't nail it.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:54.100]   They didn't nail the inertia or the gravity or the rubber stretching effect.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.860]   So Renee calls painting the back of the fence, right?
[00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:57.860]   They were really good at doing it.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.540]   Well, it was funny because Tony Fadell was talking about they had P1 and P2.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.980]   They had two competing projects because they didn't think they could get P2, which was
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:09.260]   the iPhone out in a fast enough time frame, even though it ended up being that way.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:11.380]   But they had an iPod phone too.
[00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.300]   And Tony Fadell was talking about it earlier this week because of the anniversary and saying,
[00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.820]   yeah, it worked great except if you didn't have the phone number in contacts and you had
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.780]   to use the iPod control as a rotary phone dial.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.420]   And then they realized it just wasn't going to work.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:26.340]   No, that was a joke.
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:27.340]   Everyone.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.900]   No, I'm saying no, that's every joke.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:31.900]   Oh, haha.
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.900]   Yes, of course.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:33.900]   Of course.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:34.900]   Oh, yeah, you remember the fake.
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.580]   Yeah, in fact, Steve showed it in the keynote.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.500]   He showed it on iPod with a dial on it.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.500]   I remember that.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.260]   He said not this from Fred Vogelstein's Times piece, which you should read.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.260]   It's still online.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:51.140]   The iPhone could play a selection of a song or a video, but it couldn't play an entire
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.780]   clip reliably without crashing.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.660]   This is the January demo.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.300]   It worked fine if you sent an email and then surfed the web.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.540]   But if you did those things in reverse, it might not.
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.700]   Hours of trial and error had helped the iPhone team develop what engineers called, as you
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:10.060]   said, Renee, the golden path, a specific set of tasks performed in a specific way in order
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.220]   that made the phone work.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:17.300]   His source on this was an Apple engineer, Andy Grignon, who said, "At first, it was really
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:21.020]   cool to be at the rehearsals at all, kind of like a cred badge.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.460]   Only a few chosen fewer allowed to attend.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.500]   But it quickly got at the rehearsals very uncomfortable.
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.340]   Very rarely did I see him become completely unglued.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:35.180]   It happened, but mostly he just looked at you and very directly said in a very loud
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.500]   and stern voice, "You are effing up my company."
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.860]   Or, "If we fail, it will be because of you."
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.780]   Can you imagine that?
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.580]   He was just very intense and you always would feel an inch tall.
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.020]   Grignon, like everyone else at rehearsals, knew that if those glitches showed up during
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.580]   the real presentation, jobs would not be blaming himself for the problems.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.900]   It felt like we'd gone through the demo a hundred times and each time, each time in
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.860]   these rehearsals, something went wrong.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.860]   Each time.
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:14.140]   They had AT&T, the iPhones wireless carrier, bringing a portable tell tower, tell tower,
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:18.500]   sell tower, so the new reception would be strong.
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:24.660]   Then with jobs approval, they get this, pre-programmed the phones display to always show five bars,
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.500]   regardless of whether...
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.700]   Well, I understand that.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:33.740]   None of these clues just fixed the iPhones biggest problem.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:38.420]   It often ran out of memory and had to be restarted if made to do more than a handful of tasks
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.420]   at a time.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:44.380]   So, Steve had a number of demo units on stage with him, which I didn't notice.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.860]   Did any of you notice him swapping out?
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:47.860]   He has no idea.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.860]   He has no idea.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.860]   Yes.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.060]   To manage the problem, if memory ran low on one, he'd switch to another.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:58.180]   While the first was restarted, given how many demos jobs planned, Grignon worried that
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:04.420]   there would be far too many potential points of failure.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.420]   Wow.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.420]   It's a special...
[00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.420]   It's a friend there.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.580]   There was saying right before the event, like right before it went up on stage, he gathered
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:14.620]   them all together and said, "Just remember this moment because this is the last moment
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.620]   without an iPhone."
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.620]   And then just walked up.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.620]   Yeah.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.620]   The world is true.
[00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.620]   Wow.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.620]   And that is true.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.620]   The world changed that day.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:22.620]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.780]   That's really true.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:30.060]   You can look back now, 13 years, and whether it's an iPhone or an Android device, we've
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.900]   got supercomputers in our pockets that are always connected to the Internet.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:36.980]   And they're all Linux-based and they're all conqueror-based.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.900]   And every one of them, I think at least I thought it was going to be a Microsoft Windows
[00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:42.940]   phone and Explorer future.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.900]   And now it's all Nix and Conqueror, and I don't understand what happened.
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.900]   Yeah.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.780]   Although, all of today's ills were also launched that day.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:55.660]   I mean, social media and the hate communities and privacy loss and data harvesting and our
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.820]   kids lost to their screens and on and on and on.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.020]   So the world did bifurcate that day.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.420]   It changes the world.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:09.460]   We debate this constantly on all of our shows, most significantly Jeff Jarvis and I on this
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.100]   week in Google.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.620]   When all of this first started, even predating the iPhone, when the Internet first became
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:19.740]   widely used, I think we all had this kind of utopial notion that...
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.060]   You know, this is going to democratize speech.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:25.980]   This is going to change the world for the better.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:29.180]   Everybody's going to have access to information at their fingertips.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:37.660]   You know, the barriers that divide us will tumble because we can communicate freely with
[00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.540]   each other and not be in ignorance about each other.
[00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.340]   And to some degree, that's true.
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:47.980]   I don't think anybody anticipated the nightmare that the last seven days have brought us.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.980]   It turns out it's us, Leo.
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:50.980]   It's not the tools.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:51.980]   It's always the people.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.980]   It's always been us.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.860]   There's a rock and that rock can do wonderful things but it can also do terrible things
[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.300]   and we get to make that choice every moment.
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:01.300]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.300]   I mean, I think if you said...
[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:06.660]   Well, first of all, nobody was using Twitter.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.500]   Actually, they were.
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.300]   Twitter came out in 2006.
[00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.180]   So yeah, I was using Twitter before the iPhone came out.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.180]   Come to think of it.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.180]   Yeah.
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:20.380]   Nobody had any idea what Twitter would be nor that 13 years later, the president of the
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.780]   United States would be banned from using it.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.740]   I think Facebook was a site for Mark Zuckerberg to post like hot or not basically, isn't it?
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.740]   I mean, really...
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:34.340]   I mean, in a way, think of the other big news, Apple News this week, which is Apple pulling
[00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.980]   parlor off the app store.
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.580]   In a way, it's bookends of the same freedom of speech story, right?
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.900]   There was the iPhone that made it possible for us all to be together to say whatever we
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:47.060]   want to the whole planet at once.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.980]   And then that kind of went south in some ways.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:54.020]   And now they're pulling off one of its children in the app store.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.500]   Although given parlor security problems, I think everyone on that service is probably
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   grateful.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.500]   It's not up right now.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:03.700]   Well, it affects Denise Howell, who made this point, who's our former this weekend law
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:11.540]   host, lawyer herself, that all of the companies that are doing this, whether it's blocking
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:16.900]   the president or QAnon or pulling down parlor like Amazon Web Services have done, are doing
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:26.420]   it partly out of policy, perhaps, in civic duty, but mostly because of their exposure.
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.420]   They don't...
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.420]   Yes.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.420]   They don't want to be responsible.
[00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:36.140]   In fact, parlor is already suing AWS for billions of dollars, but they felt like they
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.140]   were...
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.140]   Well, their lawyer's quit.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.140]   So, yeah, I know.
[00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.740]   He wrote it himself, but I mean, they have plenty of money.
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.140]   They got Mercer money.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.140]   But the point is, it may not have been a courageous act.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.980]   It may have been that the lawyers came into the executive suite and said, "You know what?
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:52.660]   You're exposed here if you keep doing this.
[00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.780]   You can't let this stay on your platform."
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:01.740]   Part of it is also the fact that the incidents from the last week gave a lot of these companies
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.700]   actually the legal cover that they need to deplatform them, where they can say, "Well,
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:10.060]   why did you pull the plug because you don't like what we're saying?"
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.460]   And well, no, we didn't like what you're saying for a long, long time.
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:17.300]   However, legally speaking, we can now say that you are creating a dangerous situation.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.220]   You're also tarnishing our brand with your association.
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:26.780]   And those are all things in that 80-page click-through agreement that even CEOs don't necessarily...
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.420]   They're supposed to have lawyers look at, but there's language in there that basically
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:34.780]   says that if your reputation is going to bring down our reputation, we can back out
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.260]   of the steel and you can sue.
[00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.580]   But this is the reasons why we're doing it.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.780]   You can't just simply say that we don't like you.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:41.540]   So this is part of the...
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.700]   By the dominoes, we're all coming down at the same week.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:44.700]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.980]   Do you guys think Parler will survive?
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:48.900]   There's also a lot of...
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.420]   They were using...
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.300]   This is the problem with all of this stuff.
[00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.020]   When 4chan went away, there was 8chan.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.820]   The internet...
[00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.820]   The community will...
[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.260]   It's self-healing.
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:04.940]   And so it's whack-a-mole.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.940]   I don't survive, yes.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.580]   I think that I think that I think that...
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:14.220]   Will it survive in such a public fashion so that it's so easy to get to?
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:16.180]   Maybe not, you know?
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.180]   But there will always be...
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:20.500]   Unfortunately, there will always be these back halls.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:25.340]   I mean, you set up a Discord server or a Matrix server, a Signal group.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:26.340]   There's nothing to do with...
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.340]   You're gonna tell the guy.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.340]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.300]   Yeah, there's nothing that can stop you if you're so motivated.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:35.340]   In fact, in some ways, I'm concerned about this because a lot of stuff that was happening
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:40.940]   in the open in Parler and could be monitored is now gonna be completely dark.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:46.820]   A lot of that stuff has already been seen moving towards, believe it or not, message
[00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.420]   boards for California sports teams that they...
[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:54.380]   And a lot of these organizations, they don't know that they're essentially hosting a rallying
[00:40:54.380 --> 00:40:57.180]   point for former radical members of Parler.
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.180]   Members were using World of Warcraft chat.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.180]   You can't...
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.340]   Well, that's Xbox Live, right?
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.820]   That's famous too for radicalization, especially for ISIS radicalization.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.820]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:08.820]   So...
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:10.740]   One thing I think that gets conflated a lot too is...
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.820]   And this is the analogy I came up with, so I mean, that'd be great.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:18.020]   But, you know, if I go to visit Leo and we go to Denny's together and I cause a huge
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.740]   ruckus, like I say, horrible things, I act in a terrible manner, they can't ban me for
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.820]   being Canadian, but they can ban me for being a jerk.
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.580]   And those are two very different things.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.300]   You can't really take action on what somebody is, but you can do action on what somebody
[00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:32.780]   does.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.780]   And that always seems to get conflated in these sorts of conversations.
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:38.140]   I thought there are no jerks in Canada.
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.140]   There aren't.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.140]   They're very polite.
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.140]   Actually, I'll be honest.
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.020]   We keep them out of the spotlight.
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:49.500]   I think that this is the case that what happens is there is this veneer of politeness and
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:56.100]   courtesy and niceness, but underneath it's a seething cauldron of resentment and anger
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.460]   at being so suppressed.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.460]   Right, Renee?
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.900]   No, I mean, you can't even admit it.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.900]   I'll put it there.
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:04.900]   I know what's there.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:08.740]   Very similar to Texas and the Maritimes are very similar to New England.
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.460]   We just have a sparsely populated version of America spread very thin.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.820]   Like, not enough butter on my head.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.060]   It's Bizarro, America.
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:16.820]   No, I love Canada.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:17.820]   Yes.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:21.420]   There was so much fun doing shows up there in both Toronto and Vancouver.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.500]   I fell in love with the country.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.740]   We had a bunch of politicians also had to very quickly walk back some of the things that
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:27.980]   they'd been saying this week.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.980]   Oh, yes.
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:29.980]   Humans.
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:30.980]   Humans.
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:31.980]   That's the problem.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:32.980]   Not the iPhone.
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.980]   It always is.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.980]   It's really...
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.780]   Even for security, Leo, if there's no humans, the security system is perfect.
[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:38.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:39.780]   It's when you introduce humans, that it's a problem.
[00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:40.780]   It's amazing.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:46.580]   It's actually amazing to me, but it is the story of humanity that we can create such
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:50.980]   beautiful objects of art and technology.
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.980]   Such amazing things like the iPhone.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:59.300]   And then just do so many horrible things with it.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.580]   So that's a human story, isn't it?
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:07.500]   If anything that demonstrates how relevant and appropriate the technology is, if it's
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.500]   up to...
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.380]   I realize that I'm making a very intellectual statement here as opposed to a practical one.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:20.540]   But the fact that even for lack of a better word, the dopes and drugs of society find
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:25.660]   a way to use this and find a way to empower themselves with it shows how accessible and
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.900]   successful this basic technology is.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:37.260]   And unfortunately, it would be an example of a fascist kind of state if they say, "Well,
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:42.100]   here is a very, very powerful tool that can be used to give a voice to people who are
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:45.140]   marginalized or who don't have much power.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:49.060]   We're only going to give it to people that are going to use it to create the sort of
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:55.620]   power for themselves that we find very, very convenient and very, very hopeful to us personally."
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.540]   You really have to...
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.100]   I believe in the...
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:03.500]   That a better definition of society is that you do diligence when you create this sort
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.500]   of stuff.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.700]   You try to anticipate problems.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:10.180]   You try to mitigate those risks as much as you can.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:14.340]   But then you have to let this thing have its own life and discover its own audience and
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.340]   its own purpose.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:18.140]   And then if people abuse it, then you find a way to...
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.700]   Now we have to read...
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.820]   Giving people too much control and too much power over this was...
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.580]   Had unintended consequences.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:29.060]   We must now try to mitigate these consequences that we did not map out.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:33.060]   But to simply say that we are not going to allow people to have access to a certain medical
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.660]   technology or certain communications technology because we fear what would happen if this
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:41.060]   were not in the hands of the New York Times, this were not in the hands of a government,
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.700]   but this were in the hands of just one lonely person who doesn't feel as though they're
[00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:49.780]   being heard and has a point of view that they don't see shared in the mainstream media
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.260]   or by the government.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:54.020]   That's a really, really bad and dangerous thing in itself.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:57.580]   And the EU is going to change all of it because they're going to start...
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.140]   They don't like these companies regulate, like self-regulating.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:03.340]   They want the government to regulate it and almost at a line item level.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.780]   And then the two new bills that are coming look like they're going to be every bit as
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:14.100]   much a two-edged sword, like the cookie policy and the privacy of GDPR have been.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.100]   And I was really...
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.100]   I was talking to the evidence...
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.100]   I was talking to the evidence...
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:25.420]   See, Angela Merkel and Macron of Germany and France say, "Oh, this shouldn't be allowed.
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.420]   The government has to decide."
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.340]   And of course they don't have the first amendment there.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:31.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:35.980]   The first amendment is incompatible with a lot of the laws that EU is proposing.
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:36.980]   But fundamentally incompatible...
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.220]   Yeah, Germans wonder then...
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:43.740]   Because they banned all Nazi memorabilia and talk and so forth.
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.340]   They wonder that we allow this kind of stuff.
[00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.980]   Well, Canada doesn't have a first amendment either.
[00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:48.980]   We have hate crime laws.
[00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:49.980]   There's no functional.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:54.300]   And we also don't have a version of a section 230 that allows for the moderation of all
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   these things.
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.940]   So it's lucky for Canadian Internet users that America has one because otherwise a lot
[00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:02.580]   of these networks would just not allow us to use them because of fear of litigation.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.580]   Right.
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:09.460]   And it seems like for a long time social media chugged on not doing anything on this first
[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.460]   amendment basis.
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:12.860]   We can't stifle free speech.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:17.700]   And so they sort of erred that way and then things got really bad.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:23.420]   And now Twitter and Facebook are saying, "I guess there is a line that you can cross where
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.580]   we believe we should muzzle you."
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:32.820]   But now the question was always, "What is the line and who should decide where it is?"
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.220]   And the social media companies were always like, "It's not us.
[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:37.580]   We're just the telephone company.
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:38.580]   We're not the people who speak on it."
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.580]   Except for nipples.
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:43.660]   Like you've never been able to post a nipple on Facebook and they're fine with that rule.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:48.660]   But what I'm saying is that them banning Trump and saying, "Okay, you're not allowed to spread
[00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.660]   lies.
[00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:51.420]   You're not allowed to spread misinformation."
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:56.340]   I mean, these are new lines being drawn and it doesn't really solve the question between
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:59.140]   free speech and muzzling.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:03.460]   I mean, we've gone the other way now, but you could still argue both sides.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.700]   I'm glad we have the first amendment.
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:10.740]   And I don't agree with Merkel or Macron that the government should decide what could be
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:12.540]   said and not said in the public sphere.
[00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:14.500]   Well, the first amendment is just for governments.
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:16.540]   The first amendment has nothing to do with companies.
[00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.260]   Companies are considered like individuals.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:22.220]   Like I can't go to your house and start screaming obscenities or you can kick me out and companies
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.500]   have that exact same policy.
[00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:28.460]   They are under no, there is no compulsion for companies to allow any speech.
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.460]   I understand that.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.700]   Literally anything they want.
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:31.700]   But most people don't.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:35.060]   Most people think that the companies are supposed to protect freedom of speech and it's supposed
[00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:38.860]   to protect freedom of companies from the government affecting their freedom to control
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.860]   their platform.
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:44.660]   No, but I understand that, but that's why it makes me so nervous when Merkel says, "No,
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.420]   no, we should have laws."
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.420]   I don't know.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:49.420]   Maybe that's what we should have.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:53.860]   We should have laws that say you can't say that, which would be, of course, in contradiction
[00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.660]   of the first amendment.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:59.420]   There's something that I keep flashing back on is that a lot of the things that we see
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:03.860]   as sank for sank to each country are the result of decisions that could have gone either
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.820]   way hundreds of years ago.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:12.100]   Even with the concept of an accused criminal being innocent until proven guilty, there
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.940]   are positive ways to simply say, "Guess what?
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:17.660]   The community agrees that you're a really, really big danger.
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:18.660]   Everybody knows that you did this.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.740]   You have to prove that you're innocent of this charge and we're going to imprison you
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.580]   until you've proven that yourself to be innocent.
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:28.860]   The other way, we decided that that was not the right way to go, that we would much rather
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:33.180]   simply assume innocence and the government has to prove guilt.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:37.780]   But remember that if this decision had been made differently 300 years, 200 or 300 years
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:44.500]   ago and the legal foundations that we copied ours from hundreds of years before that, we
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:49.220]   would be having the discussion about, "Gee, maybe it's a bad thing that we're imprisoning
[00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:54.420]   so many people just on the basis of we don't know if they are too dangerous to the public
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.300]   to be allowed to exist anymore."
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.940]   Free speech is the exact same thing.
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:04.540]   We made a decision that the founders of this country were so paranoid about power being
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:13.660]   aggregated by a few people who probably were in a prestigious position at birth and at
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:18.700]   the start of their careers that they decided to put as many limits on that power as possible.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:23.660]   That's why, again, the government does not have the ability to simply say, "We're going
[00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:27.180]   to essentially run the communications networks of the entire country."
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.340]   This is what we're seeing in China.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:34.700]   If there's something that we don't approve of, we can simply say, "You can't say that
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.700]   anymore."
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:36.780]   They could have gone the other way.
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.500]   We have to decide, "Are we truly committed to this or is this something that we just
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:42.500]   simply inherited?
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:49.220]   Are we going to just as children at some point make that decision of, "Am I going to continue
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:53.460]   to go to church every Sunday because I am a believer in this faith?
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:57.780]   Or am I going to continue going to church every Sunday because this is just simply something
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:02.940]   that I've always done since I was being brought to church as a little child?"
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.020]   Free speech is that church.
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:07.620]   We have to decide whether we want to be a member of that church or whether we have decided
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.820]   that no, this is just something we were doing out of a course that happened.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:16.100]   Well, that analogy falls apart, of course, on the free speech issue because if you allow
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:19.860]   unfettered free speech on social media, people die.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:21.540]   I think that's the issue here.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:28.660]   Well, that's the argument in favor of the way we do it, which is, and you can't force
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:33.580]   Twitter to moderate, but I think at some point Twitter says, "Well, we've got to draw
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:34.780]   the line somewhere.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:35.780]   You can't shout.
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.180]   Actually, you can shout fire in a crowded theater."
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.100]   It turns out that's wrong.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   That's my reliable one.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:45.500]   There is some speech to this limit.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:47.260]   There are limits on some speech.
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:48.860]   I agree with that.
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:52.180]   All I was saying is that just remember that that was a choice that was made and that we
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.180]   have to decide.
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:57.900]   Some of the most dangerous stuff that happens is when you do things out of simply because
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:58.900]   it's always been done.
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:04.780]   You forget the reasons why you do it because sometimes doing that, making that reassessment
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:08.940]   will remind yourself of why you are suffering so much before this principle.
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:13.900]   But sometimes it will also remind you that, "Well, actually, this principle was something
[00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.940]   that seemed to make sense to me 10 or 15 or 20 years ago.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.220]   It doesn't make sense now.
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.940]   Perhaps I should revisit that opinion."
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.220]   That's all I was saying.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.020]   A lot of this comes from the old AOL and CompuServe lawsuits when there was a bunch of confusion
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.780]   about if you did any form of moderation, suddenly you were responsible for all the content and
[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.780]   then that's not legally viable.
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.420]   You can't survive that way, so you have to stop either doing any moderation or you have
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:41.660]   to moderate to a beyond silly extent and even then your company will probably fall.
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:45.900]   That's how they evolved into the moderation policy they have now.
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.180]   It doesn't even have to be good.
[00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:50.740]   That's the whole thing here is that you don't even have to have Twitter has proven, Facebook
[00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.980]   has proven you can have the world's worst moderation.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:56.580]   All you have to do is prove that you have moderation and you get all the protection.
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:00.700]   I will say this for Carter though.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:05.340]   World's best name is French.
[00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.540]   It's like the parlor of a room.
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:08.540]   It's clever.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:11.500]   It's very clever.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.700]   All their data has been dumped now.
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:20.620]   I believe it's all been archived at this point now too, which is parlor and logged in, baby.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.780]   That has its own pluses and minuses.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:28.260]   I'm glad that we have a permanent record of people who would probably be deleting lots
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:33.060]   and lots of posts because they suddenly realize that, "Oh, perhaps the reason why I saw myself
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.060]   as a flag.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.460]   We've fly waving, patriot gun waving.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.380]   Let's kill them all, hang them all person."
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.380]   Ah, that's right.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:42.940]   I'm actually a member of Congress and I could really face horrible, horrible consequences
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:48.860]   for having done so that should be preserved.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:55.300]   I do have a problem alongside that with a lot of data that people posted on parlor, including
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:59.180]   location data, that they posted with the understanding that it would be never shared
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.180]   with the public.
[00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.660]   It would only be shared with the actual host themselves.
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.260]   I don't like the idea of that being exposed.
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:09.900]   Rather, I'm worried about the consequences of personal private information like that being
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:10.900]   exposed.
[00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:16.780]   I think that was my greater point is that as a service, they did not have a content moderation
[00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:18.460]   policy that was effective.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.460]   They had no security.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.900]   People didn't even have to break into this.
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.100]   They just waltzed in through the API.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:25.460]   They were using trial versions of software.
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:29.340]   This would not be acceptable for almost any product that you'd want to use.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:34.580]   I would never use a product like that, no matter what the product is.
[00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:35.580]   Let's take a little break.
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:38.340]   We'll come back with more in just a bit.
[00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.460]   It's really nice to have David Pogue joining us.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.660]   He was on the first Mac break weekly.
[00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.660]   Now he's on the last.
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.820]   No, no, I'm just kidding.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:45.820]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:47.940]   It's not, geez, I could start something.
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.380]   It's good to see you new book coming out.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:56.700]   Find out about all his new books at davidpogue.com.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.100]   Really nice to have you, David.
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:53:59.100]   Thank you, sir.
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.580]   Of course, Andy Anaco from the WGBH of Boston.
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:07.940]   I have no idea how to spell his name, I H N A T K O dot com.
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:13.340]   And Renee Richie from Renee Richie YouTube dot com.
[00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:14.340]   The eponymous.
[00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:17.780]   The eponymous Renee Richie YouTube dot com slash Renee Richie.
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.700]   Our show today brought to you by Express VPN.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.060]   I think by now everybody understands why you would want a VPN.
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.220]   I'll run through the reasons just a bit.
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:30.660]   The real question is which VPN there are a lot of VPN providers.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:34.180]   Some free, some cheap, some log use, some into it.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:38.260]   I actually VPN providers that add put ads into your stream.
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.140]   So you get more ads on the website.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.500]   That's not Express VPN.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.500]   That's the one I use.
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.500]   That's the one I recommend.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.260]   I did a lot of research and I'll explain why in a second.
[00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:51.700]   So first of all, let's talk about what Express VPN can do for you.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.900]   Of course, everybody knows that if you're at an open Wi-Fi access point by a coffee
[00:54:55.900 --> 00:55:01.420]   shop, an airport, a hotel, a cruise ship, that you're at risk because you're on a network
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:05.940]   unprotected with a lot of other people, including that guy in a hoodie in the corner who seems
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.140]   to be doing something odd with his laptop in a strange box.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:16.020]   The VPN encrypts your data from your computer all the way to the VPN server.
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.020]   So that's good for security.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:22.340]   It turns out though there's also a privacy aspect to it.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:27.900]   You get service providers, certainly that coffee shop, your mobile carrier, all can
[00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:30.260]   log what you do online.
[00:55:30.260 --> 00:55:33.940]   And it's completely legal for them to sell that information to marketers.
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:36.340]   In fact, many do.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:40.820]   So if you want true privacy, a VPN protects you that way as well.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:44.340]   There's a third reason a lot of people use VPNs these days.
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.340]   We've all run out of things to watch on Netflix.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:54.260]   If you use ExpressVPN, it's fast enough that you can watch Netflix in Japan or Netflix
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:55.260]   in England.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:56:00.780]   See all the doctor who episodes you'd ever want thanks to ExpressVPN.
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.540]   It lets you move your location to any one.
[00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:05.820]   They're in almost 100 countries.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.260]   They're all over the world.
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:11.580]   They have many, many servers, all with a lot of bandwidth.
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:13.860]   That's why you want a good VPN provider.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:17.300]   But here's the most important part when we talk about security and privacy.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.980]   Sure, you're protecting yourself against a coffee shop or you're an internet service
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:22.140]   provider.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:27.220]   But the same way a coffee shop and I speak and see what you're doing, so can a VPN provider.
[00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:29.060]   You're just kicking the can down the road.
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.260]   And that's why I highly recommend ExpressVPN.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.340]   They don't log.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:35.820]   They keep no track of you.
[00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:38.300]   And they get audited regularly by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:42.100]   So we know that's true that their privacy policy is accurate.
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.340]   And they use a technology.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:47.260]   They're so committed to this called Trusted Server, something they created that runs
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.260]   in memory.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:53.260]   So when you press the big button on your ExpressVPN app on your iPhone or Android Mac PC, you
[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:56.580]   can even put ExpressVPN on many routers.
[00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:04.740]   When you push that big button, ExpressVPN spins up in RAM only the Trusted Server.
[00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.420]   It cannot write to the hard drive.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:07.420]   It cannot log.
[00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.940]   It cannot log what you're doing.
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.220]   It's sandboxed.
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:16.060]   And then when you exit the VPN, it disappears and so does every record of your visit.
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:22.060]   And again, fully audited by an independent and very highly respected PricewaterhouseCoopers.
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.620]   So you know it's protecting your privacy.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:26.620]   Okay?
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:27.620]   That's why I choose ExpressVPN.
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.620]   And I'm not alone.
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:33.940]   It's the number one VPN rated that way by wired, by CNET.
[00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.100]   I've been using it for a long time now.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.980]   And it's fast enough to watch HD video anywhere in the world.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:41.220]   And I think that's really important.
[00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:43.940]   Protect your privacy, your security with a VPN.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.660]   I trust to keep me private online.
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:48.980]   You could even run it on your router, have your whole house protected.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:52.980]   And I guarantee you, nobody's going to complain because ExpressVPN is fast.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:57.700]   Stop handing over your personal data to ISPs who mine your activity and sell off your
[00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:58.700]   information.
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:01.620]   Visit expressvpn.com/macbreak.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:06.580]   Exprssvpn.com/macbreak.

[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:13.020]   You get three extra months free with a 12 month plan that brings it down below $7 a
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.020]   month.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:16.900]   Good price for the best VPN provider out there.
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:20.260]   Expressvpn.com/macbreak.
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:22.260]   We thank you so much for supporting Mac Break Weekly.
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.980]   We thank you for supporting it.
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.580]   Dear listener and viewer, by using that address.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:31.060]   I know you could go there and not use that address, but get the extra three months and
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:37.380]   we get a little benefit to expressvpn.com/macbreak.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:41.380]   So did Hyundai make a strategic mistake?
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:45.140]   Whoopsie, whoopsie.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:50.500]   Because when you're working with a partner, it's a good idea to understand the partners,
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:54.660]   you know, pecadillos, concerns, issues.
[00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:58.540]   Hyundai said, "Yeah, we're talking to Apple about building a car for them."
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:01.140]   And then shortly afterwards, said, "Uh, never mind."
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:02.140]   What a car.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:03.140]   What a car.
[00:59:03.140 --> 00:59:04.140]   What a car.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.140]   No, no cars.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:06.140]   No.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.140]   Never heard of them.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:12.180]   But honestly, I think Hyundai probably is talking to Apple, Hyundai said.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:13.820]   And lots of other people are too.
[00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.180]   It's not just us.
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.860]   It's interesting because there's been this drum beat over the last few weeks.
[00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.300]   Yes, Apple is making a car.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:25.620]   We had thought that the project was kind of on the back burner, project Titan.
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:29.340]   We had thought maybe they'd gotten rid of a lot of people and then they were started hiring
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.140]   people again.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:37.620]   Hyundai says, "We've been contacted by potential partners for the development of autonomous
[00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:39.780]   electric vehicles.
[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.260]   You know, they're stocking up 19 percent."
[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:43.260]   They're in co-hues.
[00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:45.260]   That's why they said it.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:49.620]   So, and I can just see Apple saying, "Hey, you know what, Hyundai, forget about it.
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:54.100]   If you're going to be that way, forget about it."
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:59.020]   But it doesn't, Renee, does it confirm the rumor that Apple is in this business to make
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.620]   a car or not?
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.620]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:05.180]   I mean, again, I go back to like, can you imagine, and David mentioned this earlier when we were
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:09.700]   talking about the iPhone announcement, there just wasn't this level of scrutiny back then
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:14.180]   because otherwise it would have been Steve Jobs, Livid demands a tablet project, tablet
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:19.700]   project in chaos switching to phone, two competing phones, Vine, Steve's attention, 25L
[01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.420]   incense, Steve goes with the other phone.
[01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.580]   Yeah, that's a very good point, isn't it?
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:31.660]   The thing that raised my VSD techters on this story was the timeline.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:33.900]   They want to ship a car in 2024.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:34.900]   Yeah, no.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.260]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.660]   You can't, I mean, there's no way.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:43.860]   First of all, if you want to do self-driving, which is the other part of this story, I mean,
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:49.700]   Tesla's been at it full time for years and years and years and still haven't completely
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.660]   licked full self-driving.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:55.740]   So Apple's going to start from zero and have something in three years.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.460]   No, it's not going to happen.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.460]   Especially if it's Siri.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:00:59.980]   I'm not going to let Siri drive me anywhere.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.980]   Siri, drive me home.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:06.540]   Here's what I found on the web about that.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.780]   Mark Gurman in Bloomberg saying in response to all of this, this was a couple of days
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:15.660]   ago, Apple will take at least half a decade to launch an autonomous electric vehicle.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:19.020]   We've seen dates ranging from that crazy 2024.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.020]   Tomorrow.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:24.020]   Two to 2028.
[01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:27.460]   I'm in the market for a new electric vehicle, but I'm not going to wait for the Apple car.
[01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:31.300]   I don't think the phone started ringing while the guy was still talking to the media.
[01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.660]   Yeah, working with Apple on a car is ringing and it says, "He cook on it."
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:35.660]   As he's talking.
[01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.660]   Oh, stupid.
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:41.620]   Even if their stock went up $8 billion, so, so stupid.
[01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:45.140]   Yeah, because his next call is not the Hyundai.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.140]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:53.620]   Also, the levels of autonomy on self-driving cars, every step above the next to the next
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:57.260]   level is twice as hard as cumulatively what it was before.
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:02.140]   The difference between high automation and full automation is gigantic.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:07.380]   This is why we're seeing so much movement in trucking, for instance, vehicles, autonomous
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:12.220]   vehicles that we'll spend almost all their time on highways as opposed to local surface
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.220]   streets.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:17.060]   Anytime someone gives you a predicted date of when they're going to have a fully autonomous
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:21.340]   vehicle out there, that does raise your BS to tell them.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:26.220]   I haven't tried Tesla's most recent autonomous, but I always felt like I was taking my life
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:27.220]   in my hands.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:32.820]   I'd have my hands on the wheel and be staring at it slowly feared into the median strip.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:38.580]   Some car makers like Cadillac, and I think my Mustang, when it gets self-driving in the
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:46.660]   middle of this year, have cameras in the wheel or in the car to make sure you're looking
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:51.300]   and will only work on already mapped highways.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.940]   That seems a little bit safer.
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:56.900]   Tesla keeps promising, "Oh, we're going to be able to do it from..."
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.380]   And maybe not when it's snowing.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.740]   Maybe if it's snowing, we think that's a wall, so we're just going to not let you try it.
[01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:03.100]   Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.100]   All right.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.500]   So I may test the model for you, owner.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.220]   I dearly love this thing.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:11.060]   I use it self-driving, such as it is.
[01:03:11.060 --> 01:03:16.700]   Every single drive, the car with a hundred percent reliability and no false starts will
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.380]   do the following.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.460]   It will take the ramp onto that.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:21.700]   Once you put it in a dress, it'll get onto that.
[01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:24.100]   You turn it on on city streets.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.700]   You don't wait to the highway.
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.220]   Oh, my God.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:33.020]   Of course, it's capable of taking the exit onto the highway, taking all the interchanges
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:37.260]   necessary, all automatically complete with signaling and lane changing.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:42.260]   And then when you finally get to the exit ramp, it gets into the exit lane, puts on
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:47.980]   the signal, slows down to the appropriate amount, and takes the exit, comes to a gentle
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:50.260]   stop at the light at the end of the exit ramp.
[01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:56.500]   By the way, do you know how it knows what speed to take that particular exit ramp?
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:02.140]   It has collected the data from all the other manually driving Tesla owners and averaged
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:05.500]   the speed that those humans take those exits at.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.100]   And so that's what it feeds your car.
[01:04:07.100 --> 01:04:09.700]   And it's incredible, incredible.
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:14.140]   So yes, there is now a release of a beta of the full self-driving.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.220]   This is the one where you use that.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.380]   I don't have the beta, so I haven't used it.
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.700]   But last week's time, I would.
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:22.700]   Wow.
[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:27.140]   I mean, for the first couple of weeks, I'd say alert and keep my hands ready.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:27.860]   But I got a post-
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:31.580]   David, you don't get in the backseat and take an app.
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.580]   You can't do that.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:33.580]   You can't do that.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:34.580]   He's fearlessly ill.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:35.580]   Okay.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.580]   You can't do what I want to think.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:37.580]   No, I know.
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.580]   The Tesla requires you to show that you're still there.
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.580]   Oh, I know.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:41.580]   It is.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:42.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:47.140]   My Model X would, almost every time, start getting angry at me and eventually put up
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:50.580]   a red warning saying you can't use self-driving until you get home.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.580]   Exactly.
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.580]   If you ignore its alerts, it deprives you of the future.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:56.860]   And I would always miss it because it wasn't that clear.
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.100]   And I had my hands on the wheels, but it doesn't use capacitance or anything.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.620]   You actually have to torque the wheel a little bit.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:05.860]   Hey, Leo, here's a tip for you and all the other Tesla owners.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.580]   It doesn't, when it says, please jiggle the wheel to show that you're still there.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.780]   You don't have to do that.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:15.620]   You can use any control to show that you're there, including just adjusting the volume
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.620]   on the wheel.
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.620]   Oh.
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.620]   So I just don't.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:19.620]   And that's enough.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.060]   Oh, I wish I'd known that.
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.060]   That's awesome.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.060]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.060]   Just use your thumb.
[01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:28.740]   And anyway, so last week, a guy posted a video of him driving from San Francisco to
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:32.420]   LA using the new beta full self-driving.
[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:36.220]   Once something fell off the car in front of him right into the lane and he grabbed the
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:37.220]   wheel.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:41.220]   But that was the only time that there was any question that it was flawless.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:42.220]   Wow.
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.220]   There's a video of it on YouTube.
[01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:44.220]   It's time lapse.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:45.220]   And there wasn't a Tesla in front of them.
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.540]   It was not a Tesla in front of them.
[01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.140]   That's the important part.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:49.140]   Mm.
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:54.980]   See, that's a, the, the, the, the diff, that's where the difficulty lies though, that I,
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:56.180]   I have two problems.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:01.900]   I have two problems with the current level of self-attention of vehicles.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:06.620]   Number one, that you're asking somebody to, I'm going to, I'm going, you're asking the
[01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:12.780]   main public to please turn over all the driving decisions to the, the system, but nonetheless
[01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:17.980]   still maintain mentally present and alert, which I think is a big challenge, particularly
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:22.660]   for people who are doing the same, like hour long, 90 minute drive, 90 minute commute every
[01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:23.660]   single day.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.860]   I think they're two kind of competing things.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:28.740]   Maybe the next generation of drivers will be able to balance that very, very well.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:29.740]   I don't know.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:31.900]   The other problem is that we have to have an attitude.
[01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:37.420]   It will, even when these systems are perfect, not just for highway stuff, which is predictable.
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:42.020]   There's, it's very, very rare that you'll have someone designed across the road, walking
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.460]   a bicycle across the three lane highway.
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:49.340]   But when it becomes good enough that we could really, really trust it on surface, on local
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.780]   surface streets.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.420]   And it is designed to be perfect that way.
[01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:57.900]   We're going to have to be okay with the idea that there are still going to be fatalities
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:00.380]   that are created by cars.
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:04.020]   Only there will be far fewer of them because they're being created by software as opposed
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.180]   to by a distracted driver.
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:09.860]   But we're going to have to make that sort of adjustment in our society's heads by saying,
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:15.020]   yes, this piece of software killed a person, technically speaking.
[01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:18.700]   And we have to be okay with that as opposed to here's the person that we can blame, the
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.700]   person who decided they were going to be texting and drinking coffee instead of checking to
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.060]   see what the lights were before they proceed through an intersection.
[01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:29.660]   David, do you do it on the same stretch of road every time or?
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.860]   No, no, not at all.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:36.140]   I, you know, like I said, I have, I sent my model X back last year.
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.260]   So maybe they've gotten better.
[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:45.100]   I mean, I will say this on the side streets, they limit the speed to five miles over the
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.100]   speed limit.
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.740]   And that actually drives me crazy.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:49.740]   Like people will honk.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:53.820]   No, Amy Webb was complaining.
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:08:00.660]   She got the new Audi e-tron Sportback and she said, every time it sees a speed limit sign,
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.900]   it slows me down to the speed limit.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:05.740]   She was mad about that.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.260]   I'm an old guy, David.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.700]   I like to drive the speed limit.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.540]   That's my, that's my thing.
[01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:14.820]   But that's, you're actually hitting upon something that's actually also being seen as
[01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:17.900]   another problem that humans are creating with self driving cars.
[01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:22.740]   And not when a human driver recognizes that another vehicle is a self driving autonomous
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:26.060]   vehicle, they become much more aggressive against that vehicle.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.060]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.820]   Because they figure that they're not, they're going to be, they were re-prec- a because they
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.940]   figure that this, the, the, the computer is not going to jump out of the car with a gun
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:38.060]   and start shooting them, but also that they know that this car has been programmed to do
[01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:40.100]   the safest, most predictable thing.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.180]   So if I'm going to cut someone off to try to get to an exit that I didn't think was coming
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:45.620]   up quite so soon, it's okay for me to take this.
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:50.800]   Oh look here is that brightly colored specific Amazon delivery van that I know has no human
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:51.800]   driver on it.
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.260]   I'm definitely going to cut off this person.
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:56.460]   So there's, there's a lot we're going to have to learn as these systems become, become
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:08:57.460]   deployed.
[01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:03.460]   This is why I'm very, very bearish when it comes to ambitious predictions of when someone
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:06.220]   is going to ship a fully functional autonomous vehicle.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.820]   I mean, eventually the whole speed limit thing is going to go away anyway.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:14.940]   The speed limits were designed for our human fallibility because we suck as drivers.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:18.380]   But once the computers get good enough, they don't need that.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.740]   We can be 80 miles an hour, a foot from fender defender and never have.
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:23.740]   Oh God.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:26.740]   I think you are a utopian.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.540]   I'll talk about, talk about utopia.
[01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:33.300]   I think that I think the really big opportunity is when we start taking the lessons that we've
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:37.700]   learned from the past year, year and a half of saying, well, of the pandemic saying, well,
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:42.060]   we're going to shut off these streets so that we have more, more room for, for pedestrian
[01:09:42.060 --> 01:09:43.660]   traffic, for pedestrian malls.
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:49.340]   When we start applying these rules towards a city and intercity planning, when we have
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:54.660]   instead of HOV lanes, we have these specifically a self-driving vehicle lane.
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:58.260]   You can note this, the only cars that are allowed to enter this lane physically are ones that
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:02.460]   have special transponders identify themselves as an autonomous vehicle.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:07.660]   And that's when you do have that sort of situation where from the helicopter, it looks
[01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:14.500]   like you have a train with 400 cars, a couple too, that because you have 400 cars following
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:19.220]   each other at one foot to 18 inch intervals in perfect safety with people who are perfectly
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:24.700]   okay with declining the seat back and reading a comic book while the computer does the driving.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:29.740]   I really think that that's the thing that's going to create that kind of transportation
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:34.340]   utopia, but not in the next five or 10 years, but when we start to rebuild cities and rebuild
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:40.260]   transport to make it less about the horse and carriage and about the diesel truck and more
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.300]   about electronic vehicles.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:46.300]   But Leo, to be sure, most of the public is with you.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.220]   The AAA did a study last year.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:54.620]   They asked people, asked Americans, would you take a ride in self-driving taxi, 71% said
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.620]   in no way.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:11:00.140]   I guess we should get over that because it truthfully, it would be safer than humans
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.140]   driving.
[01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:07.900]   The feeling of not being in control and this car drives into a truck is more terrifying
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:11.300]   than I'm in control and I drive into a truck.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.300]   That's all.
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.540]   Well, I had the chance at CES two years ago and they offered the driverless, I forget
[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.540]   which car it was.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.540]   It wasn't Googler or Tesla.
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:20.540]   It was a self-driving taxi.
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.740]   Yeah, Waymo, I think.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.820]   And they offered us the driver one and I was still terrified back then.
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:29.220]   So I took the driver one and they got lost four times trying to just get from the airport.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.980]   See, that doesn't happen to the strip.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.180]   Yeah, self-driving cars don't get lost.
[01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:40.220]   You may end up in a packing crate on the way to an island, but they don't get lost.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:47.220]   I mean, Andy is right that it's a new skill, but I mean, we seem to have crossed the hump
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.500]   of learning to use cruise control.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.500]   Right.
[01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.500]   Decade to go.
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:52.500]   That's a new skill.
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:56.700]   That's on the way to you not being involved and yet still paying attention.
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:57.700]   Right.
[01:11:57.700 --> 01:11:59.420]   So this is just another flavor of that.
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.660]   No, and I love adaptive cruise control.
[01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:03.460]   I love the lane keeping.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:09.340]   I was always a little nervous with the automatic lane change because maybe because the Tesla
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:15.420]   was a little more aggressive than I would have been about, you know, leaving some room.
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:16.420]   Are they swarm enabled?
[01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:18.020]   Like do Teslas know about other Teslas?
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:22.660]   Like they like you one chip equivalents where they'll make it move like a pipe of index?
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:23.660]   That's the 5G future.
[01:12:23.660 --> 01:12:26.020]   That's what a lot of people are talking about with 5G uses.
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.020]   Yeah, one of those drivers.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:33.140]   And then it will be safer if cars can communicate with one another, that would be a huge improvement
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.380]   because then you don't have.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.540]   My driver is an a-hole, please leave extra room.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:37.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.140]   Well, you just don't, you know, you can change lanes.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:41.460]   You don't have to do the signal and all that stuff.
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.780]   The car says, can I, if I get in here?
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:44.780]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:45.780]   Okay, get in there.
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.940]   And it's much more safe.
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:51.060]   But does their machine learning learn to be aggressive like us and they'll go, can I change
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.060]   lanes?
[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:53.060]   No, no.
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.060]   Actually, that's an interesting point.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.060]   That's a great AI.
[01:12:55.060 --> 01:12:56.060]   With the training that they've been doing, I remember the Google was, uh, a great thing
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:01.180]   Google was, uh, Google had a little fender bender with their, with their self-driving
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:09.180]   vehicle because the vehicle got in a lane that there was construction and looked back
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:14.460]   and saw a bus coming, but knew there was, you know, so I'll, I'll be able to get in.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.460]   And the bus hit it.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:18.740]   And what the Google engineers said is that's a good thing.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:19.940]   It was a little fender bender.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:20.940]   Was it?
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:21.940]   Nobody died or anything.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.140]   That's a good thing because we now can tell our cars.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:31.900]   Now if it's a bus, just assume that you're going to need a little more time because they're
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:33.260]   a little more aggressive.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.420]   They maybe have a harder time stopping.
[01:13:35.420 --> 01:13:40.780]   You know, so that's part of the, yeah, that's part of their barrel and down that lane there.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.740]   You're not, don't go in there.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:44.740]   So that's part of the answers.
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:48.540]   I can answer the question for both Renee and Leo about the aggressiveness of the lane
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:49.900]   changes.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:50.900]   It's a setting.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:55.180]   So you can set dial in one or four settings for how aggressive you want to be with those.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.180]   That's new.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.180]   Yeah.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.180]   The highest one is called Mad Max.
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.180]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:00.180]   I remember that.
[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:01.180]   Yeah.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.180]   No, I didn't have those features.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.420]   I just had to let it do what it was.
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:05.220]   Or a mess pike as we call it here.
[01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.220]   A mess pike.
[01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.380]   Is there a command like that?
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:14.860]   I mean, the thing is we can just intimidate Tesla updates the software monthly, literally
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.700]   every month there's a new version.
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:17.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:20.260]   And you've never had a car that does that before.
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:22.020]   I mean, there are new features.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:26.460]   I remember a year after owning this thing, somebody at Tesla said, you know what?
[01:14:26.460 --> 01:14:30.060]   We have cameras out the front and we have USB jacks.
[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:33.660]   I wonder if we could make that a dash cam feature.
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.260]   So now the Tesla has a dash cam.
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:39.820]   You just take a USB stick, put it in the jack and it's recording all the time.
[01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:40.980]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:43.220]   I'm not buying another Tesla though.
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:48.300]   Well, Lisa won't let me for one thing because as I've mentioned before, the door, the gull
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:53.420]   wing door, the Falcon doors kept hitting her in the head because they had sensors.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.420]   So it was very careful about opening in a garage, you know, it would go up and then
[01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:00.780]   was able to get in, you know, tiny clearance, but it didn't turn out.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:02.660]   I have sensors on the bottom edge.
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:07.420]   So every, every time I would say, okay, I'm, you know, I press the button to close all
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.420]   the doors and she would go, oh, stop it.
[01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:11.420]   Oh my God.
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:15:12.420 --> 01:15:13.420]   Several times.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:16.540]   So actually we got to the point where we had a system where I would say doors will
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:18.780]   close in five seconds.
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.420]   Stand clear.
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:22.780]   I should add a little.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:28.860]   After the, after the third time that happened, she said, you know, this is not, she, she
[01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:33.980]   always felt like, and I think she's right, we were driving a beta of the software.
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.580]   And you feel that way too a little bit, right?
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.700]   Come on, David, admit it's not perfect.
[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.820]   No, it's not.
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:39.820]   It's not perfect.
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:43.820]   But it's having to do all the driving myself all the time.
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:44.820]   Light years.
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:52.420]   As Ashley Vance wrote in his book about, about Elon Musk, it's, it's a Silicon Valley car.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:57.140]   It's a car, you know, car, traditional car manufacturers are kind of the opposite, you
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:59.540]   know, the safety first, a very conservative.
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:03.540]   It's more, you know, it's software and we're going to update it every month and, you know,
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.460]   and if the bugs will fix it and that kind of thing.
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.220]   And I think that's a very different model.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:09.220]   Very different.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:13.980]   They have a totally, I mean, Tesla airs on the side of being too aggressive with this
[01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:14.980]   stuff.
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:18.580]   The other car companies, as you say, are on the side of being too slow and conservative.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:19.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:25.860]   We can, we can also just quickly mention that the thing that I want to them, I'd like to
[01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:31.060]   follow as we move this transition into electric vehicles, more and more say like Boston, excuse
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:35.020]   me, Massachusetts, I think is the latest jump on the, oh, we will not, I don't know if
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:38.100]   it's, I'm sorry, I can't remember if it's Boston or Massachusetts saying that we'll
[01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:43.900]   not allow the sale of internal combustion engine vehicles after 2035 or something.
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:45.620]   California, California too.
[01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:46.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:50.860]   But it's going to be, it's the one of the interesting effects is that there is a point
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:57.540]   of view that a gas powered car is a very, very clean environmental vehicle from the
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:02.820]   point of view of someone buys it in the showroom brand new for $60,000, then two or three
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:07.500]   years later when it comes off lease, someone else buys it at auction for $35,000 and then
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:12.260]   someone else buys it on a used car lot for $12,000 and then it gets handed down to family
[01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:17.220]   members until it just falls apart like the blues mobile at the end of the movie.
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:20.660]   And part of this is because of the availability of third party parts, the ability, even the
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:26.100]   availability of that cousin of yours who knows cars to come over and fix and do your
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:29.500]   breaks for you or install a new alternator.
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:35.660]   And Tesla is a rather extreme example of the non fixability of a car as a platform because
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:41.140]   they do not only do they maintain such tight control over who gets access to tools and
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:47.500]   replacement parts, but also if you buy, if you buy certain Teslas used, like if someone
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:51.420]   spent $3,000 for the software option to make it do this, guess what?
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:55.940]   That was attached to the user license for this particular owner and now this car that
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:18:01.940]   when you've sold it on does not have that $3,000 or their $1,000 software patch option.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:07.380]   So we're going to have to make sure that there's still an avenue for people who have $1,800,
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:12.140]   that's it for a car that can get them 20 to 30 miles to a place of work and back again
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.260]   every single day.
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:18.620]   And I hope that whatever future we have with super, super modern, super, super technological
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:24.140]   cars, people still have that ability or something that will replace their need to own a car
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:28.700]   that will own an $800, a junker beater car.
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:32.500]   Because I'm not sure that we've solved that problem yet.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:36.020]   Google says, you know, there's been a little log jam in the app store.
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:40.900]   I've noticed there are quite a few apps that stopped updating after December 13th when
[01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:45.620]   Apple started requiring the privacy statements.
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:49.860]   And we had speculated that maybe it was last week and I apologize that Google maybe hadn't
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:53.380]   updated in all that time because they didn't want to.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:55.140]   They now say they're going to start updating.
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:58.140]   And the real reason was because it was Christmas.
[01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:00.900]   Google has done this every year.
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:01.900]   A lot of companies do.
[01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:05.460]   We're not going to update in December because we don't want our, you know, if there's a
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:09.780]   show stopper, we don't want our staff to have to come to work in the holidays.
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:14.620]   So we're going to wait for the update until January and Google says, in fact, beginning
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:20.460]   this week, they're going to update all of their iOS apps and have the full privacy report
[01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:23.220]   as required by Apple.
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:29.820]   I'll tell you the privacy report really has had an impact on WhatsApp.
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:32.940]   It's actually before we move on from Google, though, I don't think it was wrong for us
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:37.780]   to speculate because they have been anything but quick in implementing new iOS features.
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.540]   It took them years to do side by side app.
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:44.340]   They still don't do picture in picture in the YouTube app on iOS.
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.860]   They've dragged their feed at every turn over the last few years.
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:52.580]   I think it's perfectly reasonable to think they're not rushing to implement even mandatory
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:53.580]   new features.
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:55.580]   Yeah.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:56.580]   It's a good thing, though.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:02.340]   Signal is all of a sudden, I think, one of the top apps in the app store because people
[01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:07.300]   are surging because people look at the WhatsApp privacy policy, especially the part that says
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:11.780]   and everything we know about you are going to give to Facebook and said, "Maybe I don't
[01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:12.780]   want to use WhatsApp.
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:13.780]   That's going to be a tough thing.
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.780]   That's a tough thing to be."
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:15.780]   That's a tough thing to be.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:17.100]   Someone posted them side by side.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:19.740]   They posted the WhatsApp privacy sheet.
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:22.660]   They posted the, I forget there was a third one, Telegram maybe.
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:23.660]   Messenger knows Facebook messages.
[01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:28.860]   I message which had contacts and two things in Signal which was zero knowledge.
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:29.860]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:30.860]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.340]   It's a big difference.
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:36.700]   In fact, I have reinstalled Signal on my phone.
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:42.780]   I would use Signal if everybody I know would use Signal, but nobody I know uses.
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.780]   That's how it starts, Leo.
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:44.780]   It's us nerds.
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:47.220]   And then slowly, slowly more people check it out.
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:48.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:53.420]   Did you guys see that editorial on 9-5, Mac, about how maybe Apple should open up iMessages
[01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:54.420]   Oh, I wish they would.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.420]   Android phone.
[01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:56.980]   I've been saying that for a long time.
[01:20:56.980 --> 01:20:59.820]   I understand it's against their business interests, but right.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:04.900]   But it's not trivial also because, no, but it's not trivial because what makes iMessage
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:08.780]   work on the iPhone doesn't really exist on Android.
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.340]   It would not be built into the default SMS app.
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:15.340]   And yes, you can make any app on Android, the default SMS app, but people still have
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:16.580]   to do that and most people don't.
[01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:17.580]   But they do.
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.580]   That's the point.
[01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:23.380]   That's why WhatsApp is so popular on Android all over the world is because you can
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:28.020]   make it to default and people don't want to pay for expensive SMS messaging in other
[01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:29.020]   countries.
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:31.020]   And everybody they know uses WhatsApp.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:34.620]   Except for Asia, we're lying and we chatter bigger.
[01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:39.460]   WhatsApp is completely dominant everywhere but the US.
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:45.100]   I think what so David, get make the case for Apple.
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.820]   Talk to Tim, will you?
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.300]   And what?
[01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:49.740]   Tell him why he should do this.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:55.140]   Okay, so I don't know what I would do if I were Tim because the argument for keeping
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:22:01.900]   it proprietary is that it's an attraction for Apple, I mean for Max iPads and iPhones.
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:02.900]   Yeah.
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:06.540]   Although, do you know anyone who's ever said, "Oh yeah, I'm getting an iPhone because
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:08.060]   of iMessages, I'm not sure."
[01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:09.060]   No.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.060]   That's a big draw.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:15.060]   The argument of the X is the rest of the tech industry seems to want their standards
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:19.820]   to propagate, think of the browser wars, think of Adobe PDF.
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:23.220]   I mean they want everybody to use PDF even though that's theirs.
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:28.220]   So like I don't quite understand what the standard business thinking should be.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:34.020]   Is proprietary better or is universal standard better that you own?
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:40.580]   Somebody says that it's the Vernet X lawsuit in the half billion dollar settlement.
[01:22:40.580 --> 01:22:41.580]   That's FaceTime.
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.460]   I understand it's FaceTime.
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.020]   But it's not iMessage.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:46.860]   It wouldn't relate to that.
[01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:47.860]   It wouldn't be.
[01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:51.540]   No, but the thing is like Apple is not good at cross-platform and they're not good at
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:55.500]   services and people are asking them to make a cross-platform service for another billion
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:23:00.020]   users with an unclear business model and with a lack of control that they have over
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:05.180]   the security model and the integration model that they have on iOS.
[01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.420]   I think the firm confidence level is low.
[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:13.060]   I want to correct you because I think the Vernet XX lawsuit was over internet communications
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:14.660]   technologies.
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:20.620]   So I think it does impact and at least some people think it does impact Apple's messages
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.060]   as well as FaceTime.
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.540]   Will you summarize that?
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:30.020]   Yes, it's been going on for eight long years.
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:34.820]   I don't know if Vernet X is a legitimate patent holder.
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:39.540]   I think they're one of those patent holding companies.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:40.820]   He's Texas Rocket Doggies.
[01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:42.300]   He's Texas, yes.
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:49.100]   They claimed that FaceTime VPN on demand and iMessage features infringed for patents which
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:52.860]   they acquired related to secure communications.
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:56.860]   Apple obviously said no, no.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:24:00.620]   And these Texas district courts said yes, yes.
[01:24:00.620 --> 01:24:04.020]   It's been going on for a while to have multiple trials.
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:10.220]   Eventually it was a $500 million judgment against Apple.
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:13.020]   But that judgment is in effect royalties.
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:18.820]   So it maybe it solves the problem that well, we gave you half a billion dollars so now
[01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:20.820]   we can go ahead.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.580]   They're expiring, I believe.
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:26.940]   Yeah, it's now or never, maybe for Vernet X.
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:27.940]   Maybe.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:34.300]   So it was a federal jury, of course, in East Texas who said, you know.
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:40.140]   So my best pitch to Tim Cook would be make it iMessage plus and you pay like a dollar
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:43.020]   or $3 a month and you get a special bubble color.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:44.540]   It's not blue-woven or green anymore.
[01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:49.300]   It's like orange bubble and then everybody knows that you flex way harder than any of
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:50.540]   your iPhone or Android.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:53.820]   I know you're being facetious, although it's interesting.
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:59.020]   I just think, I believe it would bring people to the Apple platform.
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:03.740]   You know, remember Steve Jobs fought so hard against iTunes being on Windows when he finally
[01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:05.420]   lost that battle.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:07.100]   What did it do for the iPod?
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:10.540]   It exploded the market for the iPod.
[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:14.380]   So I think that it's nothing but a benefit.
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:19.980]   And I bet you if Apple made an Android and let's please make a Windows version of it
[01:25:19.980 --> 01:25:28.220]   as well, if Apple made a version that it would rapidly become the default messaging
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:29.220]   package.
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:39.700]   Now, it is not, I should point out as secure as a signal because Apple does have the keys
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:45.060]   to the encrypted messages and encrypted, and it backs up, you could turn it off, but
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:48.660]   just like WhatsApp, it backs up in the cleared iCloud.
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:55.020]   So you know, Signal is still arguably much more private, but I bet you would become the
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.420]   default if Apple offered it.
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:57.780]   And people would love the features.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.580]   I think they would love the features.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:06.700]   But Leo, in the case of the Windows version of iTunes for the iPod, that sold iPods.
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:07.700]   What would this sell?
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:08.700]   Well, nothing.
[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:09.700]   You're right.
[01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.140]   It's not because ever services revenue.
[01:26:11.140 --> 01:26:12.140]   Orange bubbles.
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:13.140]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:18.980]   But that's why I say that the Apple's next priority should be to create an Android compatibility
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:20.220]   for the Apple Watch.
[01:26:20.220 --> 01:26:23.020]   I absolutely don't know why they're not doing that.
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:24.020]   That's smart.
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:25.020]   Yeah, that was so watch.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:26.700]   Because they're going to make it independent.
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:27.700]   They don't want it.
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:28.700]   You'd have to have any phone for it anymore.
[01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:31.980]   It's going to be the same as when they took the iPhone to iCloud instead it's PC free.
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:35.420]   It didn't matter if you had a PC or a Mac anymore.
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:36.860]   You just needed an iPhone.
[01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:39.620]   And my understanding is they're just trying to get the Apple Watch to the point where
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:40.620]   it doesn't matter.
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:42.980]   You don't have to have a phone if you don't want one.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.980]   All you need is a watch.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:44.980]   It's fine.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:45.980]   You can use it with anything.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:46.980]   Wow.
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:47.980]   I don't even care if it's a progressive web app.
[01:26:47.980 --> 01:26:52.700]   It's just needs to be compatibility because it becomes an increasingly bad look for Apple
[01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:58.300]   to say that we are very, very proud of all the improvements we're making to humanity
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:27:02.300]   and the lives that we're saving for Apple customers.
[01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:06.060]   If you are Google customer, we don't really care.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.660]   It's like they need to.
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:09.660]   Not enough.
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:13.980]   It'll sell watches, but it will also add a little bit of extra veneer of credibility
[01:27:13.980 --> 01:27:17.340]   to their claim that we think this is the most important mission that we have.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:18.340]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:19.340]   There's little things they don't even do.
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:20.940]   And I think some of it is also bandwidth.
[01:27:20.940 --> 01:27:24.340]   Like Apple is this huge company, but they insist on this approach where they have tiny
[01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:25.340]   little teams.
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.860]   Like, you still can't update AirPods on Android.
[01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:29.740]   You need to attach them to an iPhone.
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:33.780]   Just build that into the music app because you make Apple music for Android.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:36.380]   Let that app, you don't have Apple Music, that's fine.
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:38.500]   Download it and it'll update your AirPods.
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:42.260]   There's all these little things that they just feel there's too much for them to have
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:43.980]   to do at any given point.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:44.980]   Too much to name.
[01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:45.980]   Yeah.
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:46.980]   That's a shame.
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:50.900]   That's a skill that on the Apple report card, there are some cloud apps.
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:54.500]   There are some classes in which they do get the C minus or the D. One is demonstrating
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.620]   that they have the ability to manage a multi-platform product.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:03.300]   Because that is part of what holds them back as being a truly A plus great company.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:06.580]   There are companies that simply say, yes, there are huge problems in supporting a certain
[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:10.060]   service or supporting piece of hardware across multiple platforms.
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:11.460]   But that's the world that we live in.
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:16.020]   We don't want to simply say, we are really, really great at creating wonderful technology
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:20.100]   so long as we control as many of the variables as we possibly can.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:24.620]   A truly great company has to be able to say, throw whatever you got at us.
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:25.940]   We will find a way to deal with it.
[01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:30.900]   That's something I would like to see Apple do more of just as a general thing.
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.740]   Three nanometers.
[01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:36.820]   It's just a little bit smaller.
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:37.820]   Apple has done a deal.
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:38.820]   The marketing name.
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:42.180]   Just a little bit smaller.
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:48.540]   Apple's done a deal to offer to buy three nanometer chips from TSMC.
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:52.420]   It's their chip fab that makes the current chips.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.460]   I don't know what to say about that except...
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:56.980]   They are so far ahead.
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.500]   Apple bought out almost all the five nanometer process.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:07.340]   So Qualcomm and Nvidia had to go to Samsung whose process isn't anywhere nearly as good.
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:10.420]   Intel is still nowhere near where that is.
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:14.820]   AMD is making some really good announcements and they're getting good process.
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:18.020]   It's again, it's that thing where Apple just buys so much all at one time and is willing
[01:29:18.020 --> 01:29:23.140]   to pay in advance and basically finance all of the equipment for the process that they
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:24.900]   get such a high lead time on this.
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:27.140]   Intel is trying to catch up with the M1.
[01:29:27.140 --> 01:29:28.420]   I don't know if they'll succeed.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:34.380]   This is of course a CES week.
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:35.380]   It's all online.
[01:29:35.380 --> 01:29:45.500]   Intel has had some CES announcements including an 11th gen Rocket Lake Core i9 processor,
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:47.100]   which does big little interest.
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:49.020]   It has a big little architecture interestingly.
[01:29:49.020 --> 01:29:51.020]   AMD looked much more impressive this morning.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:52.020]   Did they?
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:53.020]   I didn't see what they announced.
[01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:57.980]   They announced a new series of laptop chips which I don't know how they're going to parse
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:30:03.380]   out compared to M1 yet because the biggest problem in Nvidia and AMD have had is they
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:05.660]   just can't get product in people's hands.
[01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:10.980]   They can make announcements but all the stuff they can put out is being scalped.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.820]   I don't consider that chip really yet.
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:16.380]   But their laptop chips look really, really good.
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:22.900]   People love the Ryzen 5000 on the desktop so a laptop version of that and AMD is saying
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:26.180]   20 hours of battery life.
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:29.180]   That would be very interesting.
[01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:31.700]   We know PC makers lie.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:34.620]   I say that with a lot of…
[01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:37.780]   But they have many MDs that delivers but they make big phones.
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:38.780]   They have higher over head.
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:40.780]   They make big swings of the milk.
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:51.500]   8 cores, 16 threads, 4.8 gigahertz boost, 3.0 gigahertz base, the 5980 HS, Ryzen HS, 20
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.500]   Megs.
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:54.260]   Those names are generated by a password manager aren't they?
[01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:55.260]   They just have to be.
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:57.620]   Well, and as you say if you can't get it you can't get it.
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:02.380]   But I have to say note the TDP 35 watts.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:04.740]   That's a lot more than the M1.
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:07.580]   M1 is like what 15, 16 watts I think right now?
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.580]   So we'll see.
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.580]   We'll see.
[01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.580]   M1 man is just like…
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.260]   Isn't it awesome?
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:17.460]   When I joined you a couple weeks ago on Twit Leo I was ashamed to be the only person
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.780]   who still didn't have an M1 laptop.
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:23.940]   So after that episode because I'm waiting for the one with four USB-C Jacks.
[01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:24.940]   Yes.
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:25.940]   I'm waiting for M2.
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.100]   But I decided you know what?
[01:31:27.100 --> 01:31:28.100]   I'll be like Leo.
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:31.700]   I'll get this one for now and I'll give that to my kid in the spring.
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:32.700]   There you go.
[01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:36.260]   So I raced the Apple store online and guess what?
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:37.260]   What?
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:39.060]   It's available for weeks.
[01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:40.860]   They are completely sold out.
[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:41.860]   Yes.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:42.860]   Yes.
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:44.060]   It is a huge hit.
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:45.060]   Yeah.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:47.420]   This is the 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:49.140]   They're getting intermittent stocks.
[01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:52.420]   If you check they sometimes have stock of all the different SKUs.
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:53.420]   What's the hold on?
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.980]   Do you think it's the M1 itself or…
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.100]   It looks like the 16 gigabyte is the big…
[01:31:58.100 --> 01:31:59.100]   The RAM.
[01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:00.100]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.380]   The 8 gigabyte one seems to be much more available than the 16 gigabyte ones.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:05.460]   And that's of course because they're putting it on the chip.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:09.500]   It's not a thought on the die but it's on the chip.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:11.500]   So that's unified memory architecture.
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.740]   I'm with you David.
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:14.820]   I mean this is a stopgap.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:19.580]   And yeah it's a damn fine stopgap.
[01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:27.460]   But I can't wait to see four thunderbolt for points and 32 gigs of RAM and all of that.
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:35.300]   I have to say I have an iMac Pro, a 10 core iMac Pro with 64 gigs of RAM.
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.940]   And I try and Leo is a crying at night.
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:41.380]   Crying because I turned it off.
[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:42.380]   You couldn't take the crying.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:43.380]   It turned it off.
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:44.380]   It's sleeping.
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:45.380]   So it runs silent.
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:46.380]   Awesome.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:47.380]   It's very quiet.
[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:48.380]   Another Apple first.
[01:32:48.380 --> 01:32:51.300]   It just, I mean in some ways of course is faster.
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:56.860]   But it's just a hard thing to go from an M1 even in a laptop, even in this low end MacBook
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:33:00.100]   Pro 13 to that iMac Pro.
[01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:01.100]   It just feels a little…
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:05.060]   I'm still using Intel for my daily work because I put too much pressure on a…
[01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:12.020]   The 16 gigabyte with like big 10 bit raw files editing them every day.
[01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.020]   I'm at the edge case.
[01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:17.580]   That's why I want that new M1 F 16 inch MacBook Pro this year so badly.
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:18.580]   You'll get that.
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:19.580]   You'll get it back.
[01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.820]   You think you'll get it back in March?
[01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:23.660]   I'm not sure if it's not a redesign.
[01:33:23.660 --> 01:33:26.700]   If they do the same thing that they did with these and that's just get the new silicon
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:30.540]   into the existing designs, I think there's a good chance we'll have it March or June
[01:33:30.540 --> 01:33:33.540]   anytime they could drop that in a press release because they've already done the whole
[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:34.540]   M1 thing.
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:38.580]   But if it's a redesign, I think they're going to want it to be in an event and then
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:41.980]   it's going to depend on availability and then it'll be more likely I think June-ish.
[01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:42.980]   Yeah.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.260]   But I mean, you guys are just talking about the speed.
[01:33:45.260 --> 01:33:46.660]   I want the battery life.
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:47.660]   It's awesome.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:54.220]   I see $30,000 for this MacBook Pro stuff to the gills with storage and I can barely get
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:57.500]   across the country from New York to California with it.
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:02.780]   And me, I'm using this unplugged for all day for the shows.
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:03.780]   Days.
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.540]   Yeah, it's still at 63%.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:06.540]   Crazy.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:08.420]   I've been using it all since 8 a.m.
[01:34:08.420 --> 01:34:09.420]   It's crazy.
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:11.660]   I'm a super cheap skate.
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:15.860]   But one of the reasons I've got me buying this MacBook Pro, not just not the MacBook
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:20.540]   Air, was just the idea of having a, I don't care that it has only two Thunderbolt ports.
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:25.220]   The fact that you can see we have a 20 hour MacBook Air.
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:28.140]   I don't care what I'm going to buy in 2021 or 2022.
[01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:33.100]   I'm hoping for the Stonehenge style Mac Pro that I'm saving a button for.
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:38.940]   But this solves so many problems in my life, particularly coming from a 2015 MacBook Pro.
[01:34:38.940 --> 01:34:40.580]   It's like, yeah.
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:45.700]   It's like, it's like walking into the light after being in a bunker for like two years.
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:47.620]   It's like, oh my God.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:53.260]   Meanwhile, as we continue, let me talk a little bit about this new Tricaster we're using here.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:55.500]   Yes, it's time.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:35:00.420]   John says, I've learned a new trick on the new tech Tricaster to elite.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:05.140]   As you know, we started this podcast years ago as audio only, but very quickly, a lot
[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:07.700]   of people said, I want to see what you're doing.
[01:35:07.700 --> 01:35:11.860]   And so we started, we started, at first I started with one of those Logitech ball cams
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:12.940]   and so forth.
[01:35:12.940 --> 01:35:16.140]   But it wasn't very long before we realized, yeah, maybe we should get some cameras, get
[01:35:16.140 --> 01:35:18.100]   a studio set up, get some lights.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:19.860]   But what are we going to switch it with?
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:24.140]   And I did a lot of research and I came up with easily the best solution.
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:26.780]   Oh my God, it's happening.
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:27.860]   It's happening.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.940]   Something's happening.
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:31.700]   It's the new car.
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:37.420]   Well, if you're not watching the video, where the chains I forged it like, I forged them
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:39.860]   leak by link and yard by yard.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:44.260]   Your loving was a stick and ponderous as this one, seven Christmases ago.
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:47.700]   I don't know what we're going to do with this, but it's a cool effect.
[01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:49.620]   Look at that.
[01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.900]   This is the Tricaster is amazing.
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:56.460]   I mean, we started years ago with the original Tricaster.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:00.300]   We just got the brand new Tricaster to Elite, which is the top of the line.
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:04.500]   It is the most complete live production system on the planet.
[01:36:04.500 --> 01:36:06.900]   And given what it does, it's very affordable.
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:10.820]   There's a full line of Tricasters at newtech.com/tricaster.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:11.980]   Newtech.com/tricaster.
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:18.700]   We'll show you a little video of some of the things you can do with the Tricaster to Elite.
[01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:19.700]   We're still learning.
[01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:22.060]   We are, I think, our first training, right, John?
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:23.060]   Yesterday.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:24.380]   So we're starting to learn it.
[01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:25.380]   We use it.
[01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:27.380]   It's really, we don't use it as fully as you can.
[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:30.020]   It's really a live video production system.
[01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:32.100]   In fact, it's more than that.
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:35.620]   It's an all-encompassing digital media solution.
[01:36:35.620 --> 01:36:41.620]   It gives you the capability of doing content for internet, mobile, TV, a lot of sports
[01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:48.380]   channels, TV channels used to Tricaster, which explains why we have nine buttons on our
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:52.140]   new Tricaster for instant replay.
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:56.620]   I don't know if that's going to come up a lot on Mac break weekly, but if we needed to,
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:58.380]   we could do instant replay.
[01:36:58.380 --> 01:37:02.980]   I'm using one of the things Newtech invented, NDI.
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:07.940]   All of the Tricaster stuff is software-driven IP native technology, which gives you the
[01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:11.620]   capability of the connectivity and the control you need to take on any sort of digital media
[01:37:11.620 --> 01:37:13.020]   production.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:19.420]   The video, for instance, you see from my MacBook Pro 13 is actually not going through a scan
[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:21.540]   converter, which is what we did for years.
[01:37:21.540 --> 01:37:26.660]   In fact, until today, is going through the network using the NDI interface.
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:31.300]   It's actually riding on our company, Ethernet network.
[01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:38.660]   When you consider the variety of features offered, there is nothing, nothing even close
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:40.620]   to the Tricaster 2 Elite.
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:41.780]   There's a live call connect.
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:46.300]   If you do calls as we do, you can enhance your production by letting, by connecting to
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:50.140]   anyone, anywhere on any device, high quality video and audio.
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:55.500]   It doesn't matter what your callers are using, Microsoft Skype, Teams, Zoom meetings, Slack,
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.500]   everything.
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:58.220]   Taps right into that.
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:01.700]   Built in, there's the live set technology, which we also don't use.
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:06.180]   We really should, which could transform any location into an elaborate virtual environment
[01:38:06.180 --> 01:38:08.780]   that you can move in front of behind.
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:13.620]   You get full access to the premium library of a Newtech live set virtual sets.
[01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:15.620]   They have some amazing stuff.
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:17.300]   There's also the live graphics creator.
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.260]   This was huge for us.
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.620]   All the graphics now you see on our shows are created in Photoshop, including animated
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:28.940]   titles, motion graphics, looping effects, imported directly from Adobe Creative Cloud
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:31.380]   tools into our production system.
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:33.900]   Live graphics creator, that's what it's called.
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:37.980]   It really makes it easier and faster to do graphics than ever before.
[01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:42.700]   You don't have to be a flame expert, especially trained.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:44.180]   You can do it in Photoshop.
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:45.780]   It's the tools you're already using.
[01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:49.820]   Of course, streaming, which we use, you can stream to whatever you want, including convenient
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:54.740]   presets for Facebook Live, Microsoft Azure, Twitch, YouTube Live, and on and on and on.
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:39:01.100]   I just think the TriCaster tool is actually changing the world of video production for
[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:07.900]   churches, for television networks, for sports, and of course, for fancy podcasts like mine.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:09.180]   It's transformative.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.900]   It's better than broadcast.
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:11.900]   It's a TriCaster.
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:16.620]   Now, not every TriCaster is right for every user.
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:21.060]   I want you to go to newtech, n-e-w-t-e-k.com/tricaster.
[01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:25.940]   There's a guide there that'll help you choose which TriCaster is right for you.
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:29.900]   Of course, I know our engineers, they immediately said, "Well, what's this one, the most expensive
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:31.620]   one, the TriCaster II Elite?
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:32.620]   What's that one?"
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:35.180]   And it is amazing.
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:36.180]   Show that effect again.
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:41.900]   Is that the effect you learned at the training, John, with the various screens going in and
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:43.940]   out and moving around?
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:44.940]   That's wild.
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:47.140]   I don't know what we would use that for, but...
[01:39:47.140 --> 01:39:48.140]   Oh, look.
[01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:49.140]   I want nothing.
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:52.580]   Oh, my God.
[01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:55.660]   We could get rid of these avatars.
[01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:56.660]   We could totally...
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:39:57.660]   You know what, John?
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:58.660]   We should just back in my frame.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:01.740]   We could just get rid of these clunky old TVs and do that.
[01:40:01.740 --> 01:40:03.780]   You guys could be floating.
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:05.620]   How hard could we just do that all the time?
[01:40:05.620 --> 01:40:09.020]   Wait, are we really not on those monitors?
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:10.020]   Is that all fake?
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:11.220]   I have no idea anymore.
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:13.220]   I used to know how this stuff works.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.660]   As far as I know, I could be in my bedroom right now.
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:17.300]   This whole thing could be virtual.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.500]   They don't tell me.
[01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:19.500]   John, really?
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.500]   I'm serious.
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:22.500]   We could get rid of the avatars.
[01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:25.100]   I'm going to fantoms on.
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:26.100]   This is...
[01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:27.100]   Anty?
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.100]   Anty?
[01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:29.100]   Anty?
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:30.100]   I cannot go.
[01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.100]   I'm going to go.
[01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:32.100]   I'm going to work 23.
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:33.100]   I'm on my max.
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.100]   We thank New Tech.
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:37.540]   Every once in a while, we'll get an engineer who goes, "Okay, I'm going to do..."
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:39.420]   And Kevin King is like that.
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:41.380]   He just says, "I'm going to do something weird."
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:42.380]   Anty's like that.
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:43.380]   I just go to...
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:44.820]   And weird things happen.
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.860]   They love plumbing the depths in there.
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:48.460]   And it's really almost infinite.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:49.820]   Tri-caster, too elite.
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:53.900]   Thank you, New Tech, and New Tech.com/tri-caster.
[01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:57.700]   I want to use those instant replay buttons because then if, you know, if Andy and I get an
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:00.340]   argument, I could say, "Well, Andy, earlier you said..."
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:04.180]   We're checking this because...
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:06.060]   Let's look at that in super slow-mo.
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:10.620]   That's really good because, you know, I remember the last time we had an argument just like
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:11.620]   it was yesterday.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:17.520]   Now, it's possible that they could ingest the last 10 years of Macbreak and then you
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.860]   don't even have to come in anymore and just play the appropriate Leo response.
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:21.860]   That's what any of us said.
[01:41:21.860 --> 01:41:23.740]   That's my secret, you know, plan.
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:24.740]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.740 --> 01:41:26.860]   Just have a big keyboard with different Leo answers.
[01:41:26.860 --> 01:41:27.860]   An ML Leo.
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:28.860]   ML Leo.
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:29.860]   That's where we're headed.
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:34.420]   Okay, we're going to let Andy Crying to his koala a little bit and then we will...
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:35.420]   I'm fine, I'm strong.
[01:41:35.420 --> 01:41:38.060]   I'm just be strong.
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:45.940]   Mac shipments rise 49% in Q4 leading the industry.
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:50.900]   PC sales in general are doing really well better than they've done in a decade.
[01:41:50.900 --> 01:41:53.340]   But I'm glad to see the Mac is part of all that.
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:54.340]   That's great.
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:55.340]   49% man.
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:42:01.980]   Well, 49% of nothing ain't a lot, but still, it's a little, you know, that's a little deceptive
[01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:03.980]   to say, you know, a percentage.
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:04.980]   But I think, no, that's good.
[01:42:04.980 --> 01:42:07.180]   And I think I believe the M1 is going to help that.
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:08.980]   The profit numbers are probably better than the market numbers.
[01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:10.260]   Yes, that's right.
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:21.100]   Apple's now the number four PC manufacturer worldwide based on fourth quarter 2020 shipments.
[01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:22.100]   And for the quarter Leo.
[01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:23.660]   Can't wait for the results.
[01:42:23.660 --> 01:42:25.180]   It's going to be really fun.
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:26.180]   Yeah.
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:28.020]   Is that all the iPhone is in the fourth quarter?
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:29.820]   Is that this week?
[01:42:29.820 --> 01:42:30.820]   Yeah, I believe it's in.
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:31.820]   Oh boy.
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:33.380]   I don't think it's this week.
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:37.700]   We'll get Jason Snell to fire up his graph machine.
[01:42:37.700 --> 01:42:40.460]   Just in case you're interested, Lenovo's number one.
[01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:41.460]   January 27th.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:42.940]   The 27th, okay.
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:47.460]   Lenovo's number one HP's number two, Dell's number three, Apple's number four, Acer's
[01:42:47.460 --> 01:42:50.540]   number five, both for the year and the quarter.
[01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:55.260]   But Apple had the most growth, 49.2% growth.
[01:42:55.260 --> 01:42:58.700]   I tell you, whoever writes a how to book to go with all those new man.
[01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:00.940]   Oh man, that would be a good idea.
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:05.780]   I can't believe you're still writing books, David.
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:06.780]   I know.
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.780]   What Apple really said.
[01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:10.180]   I, yeah.
[01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:13.500]   You know, it's an experiment.
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:16.900]   I mean, it is true that computer books have basically gone away.
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:21.580]   I mean, the bookstore shelves of computer books are really tiny now.
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.660]   Everybody gets their information from Google and YouTube and that's fine.
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:30.020]   This is an experiment to see if there are still people who like structured, written by
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:35.260]   a professional writer, amply illustrated, indexed, you know, to have on your desk.
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:39.180]   A lot of people in my generation too.
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:41.180]   I get calls all the time on the radio show.
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.020]   What's a good book?
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:44.220]   And I always recommend yours.
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:47.100]   I recommend the missing manuals when you were doing those.
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:51.860]   I will recommend the unlocked series now because of that.
[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:55.980]   So there are, yeah, I think, and I've also always said, look, everybody learns in a different
[01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:56.980]   way.
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:59.700]   If you're a visual learner, you might prefer YouTube.
[01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:02.460]   If you're auditory, you might listen to podcasts.
[01:44:02.460 --> 01:44:06.260]   But honestly, I think a lot of people, I'm one of them.
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:08.060]   I like to see it on paper.
[01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:10.220]   I like to read it and I think it's a good thing.
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:14.180]   I got to say, when we were researching Mac unlocked and iPhone unlocked, we looked
[01:44:14.180 --> 01:44:21.260]   at what's available on Amazon and it's unbelievable how many of the book titles now say for seniors.
[01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:22.780]   iPhone 12 for seniors.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:28.660]   I mean, they're just taking what you just said and making it a firm assumption that nobody's
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:30.780]   going to buy a book unless you're old.
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:33.180]   I'm just not sure I buy that.
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:38.980]   It's surely there are other age brackets who like the form factor.
[01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:43.220]   When I'm learning programming languages, which I do all the time, I very often will
[01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:49.500]   order a paperback but a physical version of the book because I like to have it open while
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:50.500]   I'm next to my computer.
[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:53.340]   I mean, that makes sense, I think, for some books, absolutely.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:58.940]   So I wish you luck and I'm glad somebody's still writing computer books.
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:03.060]   Now if you can only bring computer shopper back, I think we'd all be.
[01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:04.500]   And copy serve.
[01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.060]   And copy serve, yeah.
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:11.460]   The most downloaded game in December.
[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:12.460]   Among us.
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:13.460]   So sus.
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:14.460]   So sus.
[01:45:14.460 --> 01:45:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.460 --> 01:45:16.460]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:17.860]   Very popular.
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:25.140]   48 million downloads in December.
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:26.660]   That's took off.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:27.660]   Now a lot of them.
[01:45:27.660 --> 01:45:29.580]   Everybody is streaming it.
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:32.620]   4 to 1 Google Play to Mac OS.
[01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:34.020]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:35.020]   It's big on Twitch, right?
[01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:36.700]   You watch among us AOC.
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:37.860]   On YouTube too.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:38.860]   Really?
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:45.140]   People who got to like million plus YouTube streaming accounts just doing among us just
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:50.660]   over the summer, like huge creators like Corpse and Valcarie and so many people and
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:55.780]   they all have these among us thumbnails with, you know, 9,000 IQ on them and people just
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:57.940]   watched hours and hours of it.
[01:45:57.940 --> 01:46:01.420]   And then they were brilliant because they'd collaborate and you'd see like team ups and
[01:46:01.420 --> 01:46:04.020]   apparently we just could not watch enough of it.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:05.740]   Hey, we are so in the wrong business.
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:07.540]   I know.
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.780]   Among us probably you could do that in a weekend.
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:14.860]   It's not the most complicated or visually demanding of games.
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:17.620]   I have an iPhone 12.
[01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:20.940]   I have that case with a circle on it that Apple showed.
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:26.060]   I have that puck that goes onto it and stop the mag save.
[01:46:26.060 --> 01:46:27.860]   It doesn't charge anymore.
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:29.100]   It stopped wireless charging.
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:30.100]   Yeah.
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:32.620]   I guess that could happen, right?
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:33.620]   I can't.
[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.540]   It doesn't even on my old cheat chargers.
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:36.540]   I'm a little disappointed.
[01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:38.820]   Leo, you're not holding it right.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:39.820]   I must be.
[01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:40.820]   I must be.
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:41.820]   I finally said.
[01:46:41.820 --> 01:46:42.820]   Are you putting it screen side down, Leo?
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:44.860]   Oh, oh, you mean the other?
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:45.860]   My mom.
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:46.860]   Okay.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:49.300]   She's not watching, but I'm going to tell you a little story on my mom.
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:53.620]   I gave her an Apple watch for Christmas because I thought, oh, she really, because she's
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:46:57.980]   just 88 and, you know, the fall detection and just, you know, keeping track of her and
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:46:59.300]   all that.
[01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:01.620]   And she was charging it.
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:04.620]   I think I said, if I told this before, I don't want to hurt her feelings.
[01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:10.940]   She was charging it, but she thought that the round part was the face of the watch.
[01:47:10.940 --> 01:47:15.660]   So she was charging it on the screen and it would never charge.
[01:47:15.660 --> 01:47:17.780]   And I said, well, what do you, she says, it's not charging.
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:20.220]   So we'll show me what you're doing.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:22.060]   And this was faced up the round part.
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:25.700]   And I said, oh, mom, you put the charger on that side.
[01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:26.700]   And it fixed it.
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:27.700]   So maybe it's me.
[01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.900]   Maybe I just, it's a report problem.
[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:31.700]   I'll have to try it with the other side up.
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:32.700]   Grims in the family.
[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:33.700]   Yeah.
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:36.460]   I was wondering if anybody had had that problem or heard about that.
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:39.260]   You know, is a coil in here.
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:42.340]   It could have become dislodged somehow or, you know, failed.
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:44.580]   It worked at first, but it doesn't anymore, which is fine.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:45.860]   I have same setup, Leo.
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:47.700]   I have not, I have not seen that.
[01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:48.700]   Okay.
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:49.700]   Yeah, I like the puck.
[01:47:49.700 --> 01:47:50.700]   I like the next.
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:51.700]   Oh, I love it.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:52.700]   I didn't.
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:54.920]   But now because of that, I've been able to get a wallet case because these things are
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:57.140]   too thick to charge wirelessly.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:48:00.660]   So since I went back to lightning charging, now I can have a wallet case again.
[01:48:00.660 --> 01:48:02.140]   What are you going to do with the portless iPhone, Leo?
[01:48:02.140 --> 01:48:03.140]   That's it for you.
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:04.140]   I'm dead.
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.820]   Then it would be bad.
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:07.820]   That would be bad.
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:14.060]   Now, another thing you can't do if you want to do wireless charging is a pop socket.
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:17.460]   Does anybody use a pop socket?
[01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:21.140]   They have, I see a lot of pop sockets out there.
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:22.660]   Younger folks.
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:24.620]   It's the young, it's the youngens, right?
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:29.380]   In fact, my son who went to see you bolder Henry says it was invented by somebody at
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:31.780]   CU Boulder and he's a billionaire now.
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:38.740]   So pop socket is announced a new MagSafe compatible.
[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:41.220]   They call it a pop grip.
[01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:42.380]   They're not all marble.
[01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:44.060]   Don't get the marble one that's disgusting.
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:50.620]   But apparently it isn't adhered to the iPhone as the old ones were with glue.
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:51.860]   It's magnetic.
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:56.500]   So it goes and then you take it off and you can put your puck on it.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:57.500]   So I like it.
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:49:00.300]   That seems like a good use of the MagSafe connector.
[01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:04.540]   The other one that seems like a good use is I saw there's a tripod.
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:06.780]   You just slap your phone on this thing in the magnet.
[01:49:06.780 --> 01:49:08.300]   I'll check that out.
[01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:12.180]   Because I have this thing, those of you who are watching on my mic.
[01:49:12.180 --> 01:49:13.180]   Yeah, I use that.
[01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:14.180]   Yeah, it's a...
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:15.180]   But it presses the volume keys.
[01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.180]   If you don't position it, it's great.
[01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:18.180]   I know.
[01:49:18.180 --> 01:49:20.660]   You have to put it on off center to make it not pressing.
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:22.020]   I keep turning my phone on.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:25.020]   David, for those of you only listening, many of us have this.
[01:49:25.020 --> 01:49:28.100]   It's an expandable adapter for a smartphone.
[01:49:28.100 --> 01:49:30.140]   It could have fit any size.
[01:49:30.140 --> 01:49:33.700]   But it has two fingers on either side and a spring.
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:34.900]   And then you put that on a tripod.
[01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:36.860]   And I use exactly that, David.
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:39.700]   And invariably I'll switch the fight and say slide to turn off.
[01:49:39.700 --> 01:49:40.700]   I say, no!
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:41.700]   No!
[01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:42.700]   Exactly.
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:45.300]   So the MagSafe tripod, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:46.300]   That's a good idea.
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:51.700]   The one I have heard that isn't so successful are the wallets that magnet onto the back.
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:53.500]   Because you slide it into your pocket.
[01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:54.700]   You slide it right off.
[01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:55.700]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:57.000]   Don't put your money in that.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.200]   It's moment the folks who make those add on lenses for iPhones, they are making a tripod
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.200]   mount.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.200]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:06.100]   Yeah, it's just a...
[01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.100]   That goes right on the back.
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:09.260]   I have a good on anamorphic lens as well.
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:10.260]   Do they?
[01:50:10.260 --> 01:50:11.260]   Explain.
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:12.800]   Tell me what anamorphic is.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:15.860]   Because I see that all the time and I feel like an idiot.
[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:19.940]   I mean, I'm not Alex Lindsey, so I can't give you an accurate explanation.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.180]   That's why I don't know.
[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:25.420]   Because Alex has explained it to me a hundred times and I still don't understand it.
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:30.600]   Yeah, I believe it's from the oldie time days when they had to figure out a way to get
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.600]   wider pictures using the same amount of data.
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:40.600]   And so I am not good at explaining this, but it basically...
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:44.520]   It's basically shot in a normal aspect ratio but has data that then gets it compressed
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:49.640]   down to a wide angle aspect ratio that contains all that data.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:52.320]   And it does strange things to the bokeh and to the lights.
[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:53.320]   So that's why people like it.
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:57.020]   When you watch Star Trek, it has all those really extended lens flares because of the
[01:50:57.020 --> 01:51:00.220]   way it compresses all the data when recording the image.
[01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.620]   I'm going to get so many angry film students writing to the scene.
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.820]   I think that's pretty accurate.
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:10.500]   So you're shooting in 4-3, but it's distorted so that when you process it, you then expand
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:12.060]   it to the wide screen.
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:14.140]   That's exactly what it is in film, right?
[01:51:14.140 --> 01:51:18.580]   You use the 4-3 film, but you're getting a wide screen image up on playback because it
[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:21.020]   gets re-distorted on playback.
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:23.140]   But I'm not sure what it would mean.
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:24.140]   In a digital...
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:25.140]   In a digital...
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:26.140]   Yeah.
[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:27.140]   Anamorphic.
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:30.120]   Maybe it just gives you those effects that people like.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:33.160]   The lenses are expensive because I've been looking at anamorphic lenses lately and they're
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.360]   all like PL, Mountain, like thousands and thousands of dollars.
[01:51:36.360 --> 01:51:39.720]   Do you want to shoot your show in anamorphic?
[01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:42.600]   I want to look like the bridge of the Enterprise, Leo.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:45.240]   I want cinema-rama.
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:49.120]   Just let this make everybody have to download it and then go into a big dome.
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.040]   2.59 to 1.
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:55.120]   I remember going to my first cinema-rama movie when I was a kid.
[01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:02.500]   My grandma brought me to a movie called Circus World and it was wild because I'd never seen
[01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:06.280]   the screens curved and went around you almost.
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:11.020]   We were all in awe, but chiefly my memory of that is eating too many malted milk balls
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:12.020]   and getting sick.
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:15.540]   That's another story for another time.
[01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:20.540]   We're learning all kinds of things.
[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:23.540]   Where were we?
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:25.540]   Oh Lord.
[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:28.540]   There was also a problem like that in Todd AO with people getting sick.
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:29.540]   Nauseous.
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:30.540]   Yes.
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:31.540]   Nauseous.
[01:52:31.540 --> 01:52:33.540]   That's why you don't see people shooting in that form of the day.
[01:52:33.540 --> 01:52:34.540]   No, no.
[01:52:34.540 --> 01:52:35.540]   Thank goodness.
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:37.660]   And also while watching Wonder Woman 1984, same problem.
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:41.660]   I got sick and I didn't even, you know, I only saw the second half.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:42.660]   It wasn't good.
[01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:43.660]   It could have been worse.
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:44.660]   Did you see it?
[01:52:44.660 --> 01:52:45.660]   Did you finally see people sick?
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:48.660]   I paid the 30 bucks for it because you had to pay for it.
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:52.300]   Canada, because Canada.
[01:52:52.300 --> 01:52:53.900]   It was only streaming in the US.
[01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:54.900]   Everyone else had to pay for it.
[01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:55.900]   You have universal healthcare.
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:56.900]   Stop complaining.
[01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:57.900]   Gee.
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:06.420]   So Renee, have you had any problem with condensation in your AirPod Max ear cups?
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:09.420]   No, I haven't.
[01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:13.140]   I have worn them for long periods of time indoors.
[01:53:13.140 --> 01:53:19.940]   And the working theory is that the aluminium cups are cold and your ears are warm.
[01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:24.700]   And when those two meet in the middle, it creates condensation.
[01:53:24.700 --> 01:53:30.340]   But I've been trying and either I'm too cold, you know, as a human, I'm just too cold.
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:33.180]   But I haven't been able to see it, although I know people who have.
[01:53:33.180 --> 01:53:36.460]   Or some people just have sweaty ears.
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:37.460]   It's not sweat.
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:40.140]   And I'm not going to taste test it, but I believe other people have.
[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:41.140]   And it's not sweat.
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:42.140]   It's not a conversation.
[01:53:42.140 --> 01:53:43.140]   Oh, OK.
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:44.140]   Yeah.
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:53.020]   A little note, nine to five Mac, one of their readers, Damien Men, sent his AirPod Max back
[01:53:53.020 --> 01:53:55.100]   for warranty.
[01:53:55.100 --> 01:54:01.020]   And they say, take the ear cups off before you ship it back to us.
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:04.460]   Oh, interesting.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.620]   They don't want your Jeremy ear cups.
[01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:07.620]   You think that's that?
[01:54:07.620 --> 01:54:08.620]   Maybe it's that.
[01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:09.620]   Yeah.
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:11.620]   I think it's also maybe they don't want to lose the lost.
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:13.620]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.620 --> 01:54:17.900]   I think it makes sense, especially for a company who's trying to cut down on plastic and stuff.
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:18.900]   Sure.
[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:20.140]   Why send those in for repair?
[01:54:20.140 --> 01:54:21.140]   Yeah.
[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:25.220]   And I presume that if you have a problem with your ear cups, you can get them replaced,
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:26.220]   I would guess.
[01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:28.220]   Sorry, Andy, go ahead.
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:31.020]   No, I'm saying also it's a consumable.
[01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:33.700]   So I mean, they're not going to replace a consumable.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:37.860]   They may as well for all the reasons I've restated before, but also the fact that this
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:38.860]   is not part of it.
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:41.660]   You had to keep that that's yours permanently.
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:46.580]   We don't want the ever types of them again.
[01:54:46.580 --> 01:54:51.420]   Do not do this with your Apple Watch and your camera.
[01:54:51.420 --> 01:54:55.860]   Mitchell Clark says you can use your Apple Watch as a viewfinder.
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:56.860]   Yeah.
[01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:59.780]   I saw people posting that all last week.
[01:54:59.780 --> 01:55:00.780]   Yeah, just don't do that.
[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:01.780]   Okay.
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:02.780]   That's, you know, that's as bad.
[01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:05.740]   Well, I mean, a lot of people use like some people can't afford a camera and they get started
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:09.660]   making videos, whether it's TikTok or YouTube or something, and they'll use a front-facing
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:11.460]   camera, but the back ones are really good.
[01:55:11.460 --> 01:55:12.460]   Much better.
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.460]   Really better quality.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:18.020]   So they use this as a hack to center themselves and figure out how to record themselves for
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:19.020]   videos.
[01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:21.700]   I can see that, but why not leave it on your wrist?
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:23.780]   Why strap it onto the phone?
[01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:24.780]   Because then you're looking down.
[01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:25.780]   This way you're looking at it.
[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:28.700]   So your eye, your eye line is with the audience when you're recording over the video.
[01:55:28.700 --> 01:55:29.700]   I know, but you just check.
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:30.700]   Framing.
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:33.900]   You can just, you know, I shouldn't poo poo it.
[01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:37.780]   So you're on the Twitter saying it's the best hack ever.
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:40.700]   It's the best hack since custom icons.
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:43.060]   Why doesn't the watch go to sleep though?
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:44.860]   I'm around our lock.
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:45.860]   Can you kick?
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:49.540]   The photo app doesn't, it gives you some time when you're in the photo app because it
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:53.500]   knows you're in a live view and if it goes to sleep, it's bad for your photo taking.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:54.500]   Okay.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:55.500]   Yeah.
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:59.340]   But this gives me excuse to say it once again that I think that one line of accessories
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:02.660]   that I don't think Apple has really prosecuted as well as they should have is the idea of
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:07.540]   using the Apple watch sort of more as a pocket watch as this little cute little squares
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:12.620]   poster stamp of incredible technology that you could snap onto a console someplace else
[01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:18.100]   or snap in this case on the back of a phone case for a second monitor.
[01:56:18.100 --> 01:56:22.780]   There are times where I kind of want that functionality, but I still want to have like
[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:25.580]   my regular Casio G shock on my wrist.
[01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:30.380]   He says pointing toward a risk that has no Casio G shock on it.
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:35.020]   It's a sort of thing that if it were $30 or $40 and were available in a variety of attractive
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:38.220]   colors, I would probably wind up owning one or two of them.
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:41.780]   If it meant that I could just simply have this in the watch pocket of my jeans and then
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:47.980]   consult it for a consult it occasionally for a for dapper effect.
[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:51.020]   It's funny you should say that because remember the iPod Nano?
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:55.740]   It was basically the size and shape of the eye of the watch, but without the band.
[01:56:55.740 --> 01:56:59.140]   And I remember there was this whole aftermarket of people selling wristbands.
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:01.940]   Put your iPod Nano to use that as a watch.
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:02.940]   Right.
[01:57:02.940 --> 01:57:03.940]   All right.
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:04.940]   I'm going to try it out.
[01:57:04.940 --> 01:57:07.620]   Everything won't hassle you about not being physically fit either.
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.700]   It will just say, okay, I'm much better, much better.
[01:57:10.700 --> 01:57:11.700]   Keep listening to music.
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:12.700]   Watch more movies.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.100]   You could be you could be having a heart attack.
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:16.100]   We don't care.
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:17.100]   We don't know.
[01:57:17.100 --> 01:57:18.100]   We have really none of our business.
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:19.100]   You don't have to stand up.
[01:57:19.100 --> 01:57:20.100]   Okay.
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:22.100]   You don't have to and breathing optional.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:31.740]   So I'm on my watch.
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:33.580]   I'm selecting camera remote.
[01:57:33.580 --> 01:57:36.980]   I said, I'm going to replace camera remote.
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:37.980]   Okay.
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:41.260]   And I've got my my phone is in.
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:42.260]   It's not working.
[01:57:42.260 --> 01:57:44.020]   Let me tell you, this makes some great podcast.
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:45.020]   It's good.
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:46.020]   It's good podcast.
[01:57:46.020 --> 01:57:47.020]   Anyway, go ahead.
[01:57:47.020 --> 01:57:48.020]   Try it.
[01:57:48.020 --> 01:57:49.020]   Great radio.
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.020]   We're creating it.
[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:52.060]   We're creating a theater of the air, just like the old Mercury theater of the.
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:55.220]   We can't see anything either.
[01:57:55.220 --> 01:57:57.140]   Yeah, perfect, perfect.
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:59.380]   Don't break the illusion, David.
[01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:00.380]   Come on.
[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:03.140]   Let's face for radio and a voice for text.
[01:58:03.140 --> 01:58:06.060]   I want to take a little break here.
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:10.180]   And I'm announcing it because and I apologize apparently.
[01:58:10.180 --> 01:58:18.820]   So we have we started using a service called megaphone last year, which inserts ads, direct
[01:58:18.820 --> 01:58:26.460]   ad insertion and in theory, the way it's supposed to work is I'm supposed to say, and
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:31.260]   now we're going to talk about something else, pause for a beat, and then we talk about something
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:35.460]   else and our editors put an inaudible tone in there.
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:41.540]   And then when you download it, you download it from megaphone servers and megaphone sticks
[01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:44.100]   an ad right there and it should be seamless.
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:48.580]   It should feel like a natural, but I've been getting emails from people and I apologize
[01:58:48.580 --> 01:58:53.260]   if this has happened to you who are saying in the middle of Andy's sentence, I mean,
[01:58:53.260 --> 01:58:56.660]   we all get a little impatient with Andy, but apparently megaphone really is impatient
[01:58:56.660 --> 01:58:58.260]   with you in the middle of Andy's sentence.
[01:58:58.260 --> 01:59:00.100]   And now you finally know.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:01.620]   Thank you very much.
[01:59:01.620 --> 01:59:06.500]   They have put an ad and then the ad plays and then Andy goes on.
[01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:07.940]   Don't cry into your koala.
[01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:08.940]   It's okay.
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:12.980]   We love you, Andy, but I'm just saying I apologize to people.
[01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:17.340]   So we're going to see if this works.
[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:24.260]   We'll have more with David, poke Andy, and Rene Richie in just a bit.
[01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:25.420]   And now we're back.
[01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:26.420]   I don't know.
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:29.740]   We'll see if it works.
[01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:30.740]   It's not turning out.
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:33.100]   Are you saying like film strip technology?
[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:35.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:37.100]   Press the clicker.
[01:59:37.100 --> 01:59:38.100]   Press the clicker.
[01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:39.100]   Tim Cook.
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:40.100]   Next slide.
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:43.100]   Press mid tomorrow.
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:45.660]   Supplies of M1 chips.
[01:59:45.660 --> 01:59:47.780]   I've had a question about your ad protocol.
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:53.260]   So when you do the in person ads, I'm launching my own podcast in February.
[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:54.740]   I'm the last person in America.
[01:59:54.740 --> 01:59:56.100]   Perfect timing, David.
[01:59:56.100 --> 01:59:58.980]   This is a great time to launch a new podcast.
[01:59:58.980 --> 01:59:59.980]   Exactly.
[01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:06.460]   But so when you read those ads, I've noticed that almost always they are in fact really
[02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:07.460]   great products.
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:08.460]   I mean, they're.
[02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:09.540]   Yeah, we're very careful.
[02:00:09.540 --> 02:00:10.540]   We don't pick stuff that.
[02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.820]   Well, that's what I was going to say.
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:15.660]   Have you ever been approached by somebody whose stuff really isn't good?
[02:00:15.660 --> 02:00:16.660]   Every day.
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:17.660]   Really?
[02:00:17.660 --> 02:00:18.660]   Oh, yeah, we turned down a lot.
[02:00:18.660 --> 02:00:19.660]   In fact, I remember.
[02:00:19.660 --> 02:00:20.780]   You turned them down all the time.
[02:00:20.780 --> 02:00:24.260]   I was at an upfront a few years ago talking to advertisers.
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:28.180]   The upfronts are where you at the end of the year sell ads for the new year.
[02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:29.180]   And I said that.
[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:30.660]   I say, oh, yeah, we say no to a lot of advertisers.
[02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:33.340]   And there was an audible gasp from the audience.
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:35.340]   You're getting one for me too.
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:36.340]   You turned down.
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:38.340]   Yeah, because I don't want to do.
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:41.420]   None of us can do an ad for something that we go.
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:43.820]   This thing stinks, but I'm going to do an ad for it.
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:46.140]   That would be no fun.
[02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:48.220]   So dude, a lot of people do that.
[02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:49.220]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:50.980]   Pretty much everybody does.
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:51.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:52.980]   I don't know.
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:53.980]   I'm saying as you Leo, yeah.
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:54.980]   It's called money.
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:59.940]   Well, and as a matter of fact, it's been a very tough year because of COVID.
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:03.860]   That's why I'm mocking you for starting a podcast.
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:08.180]   And a lot of even on the radio show advertising dollars are drying up.
[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:10.180]   I suspect what's going to happen.
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:14.820]   And if you can hang on, I think you'll be fine, David, is that people are just so nervous
[02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:18.180]   about COVID, the economy, about the transition.
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:23.380]   There's just so much as making advertisers stomachs go flip-flop that they're just holding
[02:01:23.380 --> 02:01:27.420]   back and podcast are the easiest thing not to buy.
[02:01:27.420 --> 02:01:32.100]   But as we were saying, I still see a lot of public service announcements on network television.
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:33.580]   I mean, they're not selling out.
[02:01:33.580 --> 02:01:35.420]   I'm sure of it.
[02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:39.860]   But I suspect what will happen is the vaccine kicks in as life settles down.
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:43.020]   We get a little bit more normal.
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:47.820]   There will be all of this pent up demand that there'll be billions of dollars that have
[02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:52.660]   been held back that will suddenly flow into the economy.
[02:01:52.660 --> 02:01:54.820]   And I think that's going to probably be in the fourth quarter.
[02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:57.180]   So if you can turn your umbrellas upside down.
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:01:58.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:58.180 --> 02:01:59.820]   It's pennies from heaven, ladies, Joe.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:05.020]   I mean, mercifully, my podcast is being done by PRX and Simon & Schuster.
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:06.020]   Oh, you don't have to worry.
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:07.300]   So, yeah, that's not my problem.
[02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:08.300]   You don't have to worry about that.
[02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:09.300]   Yes.
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:11.300]   That's the way to do it, by the way.
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:12.300]   Yeah.
[02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:20.900]   I think that it's honestly, you know, it's probably not the best time to start a podcast,
[02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:26.260]   partly because unless it's a news podcast, people are so, for the last year, have been
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:32.140]   so consumed by news that shows like The New York Times, The Daily and PR's Up First.
[02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:37.740]   They're doing very well because people are like obsessed by the news.
[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:41.140]   But it's heard, I think, podcasts like ours that are really a little bit more.
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:43.140]   You can take it or leave it.
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:44.140]   Wow.
[02:02:44.140 --> 02:02:49.220]   If I get an extra hour or a show title, the show, you can, you know, nobody's making
[02:02:49.220 --> 02:02:53.460]   you listen.
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:02:56.100]   So I'm glad what's your show going to be about?
[02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:58.940]   It's called Unsung Science, David Hogue.
[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:05.460]   And each one will tell start to finish the story of a successful science project that
[02:03:05.460 --> 02:03:09.420]   through all the odds, through all the difficulties, made it out the other end.
[02:03:09.420 --> 02:03:13.060]   So the first episode is about, do you know about debug Fresno?
[02:03:13.060 --> 02:03:15.820]   This is the coolest damn thing with climate change.
[02:03:15.820 --> 02:03:19.660]   Mosquitoes are going north in the United States and bringing with them all kinds of
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:21.180]   disease.
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:26.420]   So Google's sister company Verily decided they were going to do this radical experiment
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:33.660]   in Fresno where they would blast out 20 million per summer male mosquitoes who had all been
[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:34.660]   sterilized.
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:36.380]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:38.220]   And they mate with the females.
[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:39.700]   They have sex and need.
[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:40.700]   Nothing happens.
[02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:41.700]   But the lobster.
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:42.940]   Well, no, they have eggs that never had.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:43.940]   Oh, wow.
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:51.140]   In one summer, they decreased the mosquito population of Fresno, California by 95%.
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:54.060]   It's weird is nobody wants to live there still.
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.540]   But that's another problem.
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:58.980]   David, does the episode cover what's different from the mosquito?
[02:03:58.980 --> 02:04:02.260]   Bob has to say about recreation without programming.
[02:04:02.260 --> 02:04:06.580]   I think there's no genetic and engineering involved.
[02:04:06.580 --> 02:04:07.580]   There's no spraying involved.
[02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:09.220]   How do you sterilize a mosquito?
[02:04:09.220 --> 02:04:11.940]   Is it a very complicated procedure?
[02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:13.580]   No, actually.
[02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:21.100]   So they infected the male mosquitoes with a very common bacteria called Wobaki.
[02:04:21.100 --> 02:04:23.140]   It's already in half the mosquito species.
[02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:26.500]   So and then it's not really sterilization.
[02:04:26.500 --> 02:04:28.060]   It's incompatibility.
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:34.820]   So the males, the females of the wild, the lab males, the wild females mate and they're
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:35.820]   incompatible.
[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:36.820]   So their eggs never hatch.
[02:04:36.820 --> 02:04:39.740]   Is Wobaki available at my local CVS?
[02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:45.180]   Anyway, what's the name of the name of the podcast?
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:46.940]   It's called unsung science.
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:48.460]   And it will be out next month?
[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:49.900]   At the end of February.
[02:04:49.900 --> 02:04:50.900]   That's awesome.
[02:04:50.900 --> 02:04:51.900]   Congratulations.
[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:53.900]   Great luck with that.
[02:04:53.900 --> 02:04:55.900]   Well, I'll be pinging you up.
[02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:56.900]   You can come.
[02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:58.740]   Yeah, well, you don't need my advice, but PRX is great.
[02:04:58.740 --> 02:04:59.740]   You're going to do great.
[02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:04.180]   That's a great business.
[02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:06.020]   David Pogue is our very special guest.
[02:05:06.020 --> 02:05:07.780]   I am thrilled to see you, David.
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:10.060]   I just love having you on.
[02:05:10.060 --> 02:05:11.220]   You are so kind.
[02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:12.220]   Yeah.
[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:15.980]   And of course, you're way too big for us with the CBS Sunday morning and, you know,
[02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:19.180]   Nova and all the stuff that you do with the new books.
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:23.580]   But any time you want to come by, we just love having you here.
[02:05:23.580 --> 02:05:26.020]   Did you have a pic of the week?
[02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:27.940]   I did have a pic of the week, actually.
[02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:32.140]   Believe it or not, I've been a Fitbit guy forever.
[02:05:32.140 --> 02:05:34.300]   Just got an Apple watch for Christmas for my wife.
[02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:35.620]   Thank you, Nikki.
[02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:39.540]   And the one thing that does badly is sleep tracking.
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:43.620]   It doesn't show you your cycles, like your REM cycles and your dream cycles.
[02:05:43.620 --> 02:05:48.620]   So my wife Nikki said, surely there's some app that takes the Apple watches data and does
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:51.340]   a better job of parsing it.
[02:05:51.340 --> 02:05:52.500]   And she did.
[02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:53.500]   There is such a thing.
[02:05:53.500 --> 02:05:54.700]   It's called sleep watch.
[02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:56.660]   I have nothing to do with that.
[02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:59.340]   But the graphics are fantastic.
[02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:01.140]   Sorry, it's not focusing.
[02:06:01.140 --> 02:06:02.140]   I have it here though.
[02:06:02.140 --> 02:06:03.140]   It's okay.
[02:06:03.140 --> 02:06:04.140]   I have it on the.
[02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:05.140]   I'm sorry for this.
[02:06:05.140 --> 02:06:07.740]   Anyone who's watching your podcast, I'm sorry for the whole day of my new.
[02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:09.180]   We apologize for everything.
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:11.580]   Look at this Apple watch interface.
[02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:12.580]   Holy cow.
[02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:16.940]   Yeah, a graph of your cycles show much how much actual rest you got shows you how many
[02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:19.700]   times you woke up in the night.
[02:06:19.700 --> 02:06:24.300]   And it shows you something really important, which is how consistent your bedtime is.
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:30.380]   It turns out that's more important to how rested you feel than how many hours you slept.
[02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:32.940]   It's how consistent is the period that you're sleeping.
[02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:34.580]   So anyway, love this thing.
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:35.580]   It's free.
[02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:39.620]   Andy goes about it 2 a.m. and 5 p.m.
[02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:43.300]   It does in all, you know, I try to go to bed at least once a day.
[02:06:43.300 --> 02:06:47.740]   I'm not always religious about that.
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:48.740]   And one more thing.
[02:06:48.740 --> 02:06:54.220]   If you do decide to pay their fee, they do something that all these wearables have never
[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:59.460]   been good at, which is it tries to draw conclusions from your data.
[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:04.140]   So for example, on this app sleep watch, you say what happened to you last night.
[02:07:04.140 --> 02:07:05.940]   There was a pet in the room.
[02:07:05.940 --> 02:07:06.940]   It was bright.
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:08.380]   I was wearing earplugs, whatever.
[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:09.380]   I went for exercise.
[02:07:09.380 --> 02:07:11.900]   Stop my fault, man.
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:17.820]   And then over time, it says we've noticed that when you have a glass of wine with dinner,
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:19.940]   you sleep worse or whatever.
[02:07:19.940 --> 02:07:22.060]   It makes conclusions based on you.
[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:24.220]   Just what I need, a little judgment.
[02:07:24.220 --> 02:07:27.620]   Does it give you a single numbered sleep score?
[02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:28.620]   It does indeed.
[02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:29.620]   Yeah.
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:30.620]   My wife.
[02:07:30.620 --> 02:07:32.380]   I got a 645 last night.
[02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:36.100]   Oh, mine's only on zero to 100 and I got a 56.
[02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:39.020]   So that's not so good.
[02:07:39.020 --> 02:07:40.020]   What are you using?
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:41.020]   What's your?
[02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:45.220]   Something from beauty rest that goes, it's a little pad that goes under the, in between
[02:07:45.220 --> 02:07:47.020]   the mattress and the box spring.
[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:48.020]   So I don't even have to think about it.
[02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:50.100]   I don't want to, I don't like wearing my watch to bed.
[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:52.300]   That's really the main reason for that.
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:55.260]   But 56, and my wife Lisa is very competitive.
[02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:57.060]   So she'll wake up and say, I got an 89.
[02:07:57.060 --> 02:07:58.060]   What'd you get?
[02:07:58.060 --> 02:07:59.060]   She knows.
[02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:00.060]   I got a 62.
[02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:03.060]   She's going to do the same thing.
[02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:04.060]   Do you?
[02:08:04.060 --> 02:08:05.060]   Yeah.
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:06.060]   What'd you get?
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:07.060]   So what'd you get David?
[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:08.060]   What'd you get?
[02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:09.060]   She's got a 5.22.
[02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:10.940]   Oh, it's not like.
[02:08:10.940 --> 02:08:11.940]   You go in control of it.
[02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:16.220]   It's not like you can work harder and to sleep better.
[02:08:16.220 --> 02:08:17.980]   So, so it's kind of a question.
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:22.460]   Is this apps, it's a, it's a, it's a bit enough to sense when your partner is sabotaging
[02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:23.220]   your sleep.
[02:08:23.220 --> 02:08:24.980]   You should make that.
[02:08:24.980 --> 02:08:26.580]   That's in the premium version.
[02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:29.020]   Nikki woke me up every 20 minutes.
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:31.060]   It's not my fault.
[02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:32.900]   Sleep watch by body matter.
[02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:34.900]   I will have to try this.
[02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:36.460]   It's an Apple watch.
[02:08:36.460 --> 02:08:39.780]   Although you can enter it manually if you don't have an Apple watch, but really this
[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:41.660]   only makes sense if you've got an Apple watch.
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:44.500]   What I like is how much of the information you get on the watch.
[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:45.500]   Yes.
[02:08:45.500 --> 02:08:46.500]   That's really interesting.
[02:08:46.500 --> 02:08:47.500]   Like, like all of it.
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:48.500]   You just scroll through it.
[02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:49.500]   Yeah.
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:50.500]   Wow.
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:53.340]   What's that sound?
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:55.140]   Is that your koala?
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:56.140]   Andy?
[02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:57.980]   No, that's, that's Wilbur trying to get up.
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:08:58.980]   Oh, Wilbur.
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:08:59.980]   Hey, Wilbur.
[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:00.980]   Haven't seen you in a while.
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:01.980]   Wilbur.
[02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:02.980]   Kitty.
[02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:03.980]   Wilbur.
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:05.540]   Did you name him after Mr. Ed's owner?
[02:09:05.540 --> 02:09:06.780]   No, no.
[02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:07.780]   Wilbur and Otis.
[02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:08.940]   He and his brother.
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:09.940]   Wilbur Otis.
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:13.740]   Andy and I go pick of the week.
[02:09:13.740 --> 02:09:18.380]   My pick of the week is my favorite TV show on Netflix of all time, which of course changes
[02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:21.140]   every year for a month.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:22.580]   It's called Pretend It's a City.
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:25.460]   It's a, I don't know what you call it.
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:26.460]   It's friend Leibowitz.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:27.460]   Oh, I love that.
[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:32.260]   Telling in New York City, telling stories and talking, but she's talking to her friend
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:38.500]   Martin Scorsese, who is, who is the perfect situation because he clearly just loves having
[02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:41.300]   conversations with friend Leibowitz.
[02:09:41.300 --> 02:09:45.060]   And so sometimes you hear him like Martin Scorsese laughing, but he's also directing
[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:46.060]   it very, very well.
[02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:51.500]   And it's just every, it was one of those horrible situations where speaking of sleep, where it's
[02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:56.420]   like my Google TV with the Google Chromecast with Google TV, whatever you're supposed to
[02:09:56.420 --> 02:09:58.180]   call it was recommending it.
[02:09:58.180 --> 02:09:59.180]   That's right.
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:03.380]   I want to at least like add it to my favorites list so that when it's not 1 a.m. and I actually
[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:05.380]   have time to, I should not be going to bed.
[02:10:05.380 --> 02:10:09.060]   I can just, and then I wound up watching the first five minutes and then it's like, oh,
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:10.060]   530.
[02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:11.060]   Isn't that interesting Andy?
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:13.580]   But yeah, it's, I can't recommend it.
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:18.260]   Hylina possibly because it's so well timed for the situation that we're all in where like
[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:23.740]   I'm not, I haven't traveled more than a couple of miles from my house since March.
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:26.900]   I miss going to New York and hanging out there.
[02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:29.860]   And this is like lots of shots like inside New York.
[02:10:29.860 --> 02:10:34.020]   And also you kind of miss like face to face socialization with people that you don't see
[02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:35.100]   from time to time.
[02:10:35.100 --> 02:10:39.340]   So seeing these two friends just getting together like in a bar or like at a table in
[02:10:39.340 --> 02:10:42.780]   a restaurant and just talking is just a really wonderful thing to eavesdrop on.
[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:44.380]   So highest, highest recommendation.
[02:10:44.380 --> 02:10:49.500]   And you don't feel dirty afterwards as you do with a lot of like popular Netflix series.
[02:10:49.500 --> 02:10:50.500]   Yeah.
[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:51.500]   Yeah.
[02:10:51.500 --> 02:10:52.500]   Guilt like Tiger King.
[02:10:52.500 --> 02:10:53.500]   Yeah.
[02:10:53.500 --> 02:10:54.500]   Guilty watches.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:55.500]   Yeah.
[02:10:55.500 --> 02:10:56.500]   I did not want to invoke the name of the beast.
[02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:57.500]   Let's just not say two more times less less to appear.
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:58.500]   I love New York.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:01.100]   I mean, I, I actively love New York.
[02:11:01.100 --> 02:11:03.540]   And so I think it would be, I can't wait to watch this.
[02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:04.780]   It'd be, it'd be great.
[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:05.980]   I can't wait to see it.
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:07.700]   Thank you for that suggestion.
[02:11:07.700 --> 02:11:10.300]   Fran Leibowitz, Martin Scorsese.
[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:13.580]   It's a series called Pretend It's a City.
[02:11:13.580 --> 02:11:18.700]   And there are, don't get your hopes up there only seven episodes, but still, still.
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:19.700]   Okay.
[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:20.700]   This is perfect.
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:25.140]   Uh, COVID watching because it's not a big production thing, right?
[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:26.140]   That's safe.
[02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:27.140]   They can do it.
[02:11:27.140 --> 02:11:28.140]   Yeah.
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:29.140]   That's great.
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:34.420]   That got me hooked for like two hours was the first, I think the first real scene is like
[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:37.340]   she and Scorsese here to go to Q and A with an audience.
[02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:39.860]   And with the audience questions is, does it annoy you when?
[02:11:39.860 --> 02:11:41.660]   And then Francis, yes.
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:43.660]   That's Fran Leibowitz.
[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:45.260]   And in that shell.
[02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:46.260]   Yes.
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:48.020]   And all annoys me.
[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:49.860]   Renee Richie, pick of the week.
[02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:50.860]   Okay.
[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:54.700]   So these are, I don't know, Alex, maybe just picked these in the past, but they're new
[02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:55.700]   to me.
[02:11:55.700 --> 02:11:56.860]   And these are apertures.
[02:11:56.860 --> 02:11:57.860]   M.
[02:11:57.860 --> 02:11:58.860]   M12.
[02:11:58.860 --> 02:11:59.860]   M.C.
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:01.740]   lights and they look small.
[02:12:01.740 --> 02:12:02.740]   They're inductively charged.
[02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:05.980]   So you can just put them on a charging pad to charge them.
[02:12:05.980 --> 02:12:07.420]   They're battery operated.
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:12.900]   You can mount them on a standard tripod head if you really want to, but the cool thing
[02:12:12.900 --> 02:12:20.820]   is you turn them on and then you can, they're at zero when you start them off.
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:27.660]   And then you can just start turning them up and they get very, and what's even better
[02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:29.580]   is they are red, green, blue lights.
[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:38.300]   So you can hold them down and go into, where's the hue?
[02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:43.180]   And then you can start changing the hue on the lights.
[02:12:43.180 --> 02:12:44.180]   It's orange.
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:45.340]   It's green.
[02:12:45.340 --> 02:12:48.460]   And they're also magnetic so that if you have something metal nearby, you can just slap
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:50.860]   them on whatever the surface is.
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:51.860]   That's brilliant.
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:53.940]   And I bought the case.
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:59.900]   So you can get a case of 12 of them, the case charges them inductively and has accessories
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:00.900]   for you to charge.
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:06.180]   They have the mini USB if you want to charge them that way.
[02:13:06.180 --> 02:13:08.940]   I think it's USB C now on these.
[02:13:08.940 --> 02:13:12.780]   And all a bunch of different accessories, a diffuser light, but they are great if you're
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:18.060]   doing any sort of, especially if it's dark, but if you're doing any sort of product photography
[02:13:18.060 --> 02:13:20.900]   or you just need a light source, like you want to just put this off to the side.
[02:13:20.900 --> 02:13:21.900]   M.
[02:13:21.900 --> 02:13:22.900]   You want 12 of them?
[02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:23.900]   I need 12 for.
[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:24.900]   L.I.
[02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:25.900]   Have plans.
[02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:31.140]   I have plans and machinations, but just the case was so brilliant because you can also
[02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:34.020]   buy them in a four case, by the way.
[02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:35.020]   You don't have to buy 12.
[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:38.380]   Yeah, I mean, and I'm sure Alex bought them in 108 case.
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:39.620]   You know, if they sell one of those.
[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:40.620]   They're out of stock.
[02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:41.620]   I'm sorry to say.
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:43.580]   Oh, I wish they were out of stock.
[02:13:43.580 --> 02:13:45.060]   Oh my gosh.
[02:13:45.060 --> 02:13:48.020]   1499 for 12, 499 for four.
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:52.340]   You can get 90 bucks for a single one.
[02:13:52.340 --> 02:13:56.260]   But you got to get the case because it charges in the case.
[02:13:56.260 --> 02:13:57.260]   So that's brilliant.
[02:13:57.260 --> 02:13:58.660]   Well, you can charge them differently.
[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:02.100]   You can charge them by themselves too with a little cable, but almost every, I got them
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:04.980]   because almost every photographer, I knew had them in their gear bag because there's
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:09.380]   always some situation where you just, you don't have the light or you need an accent
[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:10.460]   and you can pull this out.
[02:14:10.460 --> 02:14:14.460]   You can put them on anything and they give you just that little, that little bit of extra
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:18.260]   light that you need in almost any situation.
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:20.100]   I've been super, super happy with them.
[02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:23.500]   They just made, I usually at night I would get horrible, not horrible, but I get really
[02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:24.500]   noisy photographs.
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:27.860]   Now I just put a few of them up and it looks great.
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:29.900]   I love the maggots.
[02:14:29.900 --> 02:14:32.980]   I can't recommend this sort of the these sort of pocket lights.
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:33.980]   Strongly enough.
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:37.980]   It is part of my standard travel gear, partly because even when you're just taking like
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:43.100]   goofy selfies of yourself someplace, you know, the difference between like how come
[02:14:43.100 --> 02:14:47.660]   like instead of the phone going for the low light mode where it looks like garbage or
[02:14:47.660 --> 02:14:50.900]   instead of having to deal with the fact that you've got shadows on your face because you
[02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:55.500]   actually want to get a picture of yourself at that museum exhibit with Guillermo del Toro
[02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:59.780]   del Toro's horror collection, but you want a good picture for yourself and just having
[02:14:59.780 --> 02:15:03.660]   this like in your hand while you're taking the selfie work so great.
[02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:08.100]   But also when I'm traveling, there's so many times where like I might be at a friend's
[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:11.260]   house and he doesn't have a desk lamp or he doesn't have a task lamp or he needed to
[02:15:11.260 --> 02:15:12.820]   go, but okay, that's okay.
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:15.500]   I happen to have a task lamp with me.
[02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:20.700]   And also when I'm using it as a flashlight, I feel like I feel like I feel like one of
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:25.740]   the officers in Star Trek, the next generations was really cool like bomb type flashlights
[02:15:25.740 --> 02:15:27.460]   used to use.
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:30.060]   It is one of those things where if you buy a good one, you can buy cheap ones for like
[02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:34.820]   20, 30 bucks, but buy a good one with a metal housing and you will have it in your pocket,
[02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:37.940]   you will have it in your laptop bag and there will be and maybe you'll forget about it,
[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:43.140]   but then there will be a time where the lights go out on on your commuter train and so or
[02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:46.700]   the it's working fine, but like the light that you're at is not working.
[02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:47.700]   So okay, let's find.
[02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:50.820]   I'll take this out and this will be my task lamp for this thing.
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:55.460]   It so makes you feel like a grown adult who's in charge of every situation when you have
[02:15:55.460 --> 02:15:57.340]   this handy.
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:15:58.340]   Very nice.
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:15:59.820]   Another another does this.
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:00.820]   Oh, really?
[02:16:00.820 --> 02:16:04.300]   Does this do like the really cool video effects that lighting effects that aperture sometimes
[02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:06.580]   has on their other like it has the effects mode as well.
[02:16:06.580 --> 02:16:07.580]   Yeah.
[02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:08.580]   Yeah.
[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:11.780]   So you can make like a police light is often the distance or flashing lights or like
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:12.780]   that.
[02:16:12.780 --> 02:16:13.780]   Yeah.
[02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:19.540]   So the only thing I don't like is the way they spell aperture, which is aperture APU
[02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:20.540]   TU.
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:21.740]   I'm sure it's for trademark reasons.
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:22.740]   Yeah.
[02:16:22.740 --> 02:16:25.700]   And the great thing about them too is like they've been making really premium lights
[02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:31.460]   like like they made it a 100 120 D I'm using the 300 D right now, then they made like a
[02:16:31.460 --> 02:16:35.700]   600 D which I think I think melted actually melted a few people.
[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:39.700]   But now they've introduced a line of much less expensive ones that don't have the same
[02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:43.220]   kind of metal housing that aren't meant to be transportable, but they're starting to
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:48.380]   fill it in with a much more affordable line of lights and they're really good quality.
[02:16:48.380 --> 02:16:50.500]   I'm going to mention a couple of things.
[02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:54.340]   One is just, you know, self serving because we I'm using the laptop here.
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:59.100]   I want to have something in the studio that I could just plug into pluggable just announced
[02:16:59.100 --> 02:17:04.060]   their new seven and one USB C adapter has ethernet.
[02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:12.860]   It has HDMI, it has two USB three ports, one 4K HDMI, one gigabit ethernet port, one SD
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:19.420]   card reader, one micro SD card reader, and a USB C power delivery charging port.
[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:20.700]   And I'm just going to leave it here.
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:24.100]   And the best thing is, and actually it's a little more expensive when I bought it because
[02:17:24.100 --> 02:17:26.900]   there was a $4 coupon, but it's 35 bucks.
[02:17:26.900 --> 02:17:29.260]   So a nice little dongle.
[02:17:29.260 --> 02:17:33.100]   If you've got one of the new Mac books, you're going to need a dongle.
[02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:35.380]   This looks like I did and I've used pluggable stuff before.
[02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:36.860]   So this looks pretty good.
[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:40.020]   And then this one's from, pardon me?
[02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:41.020]   That's got my name on it.
[02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:43.620]   So I got to get those and ones without enough jacks.
[02:17:43.620 --> 02:17:44.620]   Exactly.
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:46.620]   Yeah, one one one plug does it all.
[02:17:46.620 --> 02:17:47.620]   Yeah.
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:52.260]   And then this is from the chat room and they mentioned that I can't wait to watch it.
[02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:58.340]   NHK, which is the, of course, the Japanese broad public broadcaster has a new documentary
[02:17:58.340 --> 02:18:04.260]   which came out on January 2nd in honor of the 11th anniversary of Steve Jobs passing.
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:08.460]   The secret passion of Steve Jobs, it's free.
[02:18:08.460 --> 02:18:12.340]   You can stream it on the internet and it looks really good.
[02:18:12.340 --> 02:18:14.220]   Somebody in the chat room recommended it.
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:16.020]   So they just loved it.
[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:22.860]   So it's something you can watch on your computer from NHK World, the secret passion of Steve
[02:18:22.860 --> 02:18:23.860]   Jobs.
[02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:27.820]   And by the way, it begins with the iPhone announcement.
[02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:30.620]   So it's timely too.
[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:32.700]   Couple of great recommendations for you.
[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:35.980]   Just I don't, the URL is long.
[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:41.380]   I think if you search for NHK and secret passion of Steve Jobs, you should be able to find it.
[02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:44.580]   David Pogue, thank you so much for being here.
[02:18:44.580 --> 02:18:46.420]   Plug your books again.
[02:18:46.420 --> 02:18:49.260]   Does Wilbur have anything to plug?
[02:18:49.260 --> 02:18:51.020]   Wilbur gets a cut of every sale.
[02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:52.020]   Good.
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:53.020]   Good.
[02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:54.020]   Good.
[02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:55.020]   Yes.
[02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:56.020]   Three new books.
[02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:58.500]   The perfect book for people getting their first Mac.
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:02.540]   iPhone unlocked covers all the iPhone 12s and iOS 14.
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:07.100]   Full-color, e-book available now and the printed version in two weeks.
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:11.100]   And how to prepare for climate change comes out on January 26th.
[02:19:11.100 --> 02:19:14.900]   It's where to live, how to invest, how to ensure, how to talk to your kids, stuff like
[02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:15.900]   that.
[02:19:15.900 --> 02:19:21.260]   So January 26th, when I come in here and do the show, if I'm depressed, it's not because
[02:19:21.260 --> 02:19:23.060]   of the Apple earnings call.
[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:24.820]   It's because I've been reading this book.
[02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:28.580]   On the other hand, if I'm happy, again, it's not because of the Apple's earnings call,
[02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:31.900]   but because I've been reading David Pogue's book.
[02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:32.900]   You are awesome.
[02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:35.340]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:19:35.340 --> 02:19:39.580]   Somebody said you give up your iPhone passcode and iPhone unlocked.
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:41.260]   Maybe that's a play on the name.
[02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:44.140]   No, I docked with them all in a photo.
[02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:45.140]   Smart man.
[02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:48.500]   Andy and I go, when are you going to be on GBH next?
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:54.780]   Back to Fridays, Friday at 1230, just go to www.bhnews.org and you can stream it long.
[02:19:54.780 --> 02:19:55.780]   Live or later?
[02:19:55.780 --> 02:19:56.780]   Nice.
[02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:01.500]   And notco.com, I H N A T K O dot com.
[02:20:01.500 --> 02:20:08.940]   And Renee Ritchie has, of course, his eponymous show at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie, but also
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:12.180]   a new one with our good friend, Georgia Dow.
[02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:14.860]   It's called Apple Talk, also on YouTube.
[02:20:14.860 --> 02:20:15.860]   Anything else new?
[02:20:15.860 --> 02:20:17.740]   Anything else you want to plug?
[02:20:17.740 --> 02:20:22.220]   No, I'm just, it's, I feel like it's a quiet before the storm.
[02:20:22.220 --> 02:20:26.500]   They were releasing products, including the AirPods Max, up until December.
[02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:29.620]   And there is no telling when they're going to start again because you don't have to
[02:20:29.620 --> 02:20:31.300]   have physical events anymore.
[02:20:31.300 --> 02:20:34.580]   So it could be like those press releases start dropping anytime.
[02:20:34.580 --> 02:20:39.580]   So I'm just, I'm trying to, I'm trying to keep things going during the lull, but also
[02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:43.540]   set myself up for continued success in 2021.
[02:20:43.540 --> 02:20:45.380]   Well, we'll watch with great interest.
[02:20:45.380 --> 02:20:46.380]   CBS morning tomorrow.
[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:48.140]   I did do, and see what's happening.
[02:20:48.140 --> 02:20:53.500]   I did do a collaboration today with Devin Stone, Legal Eagle, about what all these words that
[02:20:53.500 --> 02:20:57.420]   people are throwing around in regards to Apple, Google, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, what they
[02:20:57.420 --> 02:21:02.380]   actually mean legally in the US because it's not, not always the same as a colloquial definition.
[02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:07.260]   Oh, is that the part versus Apple and Twitter piece?
[02:21:07.260 --> 02:21:08.260]   Yes.
[02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:09.260]   Real lawyer reacts.
[02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:10.260]   Yes.
[02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:12.260]   A real lawyer reacts.
[02:21:12.260 --> 02:21:16.180]   Well, he's really good.
[02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:20.860]   Like he started off doing a lot of video reactions to like movies and things like that.
[02:21:20.860 --> 02:21:25.140]   But this last month, he's just been explaining everything that's going on in terms of what
[02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:26.300]   the actual law says.
[02:21:26.300 --> 02:21:29.780]   And it's also fascinating to see how people read into that depending on their own point
[02:21:29.780 --> 02:21:30.780]   of view.
[02:21:30.780 --> 02:21:31.780]   Yeah.
[02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:32.780]   No, that'll be fascinating.
[02:21:32.780 --> 02:21:33.780]   Legal Eagle and Renee Ritchie.
[02:21:33.780 --> 02:21:36.700]   And it's on Renee's YouTube channel.
[02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:38.900]   Thank you all three of you out, all four of you.
[02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:41.580]   Thank you Wilbur as well.
[02:21:41.580 --> 02:21:42.580]   Great to have you.
[02:21:42.580 --> 02:21:43.580]   What a fun show.
[02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:47.980]   Well, next week, we'll talk about getting vaccinated at an Apple Store or something.
[02:21:47.980 --> 02:21:49.540]   I don't know what it'll be.
[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:50.540]   We'll find out tomorrow.
[02:21:50.540 --> 02:21:51.540]   Or the car.
[02:21:51.540 --> 02:21:53.180]   Or a car or a car could be a car.
[02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:54.180]   We don't know.
[02:21:54.180 --> 02:21:56.420]   But Reynolds, just a car.
[02:21:56.420 --> 02:22:02.260]   We do a Mac break weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[02:22:02.260 --> 02:22:08.020]   If you want to see us do the show, it's just really a behind the scenes feed of us making
[02:22:08.020 --> 02:22:09.380]   the show.
[02:22:09.380 --> 02:22:12.500]   We stream that audio and video at youtube.com.
[02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:14.820]   I'm sorry, at twit.tv/live.
[02:22:14.820 --> 02:22:19.180]   It's youtube, but there's also you stream and twitch and some other places you can watch
[02:22:19.180 --> 02:22:20.180]   or listen.
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:23.380]   But it's all at twit.tv/live.
[02:22:23.380 --> 02:22:28.060]   If you're doing that, join us in the chatroom, I R C dot twit.tv.
[02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:30.340]   That's our twit community chatroom.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:31.980]   Lots of nice people.
[02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:33.900]   And they're all watching live at the same time.
[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:37.260]   You can also join us in the twit forums.
[02:22:37.260 --> 02:22:42.460]   If you listen on demand, the twit community forums are at www.twit.community.
[02:22:42.460 --> 02:22:44.180]   They're great, very active.
[02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:49.420]   I want to kind of re-announce something I've been doing for some time, but we're kind of
[02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:50.420]   off Twitter.
[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:55.220]   And so I want to remind people that we also have a mastodon instance.
[02:22:55.220 --> 02:23:01.740]   If you're on mastodon at, you know, mastodon.social or canoe.social or somewhere else, you can follow
[02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:05.860]   us at Leo@twit.social.
[02:23:05.860 --> 02:23:10.900]   But if you're not yet on mastodon, go to twit.social and you can sign up and we love having you
[02:23:10.900 --> 02:23:12.100]   on that feed.
[02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:13.460]   It's a federated Twitter.
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:15.980]   So I like it a little bit better.
[02:23:15.980 --> 02:23:17.620]   That's kind of my new home.
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:22.180]   If you want to hear on demand versions of the show, many places you can go are websites
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:25.500]   the first place to start twit.tv/mbw.
[02:23:25.500 --> 02:23:27.980]   There's also a version on YouTube.
[02:23:27.980 --> 02:23:30.260]   There's a Mac Break Weekly channel on YouTube.
[02:23:30.260 --> 02:23:31.980]   You can see all the shows there.
[02:23:31.980 --> 02:23:32.980]   You could also subscribe.
[02:23:32.980 --> 02:23:36.300]   In fact, that's the easiest thing to do on your favorite podcast application.
[02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:38.020]   Just search for Mac Break weekly.
[02:23:38.020 --> 02:23:40.100]   We've been there for a long time.
[02:23:40.100 --> 02:23:41.100]   You can do me a little favor.
[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:44.140]   If you go to the website, we are doing our survey.
[02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:47.020]   We do this at the beginning of every year to get to know you a little bit better.
[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:51.180]   Gives us some ideas about how to shape our programming to fit your interest.
[02:23:51.180 --> 02:23:55.460]   But also it helps us with advertisers because we don't like to gather information on you.
[02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:58.780]   So this way you can volunteer it only if you want to.
[02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:01.940]   Twit.tv/survey21.
[02:24:01.940 --> 02:24:04.180]   Answer whatever questions you're comfortable with, Donnie.
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:05.820]   You don't have to answer them all.
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:10.420]   Twit.tv/survey21 shouldn't take you more than 5, 10 minutes to do.
[02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:11.620]   It really helps us a lot.
[02:24:11.620 --> 02:24:13.700]   So thank you in advance.
[02:24:13.700 --> 02:24:16.380]   That's it for this edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[02:24:16.380 --> 02:24:18.020]   We'll see you next Tuesday.
[02:24:18.020 --> 02:24:19.700]   Bye-bye.
