[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   It's time for Mac break weekly.
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.360]   We're gonna have a lot of fun.
[00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.000]   Alex Lindsey's back in studio along with Renee Richie.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   And of course Andy Enoco will talk about the iPad Pro now that we're a week in.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.800]   Some great reviews, some problems.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.240]   What about the screen quality?
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.800]   We'll also talk about the pencil.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.880]   We'll even attempt to break one off, right?
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.720]   No, we won't.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.880]   I promise we won't do that.
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.360]   And like Friday deals, they're surprisingly good this year.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.080]   It's all coming up next on Mac break.

[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.080]   The show where we cover the latest news from OpFru.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   Wouldn't be have their best OpFru cover is right here with us.
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   Mr. Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   Hello.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.080]   Thinking of retiring his canvas.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.080]   The painting is done.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   Yes.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.080]   So a good artist knows when to move on.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.080]   And usually that's when the canvas starts to sag and makes you look like you.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.080]   That's what I wait for.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.080]   That's the moment I wait for.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.080]   That's why that's when Picasso stopped working on Guernica because they thought, you know,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.080]   like, I got to restress this canvas or move on to some move on cartoon work.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.080]   Also here, cartoonist himself.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   Mr. Renee Richie from iMour.com.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   Good to see you.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.080]   So, cloud-blix-ly, I think.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.080]   Ah, yeah.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.080]   And Mr. Alex Lindsey in the studio today.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.080]   Good to see you, Alex.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.080]   Good to see you.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   Good to be here.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.080]   I think that was it.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.080]   It was good to have you.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.080]   Welcome back.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   I was just thinking this morning as I saw Ashley Esqueda using her iPad Pro and a pencil
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   to follow along with Bob Ross as he did some puffy little clouds.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   And then I saw, I think, serenity post a picture and Harry McCracken post a picture from drawing
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:23.080]   in the-- I'm realizing just as when the laser writer came out and you saw all these self-done
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:30.080]   publishing efforts with 25 fonts, I think we're going to enter the era of bad cartooning.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.080]   I feel like we're entering that now.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.080]   Everybody has to show their prowess.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.080]   I love your cloud.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.080]   A happy little tree.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   Yeah, nothing wrong with that.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.080]   I'm just really in blue.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   Actually, Ashley's was pretty good.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   And an interesting idea.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.080]   She at least made a video along as she's doing that so we could see her following along.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.080]   And the iPad Pro held up pretty well.
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.080]   In fact, it even looked like it was almost a canvas on that easel.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.080]   You know, I was-- I know you guys already talked about this, but I won't talk-- but what I
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.580]   was surprised at when I got the iPad Pro was that how much more responsive it was even
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.580]   without the pencil.
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.080]   It just feels like it's-- you know, the drawing is much faster.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   Yeah, I haven't got my pencil yet.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.080]   Have you ever got a pencil yet?
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.080]   We're in that weird position where we ordered one the first day, you know, first hour, and
[00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.080]   it's coming, but everybody else has already gone to the store to get there.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.080]   And I don't know if I want to.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.080]   Maybe I should get to because I might well lose it, right?
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.080]   A home pencil and a work pencil, Leo.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080]   Oh, what was I thinking?
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.080]   I'm looking for the car as well.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   I'm going to play a day pencil in a weekend and a week.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   It does feel as if-- it does feel as if carrying the iPad Pro-- I need an iPad Pro for home
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.080]   and work if I'm going to do that.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   It seems like if-- here's Bob Ross with his lovely hair.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.080]   And here's Ashley with--
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.080]   She's a student.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   She's going to go on for the Afro.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.080]   Ashley would usually go on--
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   Wouldn't that be funny if she put an Afro on?
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   But, you know, it's not about the fact that, you know, how she paints or whether she's a good painter or not,
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.080]   but the fact that instead of, you know, she's got an easel instead of a canvas,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   she's actually got an iPad Pro.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.080]   And at that size, it's kind of-- it's big enough to really feel like you're doing a painting.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   So the size also is important to that experience.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.080]   It's bigger than your iPad.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.080]   It's one of the first times where you can actually turn the iPad and it turns the drawing with you,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.080]   like the canvas actually would instead of the drawing kind of staying stable.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   Oh, it doesn't rotate?
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.080]   No, it rotates the way like you would imagine it would.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   And with Procreate specifically, you could put two fingers on and turn the canvas within the canvas
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.080]   at the same time.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.080]   So it really does feel like you're-- it's on the desk.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   It feels like you're drawing on a paper or an easel or something.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.080]   It's really cool.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.080]   And then the pen guy says it's a good pen, too.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.080]   And that's kind of intriguing.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.080]   Ashley's painting, I'm afraid.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.080]   Not quite as good as possible.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.080]   There are a lot of people who are big fans of like Samsung phones and tablets
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.080]   because it comes with a stylus on the 8-mill.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.080]   I'm one of them.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.080]   They like taking handwritten notes and they can capture all that sort of stuff.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.080]   I can't wait for a really good handwritten notes app that specifically takes advantage of the iPad Pro
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.080]   and the pencil.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.080]   With OCR, I think that'd be fantastic.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   When I was post OCR, the best one would be the ones that Leleche's take notes wherever you want.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   You can see the notes as you drew them, but it's doing OCR behind the screen scene so that if you want to
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:27.080]   read it or not, you can see it.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.080]   I put them in the notes, Leleche, but I certainly did test against the Surface Book and the
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.080]   Wacom Santique just to see the difference in latency and other factors.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   And the iPad Pro came out really, really good.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:46.080]   Mike Hurley, who, of course, we all know, Relay FM, writing as a guest post at the pen addict,
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.080]   says, "Nobody's really talked about the pencil from the point of view of somebody who likes
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.080]   to write notes with a pen.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   He was wondering if the Apple pencil would give him the digital handwriting experience he had
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080]   wanted for so long."
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.080]   He said it did.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.080]   He noted a little latency, but he said, "It's fine.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.080]   I can live with it."
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:12.080]   He says, "The line doesn't follow 100 percent right there, but given what's going on."
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.080]   And he loves, as anybody would, the palm rejection.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   That's really important for this to work because you have to rest your hand on the screen.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.080]   What I was looking for from the Apple pencils, to be able to write naturally on the screen
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.080]   in the size I usually write, by the way, that's something else that's different.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.080]   On a note 5 or even a Surface Book, a 10-rate big, right?
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.080]   I would like to write the normal size.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   You can write tiny on this.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   He says, "I was able to write naturally on the screen and visually match what I would expect
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   to see."
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.080]   He has terrible handwriting.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   I'm glad he's doing this because I've forgotten how to write.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.080]   I've used the keyboard for so long that I won't have to fill out a check.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   It's almost painful now.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   So I'm glad people are still doing this.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.080]   I always fill out when I fill out the customs forms or whatever.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.080]   I'm like, "Really?
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.080]   Why are we doing this?"
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.080]   Like an animal.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.080]   Oh, my hand.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.080]   I'm so strong.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.080]   Oh, see, that was another great thing about the iPad Pro.
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.080]   I had to sign an NDA that came in the mail while I was out at lunch, but I had the iPad Pro
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   with me.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:20.080]   It was just such a TV commercial moment where I'm looking at this form that is 8.5 by 11,
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.080]   exactly, on the sheet of paper.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.080]   I'm filling it out with the PDF form fill out tools.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.080]   I'm signing it with the pencil and was so good that instinctively I did a screenshot,
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   then took a picture, then realized, "Oh, wait, I can't use this in the review because this
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.080]   is an NDA and I can't."
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   Nothing like publishing the NDA.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   Exactly.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.080]   There are people on the thick things in the app.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.080]   I don't remember the name.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.080]   You guys remember it.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:54.080]   That turns your iPad Pro basically into a Wacom tablet for your desktop.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   So that's another interesting use that I hadn't really thought of.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.080]   It's an expensive tablet, but you also get an Astropad.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:02.080]   That's what I said.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   You said, "Oh, am I mute?"
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.080]   No, no, no.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.080]   I was talking and I didn't hear it.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.080]   Perfect.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.080]   Rich Stevens, are Stevens who does the Diesel-Sweeties strip.
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.880]   Danielle Corsetta, who does another great cartoonist, had a recent podcast where they were talking
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.080]   about the differences between the two.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.080]   I cite this because that's my only knowledge of how much these tools cost.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.640]   He was talking about how the Cintiq gear would cost $2,000 or $3,000 just for the tablet itself.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.080]   On that basis, although the iPad Pro isn't one-to-one, the same experience for a lot
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.880]   of people, it'll be the same thing.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.440]   I actually lent my pencil to Phil Notto, who is one of my favorite comic book artists.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.880]   He's doing this wonderful Chewbacca series for Marvel.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.360]   And he got his take on it because he couldn't find a pencil.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:56.040]   And he also gave it high marks, not saying that it would replace a Cintiq tablet, but
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.680]   for preliminary stuff he would do before he would move on to real tools.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.480]   It's certainly suitable, and for a lot of artists it would be just as good, but again,
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.560]   not at his level, but at a lot of people.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.360]   So I don't think anybody's saying it's a replacement for a Cintiq, but it's impressing
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360]   a lot of people.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.200]   Does Astropad support the pressure sensitivity?
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.120]   In the beta she was using, I don't think it did, but I think that will be part of the
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.120]   release version.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.480]   Because it came out first on iPhone and I had regular iPad, which didn't support that.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.280]   So there'd be no reason to write that in.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.160]   It looks like they're going to do a version, an upgrade for iPad Pro.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.160]   So yeah, the ex-cool.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.120]   Yeah, another, I've got it.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.280]   It does say that iPad Pro support is in beta right now, but I was using it the other day
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.680]   for Photoshop stuff and it was working pretty good.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.600]   So Mike Hurley didn't use drawing programs to take his notes.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.680]   He used a couple of note-taking programs, old ones that have been around for a long
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.640]   time, notability and good notes.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.800]   What do you guys recommend?
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.360]   If I were going to do handwriting as opposed to drawing.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.840]   I do it in notes.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.840]   Yeah, the note-top is good for that too.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:05.840]   The note-top is good.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.560]   What I was surprised with the note-top was that it had a ruler.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.560]   Did they just add that?
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.840]   Yeah, that's for the Pro I think.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.840]   And I have to admit that I popped it open, I opened the rules, I was like, "Why did someone
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   not do this?"
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.680]   And then of course immediately, I was really excited about the ruler immediately, I wanted
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   a protractor.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.680]   The best thing is that if you're using this actually, you can use it.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.680]   I want to come.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.680]   I need a protractor.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.680]   I need to go back to drafting school.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.680]   What do they call those curvy things?
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.680]   Exactly.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   Immediately, like, "This isn't enough.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.600]   Why isn't something written in this?"
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.880]   If you're using the pencil, you just put two fingers down on the screen and it pops the
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.080]   ruler right under your fingers and it draws a straight line for you.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.600]   Then you take your fingers off and it's gone.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   It's amazing.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.560]   Prince David in our chatroom says, "He's not sure if the pencil is as accurate and sensitive
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   as a Cintiq."
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.800]   You've used this.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   You must have used a Cintiq.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.280]   I might, we have a bunch of them.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.560]   Yeah, I wish I could get a bermon Roy on this subject.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.280]   You're the guy who's been using a Cintiq for years since they came out.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.920]   I talked to a couple artists that work a little further south.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.000]   And they had all played with it.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.360]   I guess someone brought it in for them to look at.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.280]   I guess the response was, they thought it was as good.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   A lot of them use surfaces when they're wandering around.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.640]   No, they use Cintiqs at work, but then they use surfaces at home.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.040]   Well, surface has been around for a while.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.040]   They can do it.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.040]   They said the only thing that was really missing, they really wanted Photoshop.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   They wanted Photoshop.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.040]   They wanted Photoshop.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.040]   Photoshop?
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.040]   Sketch and...
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   Photoshop?
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040]   What do they call the little Photoshop for that?
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   Sketch and fix.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.040]   Sketch and fix.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.520]   They said, if Photoshop ran on the iPad Pro, they probably prefer it.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.680]   But what about the article from DisplayMate saying that the iPad Pro screen is not as
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.480]   good as other iPad screen?
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.880]   Apple's been upfront about that.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.200]   The problem is not the screen itself.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.400]   The problem is when you put that many pixels in a display, the technology, there's compromises
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400]   in the technology.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.720]   So there's just so many pixels there.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.440]   They can't do everything they can with full color gamut and range and everything that they
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.440]   can do with the smaller...
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   The smaller...
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.920]   If your photographer was thinking of using Lightroom or one of the Photoshop tools on
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   an iPad Pro...
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.680]   I don't know if I do color correction on it.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.680]   So it's not...
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   Okay, that's interesting.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   It's enough to do SRGB.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.160]   Like if SRGB is your target, I forget what it is.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   It's like 109 or something.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.760]   The other one is just a little bit better.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.440]   But for me, the reds and magentas aren't quite as saturated as the iPad Air.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.280]   I prefer that because I find on the full color gamut, it's a little bit blown out to my
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   eyes.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.080]   But that's really kind of a personal thing.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:28.400]   But because they're doing the photo alignment and because they're using the oxide...
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.840]   I forget the film layer oxide technology, it actually looks like a phenomenal panel.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.920]   So it's not quite as good in one area, but it's better in other areas.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.600]   And overall, it looks pretty good.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.720]   SRGB is 709.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.160]   And here's the graph from Display Mate.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.880]   The white outside shape is the full gamut.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   And you see it's not...
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.320]   I mean, there's the iPad Pro 2 and Mini 4.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.320]   They're not that off.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:55.080]   I mean, in fact, I would say that the Pro and the Air 2 are pretty almost identical.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.560]   It's the Mini that's a little bit...
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.560]   Yeah, I think the...
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.560]   I think the average person...
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.560]   I think the average person.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.560]   Absolutely a little bit better, but I can't tell.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.560]   Well, I mean, if the graph tells...
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.160]   I mean, this is in color gamut anyway.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.880]   So that it shows that it's not the full SRGB gamut by any means.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.680]   And yeah, maybe you'd prefer the shift into the green on the Mini 4.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.680]   I don't know.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.200]   Yeah, again, that kind of stuff.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.840]   It's so close to become subjective at that point.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.840]   I think so.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.640]   And I think this is one of the risks of looking at something like these Display Mate ratings.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.360]   They're using tools.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.040]   They're using hardware to do this.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.240]   And you may not see that.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.360]   My opinion after using it for the weekend is it's pretty darn good.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.360]   Yes.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.040]   The people looks fantastic on that screen.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   There are people who have to understand...
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.280]   The difference between RGB and CMYK in editing apps is the difference between being able
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.320]   to work on this device and not being able to work on a certain device.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.960]   And those are the people that are going to look at those kind of graphs really carefully.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.880]   Other people, probably not.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.160]   It's interesting data, but it's not necessarily relevant.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.160]   It's color accuracy.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   It's not.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.960]   It's like counting the number of rat hairs per metric ton of...
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.960]   Yeah, there's a difference.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   Of the breakfast cereal.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.160]   I could definitely see people running entire art classes on these.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.600]   Just having like 10 of them and people come in and that's their art board.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.360]   It seems like there's much more error, by the way, just to point this out on the iPad
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.920]   ear too, it would be the least good of the three that we just talked about.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.920]   I would just consider them all a little...
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.440]   That depends how many units they tested to get an average for those things.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.840]   That's a good point too, right?
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.840]   It's not just...
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.640]   I mean, they're all probably slightly different.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   Each individual...
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.840]   Apple does do a lot of individual color collaboration, but again, when you're going across a line
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.680]   of products where they make millions of them, it's different.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.560]   And also, a lot of these reports conflate color space with color accuracy, like how accurate
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.280]   it is within that color space.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.560]   So it's hard for me to take these as absolute measures.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.240]   So I just...every time I put them all side by side and I look at them and I try to tell
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.440]   what the differences are, and I can see differences, but sometimes I like one or the other just
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   better.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.200]   Well, and the other thing is, is that we just have to remember to put this in perspective,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:59.040]   the environment that you're sitting in is going to change your impression of the color
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.040]   space.
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.800]   The color is far more than any of these little numbers.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.920]   I mean, whether we're here or we stand outside or we're in a cafe, all of that's going to
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.600]   change the color of it way more than any of these little details.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:16.120]   Conclusions for the 2015 iPads, all very good to excellent top tier displays.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.720]   You know what's funny?
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:21.760]   The best of the new bunch, the iPad Mini 4.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.640]   And I don't know, but I have the Mini 4, which is my actually preferred iPad.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   It's amazing.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.040]   I really do think that's a good looking screen.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.400]   I've always thought, "Gee, this confirms what my kind of general impression was.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:36.400]   This looks better than any of the iPads I've had to date."
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.800]   I've also found an Antech screen analysis, I think, to be better than Displaining.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   Really?
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.280]   So I'm going to look at the little word in Antechs readout of this stuff.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.320]   I mean, Displaining kind of invented this whole category, right?
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.560]   Yeah, but I mean, I don't know what they're doing with all this stuff, and I know an Antech
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.560]   is just reviewing it.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   Right.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.560]   That's all they care about.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.560]   Right.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:17:00.480]   It does, Displaining does give the iPad 4 first place best in every single test category,
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:06.720]   some contrast ratio, where it is very good, but not best.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.640]   The iPad Air 2 has a very good display overall.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.480]   And then they say the iPad Pro is a large tablet, double the screen area of the iPad
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.840]   2, triple the area of the iPad Mini 4.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.840]   So you get benefit of the large screen, but as you guys all pointed out, you sacrifice
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.000]   a little bit to get that many pixels on a screen.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.800]   After 15 minutes of looking at any one of them, my brain can't tell.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.600]   I think that's really true.
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.920]   It's funny, they use a metric called the Just Noticable Color Difference, JNCT.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   That's the actual metric.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   All right.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.680]   Well, there, yeah, I thought I'd bring that up because I've seen, you know, I've seen
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.080]   the articles and people, you know, talking about it.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.880]   No, and Apple will say that the panel may be not on paper exactly the same as the other
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.200]   ones, but when you, when you use them, the other stuff all equals Adam.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.600]   I look forward to getting my pencil in two weeks.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.600]   So frustrating.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.120]   It definitely gets up for us sooner.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   I know I can.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.000]   I could probably walk in the store today and get it.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   That's what's frustrating.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   But they are coming in.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.200]   I'm hearing from a lot of people that they happened to stay, walked into a store.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   They're in the stores.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.520]   Even even they went to Best Buy and they got a bunch there.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.480]   If you really want one, keep your eye out and you'll be able to find them.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.840]   And I was told that they will almost certainly be in the stores on Friday for Black Friday.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   Oh, right.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.440]   So Friday, go to the store.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.760]   They were like, oh, they're like, we'll have them for Apple's.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:26.760]   Yeah, for Black Friday.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.760]   Let's talk about Black Friday deals in a little bit.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.840]   We're going to take a break because Apple, I think this is the first year that Apple's
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:38.280]   really offering some surprising price cuts and even more so from third party channels,
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.280]   which is kind of shocking.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.280]   Right.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.280]   Talk about that in a second.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.280]   I want to talk to you about my Drobo.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.280]   Oh, I love the Drobo.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.040]   I love the Drobo.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.600]   I think we were the first to do Drobo advertisements way back when I know we're, I know with Scott
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.960]   Borne, we were among the first to talk about Drobo in general.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:19:00.800]   Drobo is an amazing family of storage solutions, external storage arrays.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.040]   I have the Drobo mini.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:07.360]   This is one that photographers, anybody who videographers, people who want a small two
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.840]   pounds portable Drobo with four drive base.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.800]   So you can go up to eight terabytes in here.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.760]   And if you want ultimate speed, you could put an SSD in each of these ports and really
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.760]   burn things up.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.280]   And you know what they're doing now with the Drobo's?
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.920]   I really like this.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.720]   This little M SATA bay in here, I can open it up.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.160]   I know I shouldn't do with it on.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.680]   You can do a lot of stuff with the Drobo on, but I'm not sure I should open up that bay.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.000]   But the M SATA allows you to put a little SSD in there.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.320]   I've got 128 gig S SD and that accelerates small file reads, which is really great for
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.920]   people like me who use Lightroom, Apple's photos or aperture or iPhoto.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.760]   This really makes a huge difference.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.160]   Big file reads are going to get all the benefit of the Drobo array.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.720]   I'm not going to say it's a rate array because they do something a little bit better, a little
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.280]   bit different.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.320]   The Drobo is amazing.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.640]   This is the Drobo mini.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.640]   There's the Drobo 5D.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.800]   The 5N, if you want a NAS network attached storage, perfect for a media server or a file
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.800]   server.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.280]   Of course for a whole house or whole office backup solution, you just plug it into your
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.440]   switcher router and boom, it's online and ready to go.
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:25.360]   Apps let you back up data to two different cloud service providers or sync by a bit torrent
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   sync.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   That's sweet.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.360]   That's built in.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.080]   It also lets you work well with Plex.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.240]   So your Apple TV, you've got Plex in the Apple TV or your other devices.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.800]   This is a great Plex server for you.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.640]   That's the 5N.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   And the thing that's so cool about Drobo, you saw me take off the panel.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.640]   All of the Drobo's have those great magnetic panels with informative lights to tell you
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.360]   exactly what's going on.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.560]   I can see from the three green lights that I've got three drives in the bay and they're
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.720]   all green.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.800]   This I haven't started putting anything on there, but there's a, I think it's blue light
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.800]   that'll go across.
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   It'll show you capacity.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.560]   So you know exactly how much capacity you have.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.160]   And when you want to add another drive, this requires a minimum of two, but when you add
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.040]   another drive, you just pop it in.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.720]   You don't turn it off, power it down.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.200]   They'll let you know if one of the drives is starting to fail, you pop it out even while
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.200]   it's running.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.240]   Put in a new one, it'll rebuild and you're ready to go.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.640]   I love Drobo.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.640]   It's called Beyond Raid and it is awesome.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.000]   Another thing that they let you do and they've done from day one is mix and match drives.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Because you know what?
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.160]   It's nice to use some leftover old drives, but in the old days of standard raid, the
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.960]   smallest drive is the drive that all four of them, the size all four of them have to
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.960]   be.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:35.520]   This way you can mix and match and get every bit of those bits.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.600]   And what I love about it is that the, you know, so I've had Drobo, I don't know how
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   many Drobo's we have.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   So a lot of them.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.240]   You've got to be like the king of Drobo.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   We have lots of Drobo.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.240]   Eight drive ones.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   And 12 drive ones.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.800]   And I've got a bunch of five, you know, I have the five, I have the five and have you
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   seen this many yet?
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   Because it's got on it looks awesome.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.240]   I have thunderbolt on it as well as USB three.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   What's the read right on that?
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   Do you know?
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.560]   Well, depends what kind of drives you put in there, obviously, right?
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.360]   I'll do a little test.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.640]   But the, but the big thing is, is that as it's, it's kind of the holy grail of, you know,
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.600]   just kind of throw a new drive in and you just slowly update.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.280]   So okay, now that now that there's four gig four terabyte drives out there, you add one
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.280]   as you go down.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.000]   So you get your drive started with one terabyte.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Now you're just fooling.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Isn't that fun?
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.440]   You have like four one terabyte drives and then you get up to three terabyte.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.440]   You put that in.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.440]   Now you got more capacity and get another one.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.440]   Then you get a four.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   Keep on it.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:29.040]   You're not mind five four terabytes at once when you didn't need them.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.640]   The network drives of course have gigabit ethernet on them as well.

[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.400]   Welcome to it podcast listeners.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.000]   They say on that page, that's nice.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.720]   And these new ones have gotten screaming fast.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:10.560]   I really like the MSATA having that cash drive in there.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.400]   That is a brilliant idea.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.720]   It really makes a difference.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.440]   I'll fire up the black magic.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.320]   Do you still use that as a disk speed test?
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.320]   That's the best one.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.760]   So let me-- and this is on Thunderbolt.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.160]   And these are still spinning drives?
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.840]   Yeah, these are cheap drives.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.400]   I put in cheap laptop drives.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.720]   First I got to tell it which drive to use.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.440]   Should we use the big files or the little files?
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.840]   What do you like to use?
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   I do get to use really enough.
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.520]   Five five is just takes longer.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.600]   OK, so it's mounting it.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.040]   Hold on.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.400]   See, the drobo up.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   Hello, Drobo.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.720]   Hello, Drobo.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.480]   So what size?
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.000]   Two is fine.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:48.480]   Two.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   Because you enough.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.560]   I love this test.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.880]   Do you still use that for--
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.240]   Oh, that's great.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.760]   Is it?
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.920]   I mean, these are cheap drives.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.520]   These are not--
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.040]   I know.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:57.840]   That's the same for--
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.880]   --like Western digital reds or something.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.160]   No, those are great numbers for a little--
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.760]   --71 megabytes per second.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.840]   Right?
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.880]   About the same for Ries.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.720]   There's almost exactly--
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.400]   and you know what I like about this black magic?
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.200]   Because you can see the check boxes, what you could do.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   Right.
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.480]   Would you want to edit 4K video on this drop?
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.320]   That kind of thing.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:17.760]   One.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.920]   I just want to say that--
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.280]   Is that decent?
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.280]   I'm old enough to say that there's a lot of work on RN.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.360]   Remember when we first did the first Mac--
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:25.840]   First Mac?
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.680]   Yeah, you couldn't edit 1080p video.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.240]   No, we had no way--
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.160]   Yeah, that was that.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.640]   But capturing from those cameras,
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   we had those two huge x-rays that were just a little bit
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.200]   faster than this little box.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.960]   Now, this is-- I think this is the 2012 MacBook.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.560]   I'm using a really old--
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.720]   Yeah, mid-2012 MacBook.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.680]   But I don't know if you remember.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.240]   I got one of those other world computing mercury SSDs here.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.000]   I'm just curious what I'm getting on the--
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   yes, see the Merc?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.720]   SSD is nice, isn't it?
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.520]   But it's not as fast as the new ones, because it's on the--
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.560]   It's not on PCIe.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.080]   Right.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.080]   Right.
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.800]   It's on just the new ones.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.360]   The new ones will go.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:24:59.880]   Yeah, they'll do.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.160]   The new ones are incredible.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.000]   A lot.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.600]   But that's pretty good.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.280]   I mean, my external drive is getting--
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.880]   he's getting right speeds very comparable
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.640]   to the right speeds on the--
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.520]   But if you put SSDs in there, I bet you'd be a lot.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.960]   Oh my god, if I put SSDs in there, stand back.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.720]   Shut the front door.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:18.600]   [SINGING]
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.200]   Apple is-- I love stories like this.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.840]   Apple is taking 94% of the profits
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:26.760]   in the entire smartphone industry.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.760]   Because we know.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.800]   We've seen everybody's numbers.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.080]   We've seen what their costs were.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.760]   We've seen what their profit margins are.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.840]   Is that true?
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   No, we don't know.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.440]   OK.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.200]   This is IDC.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.760]   But IDC has--
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.720]   Clickbait.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.680]   Is it Clickbait?
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.160]   They were responsible-- see, this is the thing that I like.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.640]   I mean, even if these numbers are within 50%,
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.280]   it's impressive.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.000]   Responsible for 13 and 1/2% of the smartphones shipped globally
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.960]   in Q3 2015.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.040]   13 and 1/2%-- small fraction.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.680]   But they got 94% of the profit.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.640]   I kind of believe that Samsung's struggling, right?
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.140]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.500]   I think Apple is only one who releases numbers still
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.220]   for those figures.
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.300]   Yeah.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.500]   So it's kind of hard to figure out.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.060]   But the reality is, is that you are looking
[00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.100]   at these massive numbers in India and China
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.260]   where they're selling for no profit or they're trying to make--
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.340]   But that's the same $60, $50 phone.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.340]   And there are a lot of them are also calculating losses
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.660]   because they're trying to penetrate the market.
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.380]   Apple's on Fuego in 2010.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.140]   In fairness.
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.140]   And we have a title.
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.660]   No.
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:39.700]   This is Apple value share in 2010 was 44%.
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.900]   Four years later, they were up to 93%.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.220]   Now they're 91%--
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.060]   I'm sorry, 94%.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.740]   So it's really jumped.
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.780]   Meanwhile, Microsoft down to negative 1%.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:52.580]   Microsoft--
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.380]   Well, I always like--
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.220]   Samsung's 11.
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.780]   Do they still make phones?
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:56.260]   Yeah.
[00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:57.220]   They still make phones.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.500]   It's hard for companies like H--
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.180]   There's companies that I really like that just aren't
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.180]   profitable and it concerns me because I want them to stay
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.260]   thriving and in business.
[00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.460]   You know what I just did?
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.780]   Just for you, I bought a BlackBerry Priv.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.900]   Just for you.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.700]   Off the country.
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.500]   Yeah, I would say it was a victory for Canada.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.020]   But I don't know if any of that phone is actually
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.020]   made in Canada anymore.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:13.380]   Probably not.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:16.500]   Assembled in Mexico, it's running an American operating system.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.060]   I mean--
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:17.860]   Sad, isn't it?
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.060]   Is it running QNX?
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:19.420]   No.
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.780]   No, it's running Android now.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:21.380]   Oh, that's right.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.340]   It's Android.
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:23.180]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.060]   That's why I bought it.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.820]   I remember now.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.700]   I didn't really want BlackBerry OS.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:32.300]   We appreciate your support, Leo.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.580]   Micro-- I did it for you.
[00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:36.580]   I was thinking about you when I pressed by and I bought it
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:37.580]   directly to BlackBerry.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.060]   It's a slider.
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:41.500]   In the tradition of the Palm Priv and the BlackBerry torch.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:46.780]   I've heard some people say that it is a little flimsy.
[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:47.220]   Didn't you?
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:51.020]   Yeah, Jason Howell is our technical director and producer.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.940]   He also hosts all about Android.
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:54.740]   You guys had several on him last week.
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:58.460]   We had a couple on to Florence Ion.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.140]   And then we had another one in studio.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.540]   Joshua Vergara had one?
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:02.820]   Yeah, he had one as well.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.260]   I don't know.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.460]   I just felt like the slide out mechanism for the keyboard,
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.620]   just kind of--
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.780]   they built the phone to be thin.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.220]   And then when you slide it out, half the phone's going--
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:12.500]   It's in there.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.580]   --expending out.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.860]   And it just felt like it could be delicate.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.620]   But that was in my very brief time with it
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.620]   that could prove not to be an issue.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.740]   Well, but you also had a shootout
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.060]   where you saw who could type faster.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.060]   We did.
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.460]   And SwiftKey easily peaked.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.460]   Yeah, in two different instances.
[00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:30.340]   It's the flow.
[00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.540]   Well, I was doing the touchscreen keyboard tapping.
[00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.820]   Ron was doing the swiping.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:37.740]   He was impressive.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.340]   And then there were two BlackBerry pribs.
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:41.820]   And neither of the pribs won in the game.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.260]   Not even close.
[00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.060]   It seems like we do a lot of work
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.180]   with a variety of different governments.
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:47.860]   And it just seems like all BlackBerry really
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.500]   has to do to keep the business that they have right now
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:53.100]   is just not look so far behind that they're completely
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.540]   embarrassed.
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:55.980]   Because a lot of them are all these government folks
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.260]   are all still on BlackBerry.
[00:28:57.260 --> 00:29:00.100]   They have another phone, oftentimes an Android or an iPhone.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.300]   But all their government communications is all still--
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.100]   Well, that's the pitch for the Priv.
[00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:04.460]   Get it?
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.900]   Priv-fussy?
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.260]   That's the pitch privilege.
[00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.260]   Priv-lage?
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.060]   That's the pitch that--
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.700]   The pitch is that we're taking Android, the operating system
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.740]   you want with a huge app ecosystem,
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.900]   and putting BlackBerry security on top of it.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.700]   So all the BBM stuff and all the secure server stuff
[00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.180]   is still there.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.580]   It's interesting because Microsoft, you know,
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:24.300]   had announced two bridges.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.500]   They call them bridges, trying to save their phone.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.860]   One was to iOS apps and one was to Android apps,
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.060]   still waiting to hear what's happening with the iOS apps.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.180]   The idea was an iOS app developer, I don't know, Flappy Bird
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:40.500]   could easily port his iOS app to Windows Phone
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.460]   to make it look native.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.820]   I think they just cut that off.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.980]   The bridges of Microsoft County.
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.020]   The bridges of Microsoft County.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.540]   And they killed the-- they just recently said, oh, you know,
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.700]   it turns out the Android one was really hard.
[00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.180]   And I haven't heard a thing about the iOS one.
[00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:56.380]   So I don't know what's happening there.
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:00.700]   But if they could just get one of the two working,
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:02.300]   it wouldn't make any difference at all.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.820]   It might.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.020]   Then that new 950 and the 950 XL, they have great cameras.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:10.340]   I think the operating system's fine.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.780]   The problem is it doesn't run by banking apps
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:13.500]   because the banks--
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.700]   Well, you still got to convince the developers
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.940]   to do even that little amount of--
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.620]   Well, apparently that's the issue.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.260]   Yeah, it's just the tiny market.
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.980]   Why should I 1.4% of the market?
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.900]   It is easier for you to buy an iPhone than meet up
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.420]   with this app on Windows.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.180]   It's probably like that.
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:28.820]   Are we sad about RDO?
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.780]   RDO, Chapter 11, belly up, losing $2 million a month.
[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.020]   It's a hard business, Leo.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.100]   I usually had a business that I could afford to lose $2 million
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.940]   a month to stay--
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.700]   I can't-- I can't lose money anymore.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.620]   You can't lose a quarter.
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.180]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:42.700]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.100]   If I lost $2 million a month, you're right.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.940]   I'd be-- we'd be gone.
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:46.740]   I'd have-- I'd have--
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.140]   I'd have burnt the building down and moved to Mexico by now.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:51.500]   With the Black History--
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.220]   Imagine the interview where you put it as like new CEO or CFO
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.380]   saying, I promise that we'll only lose $1 million
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:58.380]   about $1 million a month.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.260]   I've got a plan.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.540]   What went wrong with RDO?
[00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:05.500]   Because they were the first in the US to offer streaming.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:06.940]   Spotify came a year later.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.180]   Wasn't it the free tier?
[00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.220]   I think Casey Newton on the verge
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.420]   did a good dissection of this.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.540]   And it was-- they were far further behind on the free tier,
[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.420]   maybe.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:14.780]   And that let Spotify get more--
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.500]   They were the first to do an iPad app,
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.620]   and they had a beautiful one.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.660]   I felt like it was very Mac and iOS friendly,
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.140]   and the social experience felt very--
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:29.300]   kind of very much like a Mac, an Apple-y kind of thing.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.060]   And one of the guys said they spent a lot of time
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.940]   trying to get the custom-cuing right.
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.860]   Maybe that wasn't as compelling a feature as they thought
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:35.620]   it was going to be.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.420]   It was all the stuff.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.380]   They only had 7 million songs in the library,
[00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.460]   and everybody else has closer to $30 million.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:40.940]   There's that.
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:42.460]   That could be it, I don't know.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.140]   And then they made a deal with the radio stations
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.300]   to get advertising, I think, was out with--
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.220]   I feel like they're really in the same--
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.740]   Spotify's in the same boat.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.820]   Because-- and Pandora bought some of their intellectual--
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.940]   they didn't buy the company, but they
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.100]   bought some of Artio's intellectual property
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.740]   and hired some of their engineers.
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.540]   And they say they're going to do a streaming service.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.100]   But the companies like Apple--
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.380]   I mentioned this on Twitter--
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.820]   Apple, Google, Microsoft, maybe to a less degree Amazon,
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.020]   who don't need to make money on their music services.
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:12.980]   Yeah, it's basically--
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.460]   Their value adds.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.580]   They're going to stick around.
[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:18.260]   But the record companies are squeezing
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.500]   these streaming services.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.620]   Adele says, I'm not going to put out 25 on a streaming service.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.740]   You have to buy the album.
[00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.460]   And I think the record industry is just
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.500]   going to slowly increase the amount of royalties
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.940]   these guys have to pay till they're guaranteed to lose money.
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.140]   Because they foolishly don't-- well, maybe not foolishly.
[00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.500]   I don't know.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.220]   They don't want these streaming services to exist.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.980]   But I think Apple doesn't have to worry about that, right?
[00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.580]   No, Apple can do it.
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:43.740]   And the thing is, is that if you even
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.500]   look at Apple, their maps, which
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.380]   was considered a complete failure,
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.500]   is now still a large percentage of the way people do maps
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.220]   on their iPhone.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.340]   And it's just because it's more convenient.
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.260]   And so Apple Music will most likely continue to grow
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.740]   and continue to do whatever's in it.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.740]   Not by leaps and bounds, nothing profound.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.940]   But there's just a certain ease of use
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.700]   because it's all embedded into the system.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.620]   And while Apple might have a somewhat tense relationship
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.740]   with the music industry, the music industry
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.100]   can't really turn its back on Apple,
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   because it's the number one music store in the world.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:17.740]   Well, and again, I will constantly
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.580]   say the danger of the music industry is that Apple could,
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.060]   especially with the music industry.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.500]   It comes from the music industry.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.420]   If they wanted to go down that path,
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.180]   it's kind of one of those you want to not want to shake
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:28.860]   that tree too hard.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.620]   I mean, Apple right now, it's convenient for them
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:31.580]   to work with the music industry.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.900]   But they could do a lot of damage if they
[00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.060]   decide to become a publisher.
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.860]   So Lisa bought the Adele album.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:41.060]   And exactly what I thought was going to happen happened.
[00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.980]   I like streaming because you can preview something
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:43.860]   and hear all the songs.
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.180]   It's, if you want to buy the album.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.100]   And if you really like an artist,
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.740]   I think you should buy the album.
[00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:50.020]   Support him.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:51.020]   But I couldn't hear the album.
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.580]   I heard hello.
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.980]   It was the only thing she released.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.500]   Nice song.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.380]   She's a good singer.
[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:55.940]   Rest the album.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.300]   Not so great.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.340]   But how many times does that happen in our lives?
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.220]   Whereas there's a great single--
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:03.180]   Well, are we all albums Leo?
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.020]   We got to buy the whole CDO?
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.580]   Yes.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.580]   And Apple fixed that.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:06.420]   And Apple fixed that.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:06.940]   It was a good one.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:07.420]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.260]   And we used to call it--
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.900]   in Sony, we used to call it cocaine marketing,
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.100]   because it would be three hits.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:12.340]   You needed three hits out of the album.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:12.860]   And the rest?
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.340]   And the rest?
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:13.660]   And the rest?
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:14.340]   And Miller.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.380]   And literally, they just look at--
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.580]   The rest is "Man-at-Tall."
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.140]   We identified.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.180]   Because we had decided it was three hits.
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.820]   Because what would happen is the record company
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.620]   would bring in a producer to get three songs
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.340]   that they know that they can sell the album with.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.900]   And then they let the band run with--
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.780]   a lot of times they let the band run with the rest of it.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.980]   So it would be all over the place,
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.020]   because the band would have its own opinion about how it should
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:33.220]   run.
[00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.060]   So my prediction is that ultimately Pandora Spotify,
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.540]   all of the standalone DZer title, music services,
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.180]   will eventually follow RDO down the path.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.980]   It's like Railroad.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.380]   It's like anything else.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.580]   You're using a whole bunch of everything,
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.660]   and then it slowly fades.
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:50.180]   You know who's in great position is Google,
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:53.980]   because when you buy Google Play music,
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.060]   same price as Apple.
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.500]   But you get all the YouTube videos ad-free.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.060]   Plus all the YouTube music-- I know my son.
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.540]   That's his music jukebox is YouTube.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.820]   I think younger generation really likes
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.820]   keeping the music videos pumping through the TV.
[00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.660]   By the way, I saw your post, and they've pulled it down
[00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.260]   since Adele on Saturday Night Live.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:16.180]   Somebody-- bad, bad man.
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:22.340]   Somebody in the sound department released Adele's Mike Solo.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.060]   And some people thought that it was the 5'1" mix,
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.500]   but it's too clean.
[00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:26.980]   You could hear the bass in the background.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.100]   You could hear a little bit.
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.260]   It was like coming through the mic.
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.020]   It was her channel alone, right?
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:34.620]   Yeah, it still had the-- so it was post effects.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.620]   So you could hear the--
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.420]   Hear the echo, was it?
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.700]   You hear the reverb on it.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.980]   But it does sound-- I mean, I don't think it was the 5'1".
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.500]   I think that it was actually-- because there
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.300]   would be other things in the center
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.020]   that would be other than her voice.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:48.380]   And it was her channel, which means somebody running
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.060]   the sound board.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.900]   God, the question is that-- well, yeah,
[00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.820]   the question is whether her--
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.580]   was so good.
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.100]   A lot of people do that, and it's embarrassing.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.220]   I don't know who did-- so it was somebody that had a moment.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:57.980]   Oh, God, yeah.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.020]   It was really cold.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.300]   It was such a terrible singer.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.580]   It was Mariah Carey.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.900]   But it was cold outside.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.780]   And she obviously was such an-- obviously
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.140]   was having issues with her.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.140]   It was impossible to think.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:09.860]   It was pre-effect.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.860]   It was very dry.
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:13.500]   And so-- and anyway, so-- but Adele, I mean, what--
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.180]   She could sing.
[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.100]   Only smokes.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.020]   I mean, it was-- so that's why my-- some of the speculation
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.860]   was, oh, Adele's people put this out.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.660]   And that's why I posted it.
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.060]   I was like, there's no way that-- I mean,
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.540]   they posted this to show off.
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:26.500]   But in our industry, those stems are-- like,
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.740]   a lot of times, the reason that it's probably an inside job
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.660]   was because usually those bands come in.
[00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.300]   We deal with a lot of the bands.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.500]   They have their own audio engineer who
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.460]   manages all the stems.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.500]   And they give us the stereo--
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   And they give us the stereo--
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.340]   Of course, it's the first one.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:40.100]   --or the first one is reason, right?
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.060]   Yeah, they don't want anyone else to touch their--
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:42.820]   Yeah, mix.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.340]   --specifically because of that.
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:48.140]   So I have a feeling that they decided to let that go.
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:48.540]   But it was--
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.700]   But NBC yanked the video.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.700]   You can't listen to it anymore.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.980]   I mean, that was-- because it's the video, too.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.540]   Yeah, but it was--
[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.260]   It's Saturday Night Live.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.220]   I mean, that was just showing off.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.100]   That was-- she--
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.220]   Yeah, but it's not showing off when it's--
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.220]   Well, you're basically reminding someone
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.220]   of how great you are.
[00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.540]   It's nice when a singer really can sing.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.300]   I just-- I think that's pretty special.
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.620]   That's one of those live--
[00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.900]   those live eight concerts ones.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.420]   And nobody sounded like they did on the album,
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:12.500]   except for Sarah McLachlan.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.460]   And she sounded dead perfect like the CD.
[00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.140]   And it was amazing.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.060]   I love hearing somebody going to really say it.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:20.160]   The best part of that quote documentary,
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.340]   unquote, that Beyonce had on HBO, the one that
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.100]   was produced by Beyonce.
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:24.620]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.420]   So it's everything in there is--
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.300]   When I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a singer.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:30.700]   But of course, like, you know it's no mistake
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:31.740]   that they decided just--
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.420]   oh, you happen to catch me just like singing
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:38.420]   "A cappella" in the back of my limo to a new demo track,
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:42.140]   which would seem like embarrassing and like self-aggrandizing
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:46.220]   after the fact you're like, oh, leave mother of God and Jesus
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.300]   get a voice.
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:49.140]   The only round whole life is you know this is going to--
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.780]   Is this a tell?
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.060]   Oh good, let's get our show pulled down.
[00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.700]   Where'd you find this?
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.940]   The magic of the internet.
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:57.220]   I don't know.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.300]   Somebody on Reddit ripped the audio basically.
[00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.860]   Oh, smart.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.740]   So you do hear the bass in there.
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:03.660]   Yeah, but you could--
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:04.100]   You could-- you could--
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.460]   You could high-pass filter that.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.900]   You'd have isolated vocal--
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:07.700]   But you could--
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.740]   You're saying it's not part of a fuller mix.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.620]   It's coming through a mic.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.220]   I think it's coming through a mic.
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:15.420]   That could be wrong, but--
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:18.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.500]   But it's--
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.780]   Oh, this is going to get remixed.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.620]   And I'm going to say it's death.
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:24.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.420]   This is going to get DJ-Mary mixed like crazy.
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.700]   Hello.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.140]   Yeah, I'm sure it's hard by this Saturday.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.140]   It'll be in every--
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.140]   Oh, yeah, really.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.140]   It's going to be tons of white labels out there.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.380]   Dancehall, they'll be cutting it in.
[00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:34.900]   Yep.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.820]   By the way, we're playing this for purposes of commentary.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.820]   It's fair use.
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.740]   It's news analysis.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.260]   News analysis.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:39.900]   We're talking over it.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.420]   So it's--
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:40.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.420]   But why not--
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.740]   She is really good singer.
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.340]   She could sing.
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.460]   Well, I love her.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.380]   I wish she'd stop singing such depressing songs
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.100]   about breaking up.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.740]   She should go to the gestured Bieber route.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.020]   His whole new album is--
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.780]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.620]   I apologize.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.060]   I'm a loser.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:56.580]   Oh.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.940]   Thank you for supporting Canada with Blackberry and Bieber.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:00.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.140]   That's a show title.
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.140]   I'm writing it down.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:07.860]   It's Blackberry and Bieber, baby.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:09.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.140]   A million views.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:13.820]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.140]   I think that's good SEO, isn't it?
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:19.140]   You've got to get free in there somewhere.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:19.660]   Yeah, they really--
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.220]   It's really hard to sing.
[00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.820]   Because she's not singing a cappella.
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.660]   She's here now.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.340]   I will say the PR that she's done for this album already
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.900]   is between the fact that they've had 500 million downloads
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.700]   or close to it.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:34.180]   For the song that-- did you see when she impersonated herself?
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.180]   I love that one.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.340]   Graham Norton's show.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:36.940]   Yeah, and then--
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:40.300]   I actually start crying when--
[00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:45.500]   So she puts on a fake nose, a fake chin, and a fat suit.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.740]   And change-- I didn't realize she had such a cockney accent.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:48.260]   I know.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.980]   And change is it to talk like this.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.300]   She says, I'm a nanny.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.380]   I talk softly to the children.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.460]   The baby about fire.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.660]   Do they make sense of the world?
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.140]   They make sense of the world.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.180]   I got to have the fight changed.
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.380]   I got the chin bum, the record.
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.700]   Yeah, she was like that.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.380]   I'm very harsh, but I'm a talk like Jennifer.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.660]   And then she was going to be Michael Kane.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:07.860]   And then she-- no, she sounds like Michael Kane.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:11.020]   And then she goes-- I don't know-- some sort of staged audition
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.740]   for Adele likes.
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.020]   Adele soundalikes.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.820]   And they're all the fake Adels are sitting there,
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.700]   and she's Jennifer the nanny.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.740]   And I'm getting a little sick.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.220]   I'm so nervous.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.140]   I'm so nervous.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.220]   And then, of course, they all sing.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.380]   And there they are.
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.180]   Then she gets up there.
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.780]   And there's nobody sounds like Adele.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.260]   And she starts singing, I'm actually start crying.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.980]   And the people are going, oh.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.180]   Because there's no way-- there's no way you could fake that.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.100]   It's pretty cool.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:37.620]   And then she had it.
[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.700]   She did an interview on XM.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.420]   I was driving.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.780]   I rarely listened to XM.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.940]   And I was just like, man, whoever her PR person is,
[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:43.260]   is like--
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.260]   Oh, no.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:45.220]   Every single or team.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.740]   You want to talk marketing onslaught.
[00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.260]   How long is it before Star Wars comes out?
[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.540]   You want to talk marketing onslaught?
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.500]   50 million in sales already.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.860]   My god.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.460]   When they're able to make it sound as though there's
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.140]   a special ceremonial event for everybody
[00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:06.380]   to show up at Target at 12 AM to buy new crappy toys.
[00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.500]   Oh, that's mine.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.220]   That's-- wait, wait.
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:09.660]   There's a new Star Wars coming out.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.580]   No.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:14.100]   You can turn your Google account to the dark side.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.220]   You can--
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.300]   Have you done-- from a time long, long ago?
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:19.500]   I'm seeing people--
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:20.780]   Denise Howell did it.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.500]   Take her Facebook image.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.940]   And she decides whether she's Rebel Alliance,
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.940]   or whether she's the-- who is the other guys?
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.340]   The Imperial Art Forces.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:33.460]   It's just-- this is-- and this is a month out.
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:35.620]   It's going to be crazy.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.260]   You've seen the Google thing where you do--
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.980]   Yeah, you have joined the dark side.
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:40.100]   Who side do you want to be on?
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.340]   If you search-- do a Google search for a long time ago
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.300]   in a galaxy far, far away.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.540]   Oh, this is a good one.
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.260]   Yeah, so let's go to google.com.
[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:46.740]   This is a new--
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.300]   This is the same Thanksgiving edition.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.340]   A new-- so you type--
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.380]   A long time ago in a galaxy far.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.980]   Fortunately, I don't have to type the whole thing.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.100]   And then look what happens.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:04.420]   You get Google News in the style of the opening text.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:05.420]   Can you click on it?
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:05.860]   Yeah, there's--
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.700]   It's still live?
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:08.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.820]   Wait a minute, turn on the sound, Jason.
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.340]   I'm going to--
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.300]   I'm going to turn this up.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.340]   By the way--
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.740]   This is also protected by fair use for commentary purposes.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.540]   I'll be surprised this episode stays up on YouTube.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.900]   They got John Williams.
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:29.860]   That's the funniest thing.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.100]   All that alphabet money.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.820]   And these are actual search results.
[00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:36.940]   Yeah, those are search results that are linked away.
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.860]   This is one of the reasons why I love Google.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.620]   They'll pay somebody to screw around like that.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:44.020]   Well, I--
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.260]   What was the last time you hit command option
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.700]   and clicked on an about button?
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.580]   An Apple app that had something off some half.
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.580]   I wouldn't be surprised, though, if Disney hadn't given them
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.780]   just a little bit of money.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.780]   Oh, I don't--
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.460]   You don't think that's a marketing thing?
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:56.980]   I'd be surprised.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.420]   Well, they had a license stuff.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:00.820]   So I don't know if it was--
[00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:02.060]   There was a phone call.
[00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:03.660]   Well, I mean, I think they definitely licensed--
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.820]   Larry said--
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.620]   Hey, yo.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:07.700]   Mr. Eisner.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:08.460]   I got an idea.
[00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.420]   I got a proposition.
[00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.260]   I got a deal for you.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.940]   Don't tell Lorraine, but I want to do this.
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:12.860]   Don't tell Lorraine this.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.980]   She's very, very tense.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.300]   But I would like to make our search results scroll.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.700]   It'll be 1977 all over again.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.660]   If you look at this, Disney paid and someone
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.660]   just posted in the form--
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:27.300]   Disney made $4 billion for Lucasfilm,
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.740]   which they will probably make back--
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.740]   Oh, wait.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.420]   --two years.
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:30.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.100]   Well, take a couple movies.
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.180]   I mean, I'm sure there's been some money to market this thing.
[00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.060]   It's everywhere.
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.260]   You know, we're going to get a movie every year now.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.140]   Every year?
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.100]   So you get a tent pole.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.300]   So who's making the next one?
[00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:41.660]   Is JJ going to make another one?
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.780]   There's another-- none the director.
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.980]   Is there one going on right now?
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.220]   I believe there's a--
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:47.460]   There's a sequel, and then there's an anthology, then a sequel,
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:47.860]   then a--
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.380]   Is this the Mark Hamill Full Employment Act?
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.380]   Is that what this is?
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.580]   Next year is-- next year is--
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:53.380]   is it Rebels?
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.580]   Well, it's not there.
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.020]   But it's not part of the--
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:56.780]   It's not part of the series.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:57.700]   I'm sick of it already.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.140]   And I mean, it's like--
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:43:59.820]   I can--
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.180]   I like it.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.380]   "The Riken Nielsen" is doing the next sequel.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:03.300]   There's certain movies that I could watch every single--
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:04.660]   Well, you're a fan, and not only that--
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:05.140]   You watched the one--
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:05.980]   You worked on it.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.300]   OK?
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.580]   You worked on episode one.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:07.980]   Well, there's that.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.380]   So you get-- I mean, you're like an insider.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:15.380]   But I could do a great Jar Jar.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:16.380]   You've seen--
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.380]   It's actually quite incredible.
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:17.380]   I don't know.
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.380]   I think it's that great.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:22.380]   You've seen the people who are saying, actually, Jar Jar was,
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.100]   like, a Jedi master.
[00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:25.060]   Have you seen this?
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.140]   I've heard about that.
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.980]   There's this whole conspiracy theory,
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.540]   and they think he's going to be back because if you look back
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.700]   at it, Jar Jar had all these moves.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.380]   You know, he looked like he was the drunken--
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:37.660]   Right.
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:38.460]   Drunken master.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:38.820]   Right.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.420]   He looked at--
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.140]   He can.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:40.740]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.820]   He looked like he was--
[00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.780]   And instead, he was--
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.340]   He won that battle for him.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:48.500]   He did win the battle for them.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:48.900]   I never heard any of that.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:50.180]   Drunken master.
[00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:50.700]   So--
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.180]   But I could have walked out of it.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:52.660]   I was--
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.460]   Ryan, you'll stop.
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:54.860]   Ryan, something is--
[00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.620]   They weren't talking about that in the halls of Lucas
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:44:59.140]   when you were there.
[00:44:59.140 --> 00:44:59.620]   Ryan Johnson.
[00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.500]   It was not part of the conversation that I was in anyway.
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.140]   Who are you talking about, Brian?
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.900]   You know, Ryan Johnson-- I forget the name of the guy who's
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.180]   doing the movie after JJ.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:11.580]   So there is a gentleman who did the time travel movie
[00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.460]   with Bruce Willis recently.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.300]   He's doing the next one.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.740]   Ryan, something.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:17.620]   And then the third one is--
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.500]   I forget the name.
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.540]   But it's a different director for each of the sequels.
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.820]   The director of the fantastic--
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.660]   recent fantastic form movie was supposed
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.180]   to be directing one of--
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:26.540]   Oh, no.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:29.220]   They passed on him after the fantastic fourth thing
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.540]   and they got somebody else.
[00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.220]   No, it was--
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:32.540]   You don't know exactly what I'm saying.
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.660]   He was supposed to do that.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.700]   And then suspiciously, like, well before the fantastic form
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.660]   movie was released, he dropped out to pursue other interests.
[00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.220]   I shouldn't have better to bring this up.
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.020]   If you had a Star Wars--
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:48.940]   As far as I'm concerned, if you had a Star Wars,
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:53.220]   a Jason Bourne series and a Bond movie every year, I'd be--
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:55.220]   Yeah, you wouldn't have to go the movies ever.
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:57.900]   That's the only thing I'm worried about.
[00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.780]   Star Wars movies used to be like epic cultural events.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.660]   It is such a special thing to have a brand new Star Wars
[00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:05.340]   movie.
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.620]   I don't know if it's going to be a good thing or a bad thing
[00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.780]   if it turns out to be--
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:11.660]   I don't want it to be turned out like a Marvel cinematic
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.900]   universe movie where there is--
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.180]   this is just the movie they've released this year.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.620]   It could be really, really crappy
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.860]   because they know that the entire future of everything
[00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:20.820]   is not hinging on this.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.100]   They're going to collect X $100 million if they make sure
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:26.260]   that it plays well in China.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.860]   So I don't want one where there's a whole show in which--
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:34.940]   Oh, why haven't we heard the backstory of the chessboard
[00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.260]   in the Millennium Falcon?
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.460]   Who manufactured that?
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.420]   How was that?
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.540]   There's a documentary there somewhere.
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:44.940]   So you want to read the full story about Jar Jar
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.300]   being the full conspiracy theory.
[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:50.740]   It's from Sasha, Matuzak writing for fightland.vice.com.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:56.460]   Jar Jar being is actually a Sith Lord and drunken fistmaster.
[00:46:56.460 --> 00:47:02.580]   And Sasha-- actually it came from a thread that Lumpo Waru posted
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:07.700]   and it's spreading like wildfire through Star Wars fandom.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:12.900]   And they even have animated GIFs showing him doing drunken master.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.580]   So here's the drunken fistmaster.
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:17.140]   They're showing exactly the same moves.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:21.740]   It actually is pretty compelling when you watch the whole thing.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:25.260]   He's doing drunken fistmaster moves.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:27.660]   I think he's not a swamp thing.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.900]   He knows what he's doing.
[00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:32.660]   So after this movie, we get Rogue One,
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:34.460]   then we get the Ryan Johnson episode eight,
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.940]   and then we get the Han Solo movie, and then we get episode nine.
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.260]   Ryan Johnson's not the guy who directed Jurassic World.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.220]   He did Looper.
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.420]   Looper was good.
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:44.580]   The guy who did Jurassic World, I think, is doing the ninth movie.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.820]   Jurassic World was just horrific.
[00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:47.780]   I got all excited.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:48.300]   I got so much money.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:50.900]   Well, it's kind of like, OK, they already ate everybody once.
[00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.340]   I mean, everybody back.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:55.740]   I mean, it was like, you know, it's like--
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.660]   The entire premise, the entire premise.
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:59.500]   I mean, you're just kind of like--
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.500]   What were you guys thinking?
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.740]   It was just like a spoiler for the next Jurassic movie
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.620]   that was amazing.
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.620]   It said that what happens when the dinosaur technology becomes
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.580]   open source?
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.300]   Oh, I like that.
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.340]   It's brilliant.
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:12.100]   What was the name of the dinosaur in Jurassic World?
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:12.980]   I don't know.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:13.820]   It was--
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.100]   It had an obtaining--
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.740]   Yeah, it was a good name.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.380]   It was impossible.
[00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.820]   It was a serious rex, or--
[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.020]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:21.260]   Because the only reason I know it
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.980]   is because it was a jeopardy answer of all things.
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:25.980]   Ignominious rex?
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:27.340]   Yeah, it was something rex, yeah.
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.580]   I'm sure the chatter rolled out.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:31.900]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.700]   We're going to come back and actually talk more stuff.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.740]   Indominous rex.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:35.100]   Thank you.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:36.260]   Glen knew that.
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.500]   Of course you would know that, Glen.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.660]   Indominous rex.
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.060]   It's how many as rex.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:46.980]   Our show today brought to you by my sheets.
[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:50.940]   I love it when I put out fresh sheets on Tuesday.
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:51.500]   Did you know that?
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:52.180]   You really didn't know that.
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.780]   It's called TMI.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:56.380]   Tuesday's fresh sheet day at the La Porte household.
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:58.300]   And I put out those nice bowling branch.
[00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.700]   Oh, I love those bowling branch sheets.
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.980]   The most comfortable sheets on the planet.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:04.660]   You know, a lot of times you'll hear people talk about thread
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:05.300]   cat-fect.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:07.100]   When I talk about bowling branch, I tell people about it.
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.140]   They say, what's the thread count?
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:09.900]   No, that's just marketing.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.260]   HUHA.
[00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.860]   It ain't about thread count.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:16.100]   It's about the quality of the cotton.
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:21.060]   And bowling branch starts with the best cotton ever.
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.140]   Now, we've talked before about mattresses,
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.020]   and you know I have a good mattress.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.380]   But you don't sleep on a mattress, Barrett.
[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:29.460]   You got to have some nice sheets.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:30.340]   Next, it'll be jammies.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.900]   But right now, we're talking about the sheets.
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.460]   Bowling branch reinvented bedding with a sole purpose
[00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.220]   of making your nights more comfortable than ever.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.860]   Softest cotton you've ever.
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:44.100]   And by the way, organic fair trade cotton.
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.580]   And they donate a portion of every sale to charity.
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:47.940]   And it's super affordable.
[00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.780]   For a couple of hundred bucks, you could treat yourself
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:53.340]   to the same luxurious, incredibly comfortable bedding
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:50:00.020]   that US presidents and countless celebrities swear by.
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:01.860]   And we got a great deal for you.
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.780]   By the way, this is a good gift too.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.180]   Because they come in a beautiful box.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.460]   You know, these ribbons on it.
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.860]   That's the box.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.420]   And it's gorgeous.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:12.220]   It's gorgeous.
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:15.060]   So when you get your bedding for bowling branch,
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.020]   you're going to see this.

[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.220]   wedding gift, baby gift.

[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:02.700]   I shouldn't probably mention this.
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.060]   But when I-- OK, so Tuesday, new fresh tea, cheese day.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.900]   I take them out of the cupboard.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.260]   You know, they're--
[00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.460]   Oh, they're so soft.
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:14.260]   I did this morning.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.300]   That's why I'm late.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.380]   I was rolling around in my bowling branch.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:18.820]   Oh.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.260]   And they smell so good.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:25.060]   You know, they're freshly laundered, hung out on the line.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:26.540]   Oh, I love them.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.220]   Ballandbranch.com is the offer code MACBRAKE for 20% off.
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.260]   Is that anything we buy or just the sheets?
[00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:31.980]   Everything.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.220]   I need some new towels.
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:33.780]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:35.580]   Oh, great towels.
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:37.820]   See, and you could feel good because it's organic fair trade
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.340]   cut.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.620]   So it's not-- I mean, this is good stuff.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:45.380]   I will say, as much as we talk about spending $1,000
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:47.860]   on this tablet and $800 in this hard drive,
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:50.180]   when the things that really improved my life
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.420]   is when I took the mishmash of towels
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.220]   that I had acquired over the previous 15 years,
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:58.460]   some of them like cheap ones at Target.
[00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.740]   No, no, Paul and towels.
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.820]   Every month I decided I'm going to buy like $130 towel
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:06.020]   and $110 hand towel.
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.260]   Ever placing them all, it's like, toweling off
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.340]   is now a joy.
[00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.740]   I no longer walk around the house wet after a shower
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:14.660]   because it's just too rough to--
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.620]   It's like these little things that you're going to--
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.540]   You're going to sleep on your tablet.
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.420]   Let's be honest, this counts.
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:24.420]   Exactly.
[00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.380]   It took me a while to realize that investing in good sheets,
[00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:29.660]   investing in good towels, these are things
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:31.300]   I interact with on a daily basis.
[00:52:31.300 --> 00:52:33.460]   And it will make me happy to--
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.580]   That's when you know you're a grown up, when you actually--
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.420]   Yeah, your towels.
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:39.980]   Your plates and your sheets and your towels match.
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:41.780]   The plates is the hardest one.
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.700]   That's the last one to go.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:46.580]   So Apple Pencil-- I fix it to the Apple Pencil teardown.
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.340]   And one of the things Mike Thirlie said
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:51.220]   is the Apple Pencil is surprisingly heavy.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:55.100]   As with the pen, the weighting and the weight of it
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:55.980]   are very important.
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:58.060]   You don't actually want to light--
[00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.300]   You don't want it to be too light.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:00.620]   Well, I thought it was interesting to find out
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.460]   about the anti-roll or the way it doesn't roll.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.460]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:08.100]   It's got a heavy wibble wobble.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.380]   It's a weebble.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:09.900]   It's a weebble?
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:10.860]   It wobbles.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:11.860]   But it doesn't roll down.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.860]   And a tiny little motherboard.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:15.140]   That's the motherboard.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:15.740]   It's folded.
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:16.340]   It's so cool.
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:17.340]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:17.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.020]   And they had to fold it in half because--
[00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:21.060]   well, look at it.
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:27.100]   So I fix it says it's the smallest logic board it's ever seen
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.420]   in years of tearing apart technology.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.580]   It's one gram.
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.540]   They should have put a quarter next to it in the picture
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:34.420]   because you can't really tell.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.420]   But it's very small.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.140]   Well, you know how thin the pencil is.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.340]   If you fold this in half, it fits inside.
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:43.500]   There's an even tinier sensor board in the nib.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:44.980]   And movement between the two parts
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:48.700]   is apparently the pressure sensor.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.780]   It isn't-- OK.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.340]   So I fix it, gave it one out of 10 for a pairability.
[00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.100]   And when you look at what happened, when they put it
[00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:55.300]   in a part, you can see.
[00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:57.580]   My graphite pencil, their pairability is not great.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.060]   They put that back together.
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.500]   Sometimes they're like one of these--
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.820]   spiders are not insects people.
[00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:07.260]   I don't think people are comparing these.
[00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.060]   I think it's OK that there aren't like Philip screws holding
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.380]   it together and like socketed-- socketed ICs.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:13.860]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:15.220]   Let's go to the I fix it page.
[00:54:15.220 --> 00:54:17.300]   I'm glad these guys do this stuff.
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.260]   It's great to see how these things are put together
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:21.260]   and what's actually involved in those.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.460]   And here's the comparison.
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.740]   The top is the apple pencil.
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:24.740]   If you're looking on the video, you
[00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:25.940]   can see the apple pencil on top.
[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.260]   And then this is the surface pencil for Microsoft.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:30.820]   So it's a little bit bigger.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:32.260]   What's that weird?
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:33.620]   There's like these two weird things
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:36.140]   on the right side of the Microsoft.
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:38.340]   That's a clip for your pocket.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:38.820]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.980]   And that's an eraser for your pocket?
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:44.300]   Holy cats.
[00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:45.300]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.300]   Are there other pictures there?
[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.300]   Oh my god.
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:48.460]   Now, imagine that--
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.700]   Because my box is back.
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:53.100]   I wonder if they'll have a third party market for backs.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:54.820]   You'll unplug one magnetic back and just
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:56.380]   plug other magnetic backs onto it.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.020]   Like a giant Homer Simpson head eraser,
[00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.380]   you could just stick on the back.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.740]   I have to say that Microsoft--
[00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:04.540]   this is not their first time to the stylus rodeo.
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:07.780]   Did do a lot of things right with the surface
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:08.780]   pencil.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.660]   Having a clip is good.
[00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.900]   Having it magnetic so it sticks right to the side
[00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.460]   is fantastic and it holds pretty well.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.820]   And having an eraser, man.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.860]   So I used the Wacom for years and I never used the eraser.
[00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.540]   I used the whole button that does undo.
[00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:23.060]   Right.
[00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:24.100]   Because I just felt really convenient
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.460]   because you have to turn it around.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:26.780]   And turning it around was slow.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.540]   But I've been an artist for years
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.940]   and I went and I took out all my pencils.
[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:32.340]   And not a single pencil do I have with an eraser on it.
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:33.500]   I think like kids that people think
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.540]   there are erasers on pencils because of school.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:37.620]   But most art pencils don't have erasers.
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.100]   No.
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:40.060]   You know the gummy eraser or the starboard eraser
[00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:41.140]   or the chancellor eraser?
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:44.300]   All the professional artists I've been talking to.
[00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.660]   I think we both have friends at Pixar.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.060]   One of them was telling me how a Pixar,
[00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.460]   they all use Wacoms and they almost always use these.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.700]   They're the pencils--
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:53.700]   Use the erasers on those--
[00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.300]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:55.220]   They use the erasers all the time.
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.340]   I just never got on the habit.
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:55:59.340]   Oh, this is--
[00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:01.020]   Would have been nicer.
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:04.100]   I won't necessarily give them demerits for not having an eraser.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.900]   But I won't think that that was a positive thing.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.180]   It's not-- if they ever did a video saying,
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:13.220]   we realize that by eliminating the eraser,
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:16.020]   you made it more simple.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.740]   What I found though is because of how I draw it,
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:19.380]   I usually have a pencil on one hand and an eraser.
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:21.220]   On the other hand, as I just pull the pencil off
[00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.780]   and I double tap procreate to erase.
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:25.860]   Or I do the swipe gesture in Adobe to erase.
[00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.980]   And I don't miss having eraser.
[00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.420]   But I do miss the undo.
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:31.220]   And on a computer, undo feels kind of natural.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:32.500]   So I don't know if there's some sort of thing
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:34.620]   that they can do to a-- I'm not sure an eraser is a right answer.
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:37.980]   But their feels like auxiliary controls are possible.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:40.980]   I actually think a pocket clip isn't a bad idea either,
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:41.820]   right?
[00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:42.460]   That's-- that's--
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:43.940]   It's useful not only for your pocket,
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:45.780]   but anything that you're holding it in,
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:49.740]   you just need something to-- can you take the removable pocket
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.780]   clip off of a pen and slide it on there?
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:52.500]   I don't know if it's very--
[00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.140]   Well, I'm wondering if you could take the back off of this
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.060]   because it's magnetic and people will make third party
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.260]   magnetic backs with all sorts of different things on them.
[00:56:58.260 --> 00:56:59.260]   Yeah, that'd be cool.
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:01.300]   Yeah, but it'd have to have like an extendable barrel
[00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:03.180]   that goes over the casing because remember, you've
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.100]   got that lightning port--
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.060]   lightning connector.
[00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.300]   And I don't think you want to put it--
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.140]   Oh, that's right.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.420]   That's how you charge the thing.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.260]   It will violate my AppleCare if I put a third party clip
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:16.260]   from a 1954 stationary store.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:17.260]   Right.
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.140]   I've got like a cigar box full of old pencils and pens.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:22.460]   I'm sure I've got one of those metal clip-on--
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:23.300]   Right.
[00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:24.220]   Too big or clear.
[00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:25.260]   You people are saying--
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.740]   People are saying--
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:28.340]   that'll come in the chat room saying, well,
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.540]   you can't have an eraser there.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:31.020]   That's the rechargeable cap.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:31.500]   Right, exactly.
[00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.580]   But to be fair, the surface erasers,
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:35.740]   not an actual rubber eraser.
[00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:37.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:37.460 --> 00:57:38.860]   Oh, it's just a switch, right?
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:39.860]   I mean, yeah, OK.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.860]   It's just a different magnetic--
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:41.860]   It must be a different magnetic--
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.180]   It must be an interesting debate.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:48.060]   You don't need a recharging port on the Microsoft pen
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:51.140]   because, of course, it takes an actual replaceable battery
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:54.260]   that they say lasts like so long that it's not even an issue
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:55.780]   that you have to replace it.
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:58.300]   Unless, of course, you run out of battery at a time
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:00.500]   where you're not near a drugstore that has a quadruple
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.220]   A battery section.
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:04.860]   Speaking of running out of things to talk about,
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.260]   Cult of Mac decided to see how hard it was to snap the Apple
[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:11.460]   pencil wall that's in the charger.
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:12.620]   And apparently, it's hard.
[00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:15.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:15.180 --> 00:58:17.140]   You know, we're all just looking for another angle.
[00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.060]   On the land of Willard Blends--
[00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:20.780]   Can you use it as a diving board?
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:23.140]   You stick the pencil in there, jump off of it,
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.260]   and get some height.
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:26.020]   Yeah, somebody did a video of what happens
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:28.220]   if you stick a pencil in an electric pencil sharpener.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.420]   Oh, that was really stupid, wasn't it?
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:31.780]   That just made me mad.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.420]   That's $100 piece of link to it.
[00:58:34.420 --> 00:58:37.660]   That's just $100 one, but $100 thing that no one can get.
[00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:38.500]   Right.
[00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:40.500]   Yeah, even worse, right, when it's the interest.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:41.460]   It's like--
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:42.620]   It's their pencil.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:43.780]   They can do what they want with it,
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:44.540]   and if they want to make--
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:44.980]   They're not on fire.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.180]   Thousands of dollars in affiliate athletes.
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:50.860]   Well, presumably they're going to make their money back.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.060]   Speaking of magnets, you got this.
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.940]   Don't you, Renee, the magnetic--
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:59:00.140]   There are a lot of Apple Watch chargers now out there.
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:00.860]   There are.
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:04.460]   This is the magnetic charging dock.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:05.980]   And this is from Apple?
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.100]   Yep.
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:10.260]   It's a spitting image of their new headquarters.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:15.980]   But don't get it if you have the Milanese loop,
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:17.540]   because you can't get it around that, right?
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:17.900]   You can.
[00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:18.740]   You just pop it up.
[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:20.700]   And if you scroll down, there's a picture of the Milanese
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:22.460]   that will come down a little further.
[00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.620]   So it's the same disc that you get when you get your watch.
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:26.020]   Yeah, but--
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:27.420]   It's on a hinge so you can pop it up.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:27.900]   And it's the--
[00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:28.660]   No, that actually--
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:29.060]   --it's nice.
[00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:29.420]   You know what?
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:30.940]   That's actually a good way of doing it,
[00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:34.100]   because then you have the night mode and everything.
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.500]   Yeah, I think if you scroll down, you'll see that too.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:38.020]   I try to take as many pictures as I could
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:38.900]   with all the different bands.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:39.540]   How much is that?
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.100]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:40.820]   There's the--
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.340]   So there's two ways to look at this.
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:43.620]   First, it's ludicrously expensive.
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.700]   It's $79 for a white disc.
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.180]   But when you actually buy it, it is a heavy white disc
[00:59:48.180 --> 00:59:49.540]   with stainless steel insets.
[00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:51.740]   It's got some weird soft touch fabric
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:54.660]   that I wonder if the pencil would feel good made out of it
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.060]   and then swayed at the bottom.
[00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.260]   And it's fairly heavy, so it stays put.
[00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:58.860]   It needs to be.
[00:59:58.860 --> 00:59:59.180]   Yeah.
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:00.100]   Knock it over.
[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.300]   So it's a really-- it's Neil Cyber,
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:06.020]   who's a former South Side analyst who now covers Apple
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.700]   from a financial standpoint, was saying,
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.780]   this is the Apple affordable luxury thing,
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.980]   where people are buying it like, oh, I might as well just
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:13.740]   get a charging stand that goes with it.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.540]   And it is expensive, but it's not like Rolex
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:18.140]   sort of luxury expensive.
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.340]   When you're paying $79 for a dongle
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.540]   so you can use your MacBook Type-C connector
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:25.540]   with a USB port, $79 for a charging stand.
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.140]   Where's that?
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.860]   Doesn't seem like that much.
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:30.580]   No, and it's-- the hinge is like this typical Apple thing
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.540]   where it feels like a MacBook hinge, where you put it
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:33.540]   at any angle and it stays there.
[01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:33.860]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:34.940]   It's perfect, yeah.
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.940]   And to put the watch on, it doesn't even move.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:37.260]   And it just--
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.100]   It's so easy to move, but it's easy to act
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:39.660]   where you put it.
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.860]   3,000 prototypes of this.
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.060]   You kind of feel like--
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:44.700]   Apple price is not really the--
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.260]   It's not the issue.
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:46.740]   --the Apple is thinking about what they're making.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.620]   And these things are like-- you get Johnny Ive
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.820]   and they're going, how would I make it?
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:52.340]   Certainly, exactly the way I want it.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.580]   I would be shocked if Johnny Ive at any point says,
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.540]   well, can we make it for less than $79?
[01:00:58.540 --> 01:00:59.220]   I don't think we got that.
[01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.580]   You read that blog post.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:02.900]   There's a blog post from a former Wi-Fi engineer at Apple
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.580]   who was talking about the use LTE feature
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:06.820]   to make up for poor Wi-Fi.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.140]   And he's like, it's being designed
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:11.700]   by people who have unlimited free cellular data for life.
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:13.460]   So their concern is not your data bill.
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.740]   Their concern is how good is your connection quality?
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:18.180]   Experience trumps everything else, right?
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.060]   I think it's great that there's a company in the world
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.300]   that cares about that.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:25.860]   I mean, there's other companies like the BNO, right?
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:32.700]   The design, Dieter Rams kind of notion of design trumps.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.180]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:34.740]   So that's fine.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:36.100]   There needs to be a company like that.
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.580]   It's a little weird to see in technology where design has
[01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:41.580]   historically been taking a bad seat to functionality.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.900]   But--
[01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:44.980]   As I'm fun to saying, Apple knows--
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.660]   Apple has an MFI program that allows third parties
[01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:49.940]   to make what are probably going to be much more affordable
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.260]   and more convenient stuff.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.540]   They get to make the stuff that they know that no one else
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:59.700]   can make and look like from the same design language
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:02.140]   into the same sort of high-inspects they'd like to do.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:05.100]   So they're not cheating anybody out of--
[01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:08.180]   I have that ludicrous Hermes band on in those pictures.
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.460]   And you can get those for $39 out of China.
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.140]   They don't feel the same, but they look the same.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:14.060]   Oh, you mean that's not really the Hermes?
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.820]   So that is the one I have there's only the Hermes.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:17.540]   But that's almost foolish when you figure
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:18.380]   that you can get--
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.420]   Pat and Quill has some awesome ones for, I think, $100.
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:25.660]   And Serenity got a bunch of knockoffs from China for $30.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:26.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.980]   You can find something in your price range.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:28.500]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.860]   eBay is a good--
[01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:32.140]   it's a good-- even if you're contemplating buying
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:36.540]   the real thing from Apple, at least buy the cheap $24
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.060]   millinies loop and wear that for a couple of months
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.420]   before you pop $150 for the logo.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.140]   You buy the real one, you put that in the safe,
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.660]   and then you wear--
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.860]   I really wanted the stainless steel black one, or whatever.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.300]   But once I tried a cheaper one, which I'm sure is cheaper
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.900]   than it, but then I was like, oh, this isn't going to be what
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:55.660]   I want pretty quickly.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.940]   I like the stainless steel black one,
[01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.340]   because every time I think I've scratched it,
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:59.780]   it's actually a piece of concrete or metal
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:01.140]   that I've taken off something else.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.020]   And I just wiped it off.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.660]   DLC is just such a great material.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.620]   I want everything made out of DLC now.
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:12.340]   How hard is it for you to write a JavaScript that
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:16.380]   validates phone numbers and allows dashes?
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.820]   What is that?
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.540]   Not every time we are so angry.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:21.260]   Every time that happens, it's so unfriendly.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.260]   It's just Apple.
[01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:23.020]   This is Apple.
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:24.580]   I'm trying to buy one of these docs.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:26.180]   This thing.
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:29.500]   And it says, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:33.180]   769-8948 is not a phone number.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.260]   Yes, it is!
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.260]   Just pull out any non-dumeric characters,
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:40.220]   make everything uppercase, and just don't make me do the work.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:41.020]   How hard is that?
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:41.540]   That's right.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.740]   You don't even have to write it.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:45.660]   You just can get it from a library somewhere.
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.700]   For security purposes, we require your phone number
[01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.300]   to have at least one non-dumeric digit.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.540]   It's one.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.820]   In Canada, you have the postal codes that are alpha and numera.
[01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:56.340]   You never know.
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:56.980]   Is there a space?
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:57.700]   Is there a dash?
[01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.140]   They want a capital lowercase.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.620]   And you have to try every one of them until it accepts it.
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:02.540]   Oh, Lord.
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:03.060]   Oh, so fast.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:03.780]   It's doing it again.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:07.300]   It doesn't like that phone number with a dash in it.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.420]   Don't-- OK, kids, just a tip.
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.380]   In future?
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.860]   Oh, for some reason, it thinks the credit card number is wrong.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.140]   But if I typed it in, it would think it was right.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.580]   All right, just for that, I'm not buying it.
[01:04:18.580 --> 01:04:18.980]   Take that.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.300]   Watch that.
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:21.340]   No, still doesn't like it.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:24.860]   OK, I didn't want it after all.
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.540]   By the way, that is a problem, Apple.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:30.700]   If you have people who get frustrated at your shopping cart
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.700]   and go, oh, screw it.
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.980]   That's $79 for a $4 item.
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.340]   You could have made some money.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.900]   Did you-- why did you put it in again?
[01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.740]   Because usually when I order--
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.700]   I know.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.140]   I usually--
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.020]   Remember all of it.
[01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:45.060]   I have to admit, I've gotten really--
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.740]   I think Apple sees me coming.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:49.420]   They asked Apple for my password at the drop of a hat
[01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:51.820]   now on everything, every time.
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:54.180]   It's now expiring passwords all the time on me,
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:54.900]   like my phone.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:56.820]   So I just gave you my password.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.420]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:01.580]   I have to admit, I am lost in the .mac account
[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:04.540]   or whatever, like iCloud thing between devices, where
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.140]   one device has to check another device.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.940]   And it goes back and back and forth
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:10.940]   and sending text messages to something that--
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.020]   Let's talk about something we can actually fix.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:17.500]   The App Store on iOS.
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:18.340]   You can fix that?
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.540]   No.
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:21.180]   Was it Lauren Goode?
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.220]   Somebody wrote a good article on the Verge
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:28.140]   about this issue, which is we've talked about before.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:32.940]   And I know you guys know developers who face this problem.
[01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:37.420]   She quoted two developers who did sketch, which is a $99 Mac
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:39.620]   app, 3D design Mac.
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:42.060]   They said, we're never going to do an iPad Pro version
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:46.940]   because the store doesn't let us do demos.
[01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:52.020]   Charging $99 for an app on the App Store is tough enough.
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.700]   But people can't try before they buy.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:54.860]   They're not going to do it.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:57.260]   And what about the upgrade issue?
[01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.300]   There's no way to charge people for an upgrade.
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:01.340]   You either upgrade them for free or make a whole new version
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.900]   of the program that is the buy.
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:05.740]   But Omnigraphil is like--
[01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.340]   It's very useful too.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.060]   Is this a real problem?
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:09.900]   It isn't.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.880]   It is a real problem in that for people
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.220]   who come from a traditional Mac background,
[01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.700]   they expect things to be like demos and upgrades.
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:18.080]   But they have a way bigger problem than I think
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.620]   that anyone is really documenting.
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:21.820]   And that is no one's ever seen a market like this before.
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.460]   There's a million and a half apps in the store.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.740]   That was never the case on the Mac.
[01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:26.300]   It probably wasn't the case on Windows,
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:29.220]   where they were that easily available to that many people.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.380]   And people say, oh, they don't keep up
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:33.700]   the value of the apps raised to the bottom.
[01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.540]   But when you venture capitalists involved,
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.720]   they don't have to charge for the apps.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.320]   They're not making their money off the app upfront.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:40.120]   So you're going to have competitors who charge nothing
[01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:40.840]   for the app.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.840]   You're going to have an incredible amount of competition.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.240]   And yes, upgrades would be nice.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.960]   And yes, demos would be nice if you're
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.360]   dealing with people who are traditionally used to software.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.920]   But we have a whole generation of people
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.600]   who are just used to everything being free.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.280]   And they don't put any value in software.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:53.760]   That is a problem.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.400]   And Apple could pull all sorts of levers
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:57.040]   and developers really want them to.
[01:06:57.040 --> 01:06:59.200]   But at this point, I don't know if that's going to help.
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.960]   And we face this as content creators too.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.400]   And we saw the music industry talking about this streaming.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.420]   There is a massive disconnect between value propositions.
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:09.500]   And when you get to 1,000,000 and 1/2 apps,
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.540]   even if your app is terrific, people may not care.
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.700]   And that's a really hard thing for developers to hear
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.620]   that I put all this time and effort.
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:18.340]   And I made this what I consider to be this really great app.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.380]   And nobody's buying it.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.780]   And I could blame lack of trials.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:22.300]   And I could blame lack of upgrades.
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.140]   But in the end, there's just so much noise out there.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:25.980]   And it's really hard.
[01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.900]   It's become like the movie or music industry
[01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:29.540]   where you have to get a breakout hit.
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:31.180]   You have to do the kind of marketing
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.660]   that Adele's people are doing.
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:35.840]   And then you have to put all the wood behind that arrow.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:37.400]   And I don't think it's a simple fix.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.920]   And I think there's a cap.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920]   OK, go ahead.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.400]   Apple is putting some bricks in the developer's backpack
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.440]   that Apple does not have to put in there.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.280]   One is lack of demos.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.760]   The other is lack of paid upgrades.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.680]   And other is lack of access to information
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.040]   about customers even voluntarily.
[01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.240]   There are just so many roadblocks
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:58.280]   that are making the app store a non-ideal proposition
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:58.940]   for developers.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:00.400]   And we can name a bunch of developers
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:04.060]   who have decided to, at least on the Mac app side,
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:06.160]   who've decided that it's just not worth it for us.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.820]   We have a good enough relationship directly
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:10.500]   with our customers that the extra hassles
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:14.640]   that Apple inflicts upon us to be part of the app store
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.680]   just isn't paying off for us.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.560]   And users aren't going to be trained
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.340]   to start to pay money for apps until we start to see
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.440]   a little more variety here.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.080]   I think that your point is well taken
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:32.200]   that it's hard to convince people who have never used an iPhone
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:37.360]   without expecting to spend more than $2.99 on an app
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:40.120]   to suddenly teach them, look, this is a valuable software.
[01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:41.040]   That's not going to be made.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   And it's not going to be upgraded
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.440]   unless you start paying actual, like, real, make a living
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.600]   sort of money off of it.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.400]   But we're not going to even start the process
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.400]   unless we take the handcuffs off developers
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.640]   and let them do what they want to do.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.320]   All I'll say is that the procreate app for iPad,
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.880]   it's an amazing app and it shocks me that it costs,
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:02.000]   I think, $5.99.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:02.840]   What a deal.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.760]   I really just wish, I know that I'm an outlier,
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.400]   I know that you can't really build a business
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.760]   on people like me, but I really wish there were,
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.640]   like, we were seeing on so many other apps,
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.240]   a button that I can push to simply say,
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:17.080]   look, just let me give you more money than this
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.480]   because now that I've been using it for a week, excuse me?
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.680]   Like, Omni, they charge real money for their apps.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.520]   I would probably do that.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.360]   They charge real money for that app.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.120]   Are the developers will let you do,
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.600]   like, sort of a Patreon sort of thing,
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.880]   where you touch this button and basically pledge
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.080]   a certain amount of money per month
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.400]   that we will automatically get out of you
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.240]   for continuing to use the app.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.200]   I wish, I have faith in humanity,
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.360]   but I'm not sure that people are going to be able
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.880]   to come through to make that a windfall,
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:44.200]   but I'd like more developers to try to do that.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.600]   I would like to be able to,
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.000]   I would like to give more money to developers
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.560]   who make the apps that I rely on
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.680]   because I want them to make a good living
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.840]   and also selfishly, I want them to continue
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:55.280]   to support and upgrade this app.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.880]   >> I think that a lot of the app developers
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.400]   that are making money, I think,
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:00.960]   are thinking about things in two ways.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.400]   One is obviously in app purchases,
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.120]   and the second is some kind of subscription.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.200]   I mean, a lot of us, in my company, got hooked on Slack
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.560]   because it was free, and they started downloading it.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:11.560]   Now I'm paying, I don't know how much I paid per month
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.400]   for that image.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.240]   >> You're hooked.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   >> But my company runs five to 10,000 messages a week.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.160]   You know, you have to do it.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.840]   So it's, you know, but it built up from a free thing
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.760]   that then I had to pay to keep doing
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:24.680]   whatever they wanted to do.
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.160]   And so I think that that model has been successful.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.840]   I think also in app purchases, in,
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:34.240]   I think that there is a,
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.040]   and I think a lot of developers aren't doing this.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.440]   If you think you're going to build something big
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:38.480]   and I think that Apple could do this,
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:40.320]   for instance, with Final Cut,
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.960]   or anybody else's building a larger thing
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.800]   is think of your app as a platform.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.920]   So if you're not building a small app
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.760]   and you're building a big app,
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.640]   think of it as a platform and make sure that you have a way
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:49.040]   for people to build things into it
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.760]   that are third party, that Apple might get a bit,
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.440]   you might get a bit.
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.000]   But there, you know, if you've got a million users,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.600]   there's a lot of other people that might wanna,
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.760]   or even if you're building extra tools,
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.600]   I don't think you necessarily have to give the entire,
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.480]   I think if you give something that's useful enough for free
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:06.560]   or for a little, and then, you know,
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.000]   that people can use every day and get used to it,
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.120]   and then there's, you know, being able to add things on
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.080]   'cause I'm quite happy paying for extra brushes,
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.440]   you know, or whatever, you know,
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.920]   once I'm in an app and think that it's useful.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.960]   You know, so, 'cause I know, I guess I'm an art app
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:25.400]   for the iPad Pro, it was like $1.99,
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:28.240]   and then, you know, all brushes were $6 or something like that.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.160]   - Capers used to be like that,
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.400]   and they switched to their hardware supported model,
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.640]   and now Apple makes their own pencil.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.240]   I mean, it is really, really tough.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.840]   And then, all sorts of arguments, pro and con,
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:37.920]   like some people were saying,
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.000]   "Time trials would be great, I could download this app
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   and see if I really like it."
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.600]   But then someone's like, "Well, let's say you download
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.080]   this app and you put a bunch of data in it,
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:44.960]   and then your time expires,
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.640]   how do we get that data out for you?"
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.680]   And none of the stuff is simple,
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.240]   and I don't think Apple's being mean about this stuff.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:52.240]   I think that they have a big philosophical divide
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:54.040]   about this, the way they do about many things
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.360]   where some people believe that,
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.360]   in order for there to be a future,
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.440]   especially on the Mac App Store,
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.520]   you have to provide these things.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:00.520]   Not that people are like, "No, that makes it not simple.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.360]   We want people to download an app and just use it.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.480]   Don't have to worry about,
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.640]   is my data gonna time out?
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:05.840]   Am I gonna have to pay for an upgrade?
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.440]   What happens if I don't want the upgrade?"
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.640]   And I think sometimes when you desire to be simple,
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:11.680]   and you know, it's like those apps
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:13.360]   that don't have preferences 'cause they wanna be simple,
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.120]   and then all the workarounds they put in place,
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.760]   not to have preferences becomes way more complicated.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.200]   I think that's what we're seeing with the App Store now,
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.000]   is in this attempt to have a simple model,
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.680]   you have people making second versions of the app.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:23.520]   And what happens if you,
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.600]   Ken Case from Omni Group was trying to figure out a name
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.200]   for the old version of Omni Group,
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.520]   for people who didn't wanna upgrade to the new version.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.680]   And TapBots is having to do all this stuff
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.400]   to retrofit an old version of TweetBot,
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.040]   people didn't wanna have to buy the new version.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:37.920]   And I don't know what the solution is.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.280]   Like everyone says, "I want this or that,"
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:41.360]   and none of that looks like it's gonna be workable either.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.400]   But there's obviously a problem
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.080]   because people aren't getting value for software,
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:45.680]   and if they don't, they're gonna stop making it,
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.400]   and then we all lose out.
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.400]   - Yeah, that's the money quote that frightens me,
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.800]   that the idea that there's software
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.160]   that would just go gangbusters on the iPad Pro,
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.600]   but you just, that people who make this stuff
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.840]   can't justify the economics of investing in that
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.000]   as a platform if they don't think
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   they're gonna be able to get their money back.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.160]   - So you get Adobe and Microsoft
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:08.480]   who don't make them on all subscriptions making the apps.
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.960]   I mean, it's not what I want, I want indie apps.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.840]   - Well, and I think that, I don't know,
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.400]   it's also a very big market.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.160]   There are people and indie developers
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.000]   that are making money on this.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.720]   The idea that everyone should make money on every app
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.240]   that they do, I think is not realistic either.
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.840]   I mean, I think that there is a part of developing
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.640]   a good app, developing a marketing campaign,
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.160]   developing a process of how,
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.000]   and understanding in the reality that we're in,
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:31.880]   how am I gonna do it?
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.680]   I mean, we're in the process of developing apps right now,
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:35.920]   and we haven't released a bunch of them,
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.040]   but this is a conversation that we're having constantly,
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.880]   which is how are we gonna make money?
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:45.240]   Is it gonna be subscription in apps purchases
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.480]   or some kind of platform?
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.600]   And those are, but you have to think about it,
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.960]   it's not, I don't think it's gonna change.
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.720]   I think that you have to figure out how to make money
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:54.960]   and that, and some people are,
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:57.800]   and I know people that are, they're doing okay.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.600]   You know, in this market with what I consider niche.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.840]   - I guess the real issue though,
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.080]   is if you're gonna have a success with the iPad Pro,
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:06.600]   you're gonna have to add, have a support
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.480]   in a particular category.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:09.320]   - Yeah, you find a niche.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.440]   - The high end Pro apps.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.680]   Well, what I'm just saying, maybe not,
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.200]   but it seems to me that the iPad Pro
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.760]   needs a certain kind of app that the other iPads don't.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.920]   - You make as a $150 in app purchase, right?
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.120]   Like you get, you make for free.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:25.320]   - Is that the solution for trials?
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.800]   It feels like it's not.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.640]   - It's hard, like an iOS 7, a bunch of apps,
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.520]   like I remember Tweetbot, they did a complete redesign
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:32.640]   for iOS 7 and people said, "We're not gonna pay for this."
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.240]   And you're updating your user interface,
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.480]   which for them took months and months of really hard work
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.920]   to make it as good as they wanted it.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:40.080]   People are like, "That's not a real update.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:40.920]   "I'm not gonna pay for that.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:41.880]   "That's not a new feature."
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:42.960]   - Well, it's hard for them to do.
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.520]   - It might have been hard for them to do,
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.520]   but the question is that--
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:46.880]   - There's a custom-- - The cost statement was worth it.
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:48.120]   - Does the customer think it's worth it?
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.120]   - And they obviously misread that.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.880]   - Otherwise it still looks like an iOS 6 app,
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:53.720]   though, and everyone would hate it
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.160]   and they get bad reviews.
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.800]   - Well, then you have to, then you look at,
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.520]   but that's an investment into the future sales,
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.400]   not into the current, upgrading to your current.
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.120]   I mean, you look at, I mean, now Apple doesn't need
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.440]   to make money on it, but the, you know,
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:05.800]   look at Final Cut and all the other things.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.680]   I mean, Apple just keeps on running, you know, upgrades as,
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:11.000]   you know, and people, what they're,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.240]   if they're making money on it, which I,
[01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.000]   you know, I think they probably are.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:18.080]   What they're doing there is they're, you know,
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.800]   getting new sales.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:21.600]   I mean, that's what they're after.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.560]   - I think four years of overcast.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.320]   I mean, I think, I don't know if that'll work for everybody,
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.960]   but I did the patronage button four times on overcast.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:29.800]   - Did you?
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.080]   Aren't you a sweetheart?
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.320]   - Well, no, I mean, I want us to--
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.160]   - Marked the smart business app. - If they gave me
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.160]   the opportunity, I would do that for tap bots,
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.000]   I would do that for all.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.920]   I do that for any of the ND devs whose apps I use.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.000]   People say like it, you know, it's a, again,
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   tweet blocking the new version.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.560]   I don't want to buy it as $3.
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.560]   They're charging me $3 again,
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.760]   just two years later.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:48.360]   I would pay that, I use that app eight hours a day,
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:50.640]   every day I would pay that on a daily basis.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:53.360]   - And I definitely don't like free apps,
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.080]   because I'm afraid, I don't want to commit anything
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.640]   to a free app, because I'm terrified
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.520]   that they're not going to be around,
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.360]   or they're not going to update.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.720]   I've spent quite half of it.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.640]   - If it's a flappy bird who cares, but--
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.480]   - Right, you're right.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.800]   - If it's an app game, you're going to really use it.
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.360]   - But if I look at like a productivity app,
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.920]   I want them to pay, and I really am quite happy paying
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:10.000]   by 10 bucks, because I don't want to more more--
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:10.840]   - Or a hundred bucks.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.680]   - I pay, I pay.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.520]   - Or an Alex.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.400]   - I use Omni Graffle on my iPad, which I don't really like.
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.720]   I have to say, I mean, I love, I mean,
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.880]   I use Omni Graffle every day on my computer.
[01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.680]   The Omni Graffle iPad version is not.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.560]   - Yeah, I'm not at all ashamed to pay money
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.560]   for Omni Outliner, because I use that every day.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.960]   It's not at all a shame to pay 40 bucks for Scrivener,
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.800]   because I use that every day.
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.640]   - But the issue, I've been using Mars edit
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.200]   for the first time in three or four years.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.040]   - Left in, yeah.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.360]   - And the developer is actually a friend of mine,
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.400]   and offered me a press comp,
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:43.160]   and I used it for about two weeks,
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.840]   and then said, "Nope, here we go, I'll get to the same."
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:47.040]   Giving you $40, I don't want a free copy.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.640]   You just gotta think these things through.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.760]   - But that's the point.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:53.080]   If you can't try it, and it's $40,
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.560]   and you don't know if you're gonna use it every day,
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.840]   that is a tough position to put a developer--
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:59.000]   - It's like download a lot of apps
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.800]   that are like the light free version,
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.440]   just to see if I like the interface.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.000]   - And if it's, it depends on the app.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.200]   In some apps, you can put out a demo version,
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.400]   a free version, a freemium version,
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.160]   that gives you enough of a sense of it
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.120]   that you're gonna pay $100 for it.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.200]   - You're gonna pick out pay-walms in 10 bucks.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.880]   - Since the launch of Peacock has been 10 bucks,
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:17.800]   he's never lowered the price,
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.720]   but he has a Peacock light for people who wanna try it.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.560]   - Right.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.440]   - A couple of Apple Pay stores,
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440]   which I'll just mention them,
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:25.480]   there's nothing really to say.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:27.440]   Apple Pay's gonna launch in China by February,
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.880]   according to some sources,
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.880]   and Square is rolling out
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:36.800]   touchless readers for Apple Pay, which is kinda cool.
[01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.520]   - You know, I really get into the point now
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.400]   where I'm starting to think about whether a store
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:43.760]   has Apple Pay 'cause I really don't like
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.240]   giving my card card out anymore.
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.040]   I don't gotta get my card, I don't like typing it.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:49.480]   I don't like typing numbers in, I just wanna tap it.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:52.680]   I don't wanna hand any information over.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.680]   - Google's doing something Apple should probably do.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:55.680]   It'd be an interesting thing to do.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:00.680]   I think Google is probably taking whatever they make
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:04.080]   off of Android Pay and putting it back into charity.
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.440]   So when you use, they're saying,
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.760]   if you use Android Pay for this period of time,
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.520]   we'll donate to charity.
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.240]   And it's clear that they're saying is,
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:16.520]   we're not gonna make any money for this month,
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.360]   but what we wanna do is get people to try it, right?
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:24.040]   And the hope is that if people try it,
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.040]   they'll get, 'cause the first one is the hardest one, right?
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.360]   It's the first order. - It's like figuring out
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.480]   what I gotta do with my card.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:31.160]   - And then once you use it, and maybe once you,
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.400]   I don't know, there's some magic number.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.400]   Once you use it three times,
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.200]   you're gonna use it all the time.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.280]   And people are gonna donate
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.720]   to a million dollars toward education
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:41.640]   for people who use Android Pay.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:46.620]   And they're gonna go through a donorschoose.org.
[01:18:46.620 --> 01:18:49.880]   So I think this is a good idea.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:53.200]   And it's clearly a jumpstart for Android Pay, right?
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.080]   It doesn't matter if they make money at it initially.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:59.240]   - I was surprised how many people are angry
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.800]   that only American Express is accepted
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:02.600]   on Apple Pay and Canada and Australia.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.600]   - It's better than us, right?
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.920]   - Because American Express is, yeah, it is better
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:05.760]   than anything people like,
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.920]   it just seemed to offend people that it wasn't everywhere.
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:09.760]   - Well, blame your bank.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:10.960]   - Call your bank.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.760]   Call TVI. - I'm pro-
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:12.760]   - I'm studying that.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:15.520]   I'm making signs, I'm putting sparkles on them.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.680]   I'm walking back and forth in front of the banks.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.280]   - I love you, Toronto Dominion, but...
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.680]   - Help us help you.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:25.880]   - Help us help you.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.920]   - Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:31.560]   Should I talk, actually, we didn't mention,
[01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.480]   and I don't know how widespread it is.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:37.000]   - Apple's, the iPad Pro's becoming unresponsive
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.320]   after charging.
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.520]   I mean, we all have iPad Pros.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.360]   - I haven't seen it.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.200]   - I haven't seen it. - Several,
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.040]   I haven't seen it.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.040]   - You neither.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.040]   - Okay.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.520]   - Doesn't mean it's not important to people
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.800]   that's affected, but I don't know
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.000]   if it's a really widespread thing.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.320]   - Apple has put out a support document saying,
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.120]   we're looking into the problem,
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.080]   do a hard restart, that'll fix it, at least now.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.080]   Force restart by pressing and holding.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.160]   Both the sleep and wake.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.240]   Did you know this will do this, everybody?
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.120]   Probably you did.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.480]   There's several ways to reboot your iPad.
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.880]   One is, of course, to press and hold the on/off,
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.400]   so it still says slide to turn off,
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:12.840]   but if you press and hold both the sleep, wake,
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.440]   and home buttons for 10 seconds,
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.520]   it'll just go, and you'll see the white Apple logo.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.600]   You've done a reset.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.320]   Which I don't know how that's different
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.040]   from turning it off and on again.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.600]   - It flushes all the RAM, it gets everything.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:26.920]   Like everything gets gets reset.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.760]   - Exactly.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.160]   - P-chop, tau.
[01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.280]   - So it's a clean slate and everything'll start over.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:33.080]   - Yeah, but doesn't erase your data.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:33.960]   - No.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.280]   - But it just cleans everything out.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.720]   Flushes it out, the shoots.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.920]   And then there's the DFU,
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.600]   which nobody should ever have to do.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.760]   - There's recovery mode, and there's a bunch of different
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.200]   fun. - Yeah, there's at least four
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.920]   different ways to restart this.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.600]   But apparently the reset, what we'll call it,
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.240]   the hard reset, fixes that.
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.360]   - DFU, you've got to reinstall your iPad.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.200]   You don't want to do that.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.520]   - You don't want to do that.
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:56.440]   You don't want to do that.
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:01.440]   They say both 128 and 32GIG, WiFi and LTE iPad Pro models
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.680]   have all been affected, so.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.520]   - DFU's device firmware update,
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:07.880]   and it means what it says on the label.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:09.360]   - (chuckles)
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:11.360]   You're just updating everything.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:13.000]   Our show today brought to you by Texture.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.200]   Great, you know, if you're looking for something
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.360]   to put on your new iPad, I got it on my mini.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.520]   It would probably look great though, on the iPad Pro.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.440]   Texture is like Netflix for magazines.
[01:21:22.440 --> 01:21:24.400]   And I think this is great because for a couple of reasons,
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.480]   one, almost every magazine, or I'm sorry,
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.720]   I should say almost every month,
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:31.200]   there's an article I want to read in Vanity Fair
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.520]   in Rolling Stone.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:35.840]   There's just certain magazines.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.760]   I just want to, but I don't want to subscribe,
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:38.880]   I don't want to buy it on the newsstand.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:41.320]   That's really expensive.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.440]   This is the best way to do it.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.320]   Get the content you want from all of your favorite magazines
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:52.320]   and get it on your iPad, or your iPhone.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.160]   You don't even, if you don't even know what you want to read,
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.240]   you don't have to waste time finding premium content.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:00.240]   They have an editorial team that recommends
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.560]   stories for you based on the things you've shown
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560]   an interest in.
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:05.720]   They also have curated collections
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:08.160]   that lets you delve deeper into articles from magazines
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.320]   like Fortune and Fast Company and Newsweek
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.160]   and Rolling Stone and Wired.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.440]   I pretend I get it for Fortune and Fast Company
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.920]   and Rolling Stone and Wired.
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.720]   Actually, really I'm getting it for People Magazine
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.960]   'cause I just got to know what the latest is.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:21.920]   Who the sexiest man alive is.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.520]   Congratulations, David Beckham.
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:32.360]   Got to know who Gwen and Blaker up to, you know, those things.
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:35.000]   You know what happened to me?
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.800]   I realized I would go to the grocery store
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:39.520]   and then I'd be standing at the checkout line
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.560]   and I'd see these covers and I'd say,
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:43.280]   I don't know who any of those people are.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.120]   That's what you know you're getting on.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.000]   I didn't literally do not know those names.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.600]   So I decided I'm going to fix that and then I got texture.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:53.480]   Go to texture.com/macbreak.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.160]   We've been talking about texture for a long time.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.000]   You might remember them from the name Next Issue.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.080]   It's texture.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.800]   Next Issue is rebranded to texture.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:04.840]   But the same great magazines, the same great experience,
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.600]   you're going to have see the same layout in pages
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.000]   as if you bought those magazines.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.320]   But additional features, bonus features, videos,
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.720]   and the pricing is right.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:15.920]   There's two plans, a basic plan for 10 bucks a month,
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.840]   the premium plan for 15 bucks a month.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.240]   You can access on five different devices per account.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:24.000]   There's no commitment.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.880]   You can cancel anytime online, no phone call necessary.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.920]   You won't want to cancel though.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.160]   You're going to love these magazines.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.360]   It is, it's everything.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.240]   It's everything you want.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:37.200]   Even, you know, I do a lot, I like the cooking stuff.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.400]   I like to get on my bowling branch sheets
[01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.920]   on my Casper mattress.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:43.840]   - Cut it up to a little--
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:45.200]   - Cut it up to a-- - All recipes.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.440]   - To cooking, well I do because I like to look,
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:50.680]   oh this looks really good, I want to cook this.
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.800]   - Okay, I'm sold.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.640]   You don't need to talk about it.
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.480]   - It's good, isn't it?
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.480]   - I'm gonna go get it on the googer.
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:23:58.680]   - Texture.com.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.000]   Try it, you can try it free for a month.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.120]   You don't have to, you know, take my word for it.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:05.880]   Texture.com/macbreak, one month free.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.520]   I'm gonna have to get that diabetic living now.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.040]   - Is it a popular science?
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:11.000]   - Populos, of course you have popular science.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.160]   Popular everything.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.360]   I think they have popular mechanics, popular science.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.800]   - I can't describe it like all the populars.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.760]   - There it is, popular science, popular photography,
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:19.840]   popular mechanics.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:20.960]   - There you go. - You want popular
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:22.560]   they got popular. - I'm done.
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:24.280]   - It's good, popular mechanics is good.
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:25.280]   Like I don't want to think too hard,
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.160]   but I want to see some cool pictures of fighter planes.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.960]   - Yeah, and I don't want to buy it
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:31.240]   'cause then I'm just gonna be just clutter on my,
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.400]   my, I don't like carrying them around anymore.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:34.640]   I'm probably with a TV.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.920]   - Well I've flown with you.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.160]   That's what you do, you go in the airport
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.560]   and you buy 10 magazines.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.080]   - Right, no, I leave them.
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.320]   - But this is what you do now.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:43.480]   And by the way, they download
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:44.600]   so you can read them on the plane,
[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:46.800]   even if there's no wifi.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.480]   Sound and vision, that's a great magazine.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:50.080]   I love, I love sunset.
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:52.480]   - Druelling, sunset, the California magazine.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.960]   - I don't know, I never read the sunset.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:55.800]   - You haven't?
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.640]   - I've never read the magazine.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.000]   - See the point is you probably would never buy it
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.480]   or subscribe to it, but I bet you,
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.640]   I almost could guarantee you there's an article in there
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.920]   that you would go, oh wow.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:03.760]   - Yeah, probably.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.200]   - But one, that's the problem.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.000]   - Deep pet fry in your turkey.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.400]   (laughs)
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.960]   Texture.com/Macbreak.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.360]   Need I say more?
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.280]   - Are you? - Seagwen's Revenge Romance.
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.040]   I'm telling ya, Bill Murray
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:19.720]   on the cover of Vanity Fair this month.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.160]   See, I wanna read that article,
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:23.720]   but I don't wanna buy the whole magazine.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:25.520]   Texture.com, I don't have to worry about it anymore,
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.880]   I got 'em all.
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:30.200]   - So now I bought sheets and magazines in one show.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.520]   You didn't get a Drobo, oh you already got a Drobo.
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.840]   - I have a bunch of those.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.560]   - You know, as long as I'm spending your money,
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:39.840]   they updated the firmware on the Sony V7.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.200]   - Ah, the camera's so awesome.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.360]   - R2 to now do a compressed J, un-crressed raw.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.880]   So finally, there's nothing wrong with this camera.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.880]   - There's nothing wrong with this camera.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:50.480]   - Yeah, they're big photos.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.880]   Let's say 80 megabytes.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:53.240]   (laughs)
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:54.680]   Hey, cards are cheap.
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:55.760]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.920]   - And I should bench, well, you don't,
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.880]   I'll do a pick in a little bit.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:01.000]   Let's start with Andy and Naco, your pick of the week.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   - My pick is Sling TV.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.400]   I got, it's been out for a few months now.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.960]   Sling just set me up with like a cop account
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:13.160]   for limited cop accounts, so I can finally try it out.
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:14.120]   I'm liking it a lot.
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:17.040]   Now this is the service where you get cable channels
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.880]   without an actual cable subscription.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:24.800]   For 20 bucks a month, you get a basic package that contains,
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.480]   I'll be very selfish here.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:29.880]   It contains the only cable channels that I would really miss
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.200]   if I didn't, if I cut the cable.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.320]   So you got your food network, you got your food network,
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.400]   you got your TNT, you got your TBS, you got your lifetime.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.000]   So there you go, I got my project runway,
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.760]   I got my chopped, I got my cutthroat kitchen.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.040]   And you also get the Disney channel
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.000]   and a whole bunch of ESPN's and American movie classics.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.960]   And CNN and that's it stuff too.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:50.800]   For there, you can get add-on.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.320]   So for 15 bucks a month, you also get HBO.
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:56.400]   You can get sports packages, Spanish language packages,
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.800]   kids packages, again, looking selfishly for five bucks a month.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:03.360]   I can get a movie package that includes three epics channels
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.320]   which I don't really care about,
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.040]   plus Turner Classic Movies.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.600]   And so now for 25 bucks a month,
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.720]   you've got all, truly all the cable channels
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:12.440]   that I really care about.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.840]   What I like about it a lot is that,
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.320]   I also have a sling box,
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.920]   I think I also have a sling box upstairs connected
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:20.960]   to my cable box.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:25.720]   So I can tune into live cable wherever I am.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:28.440]   But this is a lot slicker, it's a lot faster,
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.760]   it's a lot more reliable.
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:33.560]   They have apps for Android, they have desktop apps for Mac,
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.200]   they have iOS apps.
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.160]   As a matter of fact, the other day,
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:42.240]   I was doing some work here at this desk on the iPad Pro
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.480]   and on the screen in which I'm looking at,
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:47.280]   the monitor for the show and for me right now,
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.680]   I had the Mac desktop app watching the Food Network
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:50.600]   'cause they were doing a marathon
[01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:52.200]   or something I wanted to see.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.800]   And beautiful HD, very, very stable,
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:58.520]   one of the most stable streaming apps that I've ever used.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:03.200]   The difficulty is that for now it doesn't have an Apple TV app.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.040]   I'm sure they haven't announced anything,
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:05.920]   I did ask them about it,
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.640]   they have nothing to announce at this time,
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.800]   but of course it would be silly to have an iOS app for iPad
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.920]   and iPhone and not have one for Apple TV.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.960]   Unfortunately, the iOS apps don't support AirPlay,
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.000]   so for now there really is no way
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.240]   if you have an Apple TV to get all this content
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.200]   on that screen, but it's really quite interesting.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.440]   It really just changed the math a lot.
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:31.040]   Now, the other difficulty is that it really is
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.600]   like getting a cable subscription to, say, the Food Network
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.320]   so that you can watch shows live, but it doesn't have a DVR.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.240]   Not only that, but each of these channels, of course,
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:47.120]   they have their own Android apps and their own iOS apps.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.120]   And so I watch a project runway
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:54.040]   through the lifetime app on my Apple TV
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:57.480]   so I can see whatever the whole past season,
[01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:02.640]   once I verify the, "Hey, yes, I'm a subscriber to this cable lineup,"
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:05.440]   you don't get access to those apps with a subscription to Slings.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:07.200]   So it's not as though you'll be able to download
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.920]   these individual apps separately
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.480]   and get all the benefits of those things.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.560]   But considering the price savings for a lot of people
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:15.800]   and considering that maybe you don't watch TV the same way you did
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:18.040]   10 years ago when you first signed up for cable,
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.440]   this might be a really, really good alternative.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:23.000]   And the other bonus for a lot of people
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.640]   is that if you haven't established credit history yet,
[01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:28.000]   there is no credit check, all you need is a credit card,
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.080]   and they'll just build to you, and that's it.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:32.880]   So I'm very, like I said, I'm very pleased with it.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.400]   I thought that it was gonna be sort of a,
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.600]   also ran sort of service, but they've built it up
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:41.000]   with a lot of extra channels that I really, really like.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.080]   They've got a good, broad selection here, and it works great.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:49.160]   So the question is whether I'm in my demo period ends
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.640]   if I actually sign up for this.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.200]   I hope not because I'm signed up for so many streaming services
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.600]   as it is, but it's good enough that it will actually provoke me
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:02.800]   to really sit down and do a full audit of how I watch TV,
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.120]   what I want, what I don't want,
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:09.120]   what I'm spending on the 40,000 different Fox News channels
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.920]   and the 30 Curling and Australian Rules football channels
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.800]   that I never, ever, ever watch.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.120]   And maybe I can save some money and get a service
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.400]   that I will actually like more.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:21.280]   - Sling TV.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.280]   I'm glad to get a review.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:24.440]   I've of course known about it, and I'm just curious.
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:25.680]   So good.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:27.320]   - Thank you, Andrew.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.200]   Renee Ritchie, your pick of the week.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.400]   - I have two quick picks.
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:33.120]   One is, one of the questions I got asked the most
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.320]   when the iPad Pro came out.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.760]   It's sort of like people rediscovered
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:41.040]   the split the side view multitasking in iOS 9,
[01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:42.960]   all of a sudden, because it's such a big screen.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:44.800]   And people were kind of upset that they couldn't do
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.760]   one Safari window next to another
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:48.560]   or one mail window next to another.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.840]   And the thing is for right now,
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.440]   it only works with two separate apps.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.920]   You open an app, you slide over another app,
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.600]   press the button and it turns into split view multitasking,
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:59.560]   two apps side by side, but two different apps.
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.480]   So there's an app called SideFari,
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:03.400]   which is a play on Safari,
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.480]   which is basically a Safari view controller.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:07.440]   So what you do is you launch Safari,
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:10.240]   you slide over, you bring inside Safari,
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.800]   and then you load stuff into that,
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.200]   and you have two Safari windows.
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.520]   - Two Safari's.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.000]   - That's really what you want.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.240]   If you want those two browser,
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.800]   it doesn't do mail, it doesn't do anything else
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.680]   that you might want to have side by side.
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.360]   But if you've just been upset,
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:26.720]   you couldn't do your two Safari windows side by side.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.400]   This will fill that gap for you.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:31.080]   So it's not a second Safari on there.
[01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.200]   It's just doing some mojo to get that.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.000]   - Yeah, it's usually a Safari view controller,
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:35.920]   which is actually pretty good,
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.560]   because Safari View Controller has all your saved passwords,
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:41.640]   it has access to all, if you're logged in in Safari,
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.880]   you'll be logged in in Safari View Controller.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.880]   So, and it doesn't have all the action capabilities
[01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:48.920]   that Safari does, but there's an action item
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:51.400]   that it gives you that you can use in other apps
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:52.880]   to send things to that window.
[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.880]   So you can target it too, which is nice.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:56.800]   - It's a clever little hack.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.720]   - And on the iPad Pro, it's really nice,
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.320]   because a lot of people really do want,
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:01.920]   they want to research something while they're writing
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:03.120]   in their CMS, for example.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:04.840]   - Right, yeah, perfect, yeah.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:06.360]   - So it's super useful.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.360]   The other app is Sketch Party TV.
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:11.160]   So if you're with the family for Thanksgiving
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.000]   and you want to play a game,
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.520]   it's almost like one of those TV game shows,
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.120]   but it uses iOS devices,
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:18.520]   and now there's an Apple TV native version as well.
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.240]   Previously, you'd use AirPlay for this,
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.000]   but it's sort of, I forget the name,
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:23.440]   but there was game shows where you draw a picture
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.480]   and try and guess the picture,
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:27.840]   and it's sort of in that tradition.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.760]   And obviously, they haven't updated the video yet,
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.440]   but now you just go to your Apple TV to the Apple TV App Store,
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.280]   you download it directly,
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.520]   and it's a fun way to, if you have a family
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.640]   with a lot of iOS devices,
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.800]   or you have the new Apple TV,
[01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:41.880]   it's just a fun way to get everybody involved
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:43.880]   and not sit by yourselves on your own little screen
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.080]   in that very sad Apple Christmas commercial.
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.520]   - Who doesn't have a family full of iOS devices?
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.920]   - I wish there was more of this,
[01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:54.160]   like there's that yoga app that lets you use your Apple watch
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:55.160]   and shows your heart,
[01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:57.800]   and people do have multiple devices now.
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.440]   - Yeah, like in my family, everyone has an iPhone,
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.160]   at least an iPhone, half of them have iPads,
[01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:04.800]   all of them have the new Apple TV now,
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:06.640]   and it's just being able to use them all together
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.360]   makes it, I think, more real world social.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:12.040]   - I wanna get this, that looks fun, drop party.
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:12.880]   - Yep.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:13.720]   - Really looks fun.
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:14.560]   - Sketch party TV.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.960]   - Sketch party TV.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:19.280]   - Alex Lindsay.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:22.560]   He's handing me his phone,
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:25.440]   so I can demo something oh so exciting.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.320]   - Oh, this is riveting.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:31.400]   It is the time remaining.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.760]   - Oh, it started.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.240]   (laughing)
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.080]   Wait, hold on, it's stopped.
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.520]   - What, how are you doing that?
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.960]   - No, anyway, so this is called podium pro.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:42.000]   We went through a lot of trouble to find something
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:43.360]   we can do easily. - This is for speakers.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.080]   - So if you're speakers, or if you have an event,
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.560]   or you're doing a show, or whatever,
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:48.120]   and your speakers wanna count down for--
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:49.440]   - Is there a rap button?
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.360]   - Yeah, I think there might be some message right here.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.600]   - Is there a shut up and get off the stage button?
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:55.800]   - We need that.
[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:56.640]   - I think this is--
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.400]   - Good idea, so you could throw a little message.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.400]   - There's a little message.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.040]   - Test underneath it.
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:01.880]   So this will work with you.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:02.720]   - Shut up, doofus.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:03.800]   - Yeah, yeah, see.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:06.080]   (laughing)
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.400]   - Sure.
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:08.560]   - Aw. - And so you need to--
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.840]   - Your fly is down.
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:11.000]   - Your fly is down.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.320]   - Yeah, so they--
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.160]   - Jerk ball.
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:14.000]   - Jerk ball.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.520]   - You have two iOS devices.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:17.360]   - So anyway, yeah, so two iOS devices,
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:19.680]   they see each other, they one broadcast to the other,
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.560]   you can run many of them, so you can have like,
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:23.680]   you know, so they can be a bunch of slaves
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:25.920]   that are all looking at a, it doesn't,
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.120]   we've tested it, we can't get it to work,
[01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.360]   like it doesn't like work over an IP,
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:30.480]   which is what we'd love to have,
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.960]   so we can put it in like another country.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:33.800]   - Right.
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:35.840]   - But in the same room or in a control room,
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:36.680]   it works really well.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:37.520]   They're on the same network,
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:38.960]   and they're using Bluetooth, I think,
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:39.960]   to talk to each other.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:42.840]   Or at least to sync to each other.
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:43.680]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:44.880]   - Anyway, but it's worked,
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.640]   we actually have been using it a lot,
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.560]   and it works great when you wanna have,
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:51.320]   you know, 'cause a lot of times
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.800]   you wanna start that countdown clock,
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:53.960]   and so if you wanna--
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:55.320]   - It'll be nice to have it.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:58.080]   - I, Apple Watch interface for this,
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:58.920]   that'd be kinda cool.
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.760]   - I don't know if it has one,
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.880]   but we use it a lot of times when you use it for it,
[01:35:01.880 --> 01:35:03.920]   iPad Mini's turn out to be a great size,
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:05.680]   that you just kinda shove somewhere,
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:07.080]   and have a countdown clock really quickly
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.200]   for them from to your forecast.
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:11.440]   - So it's called Jerkball?
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:13.360]   - It's called Jerkball, you know, exactly.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.200]   - No.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.040]   - No, it's podium pro.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.640]   - podium, how much, you know?
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.600]   Expensive, probably, 'cause it's a pro.
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:20.680]   - I don't think it was expensive, I don't think it was--
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.240]   - I want podium amateur.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.480]   - Yeah, yeah, they have a--
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.800]   They do have a, obviously a,
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.600]   a,
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:33.560]   - What's neat about this platform is it makes all of these,
[01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.000]   and these are relatively simple things,
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.240]   but they make some possible.
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.920]   - It's podium timer HD.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.760]   - podium timer HD.
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.640]   - Oh, sorry.
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:40.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.040]   - And it costs what, a dollar?
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:42.880]   - Two no.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:45.520]   - It's a dollar for podium timer HD,
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:46.840]   it's also--
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.680]   - The Pro versus the 2D.
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:49.560]   - The Pro is $199.
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:50.560]   - Yeah, $2.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.880]   - With $2 in F.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.080]   - It's two damn dollars.
[01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.920]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.560]   - Fresh metal included.
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:57.840]   - Nice.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:58.680]   It's very stylish.
[01:35:58.680 --> 01:35:59.520]   - That's where it went.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.360]   - Well, you got some--
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.280]   - There's some incredible pieces somewhere,
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:04.320]   but, and I think I did pay them.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.480]   I mean, it's a $2 to start playing with it,
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:08.280]   and then when you wanted to do something,
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.360]   or the remote control feature,
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:10.560]   if you, so if you wanna use it by yourself,
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.880]   it's $2, it's $5 if you wanna control other things,
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:14.720]   and that was fine.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.960]   So they got a bunch of bad reviews
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:19.040]   because they asked you for another five,
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:22.400]   a cappuccino to be able to remote control these,
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:26.640]   and that's just, it's got bad reviews because of that,
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:27.520]   and it's a good app.
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:31.040]   - I'm gonna pick something that cost the Alex,
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:32.240]   or used to cost Alex.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:33.240]   - Ooh.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.960]   - The Mac Fun PHUN Creative Kit 2016.
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:40.640]   The reason I'm mentioning this is it's on sale right now
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:43.200]   for 90 bucks for all of them.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:44.040]   - Aluded Chris Lee Cheep.
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.800]   - Yeah, and I use Tonality Pro,
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.640]   which is their black and white plug-in,
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:50.480]   which I really like,
[01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:52.720]   but there's a lot of stuff in the Creative Kit,
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:54.680]   but that's not what I'm here to plug,
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:56.640]   'cause when you get to Mac Fun,
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.800]   you should click Aurora HDR,
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:02.600]   Trey Radcliffe has released his own HDR software.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.960]   We've all been using, I think, Photomatics was kind of
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.440]   the choice, it was kind of ugly and clunky.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:09.440]   And of course Trey--
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.560]   - He's great. - For this good job with it.
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.400]   He's Trey.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:13.800]   It starts at $40, although they have other versions.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:17.000]   There's a pro version that gives you five licenses,
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.200]   and then you can also get training.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.200]   The pro version's 99, training's 129,
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.680]   but I think 40 bucks.
[01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.440]   It's great software,
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:26.520]   and a little disclaimer, Trey sent me a license to say,
[01:37:26.520 --> 01:37:29.320]   he said, "Hey, I got new softwares out."
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.720]   Now, we've talked before about HDR Alex,
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.960]   and I like you, I'm not a big fan of tone mapping,
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:37.640]   but it can do a lot of other stuff,
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:39.440]   including denoising,
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.920]   there's a structure, you can modify structure.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.040]   So depending on what you're looking for,
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:47.720]   and they have some great presets
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.120]   that give you a chance to really play
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.960]   with different looks.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:54.600]   - Great, go for the, if you really want this,
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.960]   painterly HDR, you can do that.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.280]   Not my favorite thing,
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.840]   but I think you can also make the same image
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:03.320]   really just be beautiful.
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:04.280]   - And you can really bring out,
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.640]   you're basically compressing a very high,
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:10.160]   you're taking a high dynamic range
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.040]   that you couldn't normally get in your camera
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:13.760]   and compressing all of those together.
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.880]   And I think that there's compressing
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:16.800]   the brightnesses together.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.080]   And so you can definitely get some,
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.560]   especially when you use it subtly,
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.360]   you can get some really great effects.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.520]   - And by the way, I'm just using architectures.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:24.360]   - Amazing.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.880]   - Yeah, he's not gonna do an ugly app.
[01:38:26.880 --> 01:38:28.800]   And the other thing it does that Photomatics does not do,
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.200]   it works with RAW when you buy the Pro version.
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:33.880]   And that's very important to me.
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.480]   I want it to work with RAW.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:38.040]   So look at all the different presets.
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.960]   There's basic architecture landscape, indoor dramatic,
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.680]   and Tre Radcliffe presets.
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.320]   He's got the baby in the corner preset
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.560]   that is just awesome.
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:49.400]   A little black truffle sawt
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:52.720]   or the endless hot shower preset.
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.160]   Tre is a creative fella.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:56.760]   I think you're gonna really like this.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:59.480]   And for $39.99, which is probably
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:01.640]   what most people would wanna get, pretty awesome.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.360]   If you wanna use RAW, you're gonna pay 100 bucks for it,
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.080]   which is still a very good deal.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:07.720]   - Can you upgrade from one to the other, I imagine?
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:08.560]   - Yeah.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.320]   And do while you're at Mac fun,
[01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:12.280]   take a look at the other Mac fun stuff.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.400]   The fact that that creative kit
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:19.400]   is under 100 bucks now is pretty astounding.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.680]   M-A-C-P-H-U-N.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:22.880]   - Do you like their plugins?
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:23.720]   - Yeah, they're great.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:26.920]   - You're a pro, I'm just a slobby amateur.
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:27.760]   - Great apps.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.840]   And I have the Aurora HDR and I paid for it.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:31.120]   - You did, there you go.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.760]   I'm not telling you anything you don't already know.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:33.600]   - It's awesome.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.600]   - I think Jeff Carlson has a book out
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.680]   on how to use it already.
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:36.520]   - Really?
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:37.360]   - Yeah, which was fast.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:39.160]   - Tre said he's been working on this for a year.
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.240]   So I guess those in the know knew already
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:46.000]   that you can go to Aurora HDR.com
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.320]   if you just want to learn about Aurora.
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.960]   But I think you should go to Macfun.com
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:52.400]   and find out about all the stuff, the creative kit.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:55.120]   I use Tonality Pro now as my kind of favorite black.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.800]   I used to use silver effects for the NIC package,
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:58.640]   which I still love.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.840]   - I use Tonality as much.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:01.120]   I still use the silver effects.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.600]   - Silver effects is the king, but Tonality is,
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.720]   again, it's that nice interface.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.560]   And of course Lightroom and Photoshop plugins
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.760]   and Aputure and all that stuff too.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.600]   So you get a lot of stuff.
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:16.680]   Intensify, Tonality,
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:20.040]   Snap Heel, Photo Studio.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.440]   - In a way, I have the NIC ones.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.560]   I have the Alien Skin ones.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:24.400]   I have the Mac fun.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.960]   I have way too many plugins.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:28.040]   Now I just have to take some pictures.
[01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:30.920]   - And I'll be ready to roll.
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:31.760]   - Exactly.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:34.160]   - I do like shooting HDRs,
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.160]   not for that big painterly effect,
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.800]   but just for the better dynamic range.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.640]   - You should get an eye or shoot it.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.680]   - You can see the detail in the dark as well as the sun.
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:41.760]   - The sky and the buildings.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.120]   - I like that.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.920]   But you control it, so that's nice.
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:47.080]   Anything else anybody wants to say,
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:47.920]   you know what we didn't do
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.000]   that I was gonna do was talk about Black Friday deals.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.600]   We were looking on iOS today
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:56.240]   and you can get an iPad for a hundred bucks off.
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:57.080]   I don't know,
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:59.600]   normally Apple really controls the channel.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:00.720]   I feel like this year,
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.040]   for the first time, Apple's offering
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:04.680]   some significantly deep discounts,
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:07.840]   or it looks like they will be able to find out on Friday.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.280]   But some of the other merchandisers like Best Buy
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.400]   are really, so shop around.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.520]   Normally it doesn't help to shop around for Apple stuff,
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.040]   but there's maybe some really big discounts out there.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.800]   - Wirecutter has a really good guide.
[01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:21.880]   - Oh, do that one, yes.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:25.920]   - Not only are they steering you towards good deals,
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.720]   but also informed by their review.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.840]   So it's not like they're gonna show you
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:34.680]   the 87 inch TV that costs $38 at Best Buy.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:36.040]   They're gonna show you like the one
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:37.440]   that you actually wanna buy,
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.840]   even if it's cost a little bit more.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:39.920]   - Actually, that's a great pick.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:40.760]   - It's gonna be great.
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:41.440]   - The Wirecutter's best deals,
[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:45.640]   and then follow the Wirecutter deals Twitter feed
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.560]   as they find more,
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:50.480]   but they've gone through like tens of thousands
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:52.760]   of Black Friday offers.
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:56.160]   More than 36,000 deals and they picked 223.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:00.080]   So this is a really great way to--
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.200]   - Is it like the next generation of consumer reports?
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:03.440]   - I love Wirecutter.
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:05.720]   They've done a great job.
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.560]   - They really have.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:08.960]   - And my lamb, Jacky Chang, Dan Frakes, awesome people.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:11.400]   - For so many things, like where there's,
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:14.400]   it's not so much where there's an objective truth
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:15.240]   to be found,
[01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:16.400]   I can't tell you them over times
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:18.400]   where I've just said I need a Shaver.
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:21.160]   Okay, what does Wirecutter or the Speedhome say?
[01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.160]   Great, this will all buy.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:23.680]   Don't care if it's just buy it.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:25.600]   - If you're really serious about a category,
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:27.200]   you're gonna do more research,
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:29.880]   but this is, a lot of, most people just want,
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:31.320]   tell me the one.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.680]   - Just tell me what to get.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:33.520]   - Well, yeah, I've got time.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.280]   That headlamp I was telling you about before the show,
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:39.960]   it was the first one of those I bought was again,
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:43.120]   I need a headlamp for doing walking like after dark.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.600]   I'm not passionate about headlamps,
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.440]   the way that I'm passionate about software
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:50.080]   or computer hardware.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.520]   But I know that they will have thought about this
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:55.560]   a lot longer and harder than from different angles
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.400]   than I will have.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.320]   And I'm confident with the Wirecutter's reputation
[01:42:58.320 --> 01:42:59.840]   of things I've bought from the past,
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.920]   that if I just buy this, it'll be fine.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:06.920]   Look at this, here's a 10% off a MacBook Pro, 15 inch.
[01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.800]   You just so rarely see these sales,
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.640]   I feel like this is an Amazon.
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:13.000]   I feel like Apple is, or B&H,
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.320]   I'm sorry, B&H is offering it for 10% off.
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:18.960]   I feel like Apple is, this year for the first time
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:20.560]   maybe really doing deep discounts
[01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:23.080]   and letting the channel do more than they,
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.520]   oh is this the one you got, the Solar 25?
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:26.360]   Oh, that's a floodlight.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.200]   - No, let's do that.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.040]   - You don't put that on your head.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.000]   - Black diamond I think.
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:29.840]   - Okay.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.320]   - Yeah, this is awesome.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.680]   Wirecutter's back up.
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:35.360]   - It also makes me feel good.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:38.040]   I lose my arrogance when I go to Wirecutter
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:41.440]   because I'll do my own evaluation of keyboards
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.520]   or fitness trackers and stuff like that.
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.920]   And then sometime later I'll check out Wirecutter.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:48.200]   Oh look, we agree, all right.
[01:43:48.200 --> 01:43:50.080]   - Yeah, I finally almost always agree
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.680]   that they really have done the homework
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:54.120]   and they have the right,
[01:43:54.120 --> 01:43:55.480]   it's more than doing the homework
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.840]   or doing the testing,
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:43:58.880]   it's they have the right point of view.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.880]   - So every view starts off with one paragraph saying,
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:06.440]   cut to the quick, here's the one we recommend.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.640]   And then the next are like 500 words of,
[01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:11.440]   here's who I am, here's why I have experienced with this.
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:15.280]   I've been a backpacker and threw hiker for the past 20 years
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:18.000]   and I did an eight day hike in darkness
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:19.880]   with eight of the finalists
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:21.760]   and that's how I determined this one.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.080]   It's like consumer reports, if consumer reports had taste
[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:26.160]   and they weren't just numbers one.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:28.240]   - You know, I think consumer reports is the wrong analogy.
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:30.280]   It's more like the whole earth catalog
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:33.760]   where it was very kind of personal.
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:36.160]   - Well, I like consumer reports
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:40.120]   because they are very, very strict about methodology
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.360]   but it means that they are like commander data,
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.600]   they don't understand that just because you have
[01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:46.960]   a line item on a clipboard that says,
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.320]   time how long it takes you to delete a file
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:50.760]   using only the keyboard,
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.560]   that doesn't mean that the Mac is a terrible,
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.800]   hard to use operating system.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:56.400]   You then filter this in through your own experience
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:01.400]   and allow your own life experience to inform your opinions.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.200]   Wirecutter will tell you, here's the methodology,
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.080]   here are the things that we think are important to find,
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:06.320]   here are the ones that have all the things
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.560]   that we think are important.
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:08.520]   And they're also willing to say,
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:09.600]   but if you don't have a lot of money,
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.320]   here's something to spend, here's something that's good
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:12.400]   but doesn't cost so much money.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.600]   Or if this one feature isn't important to you,
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:17.400]   then we would definitely go for this one instead.
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.200]   Like I said, I can't recommend them highly enough.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.040]   - And as long as we're spending money,
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:25.400]   I might mention that the Sony RX-1R2 came out today.
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:30.600]   - It's only $3,300 for a point and shoot,
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:33.840]   but it is the best point and shoot anyone's ever made.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.320]   - Well, there's that.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:36.560]   - I don't know if that's actually true,
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:40.920]   but it is a full frame sensor and nice size optics.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.280]   And then people have been waiting for this.
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:46.880]   So it's, I actually, I ordered it last night on B&A
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.920]   'cause I canceled it, I've fortunately I canceled it.
[01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.080]   - You stepped away. - Yeah, stepped away.
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:51.920]   That's a lot of money.
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:52.920]   - I don't really need it.
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:53.760]   - Since I didn't get that last one,
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.640]   see now I can get that one.
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.480]   You can get this though.
[01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:59.080]   This is kind of like having an A7R2 with just one lens,
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.600]   a 35 millimeter F2.
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:03.940]   It's pretty nice and small and compact.
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:08.080]   - Alex, I'm trying to, I'm trying to,
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:08.920]   I bought too many.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:10.480]   - This is mean of me.
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.640]   - I know, it's horrible.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:12.840]   - I'm really mean.
[01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:14.040]   That's a terrible thing to do.
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:15.920]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:17.520]   (laughing)
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:19.000]   - That's really walled across the room.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:22.440]   - Andy and I co Renee Richie, Alex Lindsey.
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:24.320]   I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:25.720]   Those of you in the United States,
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:28.280]   you've already had yours, Renee.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.120]   - Yes.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:30.040]   - We made a test of it for you.
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:30.880]   Turned out great.
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:31.720]   - Did it turn out great?
[01:46:31.720 --> 01:46:32.560]   Okay, good.
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:33.400]   Glad to know.
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:36.640]   I'll be, are you gonna Spatchcock?
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:37.480]   - We wanna what?
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.720]   (laughing)
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:42.720]   - I thought you'd be all up in the Spatchcock.
[01:46:42.720 --> 01:46:44.680]   - I didn't know I could do that in public.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.280]   - There's a new kind of turkey preparation.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:49.600]   - Oh no, I was gonna,
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:53.320]   here's the worst part is I was going to try again,
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.760]   the deep fat. - The deep fat.
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:55.760]   - I have not.
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:57.880]   - Did you have it done a great time?
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:46:59.480]   - But what I did is I ordered,
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:01.160]   I don't know if you saw my tweet,
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:03.160]   my Carly to ask me, she goes,
[01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:05.640]   can we just skip the big dinner and just go out?
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:07.240]   And I was like, I hate, I hate holidays.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.080]   The only thing that will make,
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:08.920]   - I'll make it hard when. - You're gonna have
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:09.760]   Chinese food like.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:12.040]   - No, no, so what I did is I ordered the whole foods box.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:12.880]   - Oh, that's not a bad way.
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:13.720]   - It was like a,
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.000]   - That's fine. - It's all pre-cooked.
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:15.840]   But that's my backup.
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.720]   So I'm gonna try to do the deep fat fry.
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:18.960]   But if I screw it up again,
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:20.440]   I just wanna make sure I had a turkey.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:25.440]   I would be, I'm gonna be making a turkey and a ham.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.800]   - For thanks, I'm gonna go to a lot of people to come over.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:29.800]   This is spatch cocking,
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:31.480]   you take the spine out of the turkey
[01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:33.400]   and you flatten it like roadkill.
[01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:35.160]   (laughing)
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:38.560]   - But it cooks, it really cooks evenly
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:39.720]   'cause it's flat.
[01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:41.160]   - Okay, that's my new experiment.
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:42.720]   - You should spatch cock. - I'm spatch cocking.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:45.880]   Actually, what you should do is spatch cock and deep fat.
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:46.720]   - Ooh. - We should,
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:47.720]   we should come to a spatch cock.
[01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:49.560]   - I have to have a spatch cock.
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.200]   I have a spatch cock.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.080]   I am soo-veating turkey for the first time.
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:53.920]   - Are you? - Are you?
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.840]   - Are you?
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:57.120]   - Yep, it's, I've got, I bought like a big,
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:00.280]   like a couple of like big, like just whole turkey breasts.
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:01.680]   They are dry brining in the fridge.
[01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:03.960]   - And what do you, and what are you,
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:06.200]   what are you using for the sous vide?
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.200]   - The anova. - Yep, I have one.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:09.240]   - That's the one right now.
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:10.760]   I ordered that one.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:13.320]   Remember that one that was, yep, nothing.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.760]   - Yeah, and the chon up?
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:15.600]   - I have mine.
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.480]   - Not the anova. - Not the anova.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.200]   - There's that one that would chill it
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:20.680]   and then he did. - Oh, yeah, right.
[01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:21.520]   - It was integrated.
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:22.920]   - It was like an aquarium.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:25.160]   - Yeah, then I could. - And then talk to your iPhone.
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:26.560]   It was a meat aquarium.
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:28.560]   Wonder what's happening with that?
[01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:30.000]   - It was a meat aquarium.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:31.560]   Where's my meat aquarium?
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:33.880]   - So many shows start that way.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:36.640]   (laughing)
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:39.320]   - That's part of Leo's performance writer.
