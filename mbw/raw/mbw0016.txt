[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.360]   This is MacBrigley, episode 16 for November 21, 2006.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.680]   Trick of a Tale.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:43.520]   It's time for MacBrigley.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.200]   Take off your shoes, loosen your trousers, drop your fly.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, we're all together in the same room.
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.200]   And we're having some fun now.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.120]   I am Leo Laporte.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.080]   And we actually are all in the same room.
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.080]   Scott Bourne to my left, the Bourne Supremacy.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.200]   Good to be here, Leo.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.120]   Good to have you finally show up.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.920]   Yeah, last time I was a cardboard cut-out.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.000]   We had a picture of you in your elf suit.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.240]   And we had you sitting at the edge of the table.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.440]   It was very cute.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.400]   We sort of bowed reverently to you.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.880]   That's right.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.840]   You said enjoy it because I'll never be there.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.120]   And I was-- once again, you've caught me in a lie.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.400]   Merlin Mann is also here from 43folders.com.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400]   Hey, Merlin.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.800]   Good evening.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.400]   How are you, Leo?
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.680]   In his audio shirt, you're wearing defunct car.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.600]   They're funk.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.560]   They're funk.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.480]   No, they're funk.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.040]   They're funk.
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.520]   But they're on the way to defunking.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.160]   Don't you think?
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.280]   What's the story with audio?
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.320]   What is the plan?
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.760]   I hear things.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.320]   People say that they're not, quote unquote, actively
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.640]   developed.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.960]   Seems they can't figure out what to do.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.720]   They didn't have--
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.480]   I think they have bought his stuff back.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.720]   That's all it is now.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.880]   So he can turn into--
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.600]   Which was nice of him.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.280]   I mean, basically, he said, you know, I understand.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.400]   We're not going anywhere.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.280]   So I'll give you the-- he hit the investors.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.040]   They're money back.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.540]   Yeah.
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.800]   On the other hand, he now has the freedom
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.760]   to do what he wants.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.120]   I love audio.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.360]   They get nothing but great to me.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.920]   Oh, I love Ev.
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.560]   I think Ev's brilliant.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.760]   I would love to have a copy of him on my shelf.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.120]   He's a delightful human being.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.080]   Good guy.
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.600]   Would you have him a dust cover out?
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.960]   I would keep him minting box.
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.200]   Minting box.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.800]   I have an Ev.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.400]   Me?
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.920]   I'm on my slender web entrepreneur shelf.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   That's a small number and shrinking rapidly.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.400]   Very small.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.720]   Alex Lindsey from Pixelcore.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.760]   Our host is here.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.200]   It is the Pixelcore studios we are broadcasting from.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.840]   Hello.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.840]   There it is.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.000]   Where does it come from?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You know, he never would be--
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.840]   He had to do it.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.600]   He's always there.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.120]   And on Steadicam and Banjo, Craig Siverson,
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.640]   the pod grunt who will not be heard on this episode.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.200]   Hi, Craig.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.840]   Hi, Craig.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.120]   He's also the video grunt.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.480]   And I guess today he's video grunting.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.440]   Be role provided by the video.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.880]   So what are we going to do with this video?
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.440]   I have no idea.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.000]   Craig just started shooting, and we just
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   figured we wouldn't kill him for potential marketing use.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.880]   Provery really were here all around.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.080]   It is true.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.880]   When we guys will get it out of the way, go ahead and Scott.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.560]   Well, it just so happens.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.800]   You know, we have this little system in case you're new to the show.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.400]   We have a delicious tag set up where Scott says,
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.360]   iPhone, iPhone, iPhone.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.720]   That's the system.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.120]   Did you--
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.920]   This is when we usually go and play pinball a lot more.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.320]   You just talked about the iPhone for a while.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.000]   You know, you hand off to me and then you badge.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.480]   Well, let me ask you.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.200]   Is there any news in the iPhone realm?
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.200]   There's going to be an iPhone.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.320]   There's going to be an iPhone.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.760]   We know that.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.600]   Can I finish?
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.200]   OK.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.520]   We have this system where-- and it was devised by Mr. Merlin Man,
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.800]   and he does systems for a living.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.360]   We have a delicious tag, MBW Ideas,
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.600]   and completely unsolicited by Moir.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.560]   Random human beings have posted some 100 instances of iPhone
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.040]   related information that is.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.520]   Why would that be?
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.600]   Because there's a drinking game.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   No, seriously.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.120]   OK.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.280]   They're priming the pump.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.720]   There's a drinking game every time Scott.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.840]   We're destroying the livers of young geek America.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.640]   And my particular take on it is that there
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.320]   are millions of people who are just like me,
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.520]   equally excited about the iPhone.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.520]   And here's the news.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.640]   There are not going to be just one iPhone.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640]   There's going to be two.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.280]   Now, what's weird about that is that was the original news.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.960]   Then somebody a few weeks ago, I
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.400]   think it was the time when these companies that's making them
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.920]   said we're making 12 million, but there's only one.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   And now, who says there's two again?
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.160]   You know, one of the rumors signs.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.520]   You know what?
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.000]   There may be the reading the old story, and they brought it back.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.320]   But here's my take on it.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.000]   The important news is that if there's going to be two,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.840]   there's at least one.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.720]   There's at least one.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.840]   That's all I care about.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.880]   I do have to admit, my trio is limping along,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.320]   and I am waiting.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.760]   Like I'm just not willing to upgrade it.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.920]   It's past its thing.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.160]   I'm just waiting to upgrade.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.000]   I think it's got a fetish point.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.720]   I can't see any reason why anybody would say, oh, an iPhone
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.840]   is somehow better in any way than that.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.560]   We don't know.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.440]   We don't have it yet.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.400]   But what we assume, and we've had this conversation three times,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.000]   is that we are going to get sync at least, which we have
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.680]   trouble getting.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.240]   Mark Space just released a missing sync three for Windows
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.840]   Mobile 5.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.640]   It works great with Windows Mobile 5.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.320]   This Windows Mobile 6 perfectly well to my Mac.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.400]   Here's a BlackBerry with Pocket Mac.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.000]   Sinks very well to my Mac.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.920]   You're just discussing Windows.
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.800]   This is the Mac show.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.440]   Well, as a BlackBerry, that's not Windows.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.600]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.200]   I don't know about those one specifically.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.240]   All I know is my trio has never successfully synced
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.600]   without causing trouble.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.640]   Let me just ask you, has anybody actually ever synced
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.040]   anything without causing trouble?
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.720]   No, that's the possibility of good syncing.
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.680]   That makes me excited.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.880]   Kenji Kato and John Foster both say they're in the background.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.320]   And even though I know this is going to lead to an immediate
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.280]   crash, the second the words have come out of my mouth,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.520]   I've never had a single problem syncing anything on my trio.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.040]   Where it doesn't duplicate--
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.360]   I'm talking movies.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.720]   How does it not duplicate?
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.280]   I call Alex and my friend Norman answers.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.480]   I have numbers moved around.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.480]   It's just normal.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.840]   It's just not happening in your address book.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.920]   Because I've had address book jumbles happen.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.840]   Well, you don't know why that abreast book jumble happened.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.040]   I think I've jumbled my words here.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.240]   I have to explain to somebody.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.840]   We've already--
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.480]   We've already--
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.240]   we've today already done 12 podcasts--
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.200]   12 video podcasts.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.800]   We're a little punchy.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.320]   13.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.960]   13.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.760]   And did some dancing around in front of a green screen
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.880]   as part of the video open.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.400]   This is-- we're preparing a new podcast, GMT Gear Media Tech.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.480]   So I am completely punchy.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.720]   Well, we'll just move on then to finish one last.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.000]   All right, one more thing.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.760]   The second iPhone is designed to be built around iChat,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.480]   according to the rumor site, macrumers.com.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.720]   I can't think of anything more depressing.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.960]   Mac McNN is citing this coming from American technology
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.560]   research senior analyst, Shah Wu.
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.880]   Yes, I--
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.400]   Shah Wu has never lied to us.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.440]   Shah Wu is also cited in my-- in my story.
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.960]   Shah Wu.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.460]   Shah Wu.
[00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.960]   Shah Wu.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.520]   I could put Google talk.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.800]   I could put iChat on any phone I got right now.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.680]   I mean, it's Jabber.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.560]   I don't know what makes that so spectacular.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.480]   Well, would it be a-- ah, video?
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.360]   Would it be a video phone?
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.400]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.160]   Ooh.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.000]   Now, see now I'm interested to combine Wi-Fi with video iChat.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.960]   Actually, I'm really into that.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.160]   But that might-- but now that might be intriguing.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.760]   Right.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.200]   So what we have here is the admission from you, Mr. LaPorte,
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.920]   that there might be some instance in which the iPhone
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.800]   would, to you, be interesting.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.320]   Maybe.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.280]   OK, well, that's all I need.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.320]   How about saying no?
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.040]   I buy a new phone every few months.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.800]   We're weeks away from Macworld.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.280]   As we are.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.600]   We record this show weeks away.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.520]   We should say that we are going to do a special edition
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.040]   of the show at 6 o'clock on the 8th of--
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.920]   At the Apple Store.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.000]   At the Apple Store.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.520]   So you all can come watch.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.240]   And I'll probably be standing there holding up a picture
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:32.800]   of the iPhone.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   Of the iPhone.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.280]   We're going to have some great people.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.760]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.320]   And Alex is going to use Gopher, it says, on that new phone.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.320]   I don't know what that means.
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.720]   It's Archie and Veronica.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.920]   You remember Gopher.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.680]   Even if as long as it runs--
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.160]   Archie and Veronica.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   Archie and Veronica.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.720]   There was Gopher, Archie and Veronica.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.220]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.720]   That's all you needed.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.880]   That was it.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.680]   I don't even know what Gopher is.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.320]   Oh, come on.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.720]   That's crazy talk.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.480]   It was before the way of the desert.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:56.960]   Not all the way.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.760]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.440]   There's been also been some speculation
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.840]   about the form factor.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.600]   There's been some rumors that it is going to be--
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.080]   Banana.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.080]   Banana?
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.720]   That's a safe word.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.280]   That's a scary word.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.440]   You're not related to our safe word.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.040]   It's a banana form factor.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.120]   No, it's not.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.120]   It's a banana form factor.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.240]   So it'll be curvy?
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.160]   I'm being assaulted.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.640]   No, in terms of long and skinny.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.560]   And curvy.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.080]   Maybe curvy.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.520]   Have you ever seen a long skinny straight banana?
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.880]   Actually, I have.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.760]   We won't talk about it here, though.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.360]   That Vancouver's a swing in town.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.760]   I'm going to tell you.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.320]   You are correct.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.200]   All right, so exciting.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.560]   That's the most important news of the night.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.640]   It's not news.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.520]   We've been saying this for six months.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.440]   No, it's the second phone news.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.400]   That's the point--
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.320]   I want to point where we should be seeing people sending out
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.440]   these phony, bloney, fake mock-ups of what it looks like.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.120]   I've gotten old.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.120]   And we've already played.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.920]   No, we're totally at that point.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   We're beyond that point.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.680]   That's the irony.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.440]   OK, we should--
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.160]   I think a moratorium on iPhone news until actually something--
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.400]   Now, we actually have an eye.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.640]   Let's not get crazy here.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.800]   A moratorium for this show.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.200]   Merlin, man, what's your big story of the week?
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.640]   Oh, God, what is my big story of the week?
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.600]   I've just been browsing through.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.400]   This is one I got off a dig that--
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.160]   I don't know if you know about this guy on Fox News
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.200]   named Bill O'Reilly.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.920]   But I didn't actually see this.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.040]   But apparently Bill O'Reilly had a tirade.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.840]   I really don't want to get in trouble with Bill O'Reilly.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.400]   Did you mean Bill O'Reilly?
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.280]   I guess that's what I mean.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.240]   That's how you get in trouble with him.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:24.160]   He went-- this is actually coming from Viadig on ThinkProgress.org.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.080]   The quote from Bill O'Reilly is, I don't know if an iPod.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.600]   I would never wear an iPod.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.800]   If this is your primary focus in life, the machines,
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.480]   it's going to have a staggeringly negative effect
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.400]   all of this on America.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.920]   He goes on to say, I really fear--
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:34.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.120]   Wear an iPod?
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.960]   Wear an iPod.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   That's right.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.040]   You can't talk to these geeks, he says.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.120]   I mean, you can carry on a conversation with them.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.360]   I really fear for the United States,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.160]   because believe me, the jihadist, they're not
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.080]   playing the video games.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.960]   They're killing real people over there.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.240]   Well, some jihadists are, because Al Jazeera is using Macs.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.240]   Right.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.040]   This is a nice segue.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.760]   Not that they're jihadists in the least.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.720]   But--
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.560]   No, they picked up evidently.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.280]   And I don't think this was a press release from Apple.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.600]   For immediate release.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   I think--
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   No, they're--
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   No, the--
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.040]   I guess they have picked up Al Jazeera--
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.880]   A convergence for you, young man.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.400]   This was from one of their Apple resellers,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.920]   I think, the Arab Business Machine Limited.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.640]   Anyway, they sold 41 MacBook Pros,
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.800]   70 terabytes of Apple storage, 10 Apple X-Serves, 17--
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.680]   Heavy newsroom.
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.120]   Yeah, 14 Apple X-N software licenses and 12 Power Mac G5
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.360]   quads to just crazy amounts.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.600]   This is really like--
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.480]   A lot of the laptops, I guess, are for the reporters
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.480]   to be doing there on editing and stuff like that.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.720]   And this is just becoming a standard issue.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.560]   I do have to say--
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.200]   I feel Riley knew about this when he was--
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.440]   Probably.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.040]   But I do have to say, by the way, I guess the first five
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.240]   minutes of Al Jazeera is somewhere online.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.000]   I don't know what it was.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.600]   But I tuned in to five minutes of Al Jazeera.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.280]   And it's actually marked for the discussion.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.320]   I know, I know, I know, I know, I'm marked as a discussion.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.680]   I got to say, the production values were very high.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.200]   They were.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.680]   It was--
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.680]   And the top half of the world,
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.040]   are you like, "Oh, Kerry, is that correct?"
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:16.880]   I don't know.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.160]   No American cable network.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.720]   I think if Al Jazeera was smart, they'd be putting it online.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.640]   You know, just let people--
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:22.560]   But it's not--
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560]   But I mean, it's not--
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.640]   I haven't followed the story closely,
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.840]   but it's not the same--
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.000]   it's precisely the same thing as the Al Jazeera that we're
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.800]   more familiar with.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   No, it's a whole English--
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.480]   It's not translated.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.160]   It's a whole different division that's just giving you Al Jazeera's
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.960]   take on world news and--
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.280]   Radio free Al Jazeera?
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.320]   Yeah, which by the way--
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.800]   The voice of Al Jazeera?
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.600]   It's something like that.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.200]   I don't know.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.440]   But it's interesting.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:48.680]   I-- the choice of news and where--
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:51.200]   You know, they have like reporters in the Sudan, in Iran,
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.280]   and all these places that we don't really see reporters,
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   really, because they get shot.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.160]   Most Americans-- I think--
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.320]   I don't want to pick potshots here,
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.120]   but I live in San Francisco, I'm allowed to have these kinds
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.120]   of opinions.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.560]   Americans would watch BBC news on BBC America.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.800]   It's such a different take on practically everything.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.960]   From what-- we've grown so accustomed to the kind of stuff
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.600]   that gets shoveled around on local news.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.040]   Oh, I agree.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.760]   And you watch something like BBC, and it is really substantial.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:14.960]   We don't have very good internationals.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.400]   It's substantial.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   I was watching CNN International.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.240]   It's 10 times better than CNN US, 10 times better.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.840]   So we seem to like sensational news, frankly,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.800]   in this country.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.040]   In tiny, tiny bites.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.640]   Quick and sensational.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:34.080]   And speaking of which, did you see that Britney Spears dumped
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.840]   her husband, K-Fed, via SMS message?
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.400]   And then he is promising to sell their sex tape.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.680]   And she is threatening to put it out herself
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.080]   so that we can make anything off it.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.600]   But we do prefer to take the high tone approach.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.280]   And the question we have, of course, here
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.880]   is, will it be on QuickTime?
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.120]   Will K-Fed choose--
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.280]   How will they use H.264 MP4?
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.040]   We talked about this on net at night,
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.160]   but actually, Britney removed K-Fed from her top 12 favorites
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.040]   list on MySpace.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.240]   So it's over.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.000]   At that point, times it is over.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   FedEx.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.920]   That's right.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:11.440]   It's over.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.800]   Well, there's a more important story, I think, than Britney.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.760]   And that is that Apple's stock fellows
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.440]   is at an all-time hot.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:17.920]   Wow.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.640]   So is Google's.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.200]   Google just passed 500?
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.280]   Broke 500.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.180]   The difference would be the earnings to price ratios
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.320]   are somewhat different in those.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:27.820]   Really?
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.240]   What is the PDE for Apple?
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.120]   It's reasonable, and the one for Google is outrageous.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.720]   So let's just look at it like that.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.160]   And I think this big stock jump shows
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.000]   that the faith in the company, even after the stock options
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.360]   scandal, continues to grow.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.640]   That's what Alex has been saying.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.280]   I was just going to keep on going.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.800]   I think that I really feel like Apple--
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.680]   I still feel like they're just getting their wits about them.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.040]   Since Steve came back.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.400]   Well, no, but I think Apple basically spent 10 years
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.400]   going backwards.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.320]   I mean, literally from the mid '80s to mid '90s.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.760]   It was poorly, poorly.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.440]   Poorly, spindler years and the Gilameleo years were not--
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.880]   Just a waste of time.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.240]   Although--
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.440]   And they lost a lot of ground.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.440]   You ask Woz.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.720]   And I don't know if this is loyalty to Emilia or what,
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.760]   but you ask Woz.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.120]   And he says, the turnaround began with Gilameleo.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.760]   I don't believe that.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.040]   Well, although Emilia was the guy who
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.320]   approved the next purchase, which brought Apple--
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.040]   OK, well, it began with it--
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.440]   It began with it because they buy it on next.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.880]   Well, he believes that many of the turnaround moves
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.960]   were actually implemented first by Gilameleo.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.560]   I don't know.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.720]   It was just such a mess.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.920]   I mean, if you could remember what you ordered to buy.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.520]   When jobs arrived, they were still licensing
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.120]   Macintosh to third party companies.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.000]   First thing he does is pull a plug.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.800]   Part of that is that this is--
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.160]   Anyway, you know it and you can say it.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.160]   No one knows who you are.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.280]   All right, there we go.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.680]   So I mean, there are rumors that a lot of this
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.840]   had to do with the fact that over at Motorola, you know,
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:01.200]   you had G3 and G4.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.920]   And while they were developing these G4s,
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.400]   the idea is we give the cheap laptop chips, the G3s,
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.200]   to Motorola and to power computing.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.960]   And we give the big G4s to--
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.480]   we're going to keep those for high margin sales.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.880]   And as they were building them up,
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.640]   the engineers were showing-- when
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   they were doing their presentations,
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.200]   they were showing how we're going to put all this extra RAM,
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:25.400]   dedicated to the chip, the L2 RAM, dedicated to the G3 chip.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   And what happened was that suddenly the G3 chip
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.160]   was going to be a lot faster than the G4.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.640]   And that's what happened.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.560]   You know, the 603.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.160]   It was 603 with that back then.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.280]   But when we made a G3-- remember those laptops that came out
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.200]   that were faster than a lot of our towers?
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.600]   Wow.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.520]   And what happened was is that all these guys that
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.920]   were getting these secondary computers
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.000]   were about to release.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.720]   When jobs came in, they were about to release computers
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.920]   that were going to be much faster and cheaper than what
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   Apple was releasing.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.600]   If jobs hadn't bulldozed-- I mean, the rumor is there was--
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.080]   So it wasn't really-- they didn't want to license.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.480]   They were actually going to eat--
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.160]   Apple would have been gone in three to six months.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.720]   I mean, it would have been poof.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.280]   I mean, they weren't making enough money.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.240]   That actually makes sense.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.320]   Because I remember speaking to Jobs before he went back to Apple.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.360]   And he said, we should have licensed the Macintosh
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.480]   operating system back when Windows was still 3.0.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.480]   That was our opportunity to really become the next Microsoft.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.600]   He believed in licensing.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.760]   So it wasn't that he was against licensing per se.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.160]   He was just afraid of these companies making a better
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.400]   computer.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.760]   And that's what was about to happen when they killed it off.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.080]   Was Apple ever licensed OS 10?
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.920]   I keep saying, you know, Leopard has now been pulling--
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.560]   I don't think so.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.440]   --to PCs, to beige boxes.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.120]   You know, they're having a hard time preventing it.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.960]   Well, it's been pirated, which means that every update is
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:44.400]   going to be just to break it every single time.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.880]   So someone who's really committed to having OS--
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.680]   who wants to have Leopard running on with the hardware
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.040]   address.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.400]   I think this is in the back pocket.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.840]   Jobs-- it's the scorched earth last final solution.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.440]   If things don't go well for Apple,
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.240]   that's when he breaks glass in case of emergency.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.920]   And all of a sudden releases OS 10.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:04.720]   He doesn't do it.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.680]   As long as the hardware business remains--
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.680]   But the hardware doesn't do it.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.440]   --keeps on getting bigger.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.440]   So I don't see how they do that anytime soon.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.320]   Because if that's what they're measuring it by,
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.000]   it keeps on-- I mean, it's grown faster over the last year
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.880]   than it has in maybe a decade.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.600]   And so--
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.480]   That's very profitable.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.840]   Yeah, and the stock market will attest.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.200]   Well, I think what you just said, Leo,
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.400]   is actually very accurate.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.160]   I don't see him ever doing it unless they have to.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.120]   And when they do, it'll be like an electromagnetic pulse
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:33.800]   kind of thing.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.680]   And it'll be big.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   But what about this?
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.720]   Now, nobody said this.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.320]   But there is a natural lifecycle to an operating system.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.600]   OS 10 was the new kid on the block.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.000]   Windows was kind of getting old and shaggy.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.040]   Well, now there's a new Windows five years later.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.760]   And Vista, what is the strategy following up OS 10?
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.600]   Is it just leopard and then Puma and then Cougar?
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.960]   Well, there's only four cats left.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.040]   They've trademarked them all.
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.000]   Well, and they've said that they're
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.840]   going to slow down a little bit on the amount of--
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.640]   But is it always going to be OS 10 looking forward?
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:09.880]   Or are they working on a new operating system?
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.040]   I would be the first time in years that they're not.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.000]   We're not really working on a new operating system now.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.680]   I mean, we're working on an operating system that's 30 years
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.200]   old.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   I mean, it's Unix.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.880]   It's Unix.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.280]   And so we're not really working on a new operating system.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.400]   We're working on one that's been proven to work for a long,
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.160]   long time.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.000]   In the way that Apple does business.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.760]   Because it's the first--
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.920]   Microsoft keeps redoing Windows.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.440]   The crystals get it right one day, too.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.200]   But does-- so Apple doesn't need to redo OS 10?
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.960]   Well, the infrastructure, I think they're probably going
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.560]   to sit on-- my guess is they'll sit on Unix for at least
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:41.320]   another decade.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   You know, I would be surprised.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   20, 38.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.640]   And the whole thing breaks.
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.560]   But I think that we have another decade of at least Unix.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.320]   I think that--
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.120]   Isn't there something to be gained by just continuing
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:51.960]   to refine what they've got?
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.520]   Maybe.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.080]   And to add features--
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:55.000]   There's no need.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.480]   Well, I mean, to add solid features to what's in place.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.520]   There's no need to change.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.160]   Well, I mean, because I mean, one of my windows became
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.160]   Windows was by having a really solid, installed base
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.680]   and not upsetting the Apple card.
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.600]   And that's one thing Apple seems that they'll have to face
[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.920]   at some point is you can't completely turn things upside
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.640]   down because of the installed base issues.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.160]   But--
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.280]   But Apple's been much more willing to do that.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.920]   But now they no longer need to.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.200]   We've been able to do that in hardware.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.800]   But you have to say they brought everybody along with Rosetta.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.840]   They've done a very good job, actually, much better
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.480]   than I anticipated of moving into.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.240]   Well, I think they've been working on new operating systems.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.440]   The problem is is that the people that are involved
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.440]   keep ending up in the river because they talk to somebody
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.480]   and they never get far enough along to think about it
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.160]   or at least date.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.720]   So what do they do with the iPhone?
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.320]   What operating system is the iPhone run on?
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.360]   I have an acclude.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.480]   Do they license it as they did the iPod on the same?
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.720]   They did not write the iPod.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.720]   The other thing is-- and I don't know this for sure,
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.600]   but I think some of the iPod software has a lot more in it.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.240]   I mean, the chip that sits inside of an iPod
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.600]   is a lot more powerful than just running what it runs.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.520]   So I don't think that they--
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.720]   I think there's a lot in that software that's being used
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.320]   to be more iPod than phone.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.280]   I think that it runs like an iPod.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.240]   It just happens to have some way to dial and so on and so forth.
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   I think the iPod operating system in itself
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.240]   can run the phone on its own.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.720]   A lot of the rumors have referred
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.760]   to the musical side of this phone.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.800]   So that would follow up with what Alex is saying.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.640]   They've talked about a iTunes capable phone more often
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.360]   than they've talked about.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.800]   I have to say now, as much as I like the Zoom when it first
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.680]   came out now that it's out and I've played with it,
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.960]   there's a lot to dislike, including the copy protection,
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.000]   the fact that they're paying money to the universe and so forth.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   But one thing I do like--
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.640]   and I've never had this experience before--
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.920]   is the notion of a subscription music library.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.480]   You know iTunes, you pay a buck a song and that's it.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.360]   But with a Zoom store, you can do that.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.760]   But you can also pay a subscription fee.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.040]   And anything in the store, it was great.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.480]   I dragged it onto my Zoom.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.360]   Kind of like Rapsody?
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.160]   You fill it up all you can eat.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:54.520]   Really?
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:55.760]   It's a subscription service.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.640]   No, it seems that Apple is very much against that, though.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.280]   I know they are.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.560]   And I wonder why, because I have to say,
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.800]   having now had that experience, I pooped it for a long time.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.800]   It's actually a great experience.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.440]   You just copy it whenever you're in Rapsody.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.960]   I mean, until I get rid of my Windows box a few years back,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.000]   I mean, I was using Rapsody up to the second I shut it off.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.520]   I would love to have that on a Mac.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.640]   But I think Rapsody in particular is heavily based on IE.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.080]   At least the Mac--
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.240]   Yeah, it's always been Windows is Playful's for sure.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.680]   And you know, you need something like Playful's for sure
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.080]   to do that.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.440]   That's kind of the irony is that Microsoft
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.160]   developed this Playful's for sure, which--
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.800]   I mean, they're banning.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.160]   Well, it means a portable device can check phone home
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.800]   periodically to make sure it's still licensed.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.840]   If you don't pay your monthly fee, all of the songs disappear.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.480]   Yeah, ironically, they develop that.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.000]   They use it.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.080]   A lot of people-- Yahoo!
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.320]   Music Store uses, MSSN's own store uses it.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.920]   And then the Zoom doesn't use it.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.440]   There's a whole new Zoom marketplace.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.720]   The Zoom marketplace looks so much like iTunes.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.520]   It's very iTunes-like with this one exception.
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:52.760]   You know, they have iTunes-style playlists.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:54.840]   You know, the mixes, celebrity mixes,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.920]   or they'll have hip hop 1992 to 1994, stuff like that.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.200]   You take that playlist, you drag it over to your Zoom.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.640]   It downloads all the music, puts it on your Zoom,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.960]   because you're paying that monthly fee.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.480]   There is something to be said for that.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.240]   I actually-- I have to admit that, especially
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.400]   if they move the value of the songs that I was downloading up.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:19.720]   So for instance, if I could download a 192 or 256 level--
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.920]   I don't think people care about that.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.320]   You care.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.040]   No, no, no, I care about it.
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.240]   But here's the deal.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.440]   If I could pay a subscription and get 128,
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.320]   and then if I really want-- I really want this sign--
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:28.880]   Buy a high quality one.
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.400]   I'm going to buy a higher quality one,
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.440]   and it's going to cost--
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.520]   you know, that's the trade off, and I get to keep it,
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.400]   and it's higher quality.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.680]   It's really like-- you could market it as quote unquote,
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.360]   it's CD quality.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.200]   Oh, it would be.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.360]   Yeah, it would be.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.160]   And so if I had those choices where I can just
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.760]   be constantly grabbing this wash,
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.640]   I'd be happy to pay $20 a month to have--
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.160]   What would you do?
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:49.880]   So 20, is that the--
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.280]   For me?
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:50.960]   $20 a month.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.920]   Yeah, I'll use it for a while.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.840]   It's $5 a month.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.240]   And I'd be happy to pay $20.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.880]   Well, I use a lot of music.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:59.560]   Wait, I guess after the Napster stuff started catching on
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.880]   whatever one of that was, $99,000.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:05.040]   I mean, I immediately got really interested in all kinds
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.960]   of flavors of this.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.880]   I mean, personally, I've always disagreed with the--
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.200]   at one time, conventional wisdom
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.320]   that this was turning America into a nation of thieves.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.800]   I think what it turned America into
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.400]   was a nation of people who wanted immediate gratification
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.560]   at a reasonable price.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.440]   And who loved music again?
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.600]   And I saw it rewakened my musical interests.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.720]   And at the time, I was doing cold fusion development,
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.920]   so I needed a PC.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.240]   And I would sit there and listen.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.960]   You needed a drug.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.840]   I would sit there and listen to--
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.560]   I would sit there and listen to Rhapsody all day,
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.120]   just stream it through the house.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.920]   Well, this is the same thing as if you could put it on a point.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.240]   And the other one with them was E-Music.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.520]   And E-Music kind of ate the booger,
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.760]   because they used to have an amazing system.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.680]   The booger?
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.320]   Yes, they asked--
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.560]   Did you just say ate the booger?
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.760]   They just like that football player.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.120]   What did you do to see that YouTube video?
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.680]   E-Music had a thing that was all
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.480]   you can eat for something like, what was it?
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.520]   $15, $20 a month.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.320]   Anybody remember?
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.160]   And you could download Unlimited MP3s for $15.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.400]   And then they changed it.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.720]   So I got to break in here, because I
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.560]   heard there was just tons of research from people saying,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:03.800]   we want to own our music.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.040]   And everyone talking about all these things being eaten.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.000]   I felt that way too.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:08.640]   I did too.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:10.680]   Until I used a subscription service, which is--
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.320]   by the way, the first time I used it was yesterday
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.440]   when I got this soon.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.800]   And I'm not merely listening on the computer,
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.960]   but even with a portable device.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.840]   The idea of being able to fill your portable device right
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.920]   there with anything you want, because you paid the $15 or $20
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.880]   a month is very attractive.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.840]   Well, and I think that also, especially when
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.040]   you're dealing with more niche markets,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.640]   where you're kind of exploring.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   It's really, really great.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.440]   If you're listening to international music or house
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:34.440]   music--
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.680]   It's all great for first time users,
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.840]   because you sit down.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.080]   You're not going to fill an iPod in one day, one month,
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.680]   maybe even one year at 99 cents a song.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.160]   You can, on a subscription device.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.600]   I have a 30 gig Zoom.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.440]   I feel at least half of it in about half an hour
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.200]   just by dragging over playlists.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.480]   Well, I mean, not only is--
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.160]   I don't think there's not any--
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.160]   it's just no chance Apple's going to do this.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:57.920]   They're working more towards trying--
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.880]   They're going to try to force you to buy albums now.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.160]   That's the new trend.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.200]   They're changing the way iTunes pricing works.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:03.680]   And they're going to--
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   I think that's the record companies.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.880]   I have to do say that.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.040]   One thing about this subscription is, for instance,
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.640]   they have a Paul Simon collection.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.800]   I love Paul Simon.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.920]   All of his songs, great.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.400]   And if I don't like one, I could just drag it off.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.360]   Doesn't matter.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.320]   Except you open it up and it says, not available, not available,
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.240]   not available.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.360]   The record companies are putting license restrictions,
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.320]   saying, no, sorry, you're going to buy this one.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.400]   That's the partial album.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.360]   And so now it's not just partial album.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.360]   It's also for subscriptions.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.440]   You can't use the subscription feature on this song.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.600]   Coda Chrome, you have to buy.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.600]   Apple is moving towards doing this in such a way that, first
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.400]   of all, is from an encouraging standpoint.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.440]   I'm assuming later on, it'll be more heavy handed.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.080]   Now they're saying, if you bought the single--
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.000]   --and you've always done that, though.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.440]   Well, but now they're getting pretty vocal about reminding
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.160]   you of it.
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.160]   And I've always been some things you
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.400]   had to buy the whole album.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.120]   And see, for me, that's where this model breaks down.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.680]   Because see, the whole reason I got attracted
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.120]   to the iTunes thing was--
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:55.920]   Is a la carte.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.480]   I wanted to pick the three songs on the album I really like.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.200]   But of course, that's just chewing up the music industry.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.720]   That's why Metallica didn't want to be iTunes for years.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.960]   They say we are artists who create albums, not single.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.240]   Live in the real world, dudes.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:10.560]   Do something that works for everybody or forget about it.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.480]   I mean, I think that's why people stole Metallica music.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.760]   It boils down to, though, if you make bad stuff and it sucks,
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:17.640]   no one's going to want it.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.960]   And you shouldn't be able to--
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.480]   They're treating everybody like it's a cell phone company
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.520]   where you can force people to--
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.960]   Well, let's say you--
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.840]   I want to say one thing about that.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.560]   One is on one side, I used to work--
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.200]   working for Sony, we used to know what you needed was three
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.600]   good songs, and you'd sell the album.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.720]   So you'd release three good singles, and you'd sell the album.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.600]   And the rest of it, oftentimes, was really bad.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.720]   What about a Sergeant Pepper's release concept?
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.560]   Or a trick of the tale, or do you start from Genesis?
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.960]   Like Genesis?
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   Wow.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   Anyway, so--
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.760]   But you look at it like--
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.160]   You just had a moment, that was--
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.040]   Totally having a selling England by the Poundface.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:54.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.800]   So--
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:56.800]   Let's go to each other's eyes.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.920]   I'm a little scared.
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.440]   Merlin and I are going out by the internet.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.800]   Maybe it's better if we do this over Skype, Leo.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:02.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.920]   So you know why I said I will never come here.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.720]   Suddenly, Alex seems so dreamy.
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.360]   He likes Peter Gabriel, too.
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:12.360]   So it comes in--
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.520]   But it sounds.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.160]   Any kind of an album where you--
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.080]   But a trick of a tale, for instance, is an experience.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.120]   Or an English settlement by XDC is an experience.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.880]   It's not one single that--
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.960]   We made this record.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.480]   We were thinking of it as an entire concept.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.120]   Not just one song, but a whole bunch of songs.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.160]   And because we were bloody drunk, we knew none of them were any good.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.000]   And now it needs bloody screams.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   But not putting a two second break in between, see?
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.040]   We made one long side, so that you'd have to listen to how bloody things.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.240]   Now we figured that if you just do this the whole thing,
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.200]   you might like it by the end, especially if you're drinking enough beer.
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   He can once again, through house of terrible British accents.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.160]   All the way.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.520]   All right, that was enough of that.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:56.480]   Boy, oh boy.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.720]   4,000 iPods just went fast for--
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.080]   No, no, I have a--
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.600]   That was even the commercial.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.920]   So you got your Zoom.
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:05.800]   You got your marketplace.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:06.440]   You go in.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.880]   You put down your how much a month for this--
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.080]   I don't know, actually, because Microsoft sent me a two weeks free.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.840]   But well, it's about to go up because it's universal, whatever.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:16.160]   Put it down so how does this-- and again, I'm
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.000]   going to talk to my butt about this because I don't really understand this.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.760]   I'm thinking probably 15 to 20 bucks a month.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.920]   OK, so but their whole model of the whole marketplace deal
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.640]   is about this whole spreading music, getting people.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.480]   So the idea is you fill your Zoom with the--
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.320]   yeah, with the bajillion songs, you give it to a kid on the subway.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.320]   And now the virus has passed, so to speak.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.640]   Welcome to the social, dude.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.160]   OK.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.640]   Great.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.160]   Let's try that way.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.120]   It's the social--
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.240]   --and no one's goshia is awake.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.640]   Yeah, so welcome to the way--
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.560]   Because that figure into it, though, in terms of just a difference in strategy.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.520]   I mean, because that's--
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.360]   Well, I'm sure the record companies like that, right?
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.720]   Although the sharing is ridiculous.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.240]   I mean, I have to say Microsoft really botched.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.960]   As soon as you start playing it, that counts as a play.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.120]   Yeah, they botched that.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.280]   Three plays or three days.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:57.800]   And that's just--
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.360]   That's pretty weak.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.760]   I think probably the label's kind of insist on that.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.840]   This is a device designed by the record labels, clearly.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.320]   Well, the problem is, in order to share it, you've
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.600]   got to find somebody else with a Zoom.
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.240]   And all these people are--
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.720]   That's what I thought--
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.280]   --and aren't going to care.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.680]   Well, and I think the problem that--
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.440]   this is the classic difference between Apple and Microsoft is always--
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.920]   that Apple always goes bottom up from the consumer,
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.880]   and Microsoft always goes top down from the corporate.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.400]   And that's why they have all--
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.280]   Oh, Apple's changing.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.480]   You know Steve Jobs is absolutely talking with the record companies
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:31.160]   and appeasing them and trying to keep them happy.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.800]   I mean, he's managed-- he was able to get some good deals,
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.480]   because everybody said, well, it's just Apple.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.040]   It's just an iPod.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.200]   How bad could it be if the--
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.120]   How many songs will people actually buy?
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:42.640]   But now--
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:44.440]   I think you're actually going to buy these things.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.480]   But now that they're going back to negotiate, even universal
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:49.840]   said, well, this is going forward,
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.840]   we really want them to pay for the--
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.280]   give us a royalty for per device.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.120]   You were at the Zoom launch, weren't you, Scott?
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:55.920]   Yes, I was.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:57.760]   And they asked you to bring your iPod.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.080]   We're not going to talk about giving those details.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:02.160]   But let's just put it like this.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.000]   He doesn't want to--
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.120]   Were you in Redmond?
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.620]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.280]   There's-- I live in Seattle.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:10.640]   And there's a slightly less than enthusiastic response.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.680]   It wasn't exactly an SRO type event.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.180]   OK?
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.840]   To be good.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.120]   All I can say is that the buzz around the hot dog vendor
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   outside Macworld is about four times better
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.480]   than what they had managed to achieve.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.200]   It kind of kills me, because I think in many ways,
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:26.960]   the Zoom is a good idea.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.120]   And as I said, there's things like the Zoom marketplace
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.680]   that made me rethink how I'd like iTunes to operate.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.480]   I walked up and I said, so is this the Zoom launch party?
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.240]   And there was like three guys going, we kind of think so,
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.880]   but we don't know.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.440]   You can go to that or the chiropractic
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.480]   and then you'll stress it.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.680]   Yeah, I mean, it was-- I mean, I'm--
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.120]   It's a little hyperbole here.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:50.280]   But it wasn't like any kind of Mac event I've been to where
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.040]   all the press is buzzing and everybody's
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.280]   in waiting and everything's--
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.840]   It's still a spazzy fan, boys.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.400]   Yeah, it was kind of like, oh, there's
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.360]   a turkey vomit brown box over there that does some kind of music.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.320]   I like the brown one.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:00.960]   I like the brown one.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.360]   Let me ask you this, though.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.080]   So the last thing about the Zoom,
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.720]   if taken as a thing in the world in obscurity,
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.080]   if we stop the constant comparisons to the iPod,
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.320]   I mean, for you guys who have played with it,
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:14.480]   I tried to play with an iPod or with a Zoom the other day
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.160]   of Target.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.920]   I got very confused.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.560]   Really?
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.000]   You feel like iPod was standing.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.520]   Take it all away, just as a box that the kids are going
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.240]   to grab and use, you think it's not so--
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.440]   Yeah, I don't think it's going to make it.
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:26.840]   But I think there's some very interesting innovative stuff.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.240]   And I think this is version one.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:28.840]   I also think--
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.360]   I think it's screen one.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.080]   Well, I agree.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.400]   There's some very good stuff about it.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.360]   And I think it's version one.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.440]   And I think it will get better.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.640]   I think Microsoft has firmware upgrades
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.600]   to make that will take away a lot of the things.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.220]   For instance, the Wi-Fi, you can't
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.640]   use to buy a song.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.580]   You should be able to download songs via Wi-Fi.
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.100]   That's crazy.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.600]   And I'm sure in version two, things like that
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.100]   will happen.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.620]   There's no podcast support.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.620]   That's unbelievable.
[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:50.280]   Well, I also think the licensing that they're
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.280]   doing with giving the record industry back a dollar each makes
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:54.540]   me.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.180]   But that's going to--
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:55.180]   You don't know.
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:56.340]   --bends a dollar, by the way.
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.020]   It could be $10.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:57.860]   We don't know what it is.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:58.780]   We don't know what it is.
[00:31:58.780 --> 00:31:59.980]   But what I do know is it's going to affect--
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.340]   So you know, it's going to be a good shape, basically,
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.500]   a kickback or what would you call it?
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.220]   A kickback.
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.380]   The presumption is it's going to be used for piracy.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.660]   We want our cut, which infuriates me.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:10.140]   That's the point I wouldn't want to seed if I were in the
[00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:10.640]   hardware.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.140]   I agree.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.620]   But this is why we're mad at Microsoft.
[00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.900]   But they seeded it.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:15.900]   And who knows how hard they fought, but they seeded it.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.780]   I can understand it if it was like Bob and Ernie's software
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.260]   company.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.700]   But this is Microsoft.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:27.060]   But what it does is it kind of messes up the deal for Apple.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.060]   Because I think that's--
[00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.380]   If I was doing it, if I was Microsoft, I'd get them
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:30.780]   asking--
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:31.860]   Well, we're getting on purpose.
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:32.700]   Yeah, oh, I think so.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.580]   Now, this is an idea, though, that's been around for a while.
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.820]   They tried to do it in Canada.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.140]   In fact, in Canada, when you buy blank media, you pay a
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.260]   royalty to the recording industry.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.540]   Remember when that tape came out in the States, you pay
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.300]   to royalty to the recording industry.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.380]   They like this idea.
[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:47.780]   They've always liked this idea.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:49.340]   You don't have to actually do anything to get paid.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:50.260]   You don't have to sell products.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.660]   Just assume it's going to be used for piracy.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.260]   See, that's so pathetic.
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.780]   That's like the book industry saying there should be a
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.300]   paper tax, because people might use it to cop photocopies.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:57.780]   Exactly.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:58.700]   It's appalling.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.780]   And for Microsoft to seed it--
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.980]   Just their treading water so they can figure out what
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.940]   their 2.0 is on their freaking--
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.420]   I agree.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.780]   Well, they have the 2.0 in their hands.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.780]   I don't understand.
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:07.340]   It's obvious.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:07.820]   Look at the eye--
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.260]   Just success of the eye to the instrument.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.620]   I think it's-- so you think this is a conspiracy that
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:12.580]   Microsoft really just--
[00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.460]   I think it's-- I think it's--
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.340]   I really-- I do.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.940]   And I think it's connected to JFK's death.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.460]   And--
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:17.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.460]   No, no, I saw you.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.460]   No, no, I think that that's part of the--
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.300]   I think that that's part of the--
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.460]   All of you play this podcast backwards.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:21.980]   I see that.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:22.980]   I know.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:23.980]   I think that it's--
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.980]   I see if I--
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.980]   Wall is dead.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.580]   No, but I do think that there's--
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.140]   I think that it's a tactical move to put more pressure on
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.140]   Apple.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:34.700]   I think that this is-- the record industry really wants to
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.220]   squeeze this.
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.340]   I think that eventually I still think that Apple is going to
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.780]   need-- is going to get to a point where it doesn't make any
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:42.780]   sense to keep on working with these Jack--
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.940]   well, I won't say what I was going to say about that.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:45.180]   And then--
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.180]   But--
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.340]   I don't know what came up for Jack.
[00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.860]   It started with an A.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:50.380]   So--
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:50.860]   Rabbit.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.620]   Yeah, Jack Rabbit.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.460]   I'll show you what Jack booted does.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.580]   So they want to deal with these Jack rabbits.
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.380]   And the thing is that Apple is building a vertical market.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.060]   They have the content creation.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.860]   We have everything from GarageBand to Logic.
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.900]   They don't-- eventually you're going to get to a point where
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.700]   the artists are tired of getting screwed.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.900]   Apple's tired of getting screwed.
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.340]   The consumers are tired of getting screwed.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.580]   And they're going to just cut everybody out.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.500]   These record companies used to be a PR thing.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.140]   But I don't listen to the radio anymore.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.300]   I listen to my iPod.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.100]   They do nothing now.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.940]   And so the thing is--
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.260]   I'll tell back to the internet for something like 12
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:17.980]   episodes now.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:21.060]   But I mean, it's just-- it's so appalling to me that there's
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.900]   this entire industry whose business model is predicated on
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.780]   the same concept as sheet music.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:30.740]   And they're trying to make this entire nation feel bad
[00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.420]   about the fact that their false economy suddenly has holes in
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.660]   it that can't be enforced by legal and physical means.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:39.100]   And it's just-- it's so appalling to me that we allow that
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:41.420]   kind of leverage to go on.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.340]   They're not innovating.
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.100]   They haven't tried to innovate in years.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:44.980]   I think it's very possible.
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.180]   We could look at the Zoom as a watershed that this may
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:51.060]   actually be so encumbered, that the DRM may be so appalling,
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:55.500]   that the insult to consumers by paying a tax to universal
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.900]   may be so insulting, that we actually see it as the beginning
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.900]   of the end of this.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.500]   This is maybe the last gasp of this kind of raspy.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:03.900]   Or the beginning of the opportunity to make some really
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.340]   serious dough.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:07.500]   Well, by doing it right in a different way.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.060]   In a different way.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.780]   I've got the model.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.900]   I'm going to get a kazoo and hum into a recorder that
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.700]   records to my flash drive and then just hand those flash
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:15.940]   drives on to your--
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.180]   Can record right into your iPhone.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.100]   And Genesis is going on tour again.
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:19.580]   Are they really?
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.140]   Yeah, I think Phil Collins has some payments.
[00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.900]   Don't forget, Jen is playing the B-side.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:24.900]   Channel giant.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.500]   That's a deep counter lock.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.980]   There was-- this is actually kind of an interesting business.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:33.460]   They sell a USB key at concerts with the concert recording
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.980]   as you're going out the door.
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.480]   I love it.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.100]   The pixies were doing that.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.660]   You can walk out.
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.100]   You can buy a disc on the way out.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.740]   But it's the USB-C you bring it back.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.700]   And it puts it on a machine.
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:43.940]   And that's awesome.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.780]   But now, as I remember, I have to look back and see,
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.260]   the company that invented this is called as trademarked
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.140]   or patented or whatever.
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.140]   Nobody else can do it.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.220]   You've got it right there.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.900]   I mean, this is the part that I find so galling.
[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.460]   It's just that we're all made to feel bad because the way
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.260]   that our grandparents bought music,
[00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.540]   and a business model that does not change substantially,
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:02.060]   literally, since sheet music, we're
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.740]   still-- we're being made to feel bad because now,
[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:05.420]   for the first time, they don't have that leverage.
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.020]   Instead of them, like I say, innovating,
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.020]   kind of a thing like that.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:10.340]   You're a pirate because you won't live by our business model.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.500]   But my gosh, the money that they leave on the table
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:16.020]   with not taking the opportunity to give people all this stuff
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:17.220]   when they want to buy it.
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.060]   You know, to get-- even if it has DRM in it, gosh,
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.060]   that's still a step forward.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:21.300]   It's back to what you said about Napster.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.900]   It opened your eyes to the notion of get it what you want,
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.580]   when you want it.
[00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:27.620]   And you've got people in the habit of going and buying stuff.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.300]   I can't even tell you the ridiculous amount of money
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:30.660]   I now spend on iTunes.
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.580]   That I never-- if there hadn't been a Napster,
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.260]   there wouldn't be an iTunes.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:34.100]   I agree with you.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.580]   The music company's made a lot more money out of it.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:37.420]   I just bought the first season of 30 Rock.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.460]   I bought the five episodes that are out so far.
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.140]   I bought probably 10 albums in the last week.
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:43.860]   You know who's losing, from my point of view,
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:45.260]   is the cable companies are going to lose
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.540]   because I would much rather buy my TV shows, Alacart.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:51.340]   You know, you will talk about Alacart, CDs.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.220]   The cable company's got it worse than-- you can't even
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.820]   buy an individual channel.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.020]   You can let it own a show.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.420]   You need to buy a whole bunch of channels.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.140]   You got to get 12 channels.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:36:59.900]   You get a whole tier.
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.380]   You got to get to the next level.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:02.900]   Just because you want to see one channel.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:04.740]   Yeah, I'd do that to get MTV Classic.
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.740]   Yeah, but actually all these lame channels.
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:07.860]   I don't want to watch those.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.460]   You don't want to run hungry.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.220]   No, it's true.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.220]   VH1 Classic and MTV Classic.
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.220]   VH1 Classic.
[00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.020]   VH1 Classic.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:14.620]   Wait, what is it?
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:15.780]   It's VH1.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.220]   So I am getting so old.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.220]   I'm getting so old.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.260]   The VH1 Classic.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.300]   Those bands.
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.940]   This is how I know I'm old.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:24.940]   I've never heard of any of them either.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.180]   They're too old.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.020]   Oh my god.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.060]   They're young people.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.860]   That's when you know you're in real trouble with the VH1.
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.580]   Why don't they ever play Jilsen?
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.180]   They'll never play anything from Jilsen.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.060]   You had nothing yet.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.660]   Where's the Crosby stills Nash and Young, OK?
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.580]   I don't want any much.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:39.860]   Oh, baby.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.700]   Hello, my honey.
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.900]   Hello, my right hand.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:43.620]   That's hard.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.260]   So I have to scratch all.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:46.620]   I think I think.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.980]   OK, I just want to take a look.
[00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:49.260]   Oh, we should close this off.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.860]   But I just want to point out one thing about how much money
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.020]   is being left on the table, Merle.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.020]   That's a good point.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:59.180]   Back in '95, I got my very first RIAA threatening letter
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.500]   because I launched Net Radio.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.940]   And we played music on the internet.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.700]   And we were in the middle of an ASCAP deal.
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:06.540]   So it wasn't like we hadn't been paying attention to that.
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.620]   And these guys were going to kill your kids.
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.740]   We're going to kick your dog.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.300]   We're going to hit you so hard your kid dies.
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.060]   I mean, they were all over.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:16.420]   And they said, no, we're never going to let this happen.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.340]   And for five years, they battled that kind of stuff.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.180]   And then somebody flipped a switch and said, oh, yeah.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.380]   I guess we can make money at that.
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:25.700]   So I know that they supposedly represent
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.580]   the interests of the artist.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.420]   But if I was one of those artists, I'd say,
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:28.980]   where were you?
[00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.980]   The five years people were trying to pay me.
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:32.420]   A lot of artists do say that now.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.780]   I think that they're more and more I think
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.740]   are going to continue to.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.380]   And then if I'm a new C change will come.
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.380]   If the artist say, we're done.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:42.220]   But the thing is, as an existing artist, if I was sting,
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:44.300]   if I was sting, I could go straight to iTunes
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.940]   and make more money than I ever made.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:47.220]   He doesn't need the album.
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:49.700]   He doesn't need A&M records to sell the money.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.660]   He also doesn't need the money.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:51.860]   So there's less incentive for him.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.420]   I think it's going to be the young new artist.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.460]   You guys follow the artist?
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:55.860]   I mean, do you follow the-- supposedly now,
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.260]   this is like a big thing, is watching for--
[00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.340]   something just happened recently.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.860]   One of these records just-- it's sales.
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.980]   Gosh, I'm so uninformed on this.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.780]   But there was a single that just came out
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.580]   that for the first time, it's sales on iTunes,
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:10.980]   exceeded its sales.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.480]   Wow.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   Oh yeah, I heard about that.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:12.980]   And it'd be a week.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.820]   I mean, do you think we're going to keep just seeing more of that?
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.340]   Absolutely.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:16.100]   It's got to be.
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.220]   But I'd like to dis--
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.380]   I'd like to disintermediate iTunes as well.
[00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:21.580]   I mean, iTunes is-- you're just replacing one master
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:21.580]   for another.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.260]   I can just be just in a store to me.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.460]   Like someday, I'm much as I love iTunes.
[00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:25.940]   And I--
[00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:27.100]   Well, they've got the DRM.
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.540]   They've locked you into the iPod.
[00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.540]   You can't play on any of the--
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.860]   Someone on Date J.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:31.700]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.140]   Well, I mean, and that's the issue.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.740]   It's really replacing one master with another.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.820]   I don't think that's the solution.
[00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.340]   But let's stuff the music on these little platters.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:40.620]   And then we'll put them in shrink wrap
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.620]   and we'll sell them in stores.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.140]   We'll ship them like truck.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.100]   We're going to pack around bull's--
[00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.780]   What's the bandwidth of a truck loaded with CDs
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.220]   driving across the country?
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.220]   There's actually a guy that--
[00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.860]   I hate word problems.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.980]   He started this company.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.940]   He claims that iPods and iTunes and all this stuff is dead.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.860]   What people really want is massive amount of DVDs
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:02.540]   with all the digital media content
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.940]   preloaded onto them that they can buy through the mail.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:05.860]   That's sensible.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.140]   It's interesting to see that the models kind of just
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.020]   go full circle.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.820]   Read Hastings and Netflix told me.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.380]   He said that the whole idea for Netflix came to him
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.780]   because his college computing professor said,
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:19.780]   what's the bandwidth, which is higher, an OC48,
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.220]   or a truck bearing 3,000 DVDs?
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.980]   The truck has more bandwidth.
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.420]   And so he said, wow, I guess I could--
[00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:29.420]   DVDs by mail.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:30.660]   Maybe we'll get back to eight-track tapes.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:31.420]   I think we'll get back to--
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.860]   I think we'll get back to where bandwidth gets.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:37.380]   Because I know I have a hard time imagining--
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.220]   Tower Records is right across the street.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.620]   You still go to a record store?
[00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:42.180]   No, no, no.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.180]   I was going to say, what I do is I go over there
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:47.380]   and I sometimes buy DVDs with special effects extras.
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:48.620]   Well, I like buy extras, sure.
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.620]   And I buy sandwiches.
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:50.620]   They have great sandwiches.
[00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:51.620]   We have sandwiches.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.220]   But those are the two go bankrupt tower?
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:54.020]   I think they did.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:54.460]   You're not on the tower.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:55.020]   I'm sorry, Virgin.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:55.020]   Virgin.
[00:40:55.020 --> 00:41:01.420]   So I go over there, and I buy DVDs on sale
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.460]   or with special effects extras or sandwiches.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.140]   But I never even imagined-- I mean,
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:07.860]   the entire CD section doesn't even exist for me.
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.060]   Dude, I went on to-- OK, so the other morning I woke up.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:10.820]   I get up really early.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.820]   I have a bunch of coffee.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.420]   I'm full of beans.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:14.580]   And I suddenly had this desire to have lots.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.780]   To grind your coffee before you--
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.300]   Sorry?
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:16.780]   Do I?
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.940]   To grind your coffee before you drink it?
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.540]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:20.540]   OK.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.460]   Next time, try breaking the pros that can hit.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:26.860]   I get up.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.660]   I'm full of beans.
[00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:29.660]   And a lot of my iTunes purchases happen in the morning.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.660]   This is what I'm doing a lot of work.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.820]   I'm trying to get some writing done.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.260]   And I had this sudden desire to have lots of the jam,
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:35.300]   the spam, the jam.
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.820]   And so I hopped on iTunes, and they--
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:40.380]   I immediately bought this best of from them.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.380]   They didn't have--
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.700]   That sells more records, because you can push a button.
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:44.620]   Oh, my God.
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.260]   And buy a record.
[00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.180]   But here's my only point.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.740]   And I know we're going way too long on this.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:49.780]   But my-- my desire was to like--
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.580]   I immediately wanted my three classic jam records.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:53.100]   I wanted them.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.220]   And I wanted them on my hard drive.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:55.100]   And they went, so what did I do?
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.100]   I went on Amazon, and with my stupid Amazon Prime,
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.260]   I had delivered the next day.
[00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.380]   But at least you bought it.
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.780]   But for the first time in my life, it really hit me.
[00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:05.020]   I opened a cardboard box that had been delivered to my house
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.780]   overnight by a big gas-guzzling truck.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:13.140]   I cut it open to pull out a bunch of plastic air-filled balloons
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:18.820]   that were protecting two plastic boxes with plastic wrap
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.820]   and a plastic disc.
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.740]   Containing data.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.540]   You could download it.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:22.900]   Containing data that I could have had for anywhere.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.060]   But I mean, I know I'm saying things
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.500]   that people have been saying for 10 years.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.980]   But it just really struck me how incredibly appalling
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.500]   that is.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.700]   What's Apple's doing with Purdue here?
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.580]   I mean, this could be a big step forward
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.260]   in terms of delivering not just music, but video.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.220]   Yeah, so Apple is--
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:39.540]   This was some R&D that they're doing with Purdue.
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:43.300]   They're in Vision Center for data perceptualization.
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:48.100]   Now, what this was doing was moving a video.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.860]   So this is streaming video 30 frames a second at 4096 by 3072.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.780]   24-bit color.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.260]   Wait a minute.
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.620]   So 1080p, 1080 progressive, the highest possible--
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.860]   That's 1920.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:00.620]   This is twice that.
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.220]   This is twice that.
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:01.900]   More than twice.
[00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.100]   So it's four times the bandwidth, because it's four.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:05.140]   You know, and what we're talking about--
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:05.780]   Super high-date.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:09.020]   7.5 gigabits per second.
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.260]   And they were able to do that.
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.260]   And they were able to do that.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:11.860]   And the given idea--
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.020]   So the movie industry thinks if we get these guys moved to HD DVD,
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.340]   we'll be safe for a little longer, because now it's
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.620]   so much data.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.820]   But this technology is moving faster than they can.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.220]   Yeah, this is like-- it's going to keep on going.
[00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:26.020]   And as I said, every time someone asks me whether Blu-ray
[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.580]   or HDV is going to win--
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:29.020]   They're going to lose to let it try.
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:30.820]   By the time we figure it out, we'll be downloading.
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:31.380]   I mean, it's just--
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:32.460]   That's absolutely true.
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:32.980]   It's very cool.
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.020]   Do you think bandwidth is still to hang up for this stuff?
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.020]   I think it is right now.
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.540]   It's like, you know, bandwidth meets compression.
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.300]   Both ends have to work to make this happen.
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.460]   But it's going to happen.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.580]   And it's really a horse race now between these high-def formats
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.220]   and electronic--
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.860]   Well, and hopefully we have enough competition.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.460]   A lot of it's-- a lot of it--
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:52.100]   the reason we have such bad bandwidth
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.900]   is not because we couldn't have better.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.260]   It's because everyone spends so much money on DSL
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.220]   and so much money on cable modems and so much money
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.140]   on everything else.
[00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:00.940]   They don't want to upgrade the systems.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:03.020]   They don't want to spend the next trillion dollars--
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.820]   That's why it's infrastructure.
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.020]   The nations where there's no infrastructure.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.380]   In Rwanda-- this was in the Chronicle this last week.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.180]   In Rwanda, they are running fiber to the entire country.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.540]   They're just running fiber to the entire country
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:15.420]   because it's cheaper.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.460]   Same thing in South Korea.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.540]   Same thing in Vietnam.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.660]   Everywhere in Rwanda, you'll be able to open up, basically,
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:26.060]   a EVDO-style 400 to 700 kilobits per second
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.620]   on a cell phone anywhere in the country.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:31.020]   All the schools are going to have fiber going to central service
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.220]   because the reason they're doing it
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.700]   is because it's cheaper to put thin clients at the schools
[00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:37.780]   to let them just act as the central service.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:38.780]   That's the cheaper that are hardware.
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.340]   Man with is cheaper and more reliable than hardware.
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:43.940]   And they can put $100 box that doesn't break down,
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.740]   sitting in that school for the next 10 year
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:46.740]   and have it all wired in.
[00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.820]   Makes you wonder if the $100 computer is such a good idea.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:50.260]   Maybe a thin client is another choice.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.060]   Well, for this stuff, that's what they've decided.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.380]   And we're talking about-- it used to be $1,500 a month
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.220]   for five years ago in Rwanda.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.220]   It's now $70 a month for a fiber connection.
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:00.140]   So let me get this straight.
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.420]   I have to go to Rwanda to get my good bandwidth.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.540]   I go to Iraq to get my free health care.
[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:06.620]   And pretty much where I'm at, I get nothing.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:07.140]   Nothing.
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.380]   And I'll share it for your news.
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.660]   I doubt you fear for my news.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.620]   Thank you.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:13.700]   Welcome to the West in the 21st century.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.700]   Any other stories on the top of your minds at this point?
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:18.340]   I had one come up that was kind of interesting.
[00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:20.580]   This is via a mailing list that I am on.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.060]   Hello, friends.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:24.700]   What do you guys know about VMware virtualization?
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.980]   I love it.
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.700]   This was the buzz today.
[00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.540]   So can you tell me--
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.700]   Parallel is, of course, the top virtualization choice
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.980]   in the Mac world.
[00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.100]   They did a really great job.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:34.820]   $79.
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:37.780]   You can run Windows Vista XP, Linux.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.340]   But VMware has historically been the company
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.100]   to beat in the Linux and Windows space.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.780]   And they announced a beta client for Macintosh.
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:47.260]   So is it shipping now the first beta?
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.380]   Because I'm on that mailing list.
[00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.540]   I'm waiting to see it.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:51.260]   Because it could be very, very good.
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.300]   I think it's out there.
[00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:52.940]   It's out there.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:53.460]   OK.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:55.020]   They announced that we're going to do it.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.020]   I signed up for the beta.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.260]   I've been waiting for that email saying come download it.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:00.380]   Now, I have to say, on the Windows side,
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.340]   parallel is actually faster than VMware.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.940]   But VMware has some other advantages.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.020]   We'll just have to wait and see.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.420]   One of the nice things about VMware is any VMware setup
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:11.460]   you've created-- you know all of these virtualization things
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.900]   make a file instead of a hard drive.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:17.900]   It looks like it's a Windows computer, but it's just a file.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.740]   If you're using VMware on Windows, on Linux, on Mac,
[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.300]   those files are completely compatible.
[00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:22.940]   So you can set up--
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.900]   Wow.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.860]   You can set up a virtual machine on your Windows machine,
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.860]   copy it over your Mac.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.460]   It runs exactly the same, same content.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.220]   For somebody like me who doesn't know the first thing
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:33.260]   about this stuff, it's all just been like pops and buzzes.
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.020]   What would you recommend if I wanted to--
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.020]   Right now, parallel is a question.
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:36.580]   Parallel is a way to go.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:37.700]   79 bucks.
[00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:40.260]   You have to have a copy of Windows.
[00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:42.380]   I use it for both Windows, XP, and Vista.
[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.260]   And they run great.
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.540]   To me, this is the real advantage of the Intel Mac.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.500]   We've had some members doing a lot of parallel stuff.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.380]   And they found that the Photoshop, for instance,
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.380]   runs faster on parallels than it does on in OS 10.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.780]   Windows Photoshop has traditionally
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.900]   been faster, unfortunately, than Windows.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.140]   Well, in right now, we're sitting with a non-native version,
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.300]   which is what's not going on.
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:03.700]   I haven't really followed this carefully.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.380]   I've just been watching the shadows cast by a lot
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:09.100]   of my Windows friends turning and starting
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.060]   to look in this direction.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:13.140]   And I think we're getting really-- it feels like--
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.340]   this is purely anecdotal.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.700]   But it feels like we're getting to a point where, in the same way
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.580]   that a lot of people held out, like, oh, gosh, I just
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.980]   have one more OS 9 application I live by.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.660]   I think now people are getting to the point where, well,
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:24.500]   you know what?
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.820]   I think I can survive--
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:26.820]   We're at the tipping point.
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.180]   --running my one app in virtual--
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:28.860]   We're at the tipping point.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.740]   But I think that that's why we've seen incredible growth
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.940]   over the last two, only two or three months for Apple.
[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.140]   You know, I mean, I jumped like a--
[00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:36.460]   Now, Vista's going to slow this down.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:37.740]   I think if you're a Windows user--
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.620]   Or speed it up.
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.580]   Well, that's the question.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:42.260]   With some of the DRMs, with some of the DRM that Vista's doing,
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:42.580]   I don't--
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:43.900]   We don't know until January 30th.
[00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:45.340]   When people start using Vista--
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.140]   January 30th, you really think that's the date?
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.260]   It is officially the date.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:48.740]   It's out.
[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.620]   It's the red look of--
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:50.820]   It's the net bet, the farm.
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:57.220]   Oh, no, no, no, in fact, it's out.
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.820]   Leopard comes out after Vista.
[00:47:58.820 --> 00:47:59.620]   What?
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:00.620]   Because Steve isn't--
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.180]   It's funny, and now we've got skin in the game.
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.660]   That's right, exactly.
[00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:05.820]   No, but I do think that people will look very closely.
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:07.100]   In fact, there are probably people waiting.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.220]   Now, there are some interesting things
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.820]   we talked about this on Twitter this week.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.740]   No, Vista is pretty demanding in terms of hardware.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.060]   If you want to run all the latest Vista features,
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.580]   you have to buy new hardware.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.340]   And that puts you in a position to decide what you're going to do.
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:20.140]   That's exactly right, maybe I'll run it on.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.460]   Maybe I'll run it on a virtual machine in the Mac.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:23.540]   Well, that's the question.
[00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.940]   Is not so much-- are you choosing between OS 10 and Vista?
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:27.820]   What you're choosing is--
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.380]   What's my next computer?
[00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:31.220]   Or-- I only want Vista or I want both.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.820]   That's not quite all you're choosing.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.740]   You're choosing between whether or not you'd like
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.540]   Adware and viruses or not.
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.020]   Oh boy.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.020]   No, Vista--
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:38.700]   You can have all--
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:39.540]   You can have all of it.
[00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:40.940]   You may take two drinks.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:43.180]   No, no, but take two drinks.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.180]   But I think that--
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.140]   iPhone, iPhone, iPhone.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.060]   Oh, iPhone, iPhone.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:47.420]   Here's the wild tricky.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.740]   But I do think that, for me, I can't imagine,
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.980]   at this point, buying something other than an Apple,
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.180]   not because OS 10 is necessarily better.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:55.700]   There's things that I need PCs for.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.260]   I mean, I am in bootcamp because of those 3D programs
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.620]   that I use, at least once a day.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:05.620]   I'm using Windows more on my Mac than I did before I had.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.420]   Yeah, I keep running almost all the time.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:09.180]   Yeah, so the thing is I'm using it more.
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:11.620]   So it's not, for me, it's not a choice about whether I'm
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:13.180]   using Windows or OS 10.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:16.380]   It's whether I'm buying an Apple or something that limits me
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.340]   to only Vista.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.140]   You know, that's the question.
[00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:21.060]   I'm the only person who's constantly running out
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:21.820]   of hard drive space.
[00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.540]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:24.060]   Because I've got to tell you, at this point,
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.300]   I can't even imagine trying to run Windows on my machine.
[00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.180]   I mean, even after I've gotten into this completely--
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:31.300]   You're a laptop user, though.
[00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.100]   I'm a laptop user.
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:32.700]   I think that's why.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.060]   Desktop users, where they were so--
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:34.740]   That's true.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.740]   Because my gosh, it just drives me crazy, though.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.380]   I mean, I'm forever having to clean, completely clean out
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.180]   iTunes.
[00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.820]   Merlin, there's these holes on the side of your computer there.
[00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:44.780]   And you can plug drives right in there.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.940]   Well, you know what, though?
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.540]   It's turtles all the way down.
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.740]   Because once you get a big-ass hard drive--
[00:49:51.740 --> 00:49:52.180]   You feel that one?
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:53.780]   Can I say that?
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.780]   Turtles all the way down?
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:55.940]   I think so.
[00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.340]   Once you've got a big-ass hard drive,
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:57.980]   you need to wait about--
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:58.340]   Eat a booger.
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:59.780]   --to get a big-ass hard drive.
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.220]   Right?
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.780]   So I mean, you get into this thing where--
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:02.620]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.540]   I have a terabyte network attached storage.
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.980]   The next stuff up to for that phrase is--
[00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.340]   So I mean, but the problem is, I mean,
[00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:09.620]   oh, some of this I get around with things like Chronosync,
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:12.260]   where I have Chronosync automatically back up my iTunes
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.260]   folder every couple of days, so I can throw things away
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:14.260]   in the community.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.340]   That's a very good idea.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.660]   Yeah, so I mean, I'm constantly--
[00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:17.860]   Basically, it moves over.
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:19.820]   I use Chronosync, and it moves over.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:20.300]   You can do--
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.580]   Chronosync is nice, because it's--
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.900]   If you don't have the skills to do something like Rsync,
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:24.900]   it confuses you.
[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.660]   Chronosync has a great GUI, and I have--
[00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.300]   I've talked about this on 43 folders,
[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.700]   but I have a very basic script that says,
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.060]   compare these two directories, being my iTunes music folder
[00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.100]   and the external drive.
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.540]   Move over anything that's newer or larger for all size.
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:38.060]   That's excellent.
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.940]   And so then I can throw away everything within P&D.
[00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:40.460]   Right.
[00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.460]   Is this your tip?
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:42.700]   No, but that is a good tip.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:43.060]   That's a good tip.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.420]   Chronosync is a great app.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.220]   I'll use it as my tip, because I don't have one.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.380]   Well, I did a little thing on Smart Playlist
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:51.460]   that a lot of people liked last week, actually,
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.380]   as a result of a recent Mac pre-curricular.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.860]   But long story short, I feel like I'm forever having to--
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:59.860]   I don't know how people are able to run all this Windows.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.300]   Well, it really is.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.740]   I always like down to like 5,000.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:03.540]   If I get into the thing--
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:05.460]   You're saying the thing that really is it, which is you
[00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:07.860]   have must have a 60 gig iPod, and you're
[00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.700]   filling up your hard drive, because you
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.660]   have to sync the iPod to your computer.
[00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.220]   I mean, start-- get a desktop, sync your iPod to that,
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:15.540]   and set it at your laptop.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:16.940]   I don't keep my iTunes folder in my laptop.
[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.780]   To the answer, find it a Mac.
[00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:19.620]   Buy it desktop.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.580]   If I give you the phone, could you call my wife, honey?
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:23.940]   We're buying a Mac.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:25.220]   Yeah, and I have to--
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.300]   Take back that snowball and trade it in front of me.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:29.340]   I already took the snowball back.
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.060]   I had the snowball for 10 minutes.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:34.260]   So you guys made me take it back.
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.860]   Yeah, I have three 80 gig Lecid drives that I carry.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.740]   I have 160 gigs sitting in a box here.
[00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:42.740]   We're going to upgrade my computer.
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.820]   So even with 160 gig, that's just not enough, especially
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.380]   if you have a 60 gig iPod.
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.900]   No, you're putting your photos on there.
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:49.980]   No, the worst part is you're going to carry them one way.
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:51.380]   And now I just got a rebel.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.140]   So now I'm taking raw photos.
[00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.500]   Yes, the raw will kill you.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.140]   Ridiculous.
[00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:56.660]   OK, so can I make a placeholder here?
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.420]   Can we please agree to have a discussion sometimes soon
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:01.340]   about the easiest, idiot-proof way
[00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.420]   to get terabyte plus space at home?
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:03.940]   Yes.
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:04.460]   Yeah, we'll be.
[00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:06.540]   I think that's a discussion I would really like to have.
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.340]   And if you have suggestions, if you're listening,
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:09.740]   and you have suggestions about your grandpa--
[00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:10.740]   Because everybody who's telling you,
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:12.620]   we'll go buy these ADM, ADGIG drives,
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:13.740]   and just put them together.
[00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:15.580]   And if you have suggestions--
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:16.580]   If you have suggestions--
[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:18.540]   I use a RAID 5, but it's a grand.
[00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:19.820]   Let's ask the audience.
[00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.340]   OK, well, I know we're probably running a long time,
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:23.940]   but I would like to put a placeholder to discuss it.
[00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.660]   No, we'll discuss it.
[00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:25.740]   And if you're listening--
[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:27.740]   if you're listening, assuming that you're actually
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:28.740]   listening to the talk--
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.140]   If you're not listening, then pay no attention to the world.
[00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.140]   Yeah, pay no attention if you're not listening to the world.
[00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:32.140]   My mom and the other person.
[00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:35.500]   Go up to Macbreak weekly on the Twitter.tv site
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.500]   and let us know how you would do that.
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.540]   And then we'll look through some of that stuff.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.700]   My friend Leonard has tried to explain this to me.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.380]   I went down and had lunch at Google.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:45.460]   And Leonard tried to explore Yahoo, rather.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:46.540]   And lunch had to explain--
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.540]   It's free at Google.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.540]   All of those places down there, you get--
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:50.540]   Is it Yahoo?
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:51.420]   Is it free at Yahoo?
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:52.380]   I think so.
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:53.540]   Yeah, they were there first.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.540]   We went to Google.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.380]   It was amazing, right?
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:55.940]   It was so good.
[00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:56.940]   It was a good four different restaurants.
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:57.940]   And we get to the end that we get--
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:52:59.980]   Did you go to the new building, the green building?
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:00.480]   No.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.820]   Have you been in there?
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.540]   They have cool stuff in the lobby, too.
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.540]   They have neat stuff.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.540]   And they wipe board with all of it.
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:08.340]   They love doing those wipe boards.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.340]   They're just playing on it.
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:10.340]   Yeah, the big business.
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.340]   They have 43 different cafeterias.
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.340]   Well, they have a building 43, actually.
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:15.340]   43 cafeterias.com.
[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.340]   What a hell of a--
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.340]   Step 3 profit.
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:23.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.340]   Shall we do our picks?
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.340]   Let's go on starting with Scott Bourn, do you have one this week?
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:27.840]   I do.
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:28.840]   It's kind of an obscure one.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:32.340]   But if you're into any kind of audio recording, which for some reasons on my mind--
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.340]   I don't know why.
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:35.340]   --video recording, eh?
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:40.660]   If you do podcast or if you record your own music or if you do anything that requires
[00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:45.940]   you to engage a digital audio recorder, you may have the occasion to need sound effects
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:51.340]   or you may have the occasion to need beds, music beds, background beds.
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:54.340]   SFX and beds, as we call them, in the biz.
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:58.540]   You may not want to buy an entire collection of these things because you might just be
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:00.460]   the occasional user.
[00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:04.460]   And if you are that kind of person, I have found a website for you.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:08.460]   It is called soundrangers.com.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:13.460]   And think iStockPhoto with the change being that instead of pictures you're downloading,
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.460]   you're downloading audio files.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.460]   The average sound effect there is a Buck65.
[00:54:17.460 --> 00:54:21.460]   Now, if you were to buy a bunch of things there, you'd quickly spend more than you'd spend
[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.460]   on the average big royalty-free collection.
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:26.460]   So it doesn't necessarily make sense if you need hundreds and hundreds of things.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:30.420]   But if you're just going, well, you know, last night, we recorded iLiveZone and it was a
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.420]   show about, you know, gifts during the holidays.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:36.900]   And I needed a little sleigh bell sound and I was on my laptop instead of at home or I
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:37.900]   have all my stuff.
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:41.020]   So I went there and I paid a Buck65 and I got the sleigh bell sound.
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:42.100]   So how's the search?
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:43.100]   It was really fast.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.100]   It's just like iStock.
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.100]   You just type in what you want.
[00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.100]   And there it is.
[00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.100]   And you can audition every single sound before you buy it.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.860]   You have a shopping cart that works nicely.
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:50.860]   It was very quick.
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.140]   It was a very good experience.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:56.340]   Soundrangers.com, if you're in the recording biz or you want to be.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.340]   Very good.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.340]   Like, I'm there.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.340]   Merlin Man.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.340]   Use this.
[00:55:00.340 --> 00:55:01.740]   Mine is not a new app.
[00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.380]   I try to come in, you know, for the kids.
[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.380]   I like to have new things.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.380]   You like to be fresh.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:06.380]   Because the kids love new things.
[00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:08.420]   They love the video games and they love they love new things.
[00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:10.420]   He's a fresh dressed man.
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:11.420]   Mine is an oldie.
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:15.180]   Mine is a program that we'll call it's an oldie recurrent.
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.180]   Speed download.
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:17.180]   Only recurrent.
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.180]   A little DJ joke there.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:19.180]   Is that what that is?
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:20.180]   I think so.
[00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:21.180]   All of us here.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:22.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.180]   We're all going, "Oh, I know that."
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:24.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:26.700]   Oh, he's an oldie recurrent.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:30.180]   Speed download is a.
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.180]   It was on cards.
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.180]   It was on just my car.
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:33.180]   Was it on cards?
[00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.180]   Is that how you did it?
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.180]   Yeah, it was on orange sticker.
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:38.140]   Speed download is if you do any kind of downloading.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:40.340]   I still remember the card number for Kenny Rogers, the gambler.
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:41.340]   I'm sorry, but.
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:43.180]   TMI, too much information.
[00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:44.980]   That is so pathetic.
[00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:45.980]   You know what?
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.180]   I was saying, I could go to the car wreck to my wife.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:51.620]   You know, she's never heard of me.
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:53.020]   Don't take your love to the family.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.820]   I don't like Kenny Rogers in the first edition.
[00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:56.620]   You put it on your list.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:58.620]   There's a great, great, here's the best part.
[00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.620]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:00.620]   Turn around.
[00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:01.620]   Turn around.
[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:02.620]   There's a great parody.
[00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:06.020]   I have to find it for you where Ruby comes back.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:07.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.500]   I was getting down in the bar meeting it and Ruby, don't come back.
[00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:12.180]   It was like she came back and he's reeling.
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.180]   He's getting down.
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:15.980]   Ruby, get the hell out of town.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:17.420]   It was very funny.
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:19.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.420 --> 00:56:20.420]   I love that song.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.380]   So if you do any kind of downloading, and I suspect that some of you do, you know that,
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:27.460]   well, actually this used to be more of an issue when connections dropped more often and
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:31.380]   things like that, your little haze modem would drop.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:34.100]   One of the great things that happened, I think it was Z modem was the first one.
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:36.100]   I remember doing this because you could resume.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.100]   X modem was first.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:38.100]   Oh, we were zoomed.
[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:39.100]   X modem, Y modem.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:40.340]   But Z modem, you could resume.
[00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:42.420]   So I use this program called Speed Download.
[00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:44.420]   It's from Yassoft, Y-A-Z-S-O-F-T.
[00:56:44.420 --> 00:56:46.340]   That's a great one for our Tuesday.
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:49.820]   Speed download is terrific, especially if you're doing very large files because here's
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:51.060]   what Speed Download does.
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:55.980]   It basically, it makes it very easy for you to queue up a large number of files that you
[00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:59.580]   want to be downloading over time.
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:00.580]   It's just terrific.
[00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:05.060]   If you're trying to download things like educational copyright free movies and things
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:07.260]   like that, it's really terrifically useful.
[00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.580]   You can set up a queue that has priorities.
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:11.020]   You can set something higher than others.
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.020]   You can throttle it.
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:14.020]   So if you don't want it to take over your whole network, you don't have to hack under
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:15.020]   links to it.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.020]   I like that thread on you.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.020]   I like that thread on you.
[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:18.020]   I-I-O-T-O-F.
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:23.980]   Oh, god, we're old.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:24.980]   But Speed Download is great.
[00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:28.100]   And so if you do anything, if you're doing this long enough now that we have some sort
[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:32.940]   of strange stick going on, then only we get.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:36.540]   So if you have an internet connection and you enjoy downloading, you might want to look
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:38.540]   at speeddownload from Yassoft.com.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:42.380]   Alex, do you have something?
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:44.380]   You bet I-I think I do.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:45.380]   All right.
[00:57:45.380 --> 00:57:49.020]   I'm afraid we might have talked about this one, so I'm just gonna throw it out there.
[00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:52.780]   So one that I like, a lot of times I have to build out like pipelines.
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:53.780]   So this is how a pipeline works.
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.780]   I don't think we've talked about any pipeline building software.
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:57.620]   Please don't talk about your pipeline.
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.100]   Well I have to often talk.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.100]   We had a lot of chili.
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.100]   Often times.
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:07.020]   And I had, let me just say, that chicken tiggy masala really messes up my pipeline.
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.020]   So what do you got there?
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.020]   Omni Grapple.
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:11.020]   Oh, I love Omni Grapple.
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.020]   Omni, Omni Grapple.
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:16.940]   It is, you're trying to build out, this is how a decision process goes, how a pipeline
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:17.940]   works.
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:20.380]   Does it still come on every Mac or do they stop?
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.380]   Omni Grapple regular, I think still.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.380]   Is it still, but it isn't?
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:24.380]   No, I think I'm the only one.
[00:58:24.380 --> 00:58:26.820]   Is it a 30 day version or is that a permanent version?
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.820]   It's a full version, but it's not a previous version.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:31.820]   It's the, yeah, it's not the newest version.
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:32.820]   It's not the newest version.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:33.820]   And it's worth, is it worth upgrading?
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:34.820]   I have the professional.
[00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:35.820]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:39.420]   I've used it for the US home just for people, for the five people who don't, Omni Grapple
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.420]   is a program that's very easy for you to build things like diagrams.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.420]   All the stuff that you might have done in WLstrator.
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:45.420]   It's a great illustration.
[00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:47.420]   It's just so, and here's the deal.
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:48.420]   Here's the deal.
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:49.420]   Is it your sitting there?
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:52.620]   Why don't I just do this in, in the, you'll, why don't I do it in Photoshop or Illustrator
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:53.980]   or whatever, in a drawing program?
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.980]   Any kind of drawing program.
[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:59.260]   And the reason is, well, here's the deal is you throw your little, it's about all about
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.260]   the magnets.
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:03.420]   So what happens is you say, I want this arrow to go from here to here and it sticks to the
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:04.420]   thing you're moving.
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:07.620]   So when you need to rearrange it and move it around and add stuff, it's, for example, this
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.740]   particular rectangle only accepts north and south magnets.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.620]   So it makes it very easy to constrain the way your drawings work.
[00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:14.620]   It'll auto layout.
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.620]   It'll, uh, I got you off.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:20.820]   Yeah, it's, no, no, it's, it is the, uh, it's just such a great program.
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:21.820]   I've had it for so long.
[00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:24.020]   I can't remember what is different between the professional and the regular one.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.020]   Well, I haven't had the regular one for like five years.
[00:59:26.020 --> 00:59:27.020]   I've seen you one thing that's different.
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.860]   Have you, have you used the built in outliner?
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.860]   People don't even know this exists.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:32.860]   Of course, I'm an outliner.
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:36.580]   Can't tease told me that I didn't even realize I've been using it in the CEO of Omni Grapple
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:38.060]   who actually told me about this.
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:39.900]   You can have an Omni outliner.
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:42.340]   There isn't in the drawer that flies out to the left.
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:47.100]   There's a full on outliner built in and it's like old school inspiration.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.100]   It's totally semantic.
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:52.620]   So it builds so you can actually build your outline and it'll generate all the boxes.
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.260]   Sounds like it's time to upgrade.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.420]   Completely abstracted from that.
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.420]   You can say what selections you want for those boxes.
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:58.420]   Do you want them to be round?
[00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:59.420]   Do you want it to be whatever?
[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:01.580]   It supports styles and it works back.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.940]   It's, I think almost completely a hundred percent compatible with Omni outliner where
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:05.940]   you can go around trip.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:10.220]   The great thing is that you're not just, they have tons of icons that you can draw in.
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:13.340]   The typical flow graph ones and Macs and everything else and everything else.
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:16.180]   But it also has, you can just drag jape eggs in there.
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.660]   So you have pictures of stuff that you want to just throw in there and say, "Well, I go
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:20.820]   from this camera out to this, out to this."
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:25.700]   There's a site that I'm struggling to find right now that Ken just mentioned it to me
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.020]   yesterday and I've forgotten it.
[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:28.900]   There's a whole Omni Grapple library site.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:32.460]   See, that's what I'd like because of course these templates are very useful.
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:33.460]   Are they free or?
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.460]   The templates are all free.
[01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:38.820]   And if you do things like IAA, well, I mean if you're doing IAA, you're using it already.
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:42.620]   How does it compare to Vizio, which is the Windows version of this?
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.460]   Well, this works on a Mac.
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:46.220]   Okay, never mind.
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.460]   No, I don't know.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:49.900]   Vizio, I think Vizio is a pretty sure app.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.100]   I don't think it's very mature.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.740]   It's almost elderly.
[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:59.980]   But no, I mean to me there's this constellation of apps that I would have included Omni Grapple.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:03.860]   If you could afford it, the Mindjet, what's it called?
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.540]   Mindjet, the mind mapping program that they use that?
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:08.020]   It's like 250 bucks.
[01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:09.460]   So the answer would be no.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.780]   But you used Inspiration when it was in its header.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:15.340]   When Inspiration, before Inspiration turned into a kindergarten or application, I use
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.700]   that for IAA all the time.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:20.260]   Information architecture, doing flows and wireframes.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.300]   And the other one that I've been playing with lately is C-Map.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.180]   Have you guys played with this?
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.580]   It's like a mind map, but it's a concept map.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:32.020]   So you can draw these things to say like Leo Laport is a member of Twit, which is a network
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.020]   of.
[01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:35.420]   Never gathered the value of that kind of thing.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.020]   Well, I've just started playing with it.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.020]   And if you like Mind Maps, this is--
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:40.020]   Is it for brainstorming?
[01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.020]   Is that the IDN?
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.020]   It can be.
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:44.020]   It's also an interesting way to work out a concept in your head.
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.780]   I mean to me, Mind Maps can be a little undirected.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.620]   But C-Map is the name of this app.
[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:50.620]   I think it's Java.
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.300]   I need something to help me think.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.700]   So I might look at this.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.700]   I often try to think through it.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.500]   I gotta say, I think Omni Grapple is great.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.260]   Omni Grapple is great for just brainstorming.
[01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.780]   But what you're describing is fantastic pipelines.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:04.020]   Yeah, but also I do when I'm trying to figure out how we're going to build a show.
[01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:06.020]   Because a lot of times when we build new flows--
[01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.020]   Oh, you mean we'll work?
[01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:08.020]   When I say pipeline, I mean workflow.
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.020]   I'm not just looking at the camera.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.020]   Or like, I know all the cameras look into the computer.
[01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.020]   Well, but also here's what--
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:14.540]   Like for instance, it's like we're going to take Macbreak and we're going to record
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:15.540]   it here.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.940]   And then we're going to compress everything for offline.
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:19.460]   Then we're going to put it up on the server.
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.900]   And then these editors from all over the world are going to download it.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:22.900]   They're going to edit it.
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:24.740]   They're going to send their file back over here.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:28.100]   And for me to be able to describe that to people is very, very important.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:32.740]   And also it helps me because as I draw it out, I'll go, oh, but I'm forgetting this,
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:33.740]   this, this.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.740]   What do I do with this?
[01:02:34.740 --> 01:02:40.220]   And the action of actually doing it has me get a clear idea of what I'm actually doing.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:41.220]   If that makes any sense.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:42.220]   No, totally.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.420]   I mean, I think it actually helps you in your own head kind of work it out.
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:50.220]   So finally, I'm going to wrap up with a program that is not maybe something you need if you've
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:51.220]   been following along.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:56.900]   So that Rowan's a big fan of text expander, which is a great way of filling out text boilerplate
[01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:59.180]   when you type something a lot.
[01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.460]   It's probably the only way I've been able to handle my email overload is just by creating
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.540]   a lot of templates and pressing a couple of keys in a really right email for me.
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:10.580]   Ricardo Ettore who wrote, "Type it for me many years ago and has kept it alive on the
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:14.460]   max sent me in the notes saying, you ought to try this type of the phone on me because
[01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.460]   it'll go with the program too."
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.460]   And then you know what?
[01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.460]   I actually love it.
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.260]   There are reasons to use text expander and the reason you type it for me.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:24.980]   But I think that those of you who are text expander fans might want to just take a look.
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.980]   It's a free download.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:26.980]   It's a shareware program.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.220]   You can try it for free though.
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:35.140]   It has a lot of nice features in terms of pausing, filling in, posting, pacing in the clipboard.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:37.980]   And it's been very similar in many ways to text expander, but I think they've done a
[01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:38.980]   really nice job.
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:39.980]   It's classic though, right?
[01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.740]   No, it is OS 10 now.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:42.740]   Oh, see.
[01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:44.940]   Because last time I did type it for me, it was pretty.
[01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:49.420]   It is fully up to date and I think in many ways a compelling competitor.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.340]   I'm a big fan of text.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.700]   I'll definitely have a look at it.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.700]   It's worth looking at.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:58.860]   Mark Hurst did a review of type it for me for 43 folders back in the Jurassic days.
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:02.660]   It is Jurassic, but it's, and I didn't know it was up to date because Ricardo wrote this
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:03.660]   years ago.
[01:04:03.660 --> 01:04:04.660]   It is up to date.
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.420]   It's OS 10 fully in tell.
[01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:09.180]   And I have to say he's done a very nice job.
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.180]   I use it.
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.100]   I use text expander on one computer.
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.100]   I use type it for me.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.780]   By the way, it reads in the snippets.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.820]   It's a little bit, I have to say more flexible in the snippet handling the text expander.
[01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:23.740]   If there were one feature that I would say recommends it over text expander is it allows
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.820]   you to store snippets in a variety of different ways.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:30.780]   It's those snippets are the little boiler plates that you're saving and you can create
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:32.980]   quite a collection of them over time.
[01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:36.340]   So type it for me from Ricardo Etoire.
[01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:41.860]   And that wraps up this edition alive and in person for the first time all of us of Mac
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.540]   Break Weekly.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.740]   We will see you all next Tuesday.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:50.340]   And if you get it out by Tuesday, if not, we'll see you next Wednesday.
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:54.540]   I usually get it out the same day, but it's just how I work.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.180]   I just have a pipeline that's different than your pipeline.
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.180]   My pipeline.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.180]   No pressure.
[01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:00.180]   Better than your pipeline.
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:01.180]   No pressure.
[01:05:01.180 --> 01:05:02.180]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:04.180]   Now 20% more passive aggressive.
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.820]   Hey, thanks for joining us.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:07.540]   We'll see you next time on Mac Break Weekly.
