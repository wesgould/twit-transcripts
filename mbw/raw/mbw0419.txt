[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.320]   Back to Mac break weekly in fact, I think she was on Mac break weekly very early on very early on I just dean
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.840]   Hello
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.320]   Excited look great. Well, thank you. You didn't you didn't go to the event
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.160]   I thought about it
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.560]   I mean I actually had a Southwest ticket booked, but okay
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.080]   I can't do this because I don't I really don't have to go to jail because I would be really excited
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.780]   Oh, you want to camp you wanted to like the break in donuts 15 hours in LA
[00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.640]   So I'm still a little exhausted from that so that was good
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.880]   You were the first in line at the Dunkin donuts down there
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.440]   I was fourth, but I'm still proud I think you got on all the news though the first three people must have just been
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   losers
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.760]   Anyway great to have you back
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:03.920]   Justine became very famous for her iPhone bill was that the first iPhone? I think it was I actually had right here
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.960]   Which the new iPhone kind of looks like a squished down version of the old one does it back to round it?
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.240]   Yeah, I know I like it so just to recap Apple did announce a few products today nothing that we didn't expect
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.880]   In fact the rumor mill seemed to have gotten it pretty close to write on two new iPhones a 4.7 inch iPhone 6
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.360]   5.5 inch iPhone 6 plus both will be available for pre-order
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.520]   Friday the 12th of September for delivery on October September 19th
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.720]   So unlike some rumors it looks like the iPhone 5.5 will be available immediately
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.200]   They also announced as we expect an Apple pay
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.240]   System that allows you to touch to pay with the new iPhones using touch ID to verify your purchase
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.240]   We'll talk a little bit more about some of the features of that and
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.280]   They finally announced a watch. I was getting the point Alex Lindsey where I was starting to say there's no watch
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.160]   There's no watch, but there was and the Apple watch. Yeah
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:15.120]   We are also joined by a live camera at the Flint Center in Cupertino where the announcement just happened and
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.160]   As soon as Andy and Akko and Renee and Richie emerge because they were at the event we'll get their thoughts
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.240]   As well, and if we see anybody else coming out the door Tim Cook just a minute before we began walked by
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.280]   He's got to feel pretty good. This was a this I think there was a little bit of a
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.200]   Burden on him some pressure on him to perform
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.080]   This is not his first keynote since Steve Jobs left
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.840]   But it's but it's kind of the first new product that he's announced. Yeah, and he seemed really genuinely excited
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:49.040]   He seemed almost to the point where he was having trouble getting through his comments after they
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:57.240]   First announced the watch and really this is this is the first one where I felt like he wasn't in the shadow of Steve Jobs where he wasn't
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.760]   In the wake of the funeral of Steve Jobs and all that kind of stuff. He really seemed excited
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.480]   He really seemed to be in his element. I think the key is to keep Federighi off the stage Craig Federighi did not speak
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.080]   Eddy Q did sporting a quite a Frankie Valley lurk look
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.280]   Yeah, and we also saw Kevin Lynch one of Apple's newest employees formerly CTO at Adobe
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.160]   We now know I think that what Kevin was hired to do is run the I watch team
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.160]   He did the demo of the I watch
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.600]   Renee and Andy are right now looking at it in fact Renee just posted an Instagram
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.520]   Apparently the journalists are not able to that's on my screen right now. Yeah, there we go
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.880]   Apparently the journalists are not able to touch
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.240]   The watch but they do have actually working versions of the watch on display
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.960]   Justine I'm sure you were excited about the idea of an I watch or at Apple watch as they chose to call it
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.840]   So excited like I didn't actually think I was that excited until I started using like the pebble and then I know
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.280]   This is Mac break, but I do actually have a Samsung galaxy and I have the gear too
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.720]   So kind of using those two together
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.120]   I really actually got a feel for how awesome it is to have sort of that separate device for just taking photos really quickly
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.640]   To getting maps and just seeing text messages that might not be important
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.280]   And I knew as soon as Apple came out with their version of this
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.600]   There's there's gonna be no competition. I mean it looks amazing
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.840]   Although I'm kind of interested because I'm left-handed so I wear my watch on the opposite hand
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.280]   It's gonna still kind of interfere because the the little switch is gonna be on the opposite side
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:30.080]   No, you're right. I'm left-handed Sarah Lane is left-handed. We were both wondering if there'll be a way to reverse it as
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.760]   There is actually there probably could be yeah
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.320]   Lower instead of higher, but it would still work if you put it on that side
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.840]   I think we're just gonna have to get used to watching wearing a watch on our left hand
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.640]   I don't think I can do it
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.600]   Like you I've been using Android wear watches and the pebble watches rehearsal right and we're just saying well
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   Let's see what this could be
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.240]   Do you feel like Apple as solved some of the problems that these early attempts at smart watches
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.880]   They've solved something because the Android wear watches and the Samsung watches and the pebble have made
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   extreme
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.080]   Sort of
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:12.320]   Exceptions and and they've really I mean look at the look at the pebble one of the one of the early success stories in the smart watch space
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   The screen is like a Kindle. It's like super low-res like yeah, and so you know you think well that's the trade-off you make you you have a super low quality
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.280]   Low-res screen touch it's not touch and but you get great battery life
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.240]   And that's the trade-off and people accepted that trade-off and here when you look at this
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:36.040]   I thought Apple would make an elegant round you know much more rounded much smaller maybe a round watch face type device that was very thin
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.140]   They're really obsessed with thinness and yet this thing is
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.160]   enormously thick and fat and they did it clearly in order to have a super
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:51.040]   high-res screen with smooth animation and touch screen and all the rest series support and
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.680]   It's got to have a big enough battery to get you through the day presumably and so really they they didn't make
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:05.000]   Exceptions they they they really geared it toward power and not thinness lightness and all the rest watch won't be available till next year
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.280]   We know it'll be three forty nine the starting price three models available
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.680]   including the
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.680]   Apple watch edition
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.800]   Which is in 18 karat golds got to be a thousand bucks
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.280]   And I think it's interesting that we we saw Apple not release usually I mean in the in the near past
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.040]   They have not announced something that far in advance
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.200]   So they're usually ready to sell within the week within two weeks of announcing something
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.360]   I think I wonder whether they really just did this to sandbag all the other watches for Christmas
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.120]   You know like is what they've now done is basically said you know now
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.520]   We're gonna is it interesting to see what the sales look like for all these other watches because now they've said
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.960]   Hey, this is what you have to live up to no one can react to this in time
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.440]   And they're gonna come out and now they've and because obviously they weren't ready to do it right now
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.160]   But they're already enough to show it off
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.680]   And now they're what they're basically doing is having everybody who was going to finally maybe break down
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.200]   Wait until January to see what it looks like. It's called FUD Alex
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:08.280]   Yeah, and this is the this is the iPhone playbook because Steve Jobs when Steve Jobs announced the iPhone in January of 2007
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.160]   Everybody was like wow, this is a unique because usually Apple announces the thing and it's available right away
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.520]   But they did it for exactly the reason these phones were all coming out of the woodwork
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.160]   And he wanted to get in front of it and basically give people six months of not buying anything else
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.480]   Right so that they'd be ready to buy the iPhone. Which one are you gonna get?
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.080]   I just do you're gonna get I'm assuming you're gonna get it. Oh for sure
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.840]   I mean I if I could have bought it today
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.560]   I would have probably went and waited in line
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.720]   But I really like the rose gold because as I said I had the the Samsung the gear - I had the the gold one
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.520]   And I love the rose gold, but that's the hard thing too
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.720]   It's it's like how is this gonna match everything and they have the sport edition
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.720]   Which I love the edition of having all the health benefits of this because I've had so many watches and they just did not actually work
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.400]   So I'm finally really excited that Apple has kind of come into that space
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.240]   So it's gonna be interesting. I don't know I can't decide I can't make this decision
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.680]   I'm really stressful. They did solve one problem by having interchangeable bands
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:09.840]   That makes it really easy for you to at least have other bands so you can you can have some different looks
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:13.440]   We have a
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.080]   Early demo. This is from Bloomberg business. We could apparently
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:23.160]   Stan was able to oh there goes Stephen Fry. Let's take a quick look Stephen Fry leaving the
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.920]   Apple event he was there signing autographs tweeting
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.840]   Stephen Fry of course the British comedian and
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.720]   Star of QI on BBC I think he's holding a watch is he holding a watch
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:42.000]   If you're gonna give a watch to somebody I'd give it to Stephen Fry. That's for sure. He's holding something
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.880]   a
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.600]   Great it's great to see him. He is such a talent and of course that was it one of the things
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.400]   It's interesting about this event. They had a large space and did apparently invite people from entertainment and from fashion
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.360]   Because after all if you're gonna sell a thousand dollar watch or even a 350 dollar watch
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.360]   You've got to get people in fashion wearing it well that adds the cache or when the press is there and everything else
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.840]   I'm seeing these different stars and celebrities it kind of been almost a Ted or a kind of thing that here's Sam
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.600]   Growbart from a business week Bloomberg business week
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:22.340]   He he's actually doing the first hands-on of the watch looks like Apple watch actually
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.480]   They don't have to play is that is audio the watch looks like it's in a demo mode. He's not touching anything
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.400]   So whether they have a working watch or not. I don't know. I mean it's
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:36.600]   Now there was a point of controversy early when we first saw the interface that we're looking at it's going on
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:42.440]   So apparently something weird is going on to sell fry right now. I don't know if they're taking a jump to that
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.520]   Apparently has decided to kidnap one of the fans
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.960]   Maybe he's showing him the watch
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:55.080]   What is go? I bet you that's an Apple employee who said hey Stephen can I show you something?
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.360]   Oh, no, there's a selfie and he couldn't see the screen because he's got a so sad
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.440]   iPhone or Stephen Fry
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:05.720]   This if anybody ever tells me that Stephen Fry is not nice to his fans. I'm gonna show them this video
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.120]   And say this man gave this guy ten minutes
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.740]   We got so far so far. That's the king of the so back to
[00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:22.360]   It's it's clearly in a demo mode. It's doing stuff, but not stuff that the reporters were triggering so
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.080]   You know evidently if you're
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:31.040]   It's not fun exactly. I mean remember Apple had four or five working prototypes of the iPhone when they announced it in June
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.180]   2007 they had I don't know how many working iPads when they announced
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.060]   January and it took them months to get those I think it's working
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.860]   I think that the I think that what they don't have is probably working at this point
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.580]   It's not that it's not working
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:45.940]   I think that it's not being produced in mass yet
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.820]   You know and I think that that the factories haven't really turned on and there are more than a few
[00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.980]   I mean if you look at the demo table, there's dozens of them on the demo table, so I
[00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:02.020]   The site right now on the Apple website and apparently the story is up you can't order this watch obviously
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:09.100]   but he's only showing two sizes 38 millimeter and 42 millimeter. This is one of the issues justine that a lot of
[00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.940]   People have referred to is that these watches are so big they really seem suited for men's risk
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.780]   But not for women's risks. Do you mind wearing a bigger watch?
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:23.060]   I don't I think a lot of people that's kind of like the trend right now at least is like wearing like the big chunky watches
[00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.420]   But I mean but they do have the smaller version
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.060]   So I don't know if that's gonna like kind of be able to like hinder being able to see the screen
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.060]   I'll probably get the larger one actually
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.740]   I don't know. This is all gonna depend what it looks like in person. I'm so sad. I'm not there
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.580]   I just see that it's a custom version of
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:41.980]   iOS I'm guessing they mentioned an a one processor
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.620]   It obviously has some motion detection capability J Blonik
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:53.740]   18 year consultant at Nike a fitness expert came on stage to demo the fitness features of the new Apple Watch
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:55.740]   I'm gonna have to get used to saying Apple Watch and
[00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:00.620]   He talked about how one of the one of the things the health kit could do is monitor
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:05.660]   Whether you're standing or sitting and tell you how many times you've stood up and you'll get a nice ring
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:08.900]   If you stand up 12 times and in a day and things like that
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:13.220]   So some activity monitoring they have a pulse rate monitor on the back stand for that
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:22.220]   Do you use a fitness band of any kind just into it to monitor your I do I've used pretty much every single one and then
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.860]   I think fit that is still my favorite, but also you seem like the misfit shine. I
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.060]   Love that one. I do some is these are all just glorified pedometers
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:34.540]   And I really if this is gonna be anything useful
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.220]   It's got a you you brought this up Mike
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:41.780]   It's got to be able to measure for instance or was it you it was you Alex lifting weights and you know
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:47.260]   My none of these devices will know that I'm riding an exercise bicycle or a regular bicycle for that matter
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.820]   I mean, I think that's good why this has integrated with the the heart rate and stuff like that
[00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.300]   I've used the basis fitness watch
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:59.220]   Which is probably one of the ones that is closest to actually being able to have an accurate heart rate and kind of monitor that
[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:04.900]   Because that's really the only way you're gonna be able to actually tell if you're actually doing something instead of just walking around
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.180]   But a lot of them aren't that accurate either
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:13.380]   So I'm hoping that Apple was finally solve this issue and even with the same song whenever it would it would be too hot
[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.420]   Or you would sweat it would just stop working
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.940]   So I'm hoping that that's not a problem that they're gonna run into as well
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.300]   And he and I co apparently got to put the watch on as well and it made his eyes
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.060]   Pop out. It's on my screen right now chat if you want to show that
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:37.420]   It is a very fashionable look look at how elegant that looks, you know, and he's a big guy and it doesn't look big on his
[00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:42.660]   What risk in fact it looks a little small. Yeah, he needs he needs the big one. He needs the Apple watch plus. Oh
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:46.540]   But that's interesting he he does seem happy
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.500]   He has a Moto 360 on the other wrist so
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:56.820]   embarrassment of riches one of the things they mentioned is that the new Apple pay will work with this watch
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.540]   But what they didn't mention is how well authenticate when they demonstrated Apple pay using the phone
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:07.420]   And by the way you requires an iPhone 6 or 6 plus to use apples new payment system you use the fingerprint reader to authenticate
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:12.500]   I'm not sure how it would work with a watch the only sensor I could see was on the back which is a pulse
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.580]   heart rate monitor and those heart rate monitors that the
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:21.180]   Your gear has one doesn't it Justine they only work when you're not moving
[00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:28.180]   Yeah, you have to not move or don't talk either because it'll also kind of throw off the accuracy of your heart rate
[00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.500]   Which is it's kind of crazy because even if you're like working out you're like this isn't doing anything
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:38.260]   Yeah, it's a limited use. It's not you know, it's not a real heart rate monitor if you can't measure your workout
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.940]   One thing that Eric Smalane asked on the question engine is could Apple be using this the wrist
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:48.700]   Biometric sensors for Apple pay authentication in place of touch ID. I don't think so
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.100]   I don't think I only gets ready yet
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.820]   I think that that somewhere down the road that could happen
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.620]   But yeah, probably not in the first version it is a touchscreen and you can talk to it
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:00.300]   You can answer phone calls with it and talk to Siri and give Siri commands with it. That's kind of cool
[00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.740]   It's nice that you can use it on the older phones, too
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:09.380]   So that's not alienating anybody all the way up to what for do they say the iPhone 4? I think so
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.620]   Oh wait a minute. No, it's all the fives because it does need Bluetooth Ellie. So it starts with the five
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.220]   the five not five see
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:23.300]   Well the 4s was the first with a Bluetooth Ellie and so it could include
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.340]   But I don't think it did
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.940]   It have to be iOS 8 and also maybe well see and you could put it for AC
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.300]   But I always say that on a 4s according to Apple
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:37.460]   So I'm not sure what the hold up is but I think on the screen they showed it you need a five or later
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:43.340]   I love the mag safe charging most of these watches have the most annoying charging systems
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.740]   They've got like these things we have to like snap them into place
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.100]   Yeah, and it never actually works. This is really nice
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:52.900]   yeah, my my Android wear and most of them have pogo pins on the back that you have to dock it and
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:18:00.820]   They didn't say Qi charging. I bet it's not Qi charging knowing Apple. They're not gonna use a proprietary charging technology
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.420]   But they have a little disc that snaps right into the back of the watch magnetically
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:10.220]   And so that'll make it easy to charge. I gotta tell you though and notice all the heat that Motorola is taking because of
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.460]   questionable battery life on the Moto 360
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.340]   Apple didn't say anything about battery life. I'm sure that as you said, that's why it's so thick
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.340]   But if you don't get through you got to get
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.140]   16 hours, right? Yeah, not just through a day
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.460]   You have to be able to get up at seven o'clock in the morning and have it still working at eleven o'clock on Friday night
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:31.380]   I agree, you know and because if it just goes out at like 730 p.m. Then that's your watch exactly
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.740]   Well, I think that there's a lot of things that you'd wanted to do that some of the fitness bands will do is you know
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.980]   For instance monitor new overnight so on so forth and I think those independent, you know, that's an other battery issue
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.980]   Yeah, I won't be able to be I use
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.820]   What is it sleep as Android or something like that? How long does that battery last?
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.860]   And supposedly it works on this but the problem is this gets to you through a day and a little bit more, right?
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.860]   You don't want to wear it all night
[00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.740]   I
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.020]   Know I you know people have been making a big deal about how the pebble goes three four five days
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:03.860]   And none of these other watches go for more than a day. I have to charge my phone every night
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.860]   I don't mind charging my watch every night, right?
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.220]   I would like at least two days though. That would be why
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.580]   Because a lot of times especially if you're traveling you do a lot of sleepovers
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:16.460]   Not really but it is like the traveling thing
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.220]   Although there'll be times where I'm not able to you know get to an outlet
[00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:25.420]   And I mean I never leave the house without a mophie or two because you can't get through the day without any of that
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.780]   So as long as you're able to sort of charge that but it's just another thing this battery life is so frustrating
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.780]   I gotta solve this. Yeah, I
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.820]   agree
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:40.180]   I just seen is here justine is Eric at I just seen on Twitter and she's so great. How many YouTube channels do you have now eight?
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:45.380]   I cut down the three. Oh wow. I cut back. I was like I can't do this. I need you stressed out
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.740]   I need how to play video game. I think her sister Jenna is behind her right there
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:55.380]   She was there she's so camera shot so nice to have you back in
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.460]   Alex introduced us way back when
[00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:03.060]   Yes, we met back at an uncamp justine and I met back in uncamp in Pittsburgh
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:07.700]   Was the word press camp or something like that? It was it was a it was a podcast. It was a podcast
[00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.820]   That uncamp that hot camp Pittsburgh or whatever and there was just one
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.020]   I was doing a green screen talk and there was one person asking all the questions
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:21.500]   That was just the I remember we were doing the Mac break weekly at the 21st dimension amendment brewery
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:27.400]   So this was maybe eight years ago five or seven years ago and a beautiful woman sits down at the table
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.060]   It immediately starts doing stuff on our phone. I thought I think she's in the wrong she's in the wrong place
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:38.240]   She doesn't belong here. I had my sprint trio. I remember that was a trio. It was a trio
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.860]   Even then click click click click click click click
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:49.020]   And so Alex is here too, and of course Michael we're gonna take a break. We're still watching the door
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:55.260]   So to speak across the street from the Flint Center in Cupertino as soon as somebody emerges
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:21:01.340]   We'll see if we can grab some people. We're looking for a big black hat and a Canadian guy
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.780]   Renee Richie and Eddie and I go in there somewhere sounds like an episode of Rocky and Bull and
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:12.620]   We'll talk to them in a minute from Cupertino our show today brought to you by our good friends at Shutterstock
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.460]   I was watching what was the movie? I was just watching a movie and at the end of the credits
[00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:22.140]   I said Shutterstock thanks to Shutterstock Doc. I even movies even major Hollywood films use Shutterstock
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:29.060]   I'm guessing they use a film clips video clips from Shutterstock. They have 40 million more than 40 million high quality stock photos
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:34.500]   Illustrations vectors and video clips all royalty free. That means you pay once and you can use them
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.980]   The the contributors there are so good many of them professional
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.380]   photographers videographers and artists of course they review every image
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:49.140]   For content and quality before they add it to the library and that's a good thing. See there's the editorial stuff
[00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:54.180]   Look at that. That is so great. So I mean really there's a lot of reason that you would need Shutterstock
[00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:58.900]   It's not just images in illustrations. It's editorial too very useful
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.500]   They add more than a quarter million new images every single week. So that's why that's important
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.860]   They've got a really good search engine at Shutterstock.com very sophisticated
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.580]   I've never seen better you could search and drill down by subject by color
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:18.180]   Literally that color. They'll give you a color wheel. You can say I only want blue iPhone images and you'll get that
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.900]   You could even say I want two people in it one man one woman
[00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:25.580]   You have an you can say what emotion they're expressing
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:29.580]   It's just incredible. I want you to play with it. In fact, you can create a free account right now

[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:40.420]   They have an amazing iPad app
[00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:44.740]   Webby award winner at that's just gorgeous. They're now on Android as well

[00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.580]   For ID. It's great for blog ideas if you're a blogger
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.060]   You got to have it if you're a blogger that's just all there is to it you if you do if you have a non visual blog
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:14.500]   You're dead in the water one picture every post. That's the rule at least and they have they have they have images that don't look like
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:21.020]   Like stock photos. Well, that's the most important thing right good. So if you're writing a thing about there's Apple, right?
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.180]   Yeah, and so yeah, it's fantastic
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:23.660]   I used a lot
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.500]   I mean I've used these in films TV shows
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.180]   I mean the big thing is do the math when you're when you're building one of those one of the things we've done a lot of is
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:34.140]   Taking some of the city images that they have that helicopter image here comes Andy Anako
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.460]   He's coming on over so let's finish this up once you decide to purchase a shutter stock use the offer
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:45.020]   Code Mac break 914 and you're gonna get 20% off image subscription packages. That's a good deal
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.340]   We actually have a 25 image a day package. It's great
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:54.220]   Shutterstock comm use the offer code Mac break 914 for September 14th and 20% off
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:59.820]   image packages at Shutterstock we think I'm so much for the support of Mac break weekly now
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:06.300]   This is gonna be a little bit like talking to Afghanistan because we are down there in Cupertino using something called a live
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:10.460]   View we've used it before it's yours and I thank you for lending it to us that gives us a connection
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:17.700]   Live in real time via LTE, but there is some internet latency. So we think there's one or two seconds three
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.620]   It's right. It's well to them. It's set to three. Okay, so they'll be you can you turn it down?
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:27.340]   I can take it over. We're getting a great image. I can't believe it. We'll see what it looks like when we turn it down turn it down
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.740]   We don't need to see Andy and I deaf
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:34.220]   I mean look at look at I'm used to seeing him high. We're used to seeing him in
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:39.980]   There I don't know what's going on with the camera. There we go Andy Anaka and I don't know if he's gonna be able to hear me
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:46.460]   But let's see if he can Andy is in Cupertino Andy welcome to Mac break weekly. We're joined by I Justine
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:54.700]   Mike Elgin Alex Lindsey and I already have seen the tweet you put out of you bulging your eyes bulging with the apple watch
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:00.940]   No, I'm just it's pretty darkened there
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:24.060]   So if you want to get those diopters functioning in your own my metapro
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.700]   What does the screen look like it's a obviously a high res screen yet
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:35.340]   Yeah, the the resolution on the screen is fantastic
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.100]   You really have to strain your eyes to see any pixels whatsoever
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:44.140]   Obviously every time apple doesn't event like this they create a room in which their screens look great
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.780]   But even under those conditions you have to say that that screen looked great big punchy colors
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:52.860]   There is a mode where it's showing you there's a special button when you punch it
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:26:00.060]   You sit you see pictures of your favorite contacts and every picture in there looked like a beautiful tiny little cameo portrait
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.620]   As opposed to just like an avatar little icon
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:05.900]   It's really you have really really quite a treat to use it
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.220]   The weight is surprising
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:12.140]   Well, they do have three different models if you have the sport model that's made out of a special kind of aluminum
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.860]   That feels pretty okay. It feels it feels about the same weight as the motor 360 on my wrist
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:21.740]   Which is so light that oftentimes I forget that I have it on I go go back in the bedroom to get it off the charger
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.780]   Oh, wait. No, you actually have it on if you have the stainless steel model
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.100]   That's a big chunk of watch
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.980]   Not so much that it's going to intimidate you
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.460]   I mean if you're familiar with high quality watches you have definitely felt watches the solid before
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.820]   But maybe you're not quite expecting to be that big everything's rounded over there's no blemishes
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:44.220]   There's it's so the fit and finish is perfect. They have a the leather magnetic watch band
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.740]   Is the one that I wore that instead of having a buckle like this?
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:52.060]   It just simply flaps over itself and and holds fast which means it's infinitely
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.060]   Adjustable and I was maybe maybe I should have asked first
[00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:01.180]   But after they put this on my wrist I went like this to see if it would fall off and was it was holding just perfectly fine
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.900]   Yeah, I would have done the same thing because I I'm not sure I trust in magnet those bands do look
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:12.540]   Really nice. So what so what do you think any uh, you're gonna charge 39 bucks
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:21.900]   Uh for the it depends on which one you get the the cheapest one is that I have to go back to my nose to find exactly what it is
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.500]   It looks it's typical pricing
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:29.420]   I thought for an apple product which is it's certainly more expensive than whatever the rest of the industry has decided is
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.340]   Then the going right for this sort of product but not so much expensive that you wouldn't say well
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.900]   Health it I'll wait a few more months or I'll make this the kids combined birthday and christmas present
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:42.620]   Uh, it's what moraine's to be seen is how well all this stuff works together
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.700]   Because as you say there's the one thing you absolutely were not allowed to do was to touch it
[00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:52.620]   Uh, there's Jason snell is the hero of our little group because he actually was able to put a finger on it
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:57.420]   Uh, and I think that whoever was letting do that has was hustled out under a bag
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.860]   But yeah, we were very I tried to even take I met some of friends of mine who worked for apple
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:08.700]   One of which who had one on and it was like, uh, I can't let I can't show you this and I can't let you do this and that's okay
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.060]   So that's fine. You have to ask anyway
[00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:13.740]   So that's that's no different than what the the original iPhone was like
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.620]   Uh, I I got a briefing for that one
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.460]   In which I got to actually use one of these things that was three months away from being shipped
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.500]   And there are a couple of things that it worked except for one or two apps that weren't ready yet
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:31.500]   So maybe that's the situation because obviously if you let just 100 different journalists peak pro poke and prod
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.780]   They're gonna find the one app that's just a jpeg and then they say oh, well, you know, they know it's the app isn't functional
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.300]   It's just a painting and then they're they might using that tone of voice and they're writing
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.740]   Do something that's completely unhelpful and uncalled for uh, so I'm not
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.420]   It'd be interesting to have a more a greater picture based on that
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:52.620]   But you get what you get the most interesting thing that I found is that not a peep as to what the battery life is
[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:59.420]   Uh, it was I was so scraping for details that I had to take quick notes as Tim Cook was talking about this wonderful
[00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:06.380]   Inductive magnetic charging system and I heard him say it's so easy to you you're gonna find this so easy to connect to the charger
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.820]   Every night anyway, look at this styling in the bands and so I don't know if that means that they are expecting one
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:16.460]   One day of life per charge, but we'll see how that goes again so many unanswered questions
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.420]   But I think that what we were looking for is does this thing look like it's something that's cool
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:27.180]   Does it immediately sort of activate the lizard part of your brain that says acquire acquire acquire?
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:34.380]   And it certainly did that uh certainly to a better extent than any of the uh android where watches from algae or samsung
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:39.660]   And the moto the moto 360. I think this is a really really nice watch. I've been wearing it for the past four or five days
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.580]   I've been testing it for review later this week and i've been finding it very very useful
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.980]   And even that doesn't look quite so nice compared to the apple watch
[00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.180]   And I was surprised that I would like a square wristwatch like this
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.260]   But again like so many things they solve the problem
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:59.020]   Andy uh, we should talk about phones too because I mean as as much attention as the watch is getting
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:03.420]   Apple did announce new phones 4.7 and 5.5 inch iPhone
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.980]   6 is what give us your thoughts on that
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:15.340]   Uh, the 5.5 is a wonderful device it might might my realize that when i'm talking to you today
[00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:20.140]   I'm talking about immediate reactions and my first reaction is this could be finally the perfect phone
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.580]   Uh, because the size is right where you want it to be it's roughly pop tart sized
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.300]   But it's not like the size of pop tarts when we were kids
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.940]   There's the new kind where they're only like a few ounces lighter
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.580]   But it's large enough that you feel like you're having a real experience with a phone in the media that you're using
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.620]   But not so big that I can't imagine sticking this in a pocket somewhere
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.780]   And the oddly they made some nice
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:49.500]   Adjustments to how to use a phone like this one handed now if you double tap the touch id
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.860]   Uh, the top half of the the the tire screen shifts downward and leaves the top half of the screen blank
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.180]   So that puts the top half of touch controls
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:03.980]   Underneath your thumb and then to dismiss it. I wasn't able to intuitively figure out how to dismiss it without tapping something
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.700]   But if you do action something then it goes back up again
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:11.100]   They turning it on its side will uh turn into like a you have an ipad like effect
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:16.700]   The thing that kind of surprised me was I was trying to do like a three and four-finger gestures that
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.500]   You can do on the ipad like if you're on its side nap go like that
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.860]   And you'll go back to the home screen that didn't seem to work
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.140]   But that might be because i'm not used to doing it on such a small screen
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.220]   Or they could have just simply said, you know what that's ridiculous people are going to people are not going to want to use it
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.060]   To do that way so we're not going to make it like that. I will say something that
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.580]   Uh
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:39.500]   We were all looking forward to 5.5 inches. We're all looking forward to 4.7 inches
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.820]   What I really came across with as impressed as I was with the rest of the stuff is
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:47.900]   What a change it is when you round the corners of all of these devices
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.300]   We haven't seen that you know since uh the iphone 2 i'm so the i the iphone 3
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.220]   And this one's even better than the iphone 3gs because the entire thing is rounded and
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:01.820]   We've been holding these sharp edged iphone 4s and 5s in our hands and i guess not like oh my god
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.900]   My hand these hop corners i can hardly take it
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.660]   But when you have these smooth features inside this thing that you're going to be holding for
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:09.980]   5 10 even 20 minutes at a time
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.260]   It's so soothing. It's so comfortable. You really like that tactile interface
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.180]   So it's not so much that if I had just bought an iphone 5s three months ago
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.260]   I would throw it away and buy an iphone 6
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.500]   But boy if I were even 20 percent away from being on the fence
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.260]   Holding that says you know what if I want to be using a phone for the next two years
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:30.940]   I think this is the one I want to be using well and even more importantly apple's
[00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:35.820]   Third announcement was apple pay and that will require
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:42.700]   Either the watch or an iphone 6 and that looks like they nailed it as well. What are your thoughts there?
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.260]   It really is the way that I would like to see it done
[00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:57.020]   In that it's not you would hate it if it's only have we've brought a board the apple store and starbucks and best buy
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.500]   And we're hope we're making deals with other retailers
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.860]   No, they went to the source. They said here are the major credit card trans actors
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:08.140]   We will make sure that every major u.s. Credit card is is is supported and at least the big three
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.060]   Are are in the are in the ballpark?
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:15.580]   Also, we're going to target the biggest retailers to make sure that their point of sale display systems work fine
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.660]   This is actually a really timely announcement because
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.100]   It's important to it's important to know how to
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:27.980]   How to treat this like an endurance event. I got in my pocket here. I have I've been I'm gonna stop at wall greens
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.060]   Literally on the way over there to get you know
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:34.780]   Some protein bars because you never know if you're going to be if you're going to be a little bit hypoglycemic at around one or two
[00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:36.940]   But you still got to make your deadline
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:41.180]   And so when it stopped off with wall greens on the way, oops, sorry, I'm losing my earphone here
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.420]   Stopped off at wall greens on the way
[00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.660]   And my card would not work not because I don't have three dollars worth of credit
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:53.100]   In on my card but because there's a little tiny little nick in the mag stripe and so I have to just go
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:58.380]   Four or five times finally had to use that trick where you wrap it in a plastic bag and that made it work
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:03.340]   And so I think that sometimes there's some days I feel as though I am not one of God's beloved
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.500]   Some days you feel like you're one of God's chosen
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.460]   So when you find yourself needing to write about a new advanced method of retail payment
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.220]   God gives you a situation like that to use as your lead-off paragraph
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.380]   It really just show off in addition to the security features which all look great
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:21.100]   The convenience factor is going to be great as well
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:27.340]   And that by the way is pointing out why you need an iPhone 6 or 6 plus because it's not just an update to an operating system
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:33.660]   It really is a piece of silicon inside that device that does nothing but hold trusted information so that
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.740]   No bad people can get at it
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.740]   The other surprising thing is that
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.580]   Even the I will even the apple watch have to stop saying I watch start saying apple watch
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.700]   Yeah, the apple watch can also use this system as well
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:49.020]   Based on the video or the photo they use i'm guessing that the NFC
[00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.020]   Antenna is right at the very very top here because you notice that whereas
[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.700]   In the phone videos, they just sort of held it very very closely
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.660]   They didn't even necessarily seem to tap it with the with a watch
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.580]   They seem to be very explicitly holding the top edge of it on that pad there
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.900]   So yeah, I mean i'm not sure that it's
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:13.500]   It's there's a small difficulty between the payment system and the watch system is that they're not making something that is platform agnostic
[00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:19.340]   If you want to run windows phone, god love you, but if you want to run an android phone, you can't use this payments
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.860]   You can't use this watch
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:25.260]   And so they really are underscoring once again that if you buy into apple
[00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.820]   We will pay you off in the form of great things that make it all work together really really well
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.260]   So i'm a little bit disappointed that they haven't solved the problem for everybody
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.340]   They've just solved the problem for people
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.700]   I want to show you real quickly. This is part broken, but
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:43.420]   We've nice. Yeah, this is a video from joshua tokoski of that
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:50.860]   Of that mode that you were talking about where it slides down the one-handed mode on the five and a half as soon as you touch the home button
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.100]   Um, that's a little weird. That's gonna take a little getting used to but i'm sure you can turn that off
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:00.300]   Andy did you get the file? I know you wanted to file for the chicago sun times. You want to run run and do that
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:09.020]   I have not filed yet if you got any more questions. I'll answer them. Fortunately, I'm not
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.300]   I'm not an gadget guy who has to be tweeting right from the event
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.100]   I I am the obiwan who thinks and considers and then counts as an advice
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.100]   So I if I file this off to new instead of right now, that's perfectly. Oh, all right
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:26.700]   Because I know we'd like to keep you around if we can and i'm breaking it into impressions so that I can tax deduct
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:30.380]   I'm trying to tax deduct some jedi robes. I'd like to get made
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.900]   So please encourage me to keep doing i'll get us some pressure indeed
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:40.220]   W-1 indeed hang in there. Andy and not co he's live from the flint center in kubertina where he's just come out of the apple event
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:44.860]   Renee richy will pop in at a moment's notice. I'm sure and maybe we can get both of them on
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.620]   At the same time
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.420]   Um, so gee can you hang out for just a few more minutes? Andy?
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.140]   Want to see one want to see the goodies that we got afterwards? Yeah, what'd you get?
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.260]   Watch yeah, I think I think you want to see what I what I was handed when I left
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.420]   Don't know yet because I haven't opened it. All right. Let's see it. Oh, winner is a reveal
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:03.020]   Like that I literally have not opened this ear see it's christmas card
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:08.860]   It's a reveal boxing and hey look it's pictures of of the watch of people use postcards watch
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.100]   Oh, this is what you don't have
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:17.020]   Interesting because I'm see I can't see what this big it's actually this is like creskin
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:19.340]   It's like this boom
[00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.780]   Describe the sound of an exploding goat
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.940]   So so Andy
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.540]   Maybe you can answer the big. Oh, yeah, little nice little nice little chotch key to send us home with
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:33.980]   Uh, no, you know at one point at one point. I thought he was gonna say pointed if I find out that
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:40.380]   At one point I thought he was gonna say and you're all going home with one today and he didn't and I'm a picture of one
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.300]   Yeah, you got a picture. Well, that's that's good. That's good enough. You know that
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.900]   You can see you can see the big the big white box behind us
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:54.380]   And of course I've spent like the past week just idly sort of wondering why do they need a space that big if they're using a facility
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:38:01.020]   And a lot of ideas like maybe they don't like the for the after event facilities. I don't have a good green rooms
[00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.340]   Maybe they don't have a good demo room. Pardon me was
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:11.900]   Maybe they have 500 watches and they need a way to distribute them to 500 people in a methodical fashion
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.260]   And to keep them secure in a property that they control
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.980]   That was wishful thinking but it's
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:24.140]   Why wishful thinking about something you don't like it's having wishful thinking about a samsung smart watches is it would be pathetic
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.940]   Yeah, oh, I wish they'd give us that no no not at all
[00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:30.780]   All right. Hey, Andy and I go down there in kupertino doing yoman work
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:36.460]   We are live we have a little bit as you probably noticed of latency, but that's still amazing that we're able to talk to you
[00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:41.340]   This is almost like a real tv operation. Mike. It looked like you had some questions. I have two questions
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:47.340]   The questions of the day so far you know, you're not concerned. I'm even doing the less nesman thing because the earpiece is falling off
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:52.620]   This is absolutely accurate 24th century media with the old with the old world charm. It's perfect, Andy
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:54.780]   It's absolutely perfect. Please keep doing that. Happy
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.820]   New apple watch. Okay, so the big two apple
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:02.860]   Come
[00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.860]   pewter
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:09.020]   I think he's I think he's been looking at pencils to my witness. I thought bono could fly
[00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:14.300]   All right, so a couple of questions the first is what happened to sapphire on the phones
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:17.660]   And secondly, how do you authenticate the watch for a purchase?
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.620]   I
[00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:26.060]   He may not have heard me
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.220]   Happy
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.260]   New
[00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.260]   I can any can you hear us at all?
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:37.020]   This is this damn we were doing so good. Oh, yeah, I can hear you now. Oh, you're gone for a few seconds. I guess
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:43.180]   So mike wanted to know uh go ahead and say it again. I'm yeah, so uh the first question is what happened to sapphire on the phones
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:50.540]   We're we're expecting a least sapphire on the big iPhone and what and how do you authenticate a purchase with the with the apple watch? Any idea?
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:56.780]   I'm not hearing you. Okay, so all right, we're gonna take it back to the studio
[00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:02.380]   But let's go back down there when we get that working and uh and when when they were rich he has stumped by
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:07.020]   But it's really nice to be able to talk directly to somebody who's already used the devices
[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.420]   I'm as excited about to be honest
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:16.220]   I'm as excited about the iPhone 5.5 inch the 6 plus as I am about the I watch and the good news is we are going to be able to get that
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:21.020]   Uh now I think they're changing batteries is with no, I'm changing the latency. Oh, thank you
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:25.980]   Apparently, uh, Alex has control of all of this. I'm running running the live view from here
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:32.060]   If only Alex had been running the live stream for apple, did you have the same problems justine as we did?
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.060]   Were you hearing chinese?
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:39.340]   I am glad I was not live streaming the things that I was saying trying to watch this. I had like three computers
[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:40.380]   I'm like
[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:45.820]   Throwing things and swearing I was it was so frustrating and I'm trying to watch like the live feed
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.500]   And also watching like text updates and like these text updates are not doing it justice
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:55.660]   And then there was a translator over top of it. It was a disaster until almost halfway through it was really embarrassing
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.700]   I think they should add you do it
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.340]   Yes
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.340]   I
[00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:11.900]   You know, I will say in in in in apples defense those with a number of people watching and the number of moving parts
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.060]   Lots of very very difficult streams to pull off. They have done better in the past
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:21.100]   But they haven't had as many moving parts. They haven't tried to probably send translations to china. You know, there's a lot of things
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.340]   that
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.780]   These these events are the biggest thing we do all year long I can imagine
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:32.540]   Kind of traffic millions of people hitting the CDN so Akama is getting and what we probably saw was issues with
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.020]   What happens is is that the edge network?
[00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:39.260]   Is you're getting it and what's happening some of them are going down because they're just getting overwhelmed
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.500]   I mean, that's that's my guess. So let me see. I think we maybe have got can you hear me now?
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.660]   Andy or he's he's taking a picture with his motor actually. I am so jealous
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.860]   I'm gonna
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:55.100]   I'm gonna kill you and I want that Moto X and I want that Moto 360. Of course
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:59.020]   I'll be getting an iPhone 5 5 8 10 days. So I can't wait
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:03.420]   Do you want to fly like 12,000 miles in one week? No, no
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.860]   Yeah, Andy was in Chicago for the Motorola announcement last week
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:13.500]   And now he's in kubertino and he's going back home. I know tonight because I I saw you're uh, you're uh, your email
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   So, um, we're really thrilled you were able to come out and spend this time with us
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.940]   Let me reiterate. I think he can't hear you Mike. He can hear me, but he can't hear you
[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.100]   So let me reiterate Mike's questions. There were two
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:29.820]   We thought there was gonna be sapphire on these phones and they didn't mention sapphire at all sapphire on the watch for sure
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.420]   and
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.500]   Where where's the sapphire and the second question?
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:40.620]   How do they say how you would be able to authenticate the uh apple watch during an apple pay transaction?
[00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:47.420]   Uh, well the the sapphire question is that uh, no, it is a it is a glass cover
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.580]   Uh, they said they mentioned that during the keynote someone else told me that uh during the demo room
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:55.020]   Uh, the covers for the watch are actually sapphire
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:59.740]   So if they're putting a little bit of elfin uh, elfin uh, johnny. I have a special material magic
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:02.780]   That's where it's going. Uh, and I'm sorry. I didn't hear the second question you had
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.620]   How are they doing authentication for apple pay on the uh apple watch?
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.500]   Because they were using touch ID. I believe on the phone
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.500]   Uh
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:14.060]   Well, not just touch ID but also
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:20.860]   The uh, a simple tab to pay the idea that if you've authenticated this device and you are using this this trusted device
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:25.420]   It must be okay. Uh, I admit that I have not gone that deep of a dive into that question
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.620]   It is a good question
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:30.220]   I think that the the impression that I got through the demos and again
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:34.700]   I've not had a behind the scenes meeting with apple or anything so I didn't get a chance to ask that particular question
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:42.300]   uh, but uh, the great thing about the uh, about uh, uh, about uh, the the touch is that that would be a
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:45.900]   Step removed from the authentication and the payment process
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:51.260]   They they set up a couple of they they went through a couple of scenarios in which it really just seemed as simple as I just
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:52.940]   Want to put my thumb here and now I own this thing
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:59.660]   Although that worked more on the online side of things than it did at the actual point of sale areas
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.940]   But that's a good question. Uh, really it looks like their big sell for this isn't so much the fingerprint
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:12.300]   Authentication so much as we have a special dedicated chip that does nothing but to keep credit card and transaction information secure
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:19.500]   Not only that but we have a back end and we've got agreements with these other companies that say that the person that you're paying has no idea
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:23.660]   Uh, how you're doing this transaction only that money goes from point a to point b
[00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:29.260]   Uh, they also of course made a big deal out of saying no we're if we don't want any of your personal information
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.460]   We don't know where you're spending your money what you're buying or how much you're paying
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:36.140]   That's all between you and the person you're buying something from so I don't know
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:41.340]   I they certainly I don't know if they arranged for the heist of home depot, uh, consumer data
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:46.540]   Specifically to make this a little bit more interesting and a little bit more relevant, but the timing could not possibly have been better
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:54.300]   Andy and ico and flint center and kubertina will have more with andi in just a little bit. We've turned the latency down. I didn't know there's a knob
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:58.940]   And Alex has turned the latency down. So I think it's going to work a little bit, uh, better
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.460]   Alex lindsey did have to go
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:05.980]   We thank you Alex for setting this up for us and giving us the live view which uh, really has made a big difference in our coverage
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:09.180]   We hope rene richie will wander by and andi if you see anybody else
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:13.420]   Uh that you recognize you want to pull them over to the microphone and uh and interview them
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:20.540]   Please, uh be my guest. I'll key i'm watching if you need like steven fry. Yeah, did you get to talk to him? We saw i'm signing autographs
[00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:24.380]   steven fry was totally there
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:31.340]   Uh, he had a handler with him and unfortunately i made eye contact with the handler first rather than steven fry and so therefore i was
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:36.780]   Coward into not he did nothing to the handler made did nothing to cause me to cower
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:41.900]   But it made me think that perhaps i would make this handler's day a little bit better if i did not say hello to steven fry
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:48.780]   And so i said out of respect for steven fries handler if i i decided i'd give i've given steven fries handler respect by association
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.540]   Because i certainly would have left steven fry alone if i saw i'm at a coffee shop reading a good book
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.180]   Himself i felt as though if i
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:01.100]   By association so he so the handler got off a little bit easy because we have we have 10 seconds of any
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:03.260]   Mr. Fry
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:14.060]   We won't we won't tell andy or show him the video of steven fry posing for a selfie with a fan right where you're standing and
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:21.820]   Actually helping by putting his coat over the picture so the fan could get the picture because i wouldn't want andy to think that steven fry was actually signing autographs
[00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.420]   There today
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.060]   It's you know, it's definitely a different apple because
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:30.940]   Every time you've seen pictures of like steve jobs in the crowd after one of these events
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:36.060]   They've got like they had like a wall of people around him. There was like a palpable aura of
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:39.260]   He is in the crowd, but he is not of the crowd
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.780]   You are not to
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:46.060]   Coproch him you are not too glad hand him and tim cook he was he was out there not for for very long
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.980]   But he was posing for pictures with people he was i could be mistaken
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.980]   But i think someone's hi sanded him something to sign i don't know if he did but he was definitely taking pictures with people
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:59.100]   I really do what was one of the notes that i have is that this really did feel like
[00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.820]   tim cooks iphone moment because i was also at the iphone launch and
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:07.500]   As stage managed as that was as rehearsed as it was
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.820]   I was like maybe 30 feet away 40 50 feet away from the stage
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.060]   You could just see steve jobs
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:20.460]   Radiating joy and pleasure that here is something that i am i and the rest of the team have been working on for years
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.700]   Finally i get to show it to people and let people know how awesome this thing
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:29.260]   We made is and i saw that exact same thing with tim cook today
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:35.180]   He was just he could not stop like you know smiling and like raising up his hand because someone started chaps
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:39.020]   As soon as they put up that one more thing graphic
[00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:42.620]   I think they thought it would be like a nice little joke for 10 seconds there was pewse cheers
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:44.780]   They had to sort of stand back and just did the yeah
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:52.140]   It was it was a it was a great day for tim cook i think this was a red letter day for tim cook rene ritchie has tweeted by the way
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:58.860]   That the watch uses a passcode to authorize pay as soon as you authorize it it will maintain it
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:05.820]   As long as skin contact is maintained which is brilliant so that so you authorize the watch
[00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:10.940]   You as long as you have it on and you haven't removed it it will continue to authorize if you remove the wrist
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.140]   No, no, I think there's a lot of technique
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:19.580]   There's a level level two thinking and everything that they announced today
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:23.100]   And stuff like that stuff like recognizing that
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:26.940]   If someone sends you a text message that seems like a question
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:32.780]   This device should be smart enough to parse that question and pop out some possible answers so that you can just answer just by tapping
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:36.460]   These pre-filled buttons and not just simply yes, no, maybe oh my god
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:41.180]   It's like it would actually find out. Do you do you want to pestrami tonight or you want corn beef?
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:44.300]   There will be a corn beef button. There will be a pestrami button that you can then tap
[00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:48.220]   It's a lot of companies can make really nice devices again
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.900]   I think the motor 360 is a very very nice device. It takes a lot
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:58.620]   a bigger company to again do that level two level three thinking here where where are we missing opportunities to
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:05.260]   Give our user an experience where we our device does something and that person says oh that was so cool
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.460]   Yeah, and there are a few experiences with the motor 360 i've had like that
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.100]   But that's this that's a signature of apple design
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:16.940]   But the one thing we were talking about over pizza in the break room a few minutes ago is that you don't know how awesome the motor 360
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.940]   It's going to be in six months either
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.420]   That's a long that's a long period of time. There's some iteration. Yeah, right?
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:27.100]   I mean every all the watches are going to be much better. And so this is uh, this is a watch
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.380]   You're comparing a watch that you're wearing right now
[00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.420]   And that's for sale right now that you can buy at best buy right now with a watch
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.260]   It's going to come out half a year from now
[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:39.820]   We're going to take a break and come back with more Andy and aco is in the kupartino with us
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:46.060]   Mike l good in studio and uh, are you are you in LA? I just dean justine azeric is also with me
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.860]   I am in LA it was a fun watching tim cook today justine
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:54.860]   I mean did you see the moment where he touched bono and he practically levitated off the stage he was so happy
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:59.820]   It was great. I mean it just we're always used to the steam moments, but it was great
[00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:01.260]   Unfortunately
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:07.980]   Protocol for such events was dispensed with and most people were standing up because oh god you too bono. We're at a concert now
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:12.220]   We can stand up. Yeah, so that was that was a temporary end to my ability to see things closely
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.980]   And that was also a temporary end to my own sense of adequate and I was thinking okay
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.820]   This is a wall of meat in front of me. I can finally allow just not only stand up
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:24.380]   But also hold my camera over my head because I need to take pictures of what's happening so I can write about stuff later
[00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:28.460]   Which is rude for the people behind you, but okay. No one's gonna. No one. I'm not blocking of you of anybody
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:32.460]   So yeah, I did see the the little thing like the the little uh the ET touch
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:35.340]   So I don't know if there's that's going to be a new tumblr meme
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.980]   But if it's not there should be and someone hasn't already like gone to hover.com and bought you know
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:45.340]   Tim cooks ET touch with bono.com or variants their run run and get it then
[00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:50.380]   People who people who people are fans of apple are not as clever as I thought they were hang out there Andy for a little bit

[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:25.500]   We're talking about the apple announcements. That's the story really of the day
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:29.500]   Just the i'm sure you follow the rumor mill pretty closely
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:33.020]   Was there anything that you were hoping for that you didn't that we did not get?
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.100]   Um, I know they were talking a lot about the wireless charging
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:42.460]   Um, which is is kind of interesting. I everyone calls it wireless charging, but it's really not
[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:45.900]   They're still wires everything is still connected. So for me. That's not really a big deal
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:50.380]   But I know there was a lot of rumors that the the i apple watch i'm gonna be calling it the i watch
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.740]   I watch i me too me too. Yeah
[00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:59.340]   Uh, well it has wireless charging in that you know that little inductive thing, but you called it magsafe
[00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.180]   Which I think is actually
[00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:04.380]   Really much more accurate. Isn't it? It's almost exactly like that
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:07.420]   But usually people think of like the wireless charging you think you have like sort of like a little
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:12.540]   I don't know like a tablet or something gets a place everything on which actually could be kind of nice if
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:17.660]   Um, you know, you could set your phone down set your watch down on that like next to your bed or next to your
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:22.620]   Computer which would be cool. But still I wonder how all this stuff. How safe this all is
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.340]   I mean I sleep with my ipod or not my ipod
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:30.380]   But like my iphone and my ipad one of these days both the research is gonna come out. Oh, yeah
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:32.380]   You know
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:37.020]   It's safe until you're dead. It's safe. It's okay. One of the things that doesn't matter
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.580]   Right one of the things I learned with the android with the
[00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.780]   LG G watch which has a magnetic
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:48.060]   Charging thing you have to line up the little metal things and it plunks into a little cradle that's magnetic
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:50.780]   And when you lift it up the charger comes with it
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:56.780]   And so it has a sticker on the bottom so you peel away the sticker and you stick it to your night table or whatever
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:01.500]   And it's a really funky clunky. It's a good idea, but it's you can't move it and it's
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:07.340]   It's awkward and I wonder what apple solution is because it seems like a similar problem is going to happen
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:12.860]   If you have this little round disc sitting just on the the table next to you and you put the watch on it
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.580]   And then you pick up the watch the charger's gonna come with it if it's magnetic
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:21.180]   Right. Yeah, so it's a little inconvenient. They have to have some way to bolt it down or some there's got to be some solution to that
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.420]   Because otherwise you're sitting there peeling them apart
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.140]   What about
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.140]   the nude picture gate
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.980]   I was I was kind of last week saying, you know, Steve
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:37.420]   I mean, sorry, Tim Cook needs to take the stage and apologize or at least address it
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.020]   I mean here he is
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:44.380]   iOS paid puts all of your photos on the on the cloud and now we're gonna give him our credit cards
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:46.380]   We're gonna give him all this stuff
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:50.620]   Justin, you feel like he needed to address that or was it better just to leave it alone?
[00:54:50.620 --> 00:54:53.500]   I mean, I definitely think it was better to leave it alone
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:58.780]   Because I think there's a lot of people that don't know that that even happened. Oh, okay. I thought everybody knew
[00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:02.140]   I mean, I think a lot of people do because that is it is sort of a big thing
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:06.140]   But I feel like they didn't want to address it especially since it is such a sensitive topic
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:08.780]   But I mean, I I don't have my photo stream on
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:12.780]   I mean, I don't have anything bad on my phone because that is the scariest thing is I don't care
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:16.460]   Who you are if you take a picture or you post something on the internet
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.060]   It's there you can delete it
[00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:19.660]   It's it's gonna be there forever
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:24.620]   And that's just needs to be the mentality that the kids growing up now have that everyone has
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:27.580]   But it is it is still scary like what if you lose your phone?
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:34.780]   Some people don't have passcos on their phone and I will I mean, that's that's something that's so important because you have not only your bank information
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.140]   You've got photos
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.540]   You've got personal information on that that you don't want to be out
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:41.500]   So it's going to be interesting how they do address the security
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.540]   Especially forward. I felt like Tim could maybe have
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:47.260]   said hey, you know
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:52.140]   We we believe we are the the company for your security and their privacy
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:57.980]   We're doing everything we can and we are going to make darn well sure that this nut you know is secure
[00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:02.780]   I justine you said that you don't have personal pictures on your phone, but you're not average either
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:06.700]   The average person doesn't really have a sense. It's by default if you take a picture
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:09.980]   It's by default not only stored on your phone, but stored on the cloud
[00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:12.300]   That's right and so I think that I agree with you
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.580]   I just seen that
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:17.100]   That this was not the place for for Tim Cook to address this problem
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.020]   But he thinks he addressed it last week and he didn't it was like you say lea it was a fair
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.340]   It was a missed opportunity because apple really does have
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:28.220]   Really good security in many ways and in other ways they don't have good security and
[00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:32.620]   Tim Cook's whole point when he talked to the wall street journal was look, you know
[00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:38.700]   We were not hacked actually that people were socially engineered and that happens and we should do a better job of
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:42.540]   informing people of what the risks are and that sort of thing give it that kind of language
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:46.940]   He did apologize in effect in the journal. He didn't say I'm sorry, but that was really what that was
[00:56:46.940 --> 00:56:49.420]   He said, I'm sorry if you got hacked through your own
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.540]   Wasn't our fault basically I'm paraphrasing but he also said
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:56.060]   You know, we maybe didn't do a great job and we're gonna do a better job
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:00.380]   But to your point Leo, he that was the opportunity for him to say you know what this is a super important issue
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.100]   You shouldn't have to know what's happening with your vision
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:07.500]   And so we're gonna go to great lengths to really strengthen two factor authentication
[00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:11.020]   We're gonna do all these things to communicate to people. We're gonna build in better this better that
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:16.060]   We're gonna do all the things we're gonna do but he didn't I didn't feel like he acknowledged Apple's
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:19.740]   Fault he seemed to be saying it's not our fault
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.940]   But we're gonna we're gonna help you dummies to deal with your problem
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:28.460]   Um and he that was a missed opportunity because again apple has really really good security. They have excellent
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:33.500]   Encryption for example. They have all kinds of this secure uh enclave type of
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:39.180]   uh chip that they have for the financial data and and all that that's great stuff
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:44.060]   So they really need to get ahead of and they're also not a company that uh harvest your personal data heavily
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:49.340]   Like almost every other company that's an opportunity. That's a huge opportunity for them, right?
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:55.100]   I think it has to be an education process. I mean even setting up the two-step authentication on twitter on facebook on stuff
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.460]   I mean, it's not
[00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:57.820]   It's not difficult
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:01.580]   But if this isn't something that you do every day and you don't know you need to have
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:05.740]   Some sort of easy tutorial and even for setting up the the two-step for iCloud
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:10.620]   You have to wait three days. I I mean I have it set up now, but I kept missing my three-day window
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:16.620]   I know now i'm gonna wait another three days. I just seem like that's it's a little too much. It has to be instant
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:20.140]   Nobody else does that. I understand why they do it, but I don't think it's required
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:23.420]   they also uh and I think they've changed us but they
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:26.380]   as uh
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:28.060]   film girl
[00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:30.060]   Showed Christina Warren and mashable
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:36.060]   They don't notify you even if you have two factor they don't notify you if you downloaded iCloud backup
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:41.420]   So if somebody's stealing your iCloud backup, even if you have second factor, it's not required and there's notification
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:46.700]   I think they now notify you, but it still doesn't protect you and I think that they can do better than that
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:52.700]   And there's something actually interesting that happened with att and me personally and att still never really addressed it but
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:54.860]   Um, so I was hacked
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:59:01.980]   But att has this thing where you can set up messages that you can receive on an android device or on a phone or on your computer
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:05.340]   So you'll be able to receive somebody else's text messages, which was what was happening
[00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:10.540]   And so people were able to reset my two-step authentication because they were receiving my text messages
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:15.500]   And I had called att and nobody really seemed to address it. They're like, yeah, it's fine
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:21.580]   Like it was actually not fine because i'm still to this day paranoid that someone is able to to read those text messages
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.460]   And you know, that's something that I think people
[00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:30.060]   I don't know it just there's just this layer of security that needs to be addressed and somehow that we do feel safe
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:35.900]   And I think in this digital age there has to always be that fear of that you're not 100 percent safe
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:40.700]   No matter what as much as we want to be these people are so intelligent and so smart that are able to overcome
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.140]   And mode of anything and you know, I know that they don't want my new photos
[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:47.660]   But you're a target and you so you take steps
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:51.180]   I mean you you you must be aware that there are people trying to get into your system
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:56.380]   Oh, I am and they have and I mean, I've got a lot of really terrible filled selfies with no filters on it
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:58.380]   So I'm just really don't want those
[00:59:58.380 --> 00:59:59.580]   We see a lot of you anyway
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.660]   All you have to do is follow justine on instagram
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:08.220]   But it's scary for parents and families and even and a lot of celebrities who do have these things on their phones
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:13.180]   Of just pictures of their kids or other people that it's you don't want that to be out and it's
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:17.420]   Well, nobody what nobody has talked about but I think is the case and if you read
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:20.540]   There've been a couple of very good posts from jonathan jadarski
[01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:26.780]   Uh, and and another security researcher. It seems pretty clear that the breach that happened was
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.100]   the iCloud backups
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.060]   Because of the nature of the file names and the file structure
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:36.540]   Uh jadarski's pretty clear pretty sure that at least in some of these cases if not all
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:39.820]   Uh, what the bad guys got were the backups
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:44.140]   And that's why they have videos, but that also means they have more than pictures more than videos
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.140]   They have everything they have everything
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:52.780]   And that's and that's all in there and nobody's brought that up and i'm sure that the council to these celebrities
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:56.540]   It was brought it up and made sure they've done something about it. They're not gonna do that in public
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:59.980]   But that's a big issue. It's a much bigger breach than just photos
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:07.420]   Yeah, I even went through and deleted all of my old backups and i'll just end up like making sure that all of the backups is
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.020]   Currently what is on my phone?
[01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:14.620]   But man when you do lose your phone and you do have that backup that is just the best thing ever so
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:18.940]   It's well i'm back up to my computer now and I deleted all the iCloud backups
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:24.060]   And there were quite a few even from older phones and older iPads and i deleted that's the first thing I did
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.820]   I deleted all my iCloud backups turned on two-factor authentication
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:32.460]   Um another good piece of advice is to not use your real name in your email
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.940]   Uh, those authentication emails, you know
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:38.300]   They're one of the reasons this worked is because they would probably likely able to guess
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:44.140]   The names or the email addresses for these victims and uh, and so if you use your real name at
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.300]   iCloud.com, that's not a good choice
[01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.820]   So, uh, that's one of the things I think uh, everybody should also do
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:53.900]   And especially if you could start putting your credit cards in there with apple pay
[01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.140]   Are you gonna change your name from iJustine to apple Justine?
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:59.740]   Now, you know, I actually wish I could drop the i to be honest with you
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.180]   You're stuck with it
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.180]   Are you know really?
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:06.060]   Yeah, because it's hard because it's like I love xbox and I you know
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:10.540]   I use other things too. So I've I've kind of pigeonholed myself into being the apple girl, which
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:15.580]   Believe me, I definitely am but man. Yeah, it's like I like other things too
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:19.020]   Like I have an android phone. I love google like yeah, it's yeah
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:23.660]   You could do the robertex cringley thing and be i, comma Justine
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:26.380]   Justine here we go. Yeah, I like it
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:30.940]   Uh, yeah, it's very nice of you to spend some time with us during a destiny download day
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:35.260]   Oh, I downloaded it last night. So it's actually sitting right over there. So I'm ready to play after this
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.900]   Now I really feel bad now. I'm really guilty. It's all good. I'm so excited to be on mac break
[01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:42.220]   Did you see that it was 18 gigabytes?
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:49.260]   Yes, so I had a downloading because I was able to download it yesterday and then the servers went online at midnight so
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:54.300]   Some pretty excited to play the beta was awesome. It's really I know I played the beta and I really loved it and I uh
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.860]   This is mac break weekly. We shouldn't be doing sorry
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:58.700]   I
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:03.580]   Playing it on xbox or yeah xbox one. I love xbox one. Okay. Great. I'm an xbox one fanatic
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:07.100]   I don't I know that that's not cool like all the cool kids love playstation
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.300]   But I actually and one of the things I could do is I launched smart glass
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:14.540]   And uh downloaded the game in the background, you know, I wasn't in front of my xbox
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:20.860]   But you can do it with smart glass by the game and download it. Yeah, it's great. I love all the like we have a nfl sunday ticket
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:26.060]   So we actually have the NFL pops up there. Yeah, yeah, it's awesome. It's awesome
[01:03:26.060 --> 01:03:30.060]   Uh, we are uh, I don't know how we got into this. We should be bet we should be
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:34.700]   Sorry, it's destiny destiny came out today. I know
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:38.780]   You know, I was up till midnight playing diablo three i'm trying to get
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:43.900]   I'm trying to get a level 70 character so I could stop playing and play destiny and I got
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:48.700]   I got to 69 kills. Yeah, I didn't I played for a while. Oh, gosh now i'm gonna get really excited about it
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:53.500]   No, I played when it first came out and I didn't get the dlc so I yeah, thankfully
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:58.220]   So good. All right, let's say I was working last night. I know I know
[01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:01.420]   I know I know
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:06.940]   Andy and i co is down there at kupertino where the sun is shining and I see that we have moved now
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:12.380]   Behind a fence that says private event no trespassing. I think we had to
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:18.220]   Had to make you show him the sign there because we had to make anti stand on the other side of the street
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:24.700]   Because this is podcasters row. This is the unaffiliated media standing standing over here
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.460]   We'll get back to uh, Andy rene richy. I'm hoping we'll come by rene
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:36.700]   Rene we're calling for you. Uh, they are both down there apple did announce two new i phones and surprise surprise
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:41.100]   Both will be available for pre-order on friday the 12th
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:47.580]   And we'll be shipping on the 19th justina you're getting the 4/7 or the 5/5
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:51.740]   Definitely 5/5 and I just really hope we don't have to camp out for it
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:55.980]   Me too. I want I wanted to just show up at my house. Yeah me too
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.380]   um
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:02.300]   Well, you buy an iPhone you're an android. I'm probably gonna move back to an iPhone
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:05.180]   I i'm all apple except for the phone right now. I have a mojo x
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:09.340]   I was really disappointed in the screen and I was looking forward to a sapphire screen
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:15.020]   So if this screen doesn't scratch like my mojo x did then i'm almost certainly gonna move back to iphone
[01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:18.140]   And i'll get the i'll get the big one. I was actually thinking that too. Yeah
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:23.260]   Either five and a half inches that's the there were there were two things keeping me off the iphone
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:29.340]   Size of the screen and the keyboard because I can't use that apple keyboard. It's been driving me crazy
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:32.860]   And now i'm very happy. Well, I feel like because they're gonna have third party keyboards on
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.700]   I always say during the event
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:40.140]   Tim cook said what matters is how phones make you feel and I kind of made a cynical remark
[01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:44.060]   Mark and you pointed out that you know that no that's the that's the core of it
[01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:47.100]   That's really is in fact the most important thing and in fact
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:51.340]   That's why i'm probably gonna move back to iphone because i often borrow my wife's iphone
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:55.500]   And when I use it, I'm just like oh man. This just feels so good to use
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.020]   I just I want widgets. I want a little more flexibility
[01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:02.300]   You know, it's funny during the sony event they kept saying the word condo
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:07.420]   And I couldn't figure out why they were talking about condos and it turns out this is a philosophy
[01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:10.460]   uh, sony philosophy, but it's a japanese word
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:13.180]   That means essentially
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:16.060]   emotional
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:21.180]   Power or wow the wow it would i guess the closest English translation would be the wow factor
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:23.900]   and uh sony knows it
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.860]   Anybody who makes consumer electronics knows it there is this
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:33.180]   visceral feeling when you use something not just when you see it in the store or see it as we have just done
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:36.060]   Oh, I gotta have that but the actual visceral
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:42.540]   Experience of holding it and using it that is really critical to these kinds of very personal devices
[01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:49.020]   uh apple knows that i think and um and perhaps better than anybody even than sony
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:53.180]   Uh, and these seem to have condo. I'm sorry sony. Yep
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:55.980]   It tells me you just pick up an iphone
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:01.500]   It's and I when I do still use android a lot because I do obviously youtube everything all the the google apps work
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:05.980]   So much better on android, but then man when I have to like post an instagram or edit a photo
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:11.820]   I the first thing I do is go back to my iphone because it's just it has that just ease of use and it just works
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:17.180]   I don't know you it's something you really can't explain. Yeah, it's just like wow. Okay. It works
[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:21.900]   Apple may not have handled the live video stream very well, but they did something very interesting that this
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:26.700]   Intermediated the live bloggers by doing their own live blog at apple.com
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:33.020]   They did a great job. They did who needs the live bloggers. This is a view now
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:38.540]   You know why they built a big white box. That's where johnnie. I've been living. Yep. It is a big
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:42.140]   White room. I think that's the johnny. I've dining room right there
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:46.780]   And then here's a picture of the phones in the hands on pavilion
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:51.340]   And condo. I there's definitely especially to that five and a half inch
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:55.260]   But also going I'm glad they're back to the rounded corners. I feel like
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:08:01.020]   That this iphone four four s five era was kind of a bad dream
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.260]   It's chunky. I I
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:08.620]   I like the four and four s designed with the metal around the outside and a totally flat front and back and class on the back
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:14.620]   I loved all of that. I thought that was very contemporary and I personally feel like the iWatch in the round corners is kind of seven
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:20.620]   So you think they're going back as this is a step back. I think they're going well a lot of people have mentioned including
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:24.620]   including Jason snell on twitter that
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:29.100]   The new phones look a lot like flat versions of the original iphone
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:37.260]   With the rounded corners and a metal and all that justine said now. How about 128 gigs? That's retro right justine who needs that much storage anymore
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.300]   Um, I definitely do especially people that do video
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:44.700]   Okay, because I take so many photos and so many videos and that's the worst thing is when you're you're
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:48.700]   Going to take a picture or do something and it's like great. You can't take any more photos or video
[01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:53.100]   And I do like that they up to the I think was 240 frames a second. Yeah
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:57.660]   240 which is just awesome and the video stabilization
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:04.780]   They really are going after that. What do you shoot your videos with you must use a camera now, right? Um, I well, I do
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:09.420]   I mean, I use actually I was sitting right here. It's just it's but it is big. It's a big vlogging camera
[01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.580]   Um, and it's it's just one extra thing that you don't want to have to carry
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:19.340]   It would be nice to have it's gonna be exciting to see what that is. Yeah, good iphone video. Do you use a selfie stick?
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:23.980]   I I have used one, but you really get made fun of
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:29.660]   I mean, not only do you get made up for filming yourself in public, but it's like you got the selfie
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.580]   There's a way around that. Yeah, there's a way around that I discovered in in Valencia
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:39.500]   I was there for lost bias, which is a big event and after two pictures of sangria. I didn't bother me at all
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.660]   I felt no embarrassment whatsoever
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.140]   So look into it. Yeah
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:49.100]   Renee richy is now joining us from cooperatino where he has just come out of the
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:54.780]   Big white johnny. I've room playing with the eye watch playing with the iphone hi Renee
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:10:00.140]   Hey, Leo welcome. Uh, so tell us what do you think
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:08.940]   Uh, I think there's a lot of really interesting stuff here the watch runs watch os something completely new they didn't want to shrink down
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:12.940]   Ios and the security is really well thought out for example
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.980]   You put a pin code into the watch then it authorizes your payments
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:21.580]   But it detects the proximity to your skin and if that contact is ever broken you have to reauthorize to make more payments
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:29.100]   That's brilliant. I think that is brilliant. Yeah, absolutely. That's brilliant and it's it's a it's a perfect solution very watch sizes
[01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.020]   38 millimeter 42 millimeter
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.860]   There's collections so you can get sporty looks or classic looks gold looks
[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.460]   And it's really meant to be a compliment to the iphone because you have to have an iphone to use it
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:41.180]   You saw that before with the galaxy watches from samsung
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:46.620]   But this really wants to be sort of a companion device. What do you what so what are they saying about watch os?
[01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:50.380]   I was really wondering about that yet apple now has three os's
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:55.100]   They do it's interesting. They wouldn't tell me the details
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.700]   So I couldn't find out if it has the same kernel if it's using the same drivers for anything
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:01.660]   But they're the same way they didn't want to put os 10 onto a watch
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:04.060]   They thought you know you don't want to cramp down a computer to a watch
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:06.700]   They didn't want to cramp down phone and tablet software
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.820]   Sorry, they didn't want to cramp down phone and tablet software onto the watch
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:12.620]   They wanted to make it its own dedicated specialized thing
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:16.780]   Uh what is your sense because you've seen it now
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:20.380]   Uh, you know an actual size it's hard for us to tell we're watching
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:26.140]   3d renders and cgi's we did see kevin lynch actually demo it which was encouraging
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.300]   They have a we're at least one working prototype
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:32.140]   But you were able to at least look at it. It looks like a nice display
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:38.140]   But it also looks like those are tiny pixels and especially those tiny icons in the user interface
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.220]   Do you feel like this user interface works Renee?
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:46.060]   Yeah, so it's interesting it's 320 by 320 retina display
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.620]   It is small but they're using the crown
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.300]   Almost as a as a new next generation jog wheel from the old
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:56.940]   I click wheel from the old ipods so you can zoom in and out with those and it's got
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:04.300]   And it's got that that sensor on it so that you can feel it you can feel it vibrate the taptic sensor
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:09.020]   So that you really can tell uh, it'll tell you left to right directions for example
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:14.060]   And you can tap the interface there's a whole bunch of different sort of things you can do to navigate your way around it
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:16.380]   Well, there was a there was a couple of things
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:21.020]   That I noticed about that that they seem to be emphasizing the haptics and apples are actually
[01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:26.540]   Taptic's haptics. Excuse me. Taptic, but apples always been really good word apple made up by mine. Yeah, of course
[01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.140]   They've always been really good with that. It's not a whole motor a taptic motor inside right next to s1 processor
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.180]   Which powers the watch does it feel did you were you able to feel it?
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:41.100]   In the demo, uh, I love the idea of tapping left to go left and tapping right to go right. What does that feel like?
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:48.940]   It's interesting so the watches they gave us weren't fully functional, but they were running demo software that took you through a range of applications
[01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:50.860]   Including the taptic sensor
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:56.940]   So you put it on and it showed you the different things you could do and you do feel sort of it'll take me a while to really understand that
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.300]   I'm not that sensitive to it
[01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:04.140]   But you can feel sort of a difference in where it's vibrating on your arm for the things like left and right
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:06.780]   And apple the company doesn't like hardware buttons
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:10.700]   It has the crown but it also has a hardware button that lets you go into that special
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:15.580]   Friend mode where you see all your friends that you can you know sketch to them and these nice little animated doodles
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:19.420]   I'm not going to be the guy that says Steve jobs would have hated this
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.820]   But I have to think that this is something that could would not have come out under Steve jobs
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:28.940]   That this is really this clear. This is Tim. It is actually literally Tim Cook's first new product
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:34.860]   You know brand new product category introduction and it it does feel very much like something different and new
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.420]   Uh from apple you agree Renee?
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:44.380]   Absolutely, it's he used the famous one more thing like you referenced Steve at the very beginning
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:48.300]   This might not be your product Steve jobs would have made but it's a product that johnny i've
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.500]   Really, you know wanted to make was very personal to him
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:55.180]   And it's really in the spirit of apple everything they've done since the apple too to the mac
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:59.420]   To the iphone to the iwatch has been to make computers more personal more accessible
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:01.020]   It's it's unfortunate
[01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.900]   It still needs an iphone because you can't put wi-fi or lte on your wrist without basically burning your wrist off
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.020]   But one day this might be just enough computer for a lot of people
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:15.180]   And the accessibility stuff just having the taptics and having that that's very powerful for people who want to do indoor navigation
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.180]   But our heart of seeing
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:23.260]   Renee richy, thank you so much. We're glad you uh got to go and see it in person and have the experience
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:27.340]   And we were really glad we got to uh talk to you any final thoughts before we let you go
[01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:34.780]   Yeah, you're gonna want the 5.5 inch phone. It's big but optical image stabilization is so good looking
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:39.500]   Yeah, we've already decided everybody in fact. I wonder it's going to be interesting
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:45.980]   I suppose they'll sell some 4.7s, but everybody i've talked to so far including lisa and jostine
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:49.580]   Uh want the big phone. They want the 5.5 inch phone
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:53.420]   It may be that that phone is going to be in short supply not because of production issues
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:55.420]   But because that's the phone everybody's buying
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:00.940]   It's going to be like last year when apple said gold and everyone said gross and then they said oh my god
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:04.700]   I can't get one and now i was oh five point five is too big. Oh my god. I can't get one
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.900]   Thank you Renee richy safe trip back to montreal
[01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:16.220]   Thank you any anaco and thanks also take care to karsten bondi our producer on the scene and zach and patrick dela handy who are down there
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:21.260]   Uh with the film crew they did a great job. I am just blown away by the quality
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:25.100]   Thanks to alix lindsey too for providing the live use so that we could do that stream
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:32.300]   Uh, that's via lte down from kubertino and I i'm just saying it looked better than apple stream. I'm just saying okay
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:36.940]   Yep, it certainly worked better than apple stream. All right. We're gonna take a break come back with some final thoughts
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:41.740]   On this special edition of mac break weekly i justine is here mike elgin
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:47.340]   I'm leo loport and our show today is always brought to you by the good folks at audible.com
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:50.140]   We do have you gotten an audio audiobook?
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:56.220]   Oh, yeah. Yeah, you listen in fact in fact, I think I believe i've been a member for longer than you have wait a minute
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:00.380]   Nobody has 2000. Oh, wait, man. I gotta check now. What's your date? What's your start?
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:08.300]   Because we're really close when i started when i started it audible was a physical device that you would buy that's right
[01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:12.060]   And it was a big gigantic thing and uh and had a big button in the middle
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:17.260]   I think you do free date me because I didn't use that audible device. I used the diamond rio is my first audible
[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:24.140]   Uh device, but so i've been a member almost as long as mike elgin now of course you can listen to it on your iphone
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:30.300]   On your uh android device windows devices computers tablets. I listen on my sonos throughout the house
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:36.300]   Um audible is the biggest bookstore of audiobooks 150,000 titles
[01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:40.460]   I'm just i'm gonna i'm gonna look now. I'm gonna go download all my books
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:44.380]   It was one of the nice things about audible when you when you buy a book on audible, it's yours forever
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.340]   So uh every book that i've ever listened to
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:51.980]   There are a few exceptions where the publisher for some reason is discontinued it or whatever but
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:57.980]   Virtually every book i've ever listened to is available for listening to again, and you know, so I listen to a lot of classics
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.380]   You know gulliver's travelers travels moby dick
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:05.580]   Uh, that's a great performance by the way that that version of moby dick a tale of two cities the three musketeers
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.740]   So those are books you read again and again. They're classics. You're not going to put those away
[01:17:09.740 --> 01:17:13.900]   Uh mike and I both have kind of a love for a beautiful
[01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:22.140]   Physical books, but I gotta tell you the practicality of having a book you can listen to in the car. I used to have a horrific commute
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:23.740]   um
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:27.020]   February 7th, 2000 is my first book when's your first book?
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:29.500]   Uh
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.500]   It had to be january to beat me, baby
[01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:34.140]   I'll get back to you on that

[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:03.100]   I always like to read the book before I see the movie because the the audible books are like a movie in your mind
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:08.380]   You're listening these great actors and narrators bring these books to to life. You could be that annoying guys
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:13.580]   Like oh the book was way better. Yeah, so gone girl a great. What a thriller that is
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:16.220]   um, I uh somebody told me
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:22.620]   Francine hardaway said because I've been i've been saying I have whiskey tango fox trot in my library and I

[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.340]   picking one
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:26.060]   Um, all right. I think we're about ready to wrap this up. I just seen it's so great to get you on the show today and
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:32.620]   Having me talk about so exciting. We don't get many of these these you know, uh apple's keynotes are every year
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:39.100]   but uh, it's really when they announce new categories that it's exciting. I'm thinking about the ipod in
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:44.220]   2001 i'm thinking about the uh, iphone in 2007 the ipad in 2010
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:49.420]   And now uh, and i watch and i think i'm sorry apple watch apple watch
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:54.380]   We're gonna be doing that for a while and i think apple pay do you see yourself using that?
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.620]   I do i mean i've used it before like on the sam's lung phone
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:02.140]   So it's not really like the new technology, but i think that now that apple's doing it
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:05.820]   It's it's going to be to the masses and it it man
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:10.060]   I it what scares me the most is i've had my credit card stolen and sometimes you know
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:16.940]   It was like that certain gas station or that time that i handed my card over so i love that that extra layer of security
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:21.420]   Is in place they're doing it interesting to see they're doing it right too. It's a one-time
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:25.340]   Credit card number also a one-time rotating confirmation code
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:32.620]   So even if somebody you know at the gas station and you use it somehow got that information they can't reuse it
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:39.100]   So they're going they talked about doing it for online purchases as well, which is phenomenal
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.940]   uh, i think that
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:43.820]   Given the clout that apple has in the market and
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:49.580]   And the large number let's face it of apple users still in the united states they're they're more than half
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:54.380]   Um, this is this is the first time that this kind of tap to pay has had has some legs
[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:58.220]   Yeah, i've had it my end rate phone forever, but you know with starbucks and mcdonald's
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.660]   There weren't that many places i could use it i use square more
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:05.740]   Well, there's so many apps to even like starbucks you just use the app to pay
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:09.500]   Dunkin donuts like there's so many of those they'll just don't get it. It's always get
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:14.220]   done. I love it. I'm so excited. It's been in california. Well at least in l.a
[01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.820]   So so because you grew up in pittsburgh you're a dunkin
[01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:25.100]   I don't understand the dunkin donuts thing. It's good the coffee's good. They have no it's not no it's not good. It's not good
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:34.060]   Compared to starbucks. It's much better. You're saying that dunkin donuts coffee is better than starbucks. Oh, yes starbucks is not good coffee
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:38.620]   It's just a convenience factor. I go there three times a day and i'm gonna tell you it's
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:41.980]   It's survival
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.100]   Justine it's so good to see you again. I miss you a lot
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:50.460]   But you know what i feel like you're always in my life because i follow you on youtube all three channels
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:57.980]   I follow you on instagram and follow you on twitter and i'm just always thrilled to see how well you are doing you're a super star
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:03.340]   In disjutio. I love it. It looks so awesome come up and see us sometime and when are you when are you be when is
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:06.220]   Like they're gonna give you a tv series soon, right?
[01:22:06.220 --> 01:22:11.980]   We'll see we're working on it, but i'm working on a book so i'm probably gonna have to come up and interview you for that
[01:22:11.980 --> 01:22:16.860]   Just like to begin it. I'm gonna tell about the six months that I live streamed my life on just a tv
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:21.500]   That couldn't be more apropos now that joustin has shut down and twitches been sold to amazon

[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:44.860]   Plain and we're gonna get Andy to do a yeah. Thank you pixel core.com and the live view
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.140]   We're gonna get Andy to do a uh, there's some fans
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:53.820]   Uh, I review the moto x which he got uh last week in chicago if we can in the moto 360
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:57.500]   Which he's wearing on his wrist, but all of us who bought these smart watches new
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:02.300]   It was just a temporary thing leo. I didn't buy it you bought yours
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.860]   You didn't pay for the sam sung didn't you they get?
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:05.660]   Oh, right?
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.260]   Exactly
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:12.540]   So it's just you you're the only one but we knew didn't we and you're gonna get moto 360 is waiting at your house
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:16.620]   It's it's they've already shipped it. I don't know if i've got it yet, but it's coming any second now
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:22.140]   So but will you replace those watches with the i1 yes, yes absolutely. Yeah. Yeah
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:28.060]   I feel like such a sucker, but you know, I gotta have it and you know, I think I think it's clear that
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:33.020]   There's several generations ahead of anything else i don't i still feel like the wearable
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:39.980]   There's a conundrum with wearables that has to do with user interface that has to do with battery life ease of use
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:45.900]   Functionality that has not yet been solved. I I had high hopes that apple as they have in the past
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:51.500]   Would have sprinkled some magic dust on it. They didn't I don't feel that they solved it completely
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:56.460]   I think you're right they leapt a few generations ahead, but we still have miles to go before we sleep
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:02.700]   They did sprinkle some magic dust on it and the the smoothness and high and high resolution and brightness
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:07.820]   of the user interface of the of the icons and the and the gestures and all that kind of stuff is
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:11.340]   Really amazing. It's really feels
[01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:16.460]   Like the future it feels like science fiction almost right other aspects of it not so much
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:21.180]   It's big and clunky. It's got that big dial wheel thing which yes, it's a it's a good thing
[01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:24.620]   Um and other aspects of it are so so but for the most part
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:27.980]   I think that they've really I think they've hit it out of the park
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.580]   And I think it's going to be really difficult for anybody to catch up to them anytime soon
[01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:34.060]   Well, we won't know until next year. That's one it'll be available
[01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:38.140]   But I think we'll all be sporting five and a half inch iPhones in a couple of weeks
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:39.820]   How long till we see the fake Chinese ones?
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.860]   Oh, they're already out. I'm sure
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:49.260]   They beat apple to the punch are you kidding? We do mac break weekly every uh, Tuesday at 11 a.m pacific 2 p.m
[01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:52.300]   Eastern time 1800 UTC please tune in live and join us
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:56.940]   Andy and rene i'll be back next week and we will have more insightful analysis
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:00.140]   And in a couple of weeks we'll actually have some product to talk to you about
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:06.940]   Um, you can also watch or listen at your convenience on demand versions of every show

[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:18.380]   iTunes would be a good starting point, but we have our own apps all created by our brilliant third party
