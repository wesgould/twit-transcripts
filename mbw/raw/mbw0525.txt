[00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.680]   Leo's away this week, but Andy and Alex are here,
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.680]   and we're talking about the new iPhone 7.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.640]   Yes, they're out.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.120]   Also, Mac OS X--
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.120]   it's not even Mac OS X anymore.
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.960]   It's just Mac OS Sierra ships today,
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.400]   and we've had some time to try it out.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.280]   What did we think?
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.720]   You'll find out right now on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200]   Leo Laport is on special secret assignment.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.400]   We're not quite sure what it is.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.920]   But it was going to be pretty fantastic.
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.960]   So joining me this week, we have literally the 18.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.480]   We have Andy and not coach in the Chicago Sun times.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480]   How are you, Andy?
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.400]   No, I are fine.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.840]   You are fine.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.280]   We also have, I think, sitting at the top of a mountain
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.360]   or a very large beach.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.560]   We have Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.040]   How are you, Alex?
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.480]   Hey, everybody.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.000]   Top of a building in San Francisco.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.320]   I was going to show you a production.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.160]   And then it turned out the production's still
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.280]   been kind of the heavy moving part of the trust.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.960]   And it was not a great place for a show.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.760]   So maybe later, we'll give you guys a little tour.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.760]   Is that true, or does someone start letting up a lightsaber
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.160]   and you quickly had to move the cameras the other side?
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.120]   Hey, put that down.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.200]   We can't show anybody that.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.920]   That's secret.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.120]   They're not supposed to think they're real.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   Don't cut the threads at that.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.320]   Not utilitarian lightsaber.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.280]   So I guess the big news is that Apple has shipped the new iPhones.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.720]   These are two of them, a glossy--
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.960]   I'll do the backs first-- a matte black iPhone
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.240]   and a glossy iPhone among them.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.520]   Holding these are is difficult.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.160]   New cameras, new waterproofing.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.200]   I got to play with them for a while in New York City
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.600]   and drop them into water and take lots of night photographs.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.160]   I'm actually curious to see what Andy does with them
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.840]   when he goes shooting, though, because Swen are
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.160]   in the morning, I walked the Brooklyn Bridge with Michael
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.840]   Fisher at 1 AM, 2 AM, and we were taking photos
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.360]   and were shocked that it showed so much more than I could see.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.160]   And I know you've got tons of fancy cameras
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.400]   and quite fancy camera phones that does that.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.000]   But for me, it was like the first time since the DSLR
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.600]   with a fast 50 that I've been really impressed
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.400]   while lens giving me more than I thought.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.960]   So I think I was more impressed with the camera
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.560]   than I thought I'd be, Andy.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.080]   Yeah, and that's really the strength of pretty much any new
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.000]   iPhone camera.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.920]   There are already a few blogs that are saying,
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.320]   oh, well, the iPhone 7 camera is really good.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.320]   But unfortunately, our tests show that the Samsung Galaxy 7
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.800]   is much sharper, it's much better, unfortunately.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.680]   And the thing is, at this stage, it's really hard to spend
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.600]   more than $350 on a phone camera and not get a good camera
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.960]   that takes good pictures.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.840]   The difference really now that people are going to see is
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.440]   I'm in a bar at night.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.440]   The light is crappy.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.680]   Can it give me a usable picture?
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.480]   Or I'm trying to track fast movement.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.520]   Will it get focus and lock focus?
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.480]   Now we're at the stage where everybody has that list of
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.120]   pictures that they know that their phone cannot handle.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.720]   Why would I even bother taking my phone out?
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.360]   I know it's not going to take a good picture.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.080]   But now, just as you walking over that bridge,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.600]   I wouldn't have thought it could take a good picture.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.080]   Wow, it took a good picture.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.280]   So that's what we're going to be seeing, hopefully.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.040]   And yeah, I mean, I'm pretty, I hope to have it this week.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.000]   And I've already just basically plotted out like with sort
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   of like a yellow X on my calendar that if I get it by this
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.280]   date, there is no way in hell.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.520]   I'm going to be in the office on this day because I'm going to
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.160]   be here, here, here, here, here and here.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.680]   And it's going to be fun.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.280]   It's the most I've been most, I'm more excited about this
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.560]   phone upgrade than I have been about any phone upgrade in
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.360]   the last three or four years.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.280]   That includes all the iPhone stuff.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.920]   Senator Caldwell is doing a huge camera shoot out for us.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.440]   And she started posting a few of the sample pictures yesterday.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.920]   And one of them got, I think, 6,000 retweets.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.640]   And most of them were, why didn't I have this camera for
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.200]   this Justin Bieber or Beyonce concert last week?
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.040]   Curse you, Apple.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.680]   I know I want this camera now.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.080]   And mostly, Alex, it was because of the telephoto lens,
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.880]   that ability is to hit a button and have a really clear shot
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.440]   twice as big as it was previously.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.440]   Well, I think that's one of the problems you've always had,
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.840]   whether it's the portrait view, which I haven't seen the
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.160]   examples of the portrait view yet.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.520]   But hopefully, let me have seen the ones that Apple showed.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.400]   The problem with what Apple showed was that you'll notice
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.280]   there wasn't any flurry hair and things to get.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.120]   I played a lot with the HTC version of that a couple years
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.240]   ago and where you have issues are little strands of things,
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.560]   not so much someone wearing a cap.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.680]   So it'll be interesting to see how that looks and how it
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.880]   fares.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.680]   But yeah, normally your phone has been good for, I can take
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.800]   landscapes and I can take very specific selfies or in that
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.200]   range.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.480]   And so the idea that you can actually zoom in on something
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.040]   and get something I think is a pretty exciting change.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.400]   And I think that Apple doesn't have to knock it.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.000]   They don't have to recreate the camera phone as much as they
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.720]   have to constantly be upgrading it, constantly making it
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.560]   better, constantly looking for the low light.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.800]   I think the low light is probably the most important thing.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.080]   So all that detail that you're talking about, for the
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.880]   average consumer who owns a phone, the most important thing
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.680]   is being able to take pictures inside Christmas
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.400]   pictures, birthday pictures, all of the nice dinners, whatever
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.040]   that is.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.600]   What?
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.960]   Bar pictures.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.720]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.200]   But all of those things, that's what matters probably more
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.800]   to us than anything else.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.000]   I think that I'm a big fan of not having any phones or
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.240]   concerts.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.960]   But I don't like looking through screens.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.200]   But I think that beyond that, I think that really being able
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.120]   to take pictures of your friends and family and actually
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.520]   have them turn out.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.400]   My wife has been putting off getting a phone upgrade for
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   quite some time now.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.280]   And I'm now the pressures on now that it's out.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.360]   I'm unrelenting about that.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.960]   She's got to move from her five to something a little newer.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.600]   OK, let me go to the big controversy this year.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.960]   OK.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.080]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.920]   I'll just say, she sends me pictures now from the Ivan
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.400]   Bivin also gets back is just think how much better this
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.720]   would be if you had a new phone.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.240]   So I think the big controversy this year is that people are
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.120]   going to be split because there are people who are going to
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.560]   prefer the Galaxy S7 camera.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.920]   And there are going to be people who are going to prefer
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.280]   the iPhone 7 camera.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.200]   And the big difference is that Samsung does a lot of
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.880]   processing.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.560]   People traditionally say they crush the blacks, they
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.040]   boost the sat, to give a picture that more people actually
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.160]   like right on the screen.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.880]   Where Apple's thing has always been, we're going to do the
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.200]   best reproduction we can of what you see.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.920]   And then if you want to crush the blacks or you want to
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.520]   boost the sat, that's up to you.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.240]   And those are strange positions because Apple, for example,
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.400]   they're fusing the camera.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.000]   You can access the separate cameras with third party
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.720]   apps, but they're abstracting that away.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.240]   They just want you to touch the button and shoot.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.560]   But they don't want to do that with the final product, Andy.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.960]   And I'm not certain which is actually best.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.360]   I know I'm just going to pull raw data from now on.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.840]   But for a normal person, I'm not sure which approach is
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.080]   the better one.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.280]   Yeah, this is why it's hard for--
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.560]   I'm a real avid amateur photographer.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.320]   I just love--
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.920]   I had 45 minutes to kill on Sunday.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.400]   I was going to the John Hodgman live show in Boston.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.000]   I had 45 minutes to decide I'm going to spend 30 of it in
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.440]   the Boston Public Library because I had my camera with me
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.160]   place I photographed a million times.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.840]   I'm that kind of photographer.
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.360]   But the thing is, people just like having shots that look
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.320]   good to them.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.280]   And that's a complaint that's a comment about a serious
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.040]   photographer is about what Samsung does to their pictures.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.280]   But there is a reason why if you go to Burger King or Wendy's
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.440]   that you get a burger that has lots of onion seasoning and
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.880]   lots of salt and lots of fat, it's not a gourmet burger, but
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.760]   people like salt and they like fat.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.800]   And it's not-- you're not there to tell people what kind of
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.200]   pictures they should have.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.520]   They want to be happy with the photos that they get.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.920]   And the difference is that on Android, for instance, you've
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.560]   always had the ability to pull raw directly from it.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.280]   So if you are that serious photographer, you can get--
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.080]   you will get the real fancy pants, like super, super
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.200]   red sunset, but you also get a raw image so that if you're
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.360]   taking pictures in Adobe Lightroom, you can then adjust it
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.520]   to your heart's content.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.400]   I admit that I was having some fun with people.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.360]   The Thursday that so many analysts and writers were
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.160]   getting briefings in New York City, the tip off was
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.160]   everybody's Instagram, including yours, was blowing up with
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:33.960]   like every-- you could tell like they left the site at like
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.280]   102 and then it took them five minutes to get to this place.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.720]   And then you'd suddenly see from 105 to like 117 a million
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.040]   photos of like the same sort of location.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.440]   And so I happened to have posted a picture from briefings
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.200]   that I had in New York City a few days ago.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.920]   And someone said with my cheap Nexus 5X camera, so wow,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.760]   I can't believe the iPhone 7 takes
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.400]   those great pictures.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.520]   I can't wait to see a review.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.880]   I have to admit that I was having some fun with people I
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.200]   decided I'm not going to tell people-- I'm not going to say
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.840]   nan, nan, nan, nan, nan, you got tricked.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.440]   But I'm going to start posting all the pictures from New York
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.360]   that I was going to post over the next couple of weeks.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.760]   I'm going to Instagram them all in the next two or three
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.760]   hours and not tell people that this was just the Nexus 5X,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.640]   basically being shot raw and then with the pictures adjusted
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.720]   the way that I like them.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.080]   So there's no right way to do it.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.720]   And the thing that must--
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.600]   I don't know if we use the word frustrate, the engineers
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.840]   that Apple and Samsung is that they're making cameras that
[00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:35.280]   can take pictures that are good enough to have an 11 by 17
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.320]   that goes over the sofa table for the next 30 or 40 years
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320]   of a beautiful moment.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.880]   But the thing is most people are just
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.680]   going to put them on Instagram.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.520]   And at that level, pretty much any camera
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.000]   is going to take a great picture.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.720]   And it's going to be hard to tell the difference
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.640]   between an iPhone photo and something
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.960]   you took with a mid-range camera if you strictly
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.120]   go through Instagram.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.480]   I'm totally water welcome.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.440]   The other thing that impressed me that Alex was the P3
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.080]   color space because you've got wide gamut color being captured
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.680]   by the lens, managed by Apple's color management system,
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.640]   and then displayed.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.560]   The display is also P3 and the same with the baby pearl,
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.760]   the same with the iMac.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.020]   And I didn't expect the reds and oranges
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.920]   to pop the way they did.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.720]   But side by side, you could see a huge difference.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.080]   I think this is going to be one of the next new things
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.520]   that we're going to be looking at.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.600]   Is how do we-- more than how do we add contrast,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.320]   how do we really get as much out of this?
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.800]   And how do we almost create something that is able to do
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.920]   or create a real record?
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.560]   I mean, we have to remember that now, I think more and more
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.080]   people are, this is what they're using.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.400]   This is their primary camera.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:38.440]   This is not-- they're not using a snap and something--
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.880]   as we grew up, some kind of camera
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.640]   that they carried around.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.720]   They're not using a DSLR.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.560]   They're not using a micro four thirds.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.160]   They're using an iPhone, and they're
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.680]   or a Samsung or whatever their phone is.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.640]   And so being able to gather that information
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.440]   and make it truly something that, hey, you're
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.280]   going to see a lot more images, a lot more in the imagery,
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.960]   but also something that you can actually print.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.400]   I think it's going to be more and more important.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.720]   I think a lot of us mostly put stuff on Instagram,
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.760]   but I mean, I print things every once in a while.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.680]   And so having where Apple is going,
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.600]   I think the direction we're seeing these cameras go
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.200]   is they're recognizing--
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.000]   and they probably recognized quite some time ago--
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.920]   that this is people's primary camera.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.080]   And I think that this is what they're going to remember
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.760]   all these photos and all the moments that they have with.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.240]   So the camera becomes, again, one of the most important parts
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:23.800]   of a phone.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.400]   I mean, the phone becomes, I think, less and less important.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.760]   The camera becomes more and more important
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.440]   as we shift what we do with it.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.160]   I went to Dolby when I was out in San Francisco,
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.120]   and they showed us a 1080p version of Star Wars
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.400]   next to a 4K print of Star Wars.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.640]   1080p one was HDR, and it looked so much better
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.200]   than the 4K version.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.480]   And I just came to this point where I think we're close.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.440]   It's still expensive, but you can buy an HDR TV now.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.360]   And my camera and my computer all have these HDR
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.600]   or at least P3 displays.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.840]   The software, I believe, goes to Rec 2020, which
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.240]   is the next even wider gamut standard.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.200]   And, Andy, I'm going to be drowning in deep color
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.000]   and loving it in the next few years.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.480]   Yeah, I have to-- and I have to, but I'm telling myself
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.800]   that this is the year that I replaced the HDTV
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.400]   I bought seven or eight years ago.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.680]   And what I'm learning about HDR--
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.320]   now, going to my half tech columnist,
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.840]   half consumer who's actually looking to spend $1,000
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.360]   sometime in the next three days, three months position.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.400]   What I'm finding so much is that, really,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.640]   it's not so much about the numbers of, oh, here's
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.640]   how many pixels there are.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.600]   Here's how much contrast there is here.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.840]   It really comes down to look at it.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.720]   There are lots of different ways to create a great image.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.320]   And so if someone is simply trying
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.840]   to tell you that this is a faster response time,
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.400]   so it's a better picture, or this has a different backlighting
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.240]   system, so it's a better picture,
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.480]   that might not actually satisfy the human urge.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.520]   It's human software, not human number counting,
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.040]   that actually does this stuff.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.880]   And it's the same thing with cameras.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.920]   I've actually changed the way that I write about and review
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:04.480]   camera phones.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.560]   It used to be I will give you a five-way shootout
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.200]   between five different cameras, and I'll even give you
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.120]   like pixel by pixel blow-ups if you want to take a look
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.800]   at what the noise reduction is like,
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.120]   and what the ISO noise is like, but the sharpness is like,
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:18.840]   I'll do that.
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.720]   I think I realized that this had become counterproductive,
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.320]   where I'm letting people trick themselves into thinking
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.480]   that, wow, in that picture, there was,
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.000]   I can see more of the window that I can in this picture.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.320]   So therefore, picture three must be a better camera.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.320]   Well, no, it just happened to--
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.600]   circumstances were correct to create a sharper image
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.400]   of that corner of the window in these situations.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.280]   The reason why I keep thinking that the iPhone is the best
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.880]   camera phone ever made is because it keeps getting down
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.240]   to the best, most important feature of all,
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.960]   where you take it out, you press the button,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.400]   did you get a picture that instant?
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.680]   Or did it delay a second and a half?
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.720]   Did it lock up?
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.880]   Did it put you in a different mode?
[00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.440]   No, if you hold down that button,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.760]   you will get as many pictures as God intended you to ever
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.840]   have with human sight, and you'll definitely get it.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.440]   So that's why it's the best camera that you can buy today.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.960]   And I think that one of the things
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.440]   is that we have a lot of us, there's probably 10% of us
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.520]   that are paying attention to every spec and every bit.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.040]   And I think that 90% of the folks that have these cameras,
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:27.120]   what they really care about is exactly what Andy's
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.760]   kind of touching on, which is that when they push the button,
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.200]   they want it to be in focus, they want it to not be grainy.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.600]   And they want the right people to be in focus or whatever.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.480]   And that's pretty much-- I mean, for most people,
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.520]   I'm definitely from my wife and my parents,
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.880]   that's all they care about is that they get a--
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.800]   when they took the photo, it reminds them of what happened,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.200]   and it doesn't look messed up.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.120]   And I think that-- and that turns out
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.960]   to be a very complicated thing to do.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:58.160]   But I think that Apple does it probably better
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.680]   than anyone else right now.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.240]   The only thing I had to fall in the forest,
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.960]   I just do wish that they would remove 70% of the clutter
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.000]   from the camera app.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.120]   The number of times where I've taken out the phone,
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.800]   I've been walking around holding the phone,
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:11.160]   and I want to take a picture quickly.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.320]   But, oh, OK, I'm in black and white video mode.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.720]   Like, what-- or I'm in some sort of--
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.080]   - Yeah, I'm in square effect mode.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.040]   - Yeah, and I've accidentally gotten into piano,
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.320]   I've accidentally gotten into video.
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.520]   I mean, I kind of wish that stuff was
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.720]   a hit in a little bit more because I just moat--
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.600]   - Yeah, 99% of the time, I just want to pick it up
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.440]   and take a photo.
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:32.320]   - Yeah, and annoys me because things like the filter effects,
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.040]   I never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.600]   imagine me saying that another thousand times,
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.800]   never use that feature ever.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.680]   But I will take out my phone and it's in that mode.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.480]   And I'm like, is there a way that can just put duct tape
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.640]   over that part of the screen so that it's not possible
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.440]   to activate that feature?
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.280]   And--
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.680]   - Well, they moved it, they swapped it with the selfie button,
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.440]   Andy, so it releases further out of the way now.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.360]   And now you can selfie all the time.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.040]   - It's just like the-- it's one of the least Apple-like
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.520]   designs I've ever seen.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.800]   They are masters that figure out how can we simplify this,
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.400]   how can we remove clutter.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.200]   And it's like looking at a box of Legos
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.360]   that's been like fallen onto the floor.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.080]   And then you just simply put like an iOS 10 box around it
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:16.080]   in a circle in the middle of it.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.760]   And there's your user interface.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.320]   - One thing that was fun for me is we were filming
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.160]   near Battery Park, I forget the name of the park.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.960]   And I was shooting over the fountain
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.200]   and I just hear a study yell.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.400]   - I don't know, that's where I shot my slow motion demo
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   pictures last year, when the slow motion was in my mouth.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.480]   - It was great.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.000]   And then the center Diel dropped it.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.840]   And just immediately I had like, I was screaming
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.240]   in my head, I was screaming,
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.440]   but I dropped the phone.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.880]   And then she's like, do it again, do it again.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.360]   And we did five or six takes of me dropping the phone
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.160]   that fountain and then diving after it.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.040]   I didn't even think about it, but luckily the Apple Watch
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.600]   is waterproof too, and picking the phone out.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.080]   And it survived.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   And I've seen demos on the internet now with people
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.120]   doing underwater photography and videography with it.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.840]   The only thing that scares me though is that Apple
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.480]   very plainly says that water damage is still not
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.800]   covered under warranty.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.400]   And just understanding the technology,
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.280]   I know that it's never 100%.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.880]   And also it wears out over time and can be eroded over time
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.960]   depending on what it comes in contact with.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.000]   So I'm just waiting for someone who takes
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.600]   it scuba diving or something to just totally destroy
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.360]   their phone and then that'll be the next big internet thing.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.600]   - They are very clear that they say,
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.400]   don't take it in salt water.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.960]   (laughing)
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.600]   - There's so many different ways to,
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.400]   are they gonna come up with a 40 page document
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.640]   that explains here's what we mean by waterproof
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.200]   or water resistant.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.880]   And also I fix it did one of their really great tear downs
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.960]   and came to the conclusion that a lot of the water resistance
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.720]   comes down to the quality of the adhesives
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.160]   and the seals that they've put into the device.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:51.120]   So that would mean that if for any reason
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.120]   you needed that phone repaired,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.280]   it would be super, super difficult for Apple
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.360]   to take that apart and then put it back together again
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.680]   so that all of the integrity of those seals are intact.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.040]   I don't know what the plan is,
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.840]   but it just seems to me as though
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.640]   there's so many problems with including water damage
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.280]   as part of the warranty coverage
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.640]   that is just simpler to say, by the way.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.760]   Don't think that you can drop this down
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.520]   to the depths of Atlantis,
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.800]   have a balloon automated, bring it back up again
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.240]   and we will still pay for the crack screen.
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.880]   - I'd like a co-pay like the crack screen.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.800]   Yeah, I think that would be great.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.440]   Like it's 20 or 90, whatever the deductible is for that
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.160]   and they'll do it twice or something.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.000]   - Yeah.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.760]   - And then maybe everyone's happy.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.680]   But I mean, it held up for me
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.080]   and it worked fine and we're seeing some great things.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.480]   But again, please don't think that you can use it
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.840]   like a GoPro.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.760]   Even the active, the Samsung Galaxy Active
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.480]   which is much higher level waterproofing
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.920]   than the iPhone failed into consumer reports test
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:48.520]   not that I'm a huge fan of computer reports,
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.880]   but you can always get one that doesn't work
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.240]   or one that's worn out and it could be three months from now
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.320]   and suddenly buy by phone.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.000]   So please, you never know that the time.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.160]   - I think it's great.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.440]   I think it's great when you accidentally drop it somewhere
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.080]   or you're out in the rain
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.920]   or you're out in the thing,
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.600]   you don't have to worry at every moment that it's wet.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.040]   So I think that is a great feature
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.040]   and as long as people don't use it that feature
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.280]   as a constant feature that they're actually depending on,
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.880]   I think that most people are gonna be okay.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.600]   - Yeah, my daily shooter camera is the Olympus OM-D EM-1
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.240]   that is fully weather resistant
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.720]   and the ability to simply,
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.040]   I'm walking through Yosemite or I'm walking downtown Boston
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.400]   and it starts raining and I don't have to,
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.120]   I don't even think about, oh my God,
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.480]   do I go to plastic bag and put this inside my backpack
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.640]   and the next time I was like, no, it just stays where it was
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.040]   and I don't worry about it because it's just that good
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.000]   and it's the exact same thing.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.280]   I don't think people, the feature is important in the sense
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.440]   that people will be able to do underwater photography
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:47.680]   or necessarily trust that if they drop it in the toilet,
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.640]   there'll be one less reason for them to want to go
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.680]   and get it back.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.200]   But I think it's more like it's raining
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.400]   or it's been in your pocket
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.200]   and then you don't realize how much you've been sweating
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.920]   until you pull it out and say, oh,
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.800]   it's actually dripping from the speaker port.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.640]   Oh, that's right.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.480]   I perspire to condenses on solid objects.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.880]   - But even your friend pushes you in the pool
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.040]   and doesn't realize you have your phone on you.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.680]   - Yeah. - Things happen.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.240]   - That's more of a saver. - That's a procedure.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.560]   - Yeah. - Totally.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.200]   I'm sorry, I apologize to everyone.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.440]   - No. - Now Renee, I do notice
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.120]   something odd in your ear.
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.680]   You have something. - Air pod odd.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.040]   - A little something there.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.720]   How's that one? - Yeah, so those are the air pods.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.240]   They're not out yet, but Apple did give some of them out
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.480]   to preview and I've been trying to test it out.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.160]   I'm not wearing both now because you only need one for mono.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.240]   You put both in, it goes to stereo.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.800]   And the secret is if you use them in mono,
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.720]   you can keep switching them back and forth
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.680]   and the case will keep recharging them.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.360]   So instead of five hours of stereo,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.680]   you have like five plus five plus five plus five
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.600]   effectively having two days of mono listening time.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:47.840]   And so far they've been really good.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.160]   I mean, I'm not losing them and usually my ears
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.800]   are horrible for these things.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   And the audience is quite good. - And usually my experiences,
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.520]   the phone, the phone's in my pocket
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.040]   and I have a Bluetooth setup.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.600]   You know, I end up getting some kind of breakup,
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.360]   but it sounds like you're not having any of those issues.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.760]   - And I'm using it on a Mac that I really shouldn't be like,
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.840]   it pairs automatically using that W1 chip
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.720]   on anything running iOS 10 or Mac OS Sierra.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.600]   But I'm using an older LCAP machine.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.360]   So I haven't updated my podcasting machine
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.240]   and I got a warning saying this is not designed
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.400]   to be used with this software, please update,
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.320]   but now it's working fine.
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.920]   I hear you loud and clear.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.960]   I'm not using the mic because I have this giant mic.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.000]   I didn't want to mess with the quality of the recording,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.360]   but the audio quality is great.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.800]   - And with the phone, you don't find that you ever have
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.880]   a lot of breakup or any kind of that kind of clicking
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.440]   that YouTube video. - I had none.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.280]   - I have a lot of the Bluetooth.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.840]   - And you double tap it and you use Siri.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.080]   And I've been using it in the car.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.200]   I can hear perfectly.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.800]   I use it on the plane ride the entire time.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.880]   I use it, Srinar and I both used it in New York
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.000]   when we were walking around.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.040]   So far really, really good.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.400]   I think the level of technology inside them handles a lot
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.920]   of actually putting a chip, making them tiny computers,
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.880]   solves a lot of problems that devices that weren't
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.400]   that smart suffered through.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.520]   - Right.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.480]   I'm just worried about the, I'm encouraged and also worried
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.280]   about some of the features that are built into them
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   that are designed to help you because my biggest source
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.960]   of frustration in all technology are devices that try
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.920]   to help you but are not very smart about it.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.480]   So like-- - We see you writing a letter Andy.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.920]   - Right, or it's like, oh, well, you've taken the earbud out
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.240]   and so I'm gonna automatically pause the playback
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.840]   because you're taking your earbud out
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.880]   and I'm gonna put it back in again and, oh, you've disconnected
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.560]   and you said, okay, but how about if you just, okay, wait,
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.520]   how about your, oh, you took it out
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.800]   but then you actually related horizontally
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.160]   but then you tilted a little bit.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.760]   So I think you mean go to the next track.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.800]   I'm gonna be really helpful and go to the next track.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.120]   I've been reading some people first impressions
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.440]   from people who have them and have been saying
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.360]   that this have run into situations
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.840]   where they've been annoyed by some of the automatic,
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.120]   try to figure out what I should do for you automatically
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.920]   in this instant features of it.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.880]   Have you had any bad experiences with it like that?
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.720]   - No, that's fine.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.880]   I understood that it was explained to me
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.600]   that you put one in, it goes to mono,
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.240]   put the second one in, it goes to stereo,
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.280]   take one out, it pauses, you can hit play again,
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.640]   it'll resume in mono, tap twice to answer
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.800]   or hang up on a call, tap twice for Siri.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.200]   But that's about all you can do with these
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.880]   and that's where I think annoyance will come from
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.040]   because tapping twice, waiting for Siri,
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.840]   saying increase volume 20%, lower volume 50%,
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.440]   skip to next track, that's a lot more work
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.920]   than just clicking a button on a remote control.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.040]   So the parts that it does make more convenient,
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.160]   it makes super convenient, but at the expense
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.360]   of the more complicated actions,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.280]   which then become exponentially more complicated.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.400]   - Yeah, I'm not sure if I wanna be next
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.240]   to someone on the bus saying, oh, more volume please,
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.720]   less volume, well,
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.280]   - You can do it on your phone or your watch too,
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:47.080]   like if you need to, you can tap it on your watch
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.840]   or your phone, but if you really wanna be hands free,
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.520]   you gotta have a conversation.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.040]   (laughs)
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.800]   - It should be public.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.120]   - So it wouldn't be an iPhone launch
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.880]   if there weren't at least a few gates to go around.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.680]   A couple of years ago, it was Ben Gate last year,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.640]   it was Chip Gate.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.120]   This year, there are like mini gates,
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:05.200]   maybe I don't know, fences or something that happened.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.920]   The first one was with the home button.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.680]   Apple did say at the event, and I remembered this clearly,
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.640]   that it's a capacitive button, the same ring
[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.080]   that the text touch ID now detects you pressing
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.640]   the home button and that lets it stay in a low power state
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.120]   until you're actually going to press it.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.360]   So it's a little bit of power efficiency there.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.040]   But if you put something covering your thumb,
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.960]   for example, if you're wearing regular gloves,
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.280]   it has no idea that there's anything on it.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.000]   This doesn't feel the electricity, so it doesn't activate
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.480]   and that was concerning to some people.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.720]   It was pointed out very quickly that all you could do
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.360]   was press the home button because the screen still
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.280]   requires capacitive touch.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.040]   You still have to have actual skin contact to do that,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.880]   but people were used to just turning on the screen
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.960]   to look at notifications.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.720]   You can do that with raise to wake, but that's fine.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.600]   What made it a little bit more of a problem is that
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.160]   some people said it didn't work with capacitive gloves either.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.400]   Those are the kind of gloves you get that have a coating on
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.480]   and that does allow electrical transfer.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.760]   We tested a whole bunch of them,
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.640]   so I already tested several pairs.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.240]   I have 10 pairs because every family member thinks
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.400]   it's the perfect gift for me any holiday or birthday season.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.280]   So I took them all out and even the dollar store,
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.720]   like the cheapest ones I had, worked fine
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.320]   as long as the capacitive material actually touched the ring
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:15.600]   and wasn't degraded in any way.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.560]   So it was fine for me, but Andy, it is more complication.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.840]   It's not just a physical button anymore.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.720]   It's something that has to have certain conditions
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.440]   met now to work.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.320]   - Yeah, there are a whole bunch of knock on effects.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.160]   Every time you do something that, to change a design
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.120]   that is simple and it's logical and it's rational,
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.880]   it's something you really motivated to do,
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.440]   but you're not gonna find out how it affects people's lives
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.680]   until you actually do it.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.840]   And that's a classic problem.
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.880]   There are problems that are affected by people
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.280]   in the warmer climbs that those of us in New England
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.360]   and Chicago and Minnesota said,
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.200]   this is gonna be a totally different device
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.320]   as soon as the mercury drops.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.800]   And there are a number of, I'm like you,
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.920]   I do have a number of those capacitive gloves.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.240]   Mostly I have a pair, I have sets of burner gloves
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.360]   where I've just literally like snipped off a fingertip
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.720]   just so that I can make sure that I will have a finger free.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.240]   And there's also the nasal interface sometimes
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.840]   to make that work.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.160]   So yeah, that is a bummer.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.160]   Also, some people are complaining rightly that
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:23.880]   they have diminished sight, they have special needs
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.400]   when it comes to operating a phone.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.040]   And the presence of a tactile clicky button
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.600]   is a lot more easier for them to manage
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.920]   than something that is a conjectural button,
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.960]   even though there is a way to,
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.840]   you can actually feel where the actual sensor is
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.520]   and the haptic just goes through the feedback.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.960]   The home button actually feels the same.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.320]   It just, the click doesn't feel the same,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:45.040]   but the physical button by itself feels the same.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.440]   - And also some people have been talked about workarounds.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.080]   If you go into accessibility, I've got it right here.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:53.000]   There's a feature called the display accommodations.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.400]   I'm sorry, not display accommodations.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.600]   It's where is it?
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:57.920]   - Rest finger to unlock.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.840]   - I'm sure everyone is in contact with the copacitor.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.480]   I don't understand this copacitor thing.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.920]   What's the issue here?
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.000]   Like nobody in Northern California is like,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.840]   I don't know.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.680]   - Or in Northern California.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.360]   - The capacity, the capacity, Alex.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.800]   So the winner mode might be to turn on touch accommodations,
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.760]   which says, if you have trouble using the touch screen,
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.080]   adjust the following settings to change
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.960]   how the screen will respond to touches.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.760]   And there's a bunch of ways that will just,
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.640]   it won't make assumptions and you will still be able to
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.600]   use it the way, it's a little bit easier to use it
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.480]   with a capacitive pair of gloves than before.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.080]   It's not intended, like a lot of the great features
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.640]   and accessibility was designed to make the devices
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.120]   accessible to people who have certain limitations,
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.160]   physically, but there's always little fun things
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.440]   for people who just want things to work a little differently.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.040]   I've been, there's a, for those of us who do not have
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.200]   the eyes of a hawk, there's a new feature that will
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.120]   essentially turn it into, turn the phone
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.520]   into a really wonderful magnifier.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.040]   So that's, so that if you're like in dim lighting
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:03.800]   and there's some, there's some text on a,
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.080]   on a package or on a bottle or this dim light in a menu,
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   you just can't like, there's not enough light
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.200]   so that your hardware can really lock in
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.280]   and what those words are.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.920]   It will light amplify it, it will magnify it
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.680]   and then it will lock that image so that you can then
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.720]   read it at your discretion and at your leisure.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.240]   So there's always, the last thing that I do
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.640]   whenever I'm testing out a new version of iOS
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.480]   is actually to go into accessibility and see
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.640]   what has changed and how can I exploit it to my own ends.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.080]   - So I think it's gonna be a biggest problem
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.000]   for people in border states because once you're above
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.320]   the wall, I mean, we have capacitive gloves
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.280]   but none of us use them.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.520]   It's the same thing like you go by a Canadian hospital
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.960]   and because you can't smoke inside,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.200]   there are doctors outside in their scrubs
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.080]   like for 20 minutes at minus 30 degrees
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.520]   just smoke in there and using their phones and they're fine.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.560]   So we're used to having frozen appendages
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.320]   but I think it's the people who do have those gloves
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.560]   who are afraid of a little bit of cold
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.360]   but it will, you really have nothing to worry about.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.200]   It'll work the same as your screen.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   The thing that I think Alex is gonna be
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.800]   at least more of a concern for people to have it
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.280]   is the hissing effect.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:11.640]   Basically, it's a coil whine where the new A10 processor
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.520]   which is a beast, is a beast of a processor, it is so fast.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.080]   On some people's phones it's creating a higher pitched noise.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.360]   I tried a ton of devices.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.000]   I listened to iPads, to Macbooks,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.880]   to home electronics devices, to stereos.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.120]   You can hear the same bass noise on almost any of them
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.240]   when they're under load but for some people,
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.520]   for some reason whether it's the waterproof coating
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.360]   or just the components are in the wrong position
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.000]   on their unit, they hear it really loudly
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.240]   and I wonder if post-Samson climate
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.000]   we're all a little bit, we're all a little bit sensitive to this?
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.520]   - You know, I don't know, I'd like to hear it.
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.360]   I haven't heard any of this so far.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.720]   And I don't have a seven, traditionally I'm always
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.880]   somewhere where I can't order when it first goes off
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.880]   and then I have to wait two or three months
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.040]   to get my phone. - I'm just full of those cases.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.000]   - So I'm not gonna have a seven anytime soon.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.080]   So, but with any device, I haven't heard any of this
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.600]   and I haven't heard recordings of people
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.200]   who have said that they've heard this
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:09.040]   and I'm kind of curious how loud it really is.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.320]   I mean, there's definitely a lot of things
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.880]   that drive us all crazy and I'm sure that it's there
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.800]   but the question is like once you put it inside of a case,
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.880]   which you should always do.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.000]   - It's only when it's under load like restoring
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.800]   or when the processor is really firing on heavy
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.800]   and the room is quiet, you'll hear that.
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.320]   (imitates clicking)
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.160]   Sound.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.080]   - I haven't, I've never heard that ever,
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.840]   but and I'm usually pretty sensitive to sound
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.560]   but maybe it's just that I'm always in a loud environment
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.520]   when I'm pushing my phone.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.120]   So, I don't know for sure.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:41.840]   But I think that it's probably something that is a,
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.200]   you may be there, there's a phone,
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.720]   the phones have some registration issues
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.960]   that's probably, one would say a handful is probably,
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.120]   a very small percentage could be 10,000 people
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.480]   or 15,000 people that have kissing.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.760]   But I think that it's probably some kind of
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.840]   small registration issue with some of these,
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.840]   which is why I think I always benefit
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.640]   from the fact that I missed the first round.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.960]   (laughing)
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.800]   - Yeah, that's it.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.680]   - Like always, I always think I'm gonna do it that night
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.160]   and then it's like, not now, it's not until November
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.960]   and I'm just like, ah, this week and total is in the store.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:18.000]   - Yeah, that's a really good point that they,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.520]   of course they test these things thoroughly
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.800]   but it's not until they put millions of devices
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.400]   in the hands of millions of people,
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.400]   people who have different levels of hearing
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.120]   and also in different environments
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.520]   that you're gonna figure out what the defects are,
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.400]   what the bumps might be in the manufacturing process.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.880]   So if you wait for, there can be a hardware revision
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   that does nothing more than improves the return rate
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.800]   so that you, if you were to affect your devices
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.400]   and just makes things a little bit simpler to build.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.360]   And that's also a good time to mention the general advice.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.560]   Any time that you buy a brand new Apple device,
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.280]   meaning it's not just new to you,
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.120]   but this is a, they've just released it.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.360]   If there's anything, anything you don't like about it,
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.640]   do not hesitate to go back to the Apple store with it
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.200]   because this is a time for the first two or three weeks
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.160]   where they are hyper, hyper, hyper vigilant about anything
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:12.760]   that might be wrong with this device.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.160]   So if you dropped it and the screen shattered
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.080]   and you thought that, wow, it's like,
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.320]   I've dropped it on this car,
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:20.160]   I've dropped my old phone,
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.600]   it's caroped a couple of times, not any problems.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.960]   Why did this one break?
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.400]   You're not necessarily screwed
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.840]   because each store might have sort of a bounty
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.560]   where the mothership has said,
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.120]   we want you to try to capture,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.640]   if we were gonna allow you to capture as many as X devices
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.680]   with broken screens,
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.840]   X devices that have connectivity problems
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.240]   with the cellular X devices that have connectivity problems
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.560]   with Wi-Fi, things that have unusual dings,
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.000]   if something's making a buzzing noises,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.240]   these are the situations where you take it back,
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.720]   you don't wind up having a long conversation
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:58.000]   with the genius, the genius does not have a long conversation
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.760]   with their manager, they immediately bring out a black coffin,
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.440]   it's referred to as the capture,
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.040]   they actually will capture,
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.160]   they call it capturing the phone,
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.640]   it will be sent directly back to the mothership,
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:12.920]   you will be given a brand new phone maybe,
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.720]   and like no questions asked just do,
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.680]   okay, we're awesome, we're just gonna solve this problem
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.560]   for you immediately,
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.640]   and it's not maybe not something that they would do
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.040]   for people a month later or two months later.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.640]   This is the time where Apple wants to know
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:26.240]   how are these things performing in the real world,
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.160]   and the only way they can figure that out
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.680]   is to capture devices that are causing problems,
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:33.560]   and then dissect it down to the molecular level
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.600]   and see what was different about this one,
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   that seemed to be different from the reference products
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.000]   that we have certified as being built
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.880]   and operating as they should.
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.280]   >> And not to be, not to be the curmudgeon,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.680]   but I find that, I mean, while a lot of us get excited,
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.160]   that thinking of the release date
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.240]   as three months out from the release date
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.760]   can really make sure that-
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.120]   >> Lois, your anxiety level.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.040]   >> They're gonna make more than 80 of them.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.760]   You're kind of okay if you're gonna wait,
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.600]   they'll make more.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.880]   >> You'll get one eventually,
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:05.280]   and the second, it will be a dot two version.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.840]   >> You know, like there'll be a couple like that.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:07.680]   >> Right.
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.600]   >> So, my thing with all of this is just that,
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.880]   it's launch weekend, so every outlet worth their viewers
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.520]   is looking for a hot Apple story,
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.000]   and we saw this on NBC, it showed up on NBC yesterday,
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.280]   and we're living in a climate where
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.840]   there literally are phones that are burning,
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.720]   so people are super sensitive about it.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.880]   This is a processor, has nothing to do with the battery.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.680]   It's a well-known electrical phenomenon.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.280]   I talked to some engineers about it,
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.440]   and a bunch of engineers contacted me in the comments,
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.080]   and Twitter, and it can be annoying.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.560]   And if it doesn't annoy you, absolutely.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.520]   If it's loud enough to annoy you, take it back,
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:39.320]   but you don't have anything to worry about.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.280]   And with that, we're gonna toss to our good friend,
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.880]   Leo Laport, because he wants to tell us
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.320]   about something awesome, and I think it's called Texture.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.160]   >> Thanks, guys.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.800]   We will have more Mac break weekly in a little bit,
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.440]   but I've got to tell you about our fine sponsor.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.360]   In fact, somebody that's saving my life
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.520]   as I travel long airplane flights,
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.680]   a lot of downtime, a lot of waiting rooms.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.640]   That's why I love Texture.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.880]   Magazine's a great source of entertainment.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.240]   They're great for reading, short stories,
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.640]   fiction and nonfiction, but of course,
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.280]   the problem is they're expensive.
[00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:15.520]   I'm not gonna subscribe to a year's worth of magazines
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.880]   for one or two articles in that time,
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.640]   and I don't wanna go buy the newstan edition every time.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.560]   Just think of the coffee table clutter.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.320]   So when Texture came out, I was thrilled.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.400]   It's basically Netflix for magazines,
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.560]   and you get access to 200 of the best magazines in the world.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.800]   I mean, all of them, the New Yorker,
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.040]   the National Geographic, Wired, Vanity Fair,
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.000]   I'm telling you the magazines I read.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.840]   Actually, I like to look at Billboard and ad age two.
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.240]   Those are kind of trade magazines.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.920]   Probably not magazines I would buy or subscribe to,
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.280]   'cause it's Billboard's hundreds of dollars a year,
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:50.280]   but the fact that I've got it
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.720]   as part of my Texture subscription is awesome.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.120]   I should show you my iPad, 'cause I've already,
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.920]   I got all my magazines that I wanna have
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.160]   on the trip with me, favorited.
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.680]   And once you favor it 'em, you can say,
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.600]   "I want you to download each new issue when it comes out."
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.200]   So they're automatically on the iPad,
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:09.400]   even if I'm in the air or somewhere without a connection.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.640]   That is awesome.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.120]   That is wonderful.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.520]   And the best magazines,
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:16.040]   you get every page that's in the current issue,
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:18.160]   plus back issues, plus bonus features
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.880]   that you would not get in a magazine,
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.760]   in a print magazine, like video.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.200]   And the best part is you can use your texture subscription
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.880]   on up to five devices per account.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.840]   So you have it on your phone and your tablet.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:30.680]   It's great.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.320]   Or in my case, Lisa's got it and I have it.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.440]   We have a family subscription.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.280]   You sign up for texture.

[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.480]   A world of great reading,
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.400]   stuff that's not on the internet,
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.640]   but it's on your iPad, your iPhone, your Android device.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.880]   Texture.com/twit.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.760]   Now back to Macbreak.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.320]   Leo, it's great that you're still with us,
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.320]   at least in spirit.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.520]   So the big news today,
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.520]   we were talking about the release, the big weekend use,
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.240]   but the big news today is that Mac OSC era
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.200]   launched about an hour before the show starts.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.280]   I had a chance to use it because I am foolish
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.840]   and I put the beta on my computer,
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.280]   the minute WWDC's keynote ends.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:34.840]   And sometimes I suffer for it.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.600]   Sometimes I'm happy about it.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.920]   This year it was fairly stable for me.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.720]   Andy, have you had a chance to play around with Sierra at all?
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.840]   Yeah, I haven't installed the shipping version
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.080]   because I have not lived a pure and chaste life.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.760]   And if God wants to make trouble for me,
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.520]   I'm basically saying, "Hi God,
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:54.200]   I've done an hour before podcast.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.280]   Please strike me down."
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:56.840]   Like Andy.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.360]   It's hilarious, I am, yes.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.080]   But I've had the beta on my secondary Mac.
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.040]   As I've been working pretty great,
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.520]   I installed it for good when iOS 10 came up
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.400]   because there are a few features that kind of get nasty
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   at you unless you say, "Wait a minute,
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.840]   you're not running Sierra, you're running into Sierra."
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.560]   But I find it very, very stable.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:22.040]   I find it not a Titanic upgrade, but a pretty safe one.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.720]   And as usual, my usual advice is if you can,
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.120]   wait a couple of weeks, wait a couple of weeks,
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.200]   just in case there's a deal breaker coming up,
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.920]   but I found it a pretty good experience.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.760]   So that means Alex is gonna be waiting a year or two
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.320]   for his production machines.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.120]   (laughing)
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.880]   I thought about it and it's just been a busy summer.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.000]   I haven't, so I was like, "Well, just wait until Andy
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.160]   and Renee tell me it's okay."
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.360]   - Are you an El Capitanian?
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.880]   (laughing)
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.720]   - Yeah, yeah, I have.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   I have done this.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.560]   - Okay.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:51.960]   - There's actually a handful of machines
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.120]   that are still on 185 or 186.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.600]   (laughing)
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.440]   Because there's--
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.520]   - They're Intel's all right.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.360]   - They work.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:00.200]   - What?
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.880]   - They're Intel though, right?
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.000]   - Yeah, well, the funny thing is that
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.920]   there's big stickers on them that say, "You know, 185.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.120]   "You know, like do not change this."
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.200]   'Cause there's some playback stuff that we use
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.280]   that gets a little less stable as the upgrades go up.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.120]   So we've got a couple of these old machines
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.960]   that are relative to new machines,
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.600]   but with old operating systems.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.040]   But, you know, I moved that El Capitan like last week.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.280]   I mean, it was, it's been great.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:29.080]   I mean, you know, when Apple releases,
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.440]   at least announces a new one,
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.360]   that usually tells me that it's time to upgrade
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.920]   to the last one.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.760]   That's pretty much how I will.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.760]   - So the most impressive thing to me with this update
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.840]   is that Apple continues to take continuity,
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.640]   which was released two years ago,
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   and is a technology that doesn't just sync data,
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.120]   but syncs the state of activity
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.440]   between multiple devices
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.400]   and do pretty interesting things with them.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.120]   And this year we got universal clipboard
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.920]   so I can copy from my iPhone, paste onto my Mac.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.800]   We've got auto unlock.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.720]   So as long as my Apple watch comes in proximity,
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.880]   it'll just open up my Mac.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.880]   And we've got--
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.720]   - Seriously.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:05.640]   - I'm blanking what third one was,
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.360]   but there's at least three cases in the operating system
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.840]   where, sorry, the Apple Pay,
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.080]   which is done on Safari on the web,
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:16.480]   but is authorized by your Apple watch or your iPhone.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.320]   And that to me is a sort of integration
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.560]   that Apple does really well.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.560]   I mean, I can't believe there's still no handoff for iTunes
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.840]   because I would love to be able to start a movie on my Mac
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.280]   and walk away with my iPhone
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.760]   or come back on my iPad and watch it on my iMac.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.960]   But Andy, this is one of those things
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.480]   where I think the technology was a good idea at the time.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.600]   And like extensibility,
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.040]   they just keep finding more and more and more
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.680]   really cool ideas to do with it.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.320]   - Yeah, it's a core technology,
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:44.280]   which means that the news announcement is boring
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.760]   for most consumers, really exciting for developers.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.440]   Then a year later becomes really exciting for consumers
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.600]   as app developers figure out how to make that work for them.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.960]   It's a tough feature though,
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.840]   because you really do have to be aware of it.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.800]   You have to be aware that there's a shared clipboard
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.280]   between these two devices.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.040]   It also has to be relevant to you.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.160]   If you're doing, I was using it a couple of times last week,
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.600]   mostly just to test it out.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.800]   Most of the time when I want to move a small piece
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.760]   of information, that information is important enough
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.400]   that would like to actually put it into Google Keep
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:21.680]   or Evernote or the great internet shared clipboard
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.160]   that I rely on.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:29.160]   I'm glad that Siri works a lot more like it does on iOS
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.240]   than it does on Mac OS now.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.360]   There are a lot of extra features
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.480]   that let you control hardware features of the Mac
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.960]   that weren't there before.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.280]   There's a lot more spotlight sort of stuff.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.440]   Now, spotlight doesn't feel like it was born
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.840]   on another planet from the version of Search
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.560]   and Spotlight that's on iOS.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.720]   So there's a lot more, there I say,
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.080]   Google now sort of functionality where there's a search bar
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.840]   and a search box that remembers the stuff you're interested in
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.160]   and lets you kind of keep it there for reference.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.680]   Lots of things that are gonna,
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.280]   they're not gonna immediately change your life
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.600]   until the first time you realize that this,
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.680]   you make a concerted effort to like go to the iBook store,
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.360]   download the actual PDF, the actual iBooks manual for it.
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.560]   You will see that there are features
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.240]   that you didn't even guess existed.
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.000]   You start playing with them and then suddenly
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   you start remembering to use them.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.320]   So that's, I myself forget that Apple does document
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.360]   this entire thing fully.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.120]   They give you almost a $35 missing manual sort of book
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.760]   on here's how to use all the new features here
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.680]   as opposed to the sales brochure
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.800]   that you'll find on apple.com.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.440]   There are oftentimes that I just don't know
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:38.720]   that something happens until I actually read that book.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.960]   So it wasn't after one week of raising it full time.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.520]   Like I said, it hasn't really revolutionized my world
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.240]   but it's a good step forward
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.560]   and it doesn't have to help me
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.280]   in the hundred different ways it can help me.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.480]   All it has to do is find three or four things
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:55.160]   that are kind of tough for me right now
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.120]   and make that part of my world a little bit better.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.200]   - K will say, I think that's actually one of the things.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.400]   - I think that's the last words between the two
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.880]   and it was much better than typing it on his iPhone.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.360]   - Yeah.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.520]   Yeah, well, and I think that one of the things
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:07.440]   that Apple does really well
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.520]   and I think people get disappointed
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:11.400]   that Apple is not creating one revolution after the other
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.720]   but the evolution that we're seeing both with the OS 10
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.320]   and with the phone is an evolution.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:18.800]   It's saying we're gonna make all these things
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.640]   a little bit better.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:20.720]   We're gonna do it kind of a stable way.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.840]   We're not gonna try to redesign the entire interface
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.640]   and have you, and some of it will work
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.560]   and some of it will break and some of it will catch fire.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.960]   You know, like it's, it is, you know,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.720]   there's things like we're just gonna make, you know,
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:33.120]   everything just, you know, be a little smoother,
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.920]   a little, you know, I think for a lot of,
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.520]   and one of the things I've been thinking about a lot is
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.880]   that I think that in some ways Apple, you know,
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.560]   users and iPhone users,
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.400]   (laughs)
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.240]   in a lot of ways they, you know,
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.440]   it's not, they buy an iPhone,
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.200]   not because they love phones so much,
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.840]   just because they don't, you know,
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.160]   they kind of want to just be part of their environment
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.080]   and not something that is, you know, all encompassing
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.480]   and they just want it to work.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.280]   - The big thing for me was Siri on the Mac.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.680]   Like I think it fairly,
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.440]   fairness, it took way too long to get there
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.160]   because for us it's nice to have,
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.640]   but for people in the accessibility community,
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.520]   there was really no way to control a Mac,
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:06.800]   no native way to control a Mac with their voice.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.760]   And we've seen how empowering that is
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.880]   with the iPhone, with the iPad,
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.560]   even with the Apple TV and just basic voice control
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.880]   and especially sophisticated Siri control
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.920]   is a difference between that device being usable
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.880]   to them or not.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.920]   So I'm super, super happy, you know,
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:21.880]   it doesn't do everything yet.
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.880]   It doesn't do home control,
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.400]   which I would think was being normal for a device
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.320]   that's most of the time in your home,
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:30.720]   but you know, there's always limits to what it can do.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.520]   I like that you can do complex searches for files,
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.120]   you can get to settings almost immediately.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.440]   You can query for things that would otherwise
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.840]   take you spelunking through the computer to find.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.080]   I think all that is great.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.760]   I also really, I didn't think I'd like it.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.600]   I didn't think I'd use it because I'm a control freak,
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.360]   but all the new storage optimization stuff,
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.920]   if you can find it because it is incredibly buried
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.600]   in, it's a new storage manager
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.880]   that you basically have to use Spotlight to find
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.640]   or if you know it, you can go to the Apple menu
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.720]   and click on about this Mac and get there.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   But it's really great.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.160]   I was always, always hitting the storage limit.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.640]   I was continuously getting that,
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:08.880]   your disk is almost full, go delete stuff
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.040]   and it would be at the worst time.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.000]   Like when I'm rendering a file cut video
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.600]   from a hands-on at an event
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.520]   and I'd have to go scrounge for space.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:18.440]   But immediately it showed me all these iOS backup files
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.120]   and old render files that I could delete
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.440]   and it got me down to about half full on my disk
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.360]   and I've stayed there.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.040]   The one that I'm more cautious about
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.560]   is the automatic syncing of the desktop
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.240]   and the automatic sort of quasi deletion of files locally
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.760]   because there's a safety file caused because for me,
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.320]   I render logic files and final cut files to my desktop
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.240]   and they start syncing and if I'm tethered,
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.840]   there just goes all my data.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.120]   Like it's just, I want to be able to drag it to Dropbox.
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:50.480]   But also, it's a sync service.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.240]   It's not a backup service
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.960]   and your stuff could just vanish
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.120]   or you could go offline.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:57.160]   It's the same problem I have sometimes with Google Docs.
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.160]   You could just go offline
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.200]   and there's not have access to a file you need.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   So that to me, I think people should be highly cautious of.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:09.520]   - Yeah, also Apple doesn't have the greatest track record
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.480]   for me, for trust us, we'll manage your files,
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.800]   we'll manage the hell out of your files.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.440]   As anybody who switched over to Apple Music found out
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.760]   that, oh boy, you really simplified my collection.
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:25.040]   You simplified it down to three albums and two MP3 files.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.640]   Thank you very much.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:30.760]   But more than any other release, definitely.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.600]   You should always make sure you have a recent backup anyway,
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.800]   just as a matter of course,
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.840]   but this is one of those times where you're double, double,
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:43.360]   double sure that you run Superduper the hour before
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.280]   you are about to install the upgrade.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.840]   Make a backup on another drive, unplug that drive,
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.160]   put it someplace where Apple can't see it
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:53.840]   and can't hurt it possibly.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:55.760]   And then started up there.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.840]   Yeah, I mean, I also tried the optimizer.
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:01.000]   I noted that it was able to find at least
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.360]   the 20 or 30 gigabytes of storage that I could get rid of.
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.880]   I noted it, I did not have the guts to push that button
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.960]   and say, yes, please delete files from my hard drive.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.200]   That's definitely one of those things
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.920]   we're gonna wait two or three months for,
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.160]   to see how much Jim Dallerimple might or might not
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.000]   be affected by this.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.560]   I think Jason Snell wrote that he was,
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.600]   like, damn it, at least a couple times.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.280]   So yeah, be extremely cautious.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:26.080]   - Letting the machine delete my files
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.560]   is not something that I'll ever do.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.160]   I don't care what anyone says.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.000]   (laughs)
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.760]   We didn't like, no, no.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.720]   - Well, so I don't understand the use case as much
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.440]   because if you're in a situation where you are
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:38.240]   right at the edge of storage
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:40.640]   and it starts moving older files out of the way,
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.920]   I mean, you've got bigger problems.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.560]   It's the kind of thing where you really need to
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.440]   sort of do that management beforehand
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.840]   because I don't see that being particularly helpful for you.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.160]   But I think, again, the other stuff,
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.880]   the other stuff is really, really good.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.920]   The dictionary management, all that kind of stuff.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:54.000]   So I would keep that one off,
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.240]   but flip the switch on the other ones pretty quickly.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.440]   - Well, and I think that one of the things
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:02.560]   that that is a challenge for all of the consumers
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.840]   that are now shooting all these phones
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.880]   and as the phones shoot bigger images,
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.440]   like where do you put them all?
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.120]   I think that the last time I moved my wife's,
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.760]   her stuff from one computer to another,
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.400]   it was like a thumb drive.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.280]   Two gig thumb drive moved everything.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.800]   From one computer now, it's getting to be a problem.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.640]   And I think that people are trying to figure that out
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:26.120]   right now and I don't think that they have figured it out
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.720]   as far as how they're going to actually make all of that work.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:34.080]   - Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of,
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.920]   it's such a mature operating system
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.960]   and there are still big holes for things
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.000]   that I'd like them to fill.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.440]   So obviously they're gonna keep going,
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.760]   but things like photos this time,
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.440]   photos was a complete rewrite.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.080]   It was kind of wonky at first, it's been getting better now.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.760]   Again, it has a new color management system
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.960]   so it can maintain all those wide gamut color profiles.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:55.280]   And if you move something to a device
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.480]   that's got a lower color profile,
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.360]   it'll keep the high gamut information
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.560]   so that if it then moves on back,
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:00.400]   I mean, there's a whole bunch
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.280]   of super smart stuff going on there.
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.000]   The markup extension is in photos where,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.360]   I think photos and messages where I think
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.600]   it should have been for a long time.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:09.960]   There's a new brilliant slider.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.400]   There's just a lot of little nice things
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.920]   and music, although it's still trapped
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.440]   inside purgatory called iTunes,
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.200]   it's gotten the same kind of refresh and redesign.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.960]   So there's quite a lot going on in there,
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.400]   but still holes and bugs.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.720]   So I'm guessing next year we'll get
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.400]   another new version or something.
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.680]   - Are you still having the problem where you,
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.680]   that it wants to bring the same images in over
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:36.520]   and over and over again from your iPhone?
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.360]   Have you seen that?
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.560]   - No, but I thought photo-like right.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.400]   - I mean, I thought photo-like right.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.520]   - Huh?
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:42.960]   - I let iCloud photo library do that.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:43.960]   So they're just there.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.560]   I never do it manually.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.520]   - The phone was terrified that I'm gonna lose my photos.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.480]   And so I go to sync it and then literally it has,
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.560]   there's a certain date that it starts at
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:55.760]   and just bring them all in over again and again.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:58.240]   - So I have them, my iMac keeps everything local,
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.640]   doesn't do any of the online storage
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.440]   and then that gets backed up to an external drive.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:05.000]   So as long as it hits my iMac at some point,
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.400]   it's safe 'cause it goes to Time Machine
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.560]   and it goes to SuperDuber.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:10.000]   And that, you know, I think fairly,
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.840]   and it's an iCloud.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.680]   - It's like that I've seen people talk about online.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.960]   They just haven't,
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.520]   I don't think anyone's really figured out exactly
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:18.400]   how to get it to stop doing that.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:21.440]   You know, but sometimes iPhones are basically,
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.240]   it just wants to pull down a lot of the images.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.040]   And it seems to be caught up in one,
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.360]   you know, it'll go back to a certain date.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.680]   It's not like it's back in my entire iPhone, but yeah.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:30.960]   So I've gone to doing what you're doing,
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   which is let it go to the cloud and pull it down there,
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.720]   but it feels so much safer.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:38.400]   And I'm really about, you know, wired things.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.480]   You know, I know that I, you know, I, I, I, I,
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.760]   percued the whole wireless headphone thing
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.160]   and everything else, but that just means
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.440]   'cause I'm moving to a lighting connector.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.800]   I'm still thinking of those wired connections.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.040]   And we'll trust this wireless thing.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:51.640]   You know, it's just, you know, it's too whizz-bang.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.760]   - Indistinguishable from Magic.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.600]   - Yeah.
[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.400]   - I don't think that any data that I generate
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:00.640]   is as heavily and automatically and secretly backed up
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.480]   as my photos.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:05.800]   I can, I have to actually think to remember
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.120]   all the different times that I have clicked a button in haste
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.840]   'cause I'm installing a piece of software
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:13.560]   and then realize that, okay, so now Dropbox has a copy
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.840]   of every photo I take with my phone.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.800]   Google Photos has a picture of everything
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.960]   that's in these libraries.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.960]   Apple House now has a backup of this.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.080]   It's probably in four or five different places.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.440]   And there are times where I've just told,
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.120]   I totally forget that even screenshots I'm taking
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:32.040]   are now from my, from my iPad, wind up on my Android phone.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.360]   Or actually that's handy.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:34.920]   I was going to try to solve the problem
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:37.600]   of moving a file from here to there, but okay.
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.360]   So yeah, I still haven't trusted Apple
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.680]   to manage my photos yet, but I should mention
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.080]   that I'm full of crap in many ways
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:46.480]   because I seem to trust everybody
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.440]   to do everything with everything, except for delete stuff.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.080]   - Well, you know, I think I don't even trust Google,
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:53.640]   by the way, right now, I can't,
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.840]   Google really is a really cool app
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.520]   that I really need to download and check out
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:58.880]   before tonight.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.000]   - Any trips?
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   - Right, trips.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.400]   And I've said, you don't have enough room.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.080]   And I say, by the way, you have 500 and something megabytes
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:07.960]   of photos that have already been backed up
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.400]   in full resolution.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:11.800]   Do you want me to delete them from the phone?
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.840]   And it's, I feel exactly like my grandparents,
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:17.160]   or by even my dad, you know, leaving that,
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.040]   leaving the house for a week's vacation,
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.400]   we have to unplug the TV.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.640]   Our solid state modern TV, because if we leave it plugged in,
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.000]   it could explode and start a house fire.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.720]   I'm now grandpa saying, but if I, it's gonna,
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:34.000]   I don't want it to delete photos that I never have again.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   They're good.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.080]   Grandpa, it's not gonna delete them from everywhere.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.360]   It's just going to delete them from the phone.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.440]   They're still safe in those four other places I told you about.
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:44.720]   Yes, but it's a delete.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.560]   I don't like delete.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.600]   It's a scary word.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.120]   - No, I mean, that is so true.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.180]   And one of the questions I had is,
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.080]   Apple is touting that they're gonna be doing
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.320]   what they call computer vision,
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.520]   which is artificial intelligence and machine learning.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.640]   Locally, like the famous quote, we don't need,
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.840]   we don't need you to upload your photos
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.400]   and tell us what I'm out and it looks like.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.200]   But that's the sort of statement that you have to prove.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.080]   Like you have to give me your software,
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.800]   let it run locally, not, you know, attached to the cloud
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.720]   and give me great results because I might still prefer
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.080]   to use it because it's more private.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.520]   And I have this philosophical paranoia about that stuff.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.680]   But for most people, they just want really good search
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.520]   and you've got to win them over.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:19.960]   I was pleasantly surprised.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.960]   I don't think it works anywhere nearly as well
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:26.480]   or granularly or as encompassingly as Google Photo Search,
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.720]   but I type in stake, I get stake, I type in coffee.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:30.400]   I get so much coffee.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.520]   I type in locations and dates and mountains and lakes.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.840]   I find all this stuff.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:37.520]   I can't type in iPhone or Mac or iPad,
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.440]   which to me is incomprehensible 'cause it's Apple Zone stuff,
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.960]   but maybe that's not part of the database
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.080]   they've worked on yet.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.320]   But it worked well, but I don't know if it'll win over
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.200]   anybody from Google Photos yet.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:51.720]   - Yeah, it's also one of those.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.720]   I don't know if Google Photos for that matter
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.160]   will win people away from Apple Photos.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:01.480]   There is such traction for whatever came built into the phone
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.720]   that seems to work okay.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:07.640]   It's so hard to switch people from to Google Maps.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.560]   It's so hard to switch people from Evernote
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.640]   if they're already using Evernote to Apple Notes.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.760]   So it's just a hard thing to do.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   I fall for that myself.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.040]   I have to pretty much have a calendar reminder to say,
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.120]   "Please look at other word processors
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.120]   because you have not done a comprehensive search
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.560]   for other word processors in the past two years
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.680]   and who knows something wonderful might have been released
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.400]   since you fell in love with Scribner."
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.520]   So it's hard to blast people from whatever is,
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:37.080]   people don't want the latest and the newest thing.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.480]   They want something that works
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.040]   and the stuff that's been working great for the past two years
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.920]   is something that it's hard to talk them out of.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:46.200]   - Well, and I think that Apple Maps,
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.280]   specifically Apple Maps has gotten a fair bit better.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.080]   I was just in Rome a couple of weeks ago
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.880]   and I found that Apple Maps actually worked better
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.000]   than Google Maps, which I was kind of surprised at.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.800]   Google Maps kept on taking me to restaurants
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.920]   that didn't exist anymore.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.920]   - It really varies.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.600]   I mean, we drove back from Ottawa and neither of them did
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.920]   what I would call an acceptable dog
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.640]   and it just showed me that mapping is hard
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:11.800]   and I switch apps now depending on what city I'm in.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.640]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.000]   So yeah, I know there was a,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   we walked in the middle of the night
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.040]   trying to find some of the perfect Italian restaurant
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.280]   in the middle of the night and ended up walking a lot,
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.480]   going from one restaurant to another
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.960]   that was like not closed or not open,
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:23.920]   like the information,
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.400]   and then we switched to Apple Maps
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.560]   and then it was fine.
[00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:29.760]   So I think that a lot of it had to do with
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.400]   when they got the data.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.840]   So Apple Maps is newer, so it got the data more recently
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:39.000]   than when Google got it as far as what's open,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.400]   what's there, that type of thing.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.040]   So the persistence, I think,
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.440]   turned out to be the thing that was the problem,
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.640]   but I will admit that I still use Google Maps 99% of time.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.480]   (laughs)
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.760]   - There's a lot of other stuff in here.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.120]   I've got a review live, Jason Stelz got a review live.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.200]   A lot of people have reviews live,
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.280]   so just go and take a look at them.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.700]   I think we talked about this in the beginning,
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.040]   but the usual advice applies.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.280]   If you don't absolutely need it today,
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.480]   wait a few days, let the people who do install it today
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.240]   be your guinea pigs in case anything does pop up.
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.560]   But all in all, it's incredibly familiar.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.120]   It looks the same, it behaves the same.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.520]   It just has a bunch of new features.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.280]   And if you are invested in Apple's ecosystem,
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.680]   if you have an Apple Watch or iPhone,
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.000]   it rewards you with that.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.640]   It rewards you for that with enhanced continuity features.
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:21.880]   So you get even more extra cool stuff,
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:23.600]   including picture mode.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.680]   - I have to admit, I did download the beta
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.960]   for the iOS for my kids,
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.960]   so they could play with programming,
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.320]   and which they love, by the way,
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.400]   they enjoy that a lot,
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.880]   but they really, of course, love
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.640]   with all the stuff they could do with messages.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:37.920]   So my daughter is very disappointed with me
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.800]   because I haven't upgraded yet.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.440]   And she--
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.960]   - Oh, father.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.600]   - I'm so frustrated by that,
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.200]   because you can see them on the Mac,
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.920]   but like, Georgia keeps sending me like,
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.160]   pug stickers, and I just want to fire back,
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.680]   but I can't because I'm on my Mac.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:53.400]   I have to go across the room and get my iPhone,
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.640]   and by then it's not as fun.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.440]   I guess they ran out of time
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.600]   where there wasn't enough resources,
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.000]   'cause I believe they had to pull people in
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.160]   to get iOS 10 messages finished,
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.000]   but I just, I can't wait until messages
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.880]   is just fully featured and at parity,
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:08.040]   because I will unleash sticker fury on that woman.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.440]   It'll be great. - Yeah.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.600]   You know, it's interesting to watch my kids,
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:14.760]   you know, use iPads and iPod touches and so on and so forth.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.680]   They don't have a phone, but they, you know, iPod,
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:20.520]   you know, and because they just so seamlessly tie this stuff in.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.960]   You know, I couldn't figure out how my daughter,
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.240]   I would tell her where I was in the world
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.120]   over the last couple of weeks,
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.960]   and she would immediately, I'd go,
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.840]   I'm in Lagos, do you know where that is?
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:29.160]   And she's like, that's in Nigeria,
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:31.920]   and I realized until I saw her in person
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.120]   that she's like asking Siri where it is,
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.440]   and then responding to me over text, you know?
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:39.760]   And she's like, you know, the idea that, you know,
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.240]   that my kids are so tied into this information,
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:45.840]   and so, you know, cleanly pick it up.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.840]   It's kind of amazing, and it's scary probably,
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:50.160]   both at the same time,
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.240]   but I think that it's,
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:53.880]   they're having a lot of fun with it.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:55.240]   - The super smart thing with messages
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:58.160]   is that they made the stickers collaborative,
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.920]   so a friend of mine sent me a couple of porsches side by side
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.880]   with a joke like my parking lot, LOL,
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.320]   and then I stuck a moose in front of it,
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.600]   saying my parking lot,
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.400]   and then he stuck a person diving in the way to save the moose,
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.480]   and you're going back and forth
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.880]   and you're building these things,
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:13.800]   and because it's not text, it really is like it's images,
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.800]   and there's this wonderful sticker pack by Phil Ryu
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:20.400]   and David Lanham, you know, from Impact and Icon Factory,
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:23.080]   that just lets you like add mustaches and googly eyes
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.960]   and heads and you can, someone sends you a photo,
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:28.320]   you could add googly eyes and a mustache and send it back,
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:31.680]   and that makes it so much more engaging than just a picture.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:33.720]   - Did you see the grammar correction?
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:36.360]   - Oh, I both love and hate it so much.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.800]   - Someone, someone has, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:40.120]   There's the grammar progression,
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.440]   and do not do that to me.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.960]   I'm just telling anyone who talks to me,
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:46.360]   or like, I don't care, as long as you know.
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.680]   It used to be pray-the, and then it was pretty,
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.040]   and now we don't even use it anymore.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:52.240]   Language evolves, I'm with Joss Whedon on this.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.680]   - Exactly, yeah.
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:54.600]   You know, it's a boring person,
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.440]   they're gonna only spell something one way.
[00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.560]   - That spell is, S-P-L-T, spell, there we go.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.080]   No, I think it's really true.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:04.800]   So in that spirit, for a non-boring person,
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:06.720]   if you wanna create an entire website
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.440]   where you can tell people how bad their grammar is,
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.560]   I think Leo might have the perfect service for you.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.880]   - Thank you, gentlemen, we'll have more with Mac Break Weekly
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.920]   in just a bit, but first a word from Squarespace,
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.120]   and as you know, the place to make a beautiful website,
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.040]   a portfolio, an online store, or a personal blog.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.360]   That's what my personal blog is,
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.520]   it's so easy to make a great slideshow.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:30.080]   It's at leoleport.com with pictures and stuff,
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.720]   and then I said, oh, well, I should add my blog,
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.080]   I imported my blog, I've been doing a blog
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:37.280]   for almost 20 years, it imported all of the previous posts,
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.000]   that was nice, made it very easy for me to set it up.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.160]   I don't have an online store,
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.720]   but every Squarespace template
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.680]   does have commerce capabilities.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.320]   So if I should decide, I wanna sell candles or something,
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.600]   I could.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.720]   I use it for my photos, a photo portfolio, it's just great.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.240]   If you really wanna get geeky,
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.880]   Squarespace has the best developer platform out there.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:59.120]   I think a lot of people don't know this,
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.520]   'cause Squarespace is famous, of course it's the best hosting,
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.800]   and the best software that are married together
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:05.920]   to give you a site that never goes down,
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.800]   that looks fantastic, that's got all the best engineering,
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.840]   mobile responsive design, e-commerce, all that stuff.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.200]   I think you know that, but perhaps you don't know
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:17.600]   that if you're a developer, if you are a CSS or JavaScript guru
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.320]   and you wanna full access and full control,
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.320]   you can get it with a Squarespace developer platform.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.760]   It is great, you could start with a blank template
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.840]   that has all of the under the hoods capabilities
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:32.240]   in there, so you can kind of get a really quick start,
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.680]   or you could take an existing template or create your own,
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.160]   you'll have full control over the site's HTML, CSS,
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.280]   JavaScript, you've got a JSON API,
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.280]   you've got a content management system,
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.680]   it really is super slick, and once you've registered
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.200]   as a developer and you flip the toggle,
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:54.120]   you can use SFTP to get your stuff to the site,
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.520]   you can use Git, they support Git,
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.720]   so you can have check in, check out all that stuff,
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.360]   Git coding, it is just fantastic.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.840]   The good news for non-coder is that,
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.960]   that means there's a very rich ecosystem of developers
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.800]   who will for a very reasonable price,
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.560]   and I know 'cause we used one for Lisa's new site,
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:16.040]   Artisanalagency.com, do it all for you,
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.520]   do all the work for you, awesome.

[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:36.960]   don't forget the offer code MACBreak to get 10% off.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.760]   Thank you Squarespace, and now back to MACBreak Weekly.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.960]   - Ah, thank you Leo.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:46.760]   So it wasn't all launches and new products for Apple.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.080]   They also took a hit when it came to diversity,
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.840]   and this is a really complicated story
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.880]   because it's got multi-fascets.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.760]   A publication called Mike was investigating,
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.680]   you know, the keynote that Apple did, the iPhone keynote,
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.720]   saying that women weren't given a lot of stage time,
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.560]   that it was mostly Tim Cook, Phil Schiller, and Jeff Williams,
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.760]   who were up on stage with some of the women
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.320]   who were there or some of the diversity
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.240]   that was there didn't come from Apple,
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.280]   but came from third parties.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.880]   And then they got this letter back,
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.120]   which they said came from Apple PR.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.880]   They blanked out the name, but they published the letter,
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:19.120]   even though the letter said, this is on background,
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.720]   they said we had not agreed to background,
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:25.240]   so we're publishing this, and that led to a lot more discussion
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.120]   about diversity and some of the problems
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.160]   that women have been facing, or at least women
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:31.800]   that they've been talking to have been facing
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.760]   within Apple and Apple's Human Resources Department.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.080]   So let's break this down.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.720]   Andy, my thing is if Apple had been founded 10 years ago,
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.280]   or if they had had huge problems
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.880]   and had to turn over leadership the way a company
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.440]   like Microsoft has, I think the leadership structure itself
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.720]   would be much more diverse now,
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.040]   just because the climate, the times, the talent
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.160]   in Silicon Valley is much more diverse.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.840]   But Apple's executives have been there in most cases
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.200]   for years, and they have expanded.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.560]   There's Angela Arrens now, and there's many, many other people there,
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.400]   but it's still a very, very small group,
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.880]   and they tend to let those people do the stage demos.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.320]   And I'm not sure changing that would benefit them.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.360]   I mean, in the old days, it would just be one half Syrian,
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.200]   Steve Jobs doing the entire demo.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.040]   - Yeah, but that was a while ago.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.360]   And there are a couple of different aspects to this.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.800]   One of them is that, yeah, hell yeah,
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.360]   you should have as diverse Acastic characters
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.120]   in your public keynotes as possible.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:35.360]   This isn't just PR, this isn't just putting on a good face,
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.160]   it really is choosing how you choose to,
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.640]   this is how you choose to represent yourself
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.240]   to the rest of the world.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.800]   And part of that is we want to represent ourselves
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.920]   as not just a bunch of white guys,
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.160]   speaking as a white guy, I don't think that's a term,
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.320]   being a white guy is a terrible thing,
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.120]   but you really do have, once your company reaches
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.160]   a certain scale, I think you have a certain responsibility
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.080]   to make every single person that's in your organization
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.360]   feel as though that they are personally
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:05.960]   the face of your organization.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.560]   So when time after time after time after time,
[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:13.480]   Apple events are all white guys on stage.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:16.840]   It's not emphatically telling everybody who is not a white guy
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:20.040]   that you are not necessarily what we choose to represent,
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.440]   but goodness, if you've got a backpack full of troubles,
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.000]   that's one more brick that the company's putting
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.800]   into your backpack for you that it doesn't have to,
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.440]   because the range of talent and backgrounds inside of Apple
[01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.560]   is amazing.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.880]   And if it means that if it means that we have fewer
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.640]   of the regular cast of characters,
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.920]   if it means that Greg Federighi doesn't have as much stage time,
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:44.080]   if it means that Phil doesn't have as much stage time,
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.200]   that's what you got to do.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.560]   It's such an easy thing.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:51.240]   And also there's the altruistic part of there are people
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:56.200]   that are struggling under burdens that are being imposed
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:00.400]   upon them completely unfairly and ridiculously.
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:06.520]   And if you can just tell these people that are trying to make
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:09.120]   their way, money them, trying to start their careers
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.960]   in technology that, yes, when Google has an event,
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.560]   I see lots of women there.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:18.880]   I see lots of people that look like me up on that stage.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.520]   It is an endorsement from the entire industry
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:23.920]   that you are welcome in this place.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.360]   I mean, it's hard to overstate the amount of crap
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:33.720]   that for instance, women are forced to take in this industry.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.480]   When I have lunch or coffee with female friends of mine
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.520]   who work for these large companies and I ask them
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.120]   so how are things going?
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.640]   I, 10% of me is like stealing for terrible stories
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:52.440]   that are unbelievable, which is not to say I don't believe them,
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.800]   but I'm like, I can't believe that someone would talk to you
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.880]   that way.
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.920]   I can't believe someone would treat you that way.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.880]   I can't believe someone at the very least,
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:05.200]   if they're not willing to treat every one of their coworkers
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.880]   for the same amount of dignity and respect,
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:10.120]   I am at least shocked that they're not so stupid,
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.000]   that they're so stupid, that their simple desire
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.560]   for self protection is like, I acknowledge that saying this
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:21.080]   to this coworker would be a bad stupid thing for me to do.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.480]   It would be a career limiting prospect.
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.200]   So anything that Apple can do, they should be doing.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.600]   And I acknowledge that it's difficult when you have a team
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.440]   leadership that is as compact as what you have at Apple.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.280]   And when you really are, it's a hereditary, almost a heraldic
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:44.080]   sort of position to be in that that the Troika leadership,
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:49.920]   it's hard to promote a woman or a non-like guy
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.920]   into one of those positions, but I think they should work on that.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.280]   But again, there is no reason not to have more women on that stage.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:00.760]   There's no reason, no excuse for them not to have more people
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.400]   of color up on that stage.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.200]   So I'm very, very glad that this has come out.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.440]   I'm very, very glad this has gotten the level of attention
[01:08:08.440 --> 01:08:14.040]   that it has, because it's not as though Apple is unique
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.360]   in having a problem with making every woman feel as though
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.360]   they are as important part of this machine
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:23.320]   as any other part of that machine, making them feel as though
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:26.760]   if they start at Apple, they could go as far as their talents
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:29.880]   and their motivation and their destiny will take them.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:34.920]   It's something that really has to be corrected and has to be corrected
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.280]   by every single company saying this is important to us,
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.600]   and it's so important to us that we're willing to do this.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:45.880]   I don't want to ping, I don't want to ping Phil for something
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.560]   that he's been dinged on, dinged on way too much in the past
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.080]   two weeks, but that's courage, that's real courage,
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.720]   saying that we are going to make ourselves a little bit vulnerable here.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.640]   We will admit that we've had problems,
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:01.480]   we will show you what we're doing to try to heal these problems,
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.240]   because there's very little they can do that would be as important
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:10.760]   as a corporatism as to be the company that says that we are going to,
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.560]   we have an important position to be filled.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:17.880]   We are not going to fill it until we fill it with an important woman,
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.640]   an important person of color, because we know that those people are out there,
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.280]   we're just not looking hard enough to find them.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.840]   We are not just going to go with, we know this person,
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:30.200]   this person's worked well with us, this person comes highly recommended.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.680]   We're going to say that there is someone as good as that,
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:36.760]   that is not in the radar, that it's not on the radar system we've been using,
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.840]   that has only been finding white guys for us so far.
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.040]   We're going to change our radar system so that we're finding someone else.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.600]   So end of rant, but I would not be ranting about it.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:52.920]   So deeply, have I not been so taken aback by the stories that I've been told by,
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.640]   again, friends of mine, that should be treated better but arch?
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.640]   No, I think it's absolutely.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:02.760]   As a stealer fan, I think that one of the things that I believe actually the
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.880]   Steelers pushed for was a priority in interviewing Black coaching positions.
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:13.560]   And Mike Tomlin, of course, is the coach, Coach Tomlin,
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.680]   is the coach now for the Steelers.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.880]   And I'll argue, he's probably one of the best coaches that
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.840]   Steelers ever had, a million had, like, three in the last 30 years or whatever.
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:27.240]   But I think that you're seeing a lot more of those coaches,
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:33.320]   of coaches that are African American, that makes a lot of sense when you look at how many
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:39.320]   players are African American to have that representation.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.200]   And what it took was saying, this is going to be a priority.
[01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:44.200]   You know, this is going to be a priority. We think it's important.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:46.280]   You need to interview and really take a look at that.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:47.800]   And then you just started seeing it pop up.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.920]   You know, it takes time.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.640]   But I think that you're right, that it's just a matter of saying that we're going to
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:56.040]   make sure that we interview those folks first, or at least giving them a shot,
[01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:59.080]   because of any area.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.640]   And I think that it's made a big difference.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.520]   It's an incredibly important subject.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.720]   And some people believe that Apple gets unduly criticized for this,
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.960]   but Apple gets a lot of attention for everything.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.640]   And this is the equal and opposite part of that is when they absolutely deserve a more
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.160]   intense level of scrutiny because they get a more intense level of promotion when they
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:17.800]   do something good.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.480]   So, you know, you're the biggest company in the world.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.560]   You get the biggest magnifying glass on you.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.680]   And it's up to you how that magnifying glass reflects you.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.720]   And I think there's a lot of good stuff in this.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.480]   I mean, pain promotes change.
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:31.960]   And the more painful this is, whether Apple goes first or Apple,
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:35.640]   you know, does it slowly and finally, the pain makes change go faster.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:39.080]   And I think that the discussion itself is hugely valuable.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.960]   I do think it's really hard with the leadership because again, they've been there for years.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.080]   It's a very old company.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.720]   You don't want to just fire Phil Schiller and bring somebody in.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.680]   But the board, for example, boards get turned over all the time.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.680]   When one statement Apple could make is, I don't know exactly what the law is on it.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:57.080]   But like next week, the Apple could decide we want a board that reflects our customer base
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.120]   and reflects the diversity that we want to champion.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.520]   And that entire board could turn over and really show an Apple that is in fitting with
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.760]   all with what they put up on the website.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.440]   And in the ads.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.320]   And I think there's things like the Safari team at Apple, famously,
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.200]   they decided the only way to get more women and more diversity
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.520]   was to include more women and more diversity in the process.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:22.840]   That if you didn't send women and people of all backgrounds to the universities for the job fairs,
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.800]   people wouldn't come up for them.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.400]   They would just feel excluded immediately.
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:26.840]   They wouldn't even approach you.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:27.880]   So they started sending women.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.480]   They started sending people different backgrounds and they would get more CVs.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.440]   And they'd include them in the hiring process because they would not automatically
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.600]   rule out a candidate just because of their background.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.440]   And it led to an incredibly deep, deep, diverse talent pool at Safari.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.200]   And those sort of programs can just get propagated everywhere.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.320]   I think a couple of weeks ago or a month ago, they did a comparison of everyone's salaries
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:54.280]   and they made an effort to adjust to make sure that there was no disparity just based on your
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.400]   gender or your background.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.920]   And they adjusted a lot of salaries there.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:01.160]   But unless HR is involved, unless people don't get the kind of stories that Andy's heard
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:03.960]   that I've heard, then I'm sure a lot of people have heard.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.560]   It's not a matter of whether you get paid the same, it's whether you have the opportunity to
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.560]   advance the same and whether you actually love and enjoy being there, not just because it's
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:14.440]   Apple, but because it's a phenomenal place to work.
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:20.120]   And I think that is going to take Tim Cook down deep, deep scrutiny, almost laser
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.760]   ablation across the company.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:27.000]   But I think Apple is one of those places where if they have the will, it's absolutely a solvable
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.360]   problem, not just for them.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.440]   It can help the industry.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.560]   This is a company that introduced a $12,000 gadget watch.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:38.280]   This is a company that removed the headphone jack from a phone that is known for playing
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:39.160]   music in movies.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:44.440]   It underscores the fact that there is nothing that you can't do if you decide that it's important
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.280]   for you that this thing happened.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:52.760]   So whenever I see a situation like this, I'm sorry, a situation in which there is consistently
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:57.720]   not a visible presence of women and people of color at the highest level,
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:02.760]   it's partly because they do not believe that this is a problem that they need to address.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.800]   And it's going to have to be, it's going to have to take stuff like saying,
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:12.360]   like just like with the Steelers, that we are going to make it a priority to fill this position,
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.920]   to restore balance to the power of the force.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:18.520]   And of course, it's not just Apple, it's not just technology.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:25.800]   It's shagrin by a report from the White House about how women in the positions of authority,
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:32.680]   the White House, basically have strategized how to make sure that they are given the
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:38.920]   proper amount of their ideas are given the same amount of power and respect as ideas from the
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:44.680]   men in the room where they basically have a policy and they've sort of teamed together that if
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.200]   Cheryl says something, it makes it, it pauses an idea.
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:54.200]   The other four women in the room will immediately congratulate and improve upon that idea and
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.160]   underscore every time they mention it, say, I think that the thing with Cheryl's idea is that this.
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.560]   And while Charles's idea isn't going to work for this, but we can improve it by doing that.
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.960]   So number four, filling the room with endorsement as opposed to,
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.880]   I'm going to shoot this down as the truth is down.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.400]   But also every time that idea is repeated, the word Cheryl is included there to make it real clear
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:19.720]   that this was not someone else's, one of the men in the room's ideas, this was Cheryl's idea and
[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:22.120]   she's the person that solved this problem for everybody.
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.680]   So it's an American problem, it's not just a technology problem or an Apple problem.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:30.600]   And it's something that, because some people will look at this and they go,
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.960]   I don't understand the most qualified person has a job, we're going to be giving opportunity,
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.480]   people who don't do it. But that's not it at all. There are people who simply don't have the
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.480]   opportunity to compete. They can't even get in the door. They can't even get into the system to
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.080]   get into the door. And that needs to be fixed. It needs to, everyone has to have the same
[01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:49.400]   opportunity to get to those same levels and to be in those same levels. And I was having this
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:53.640]   conversation with a couple of friends of mine and one of them happened to be Chinese, one of them
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.160]   happened to be Italian. And they just, they kept saying they don't understand. And I said,
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.720]   well, how do you feel when you see like a kung fu stereotype? And he was outraged. And how do you
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.880]   feel when you see a mob stereotype? And that person was outraged too. How do they do that?
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.960]   And it was totally not realistic. It's besmirches our entire people. And you have to have like,
[01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:15.000]   take that feeling, take that feeling of when you have felt excluded or made fun of or treated less
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.480]   than and projected to everybody else. And then I think you start to understand what a lot of
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.640]   people go through on a daily basis. And you understand that it's totally unacceptable,
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.280]   not because they're a certain gender or a certain background, but it's just as a person is totally
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.960]   unacceptable. And each and every one of us has to do everything we can to fix it.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:37.800]   Yeah. And I will say that on the one side of the other side of that is that, you know,
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:43.400]   the, you know, I grew up in a childhood where when we were being, you know, inappropriate or
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.840]   whatever my mom, you know, and I say, like, we wouldn't clean our room or we wouldn't do whatever,
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:51.800]   or we said something crazy. My mom mostly just just followed it with laughter. In ridicule.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.560]   That was pretty much like that was that was her primary way of disappointing us. And it does,
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.720]   it does create a certain, I would say, prepare it. So I mean, I definitely believe that my kids,
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.080]   I mean, I, I definitely worry about this stuff and people should definitely have all this stuff.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:11.400]   But I definitely have taken to my mother's approach of developing kids with thick skins
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:18.600]   that allow them to to manage, manage life, because regardless of how much these companies work at it,
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.480]   you will be more successful if you have a future skin.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:29.560]   Yeah, but that's, that's true and practical. The difficulty is that, again, women and people of
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:35.160]   color, they're, they've been people who look like me have been telling them stuff like that,
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:41.400]   since their grandparents have been trying to get ahead. And so they, no one should have to have
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.280]   as thick as skin that's as necessary to deal with. I think there's a lot of, oh, no, no, I know,
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:52.280]   I know you're not. But as a, as a, my wife is African-Americans. So speaking from that perspective,
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:56.600]   I definitely understand the sensitivity to it. But I think that it's also important to, you know,
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.600]   from a, from a company's perspective, we spend a lot of time paying attention to it. And from,
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.560]   and I think a lot of companies have to pay attention to those things. But I think that also people
[01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:11.080]   need to also, you know, push, you know, like, not with big things, but with little things. There
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:15.240]   were some of the, in the articles that were, that were talking about some of the issues that
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.280]   were happening to Apple. Like, there was definitely some of them I looked at and said, okay, that's
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:23.400]   not okay. And then there were a couple of them. I was like, little, little, little sensitive there,
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:28.680]   you know what I'm saying? Like, you're not why, you know, like where I would, where, you know,
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.880]   I can definitely see how I would report that. And if I heard that happening in my company,
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.680]   someone would definitely get an earful. But I don't know if I personally would bring it up if I
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:40.840]   was on the other side, if you know what I mean. Yeah, I mean, I just, but I keep thinking about,
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:47.800]   I'm going to pace that if you do a Google search for Chief of Army Lieutenant General David Morrison
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:55.880]   on YouTube, you find exactly how the head of an organization needs to act about abuse and
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:01.720]   unacceptable behavior like that. It is the most applause inducing video you've seen,
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:07.160]   where he's this he's the Chief of Army in the Australian Army. And there were,
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:12.280]   according to the comments, I remembered it, but I just refreshing myself. There was a
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:18.360]   news reports about unacceptable behavior by Army members towards, again, the non male,
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:24.120]   non non white people in the Army. And so it is a three minute video of this man in battle,
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:28.280]   regular office work battle fatigues staring into the camera and just saying,
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:33.960]   pointedly, this is our army. We do not tolerate this. If you want, if you want to,
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:40.440]   if you want to be disrespectful to other members of your army, you are not wanted here, get out.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:45.480]   You might find another organization that will tolerate it, but I don't think you will. And
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:50.360]   I'm not saying that Tim Cook should get on battle fatigues and do a YouTube video about it, but it's,
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:53.720]   actually, I actually think he should. I think that would be,
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:20:02.520]   but not, but it would be, I think that one, I think that it's a, it's such a great opportunity
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:09.800]   for Apple to say unequivocally, this is how we feel for someone to see internally, Tim Cook saying,
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:15.480]   this is how seriously that I'm taking this issue, that by the, you want to, you want this problem
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:22.520]   to be solved before it comes up to me in my office, and I have to fix it because that will wind up
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:30.120]   with asses being bounced out of here, and you don't want that to happen. Or basically me imposing
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:35.400]   a whole bunch of rules from the top down as opposed to people who are supposed to be responsible for
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:40.600]   protecting the members of their team, be, I'm sorry, I'm just saying that you would like to,
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:44.840]   you would like to have every manager individually responsible for saying that's not appropriate,
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:49.640]   we're not going to tolerate this, and please realize that I'm now going to be watching you
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:54.280]   really closely to see if you can learn a lesson, because if you can't, we don't need you, we don't
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:59.160]   want you, we will find a way to get you out of here. By the time you get to the problem where you have
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:05.320]   to have Tim Cook being the God voice from on high saying, yeah, here is what we define,
[01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:11.320]   what all humans define as proper levels of respect for other humans. It's like saying,
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:18.360]   I'm going to explain to you how to shower after every morning, I'm going to show you how to,
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:24.920]   how to make sure you do your play deodorant, and you don't smell like a, like a goat coming to the
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.000]   office every morning, you should have learned this stuff before your interview with Apple.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.080]   It shocks me that I have to explain this stuff to you.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:35.640]   And Tim Cook has the moral authority, he's built up the moral authority to totally own that sort
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:42.440]   of a statement. Yeah, yeah, and he's made that statement before to his great credit, not just
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:49.080]   within his own house, but also to try to extend that to I'm the CEO of the biggest company in the
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:56.280]   world. I'm gay and I'm, I had no, and that the reason why I'm making this an official statement is because
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:01.960]   I want to set the example and make people know that, look, if you think that I am less than the
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:07.480]   same as you, you are basically saying that you are not capable of being the CEO of the greatest
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:12.680]   in the biggest company, tech company in the world. So I would love, it's, it's a great opportunity
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.960]   for leadership. And I hope that Apple responds thoughtfully to this.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:19.880]   And I think that the easiest way to handle this in a lot of ways is to hire more minorities and
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:25.240]   more women. I mean, I think that, you know, our, my companies is very diverse. Everything from,
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.440]   you know, everybody's their choices, their, their ethnic backgrounds, everything else is about,
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:36.520]   it has been, you know, plus and minus a very, very diverse. And that creates the sensitivity,
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.480]   you know, like, you know, I think that, you know, it does. I mean, definitely telling people that
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:45.800]   this is not right is, is a, is very important. But I think also the hiring is where is the first step.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:50.040]   You know, I think that Apple and Google and a lot of other folks are all, all focused on that as well.
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:55.480]   Yeah. So there's absolutely no way to properly transition such a serious topic,
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:00.040]   it's like a goofy one. So I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna put a lantern on it and talk about the new
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:06.120]   Apple ad because they, Apple has now got an Apple music ad up where the executives actually appear
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:10.680]   in the commercial. I don't know how often they've done this. I don't think it's very often, but we
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:19.720]   have one with Bazz with, sorry, Bazz with Eddie Q with Jimmy Iovine all about new Apple music.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:25.160]   And yes, it's funny. And it harkens back to carpool, karaoke. And it's got James Corden in it. But
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:29.400]   Andy, this, I don't know if they've managed to pull it off. I mean, Corden was funny,
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:34.120]   but I don't know if everyone else managed to pull it off. Yeah, that's kind of tough. It's,
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:38.840]   it's the, the, I won't make fun of them for it because I'm sure they were doing their best.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:45.800]   Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, okay, it's nice. But it didn't make, it didn't make me more interested
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:50.200]   in Apple music than I was before. And that's the only purpose of having, having a video like that.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:56.840]   I think that they've been using James Corden a lot. Yeah. Oh, can you play a little bit of that,
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:02.200]   Carson? Yeah, exactly. So they got him in, Greg, they've got him in different, yeah, they got
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:11.400]   in a Pharrell hat. It's, it's cool. But it's comedy is just super, super hard. And also,
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:16.040]   it's a lot of inside baseball where those of us are saying, Oh my God, look, it's pretty cute.
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:21.080]   It's not funny. Like, and everyone else is like, Oh, so there's, okay, there's a guy. I see a nice
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.960]   shirt, very nice shirt, nice office. It's a comedian and three non actors in this commercial. And I
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:31.800]   guess they're playing, I don't know. What do you think Alex? I, I don't believe in putting
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.120]   non-actored in commercials unless they're just testimonials.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:40.440]   So, you know, I think that that puts people on a really complicated, I mean, then people talking
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:44.200]   about how something is good for them or whatever in a serious thing. But I think that trying to
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:50.600]   push someone who hasn't done that before is something takes years of experience and process to
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:56.280]   get to to be, to be a little bit bigger, bigger than life and to be comfortable with that process.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:05.720]   And so I don't, I probably could not find out more fun. So looping back around the iPhones are
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:11.400]   out. People are already talking about the next iPhones. There's a story in Venturebeat about proof,
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.200]   proof that Apple is working with Energas, Energas, I don't know how to pronounce it,
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:21.480]   to wirelessly charge phones up to 15 feet away. I always think that I can hold a marshmallow
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:25.960]   in between me and the phone and it'll nicely toast. I know that's just wacky, too much wonder
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:30.680]   brothers cartoon stuff. But this technology is one of those dream things that we've always hoped for
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:35.480]   because no matter what, what contact charging is like, it's next to your bed. I've knocked,
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:38.600]   I've knocked my Apple watch off the charger several times just by moving my pillow or my
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:43.080]   comforter. And I've had my Palm pre was sent across the room just because it just wasn't well
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:49.000]   connected to the charger. We don't have the ubiquitous charging at this. This sounds like
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.280]   the future, Annie, but I don't know if it's next year's future, the way people are talking about it.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.080]   Yeah, I've always thought that Apple's explanation for why they don't do like
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:05.080]   Qi wireless charging is that, well, we are giving you a battery that lasts like two or three days
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:10.840]   on occasion. That's how we're basically making it so that you don't need to charge it unless you've
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:16.280]   actually put on the Unite Stand at home. I don't know how we can make it more easy for you. Also,
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:23.160]   this technology, it has to really, really work, which means that I unfortunately put it behind,
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:28.280]   I put it behind a metal box, I put it, I left it in my pocket and didn't charge overnight.
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:34.920]   That's not going to make it work. You also change the problem from, I have to have my phone on
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:41.320]   that special pad at my desk to I have to make sure my phone is in the room that has the charger
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:47.160]   in it. Although I'll admit that I've had times where I'm like, okay, the end of the charging
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:52.440]   cord was less than six inches away from the phone. I feel as though I should get at least partial
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:27:00.200]   charge and partial credit for that. Also, we've seen Apple delete the headphone jack, which is going
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:05.080]   to really, really inconvenience a lot of people for a couple of years to save a little space.
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:09.720]   I don't know what it would take for them to put in whatever technology and whatever antennas are
[01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:16.200]   required to make those. I think and say nothing above creating interference between all the radios.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:20.760]   So much of the engineering of any phone comes between, we have all these different radios and
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:24.920]   all these different high powered electronics, all of which they're creating fields of their own,
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.880]   how are we going to make sure that none of these crowded, crammed together electronics are interfering
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.760]   with each other. So I don't know if they would do it. The source of the rumor is that they had to
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:41.000]   do it. The company had to do a disclosure about the radio device, how they've done their testing,
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.400]   and they've listed well, it's at these following labs for these following certification testing.
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:51.320]   And Apple has been listed as one of those labs, again, relating to, oh, shock, absolute proof that
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:56.200]   Apple must be including it in the next thing. Apple test everything. Exactly. That's if we have
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.440]   a t-shirt, one of the first ones, we're going to say Apple test everything, don't panic.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.560]   And I'm sure we sell out of the first run of them. So I don't think much of this rumor.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.760]   I love it. I mean, even some of the iPhone reviews this year were full of it. And the
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:13.960]   inner Tony Stark in me loves the idea of a white ceramic iPhone with an edge to edge display,
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:19.480]   a completely abstracted home button that can read fingerprints on every surface of it that does
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.560]   wireless distance charging. Because once you go ceramic, you're not, there's no metal interference
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:28.760]   anymore, which is why Apple didn't do wireless charging for years, and basically floats into
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:33.800]   your hand every morning. But the other part of me is like technology is hard. And we've seen how
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:37.800]   hard it is for companies like Apple and Intel who have been iterating year after year after year
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.600]   to keep up the pace of that iteration. Because it's like, if you're in a Ferrari, you can get from
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:48.760]   zero to 100 really fast, and you can push it and go from zero to 200, you know, okay, but going from
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:53.640]   200 to 300, sometimes you got to bend the laws of physics. And that's where I think we're goming
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:58.440]   the smartphones now, whether it's Apple or Samsung or anyone. Yes, we'll still have the innovations,
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:03.080]   but they're going to have to work really, really hard to keep up the sort of pace that we've
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.560]   that we've come to expect from them. I don't think power is necessarily one of those. I mean,
[01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:14.360]   I would love to have a lightning connector for my watch. It's just buried under a seal.
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:19.880]   That cute little thing that I've popped my Apple watch onto to charge. And if I, you know,
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:25.080]   probably once a day it gets bumped and then it gets knocked off my watch, then it doesn't charge
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:29.960]   anything. So I don't like if I can't even get that to work well on a daily basis, let alone.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:33.080]   I just want something to plugs in and call it a day. I know I'm a little bit of
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:39.000]   a permiginal fashion, but I don't think this is probably something we'll see anytime soon.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.960]   I mean, years ago, you could make a waterproof phone if you didn't care about the toxicity of
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.800]   the chemicals, but Apple wants EPA ratings and you could make a wireless charging phone if you
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:52.280]   didn't want to use metal backs, but Apple wanted to use metal backs. And you could make a, there is
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:56.760]   now technology to charge through metal, but it's not efficient. And distance charging is not efficient.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:00.600]   And Apple, you know, every, every conference now, they're talking about their energy efficiency,
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:05.960]   not just how much power it has, but how efficient that power is. And I'm sure in the deep vaults
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:11.000]   of Cupertino, there is an iPhone seven S or eight or X or whatever they're going to call the next one.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.800]   That is everything that you would expect, you know, Iron Man to have in his phone.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:19.640]   I just, I just don't know if that's the one that's going to ship hundreds of millions of units and
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:25.320]   and when it's going to ship those things. I don't know. Future is hard.
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:31.480]   Leo, this is the perfect time for you to tell me about how I could get all that science fiction
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:35.720]   stuff, not in reality, but you know, maybe in beautiful audible form. Well, I have more with
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:40.200]   Mac Break Weekly in just a moment, but let me talk about audible.com. I know these guys are all
[01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:44.360]   going to want to chime in. They're all audible listeners. I'm an audible listener. I just was
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:50.280]   looking. I've been an audible listener since 2000. And the nice thing is I actually, because I have
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:55.080]   one of these big Drobo drives and I have a lot of storage space now, like 18 terabytes, something.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:58.760]   I thought, I'm going to download all my audible books. Let's see if I can get all my old audible
[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:02.840]   books. So I'll have them for my trip, not that I'm going to listen to 500 different books,
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:09.480]   but it's nice to have a bookshelf with you all on your phone, right? So I have virtually every book.
[01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:13.960]   I think one book or two books that publishers have removed them from audio or whatever,
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:17.400]   but it's really nice because it really becomes your audio library.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:23.480]   Almost 500 books I've listened to over the last 16 years as an audible customer. You're not an
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:27.640]   audible customer. Oh, you got a joint. Actually, a couple of the books that we've been talking
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:35.480]   about lately are coming out. The third in the trilogy that we were talking about before,
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:42.680]   the three body problem in dark forest, the third one is coming out September 20th. So will that be
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:49.080]   out today? It comes out today. So that's deaths and remembrance of Earth's past. That's the first
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:54.520]   time we've known the title of the trilogy, by the way. I think they held it back so you wouldn't get
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:32:01.480]   like what? Earth's what? Anyway, that comes out September 20th on audible. I'm giving you,
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:05.720]   you can get two books. So here's a couple. Actually, if you, you shouldn't start with deaths and you
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:10.040]   should start with the three body problem if you haven't read it yet. And then we were talking
[01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:18.280]   about that wonderful fallors sequence by Peter F. Hamilton, the second book in the series is a
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:23.080]   two book series, A Night Without Stars. It's the second in the Chronicle of the Fallors.
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:28.600]   What do you call it? It's not trilogy. It's a doology, a duology, a doo,
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:37.560]   pair, the second in the pair of books. And that comes out on the 27th next week, next Tuesday.
[01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:42.520]   So look, I'm just giving you some ideas here. There's so many great books on Audible. I bring,
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:48.600]   when I travel nonfiction about the regions I'm traveling to, I bring fiction to, you know,
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:53.960]   entertain nonfiction to learn. I like to alternate. I love Audible. You will too. So we've set it up
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:33:00.600]   that you get a book for free. If you go to audible.com/macbreak, that's going to be the gold account.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:08.120]   That's the book of the month. Credit of the month. Most books 99.5% are one credit.
[01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:12.520]   And you get the daily digest of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. So you get, you
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:19.080]   know, news updates as well. What about so many great books and college courses and
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:26.760]   comedy performances and radio shows? Just a wealth of audio entertainment. You will love audible.com/macbreak.
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:32.440]   First one's free. Enjoy it today. Now we get back to Mac Break Weekly.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:38.280]   Ready of progress. Thank you, Leo. Whatever remote location you're broadcasting from,
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:42.760]   you've managed to set it up identically to the studio. It's brilliant, brilliant work.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:47.480]   So I forgot to warn everybody that we would be having picks of the week coming up next.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:52.680]   And do you, do you have any chance to have yours ready? I indeed have mine ready. It's a really
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:58.040]   good keyboard that Logitech just released. It's going to be a little familiar to a lot of people.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:06.040]   This is the brand new Logitech K780 keyboard. It is a full 100 keyboard. It has, it just has
[01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:10.600]   something you've seen before in Logitech keyboards where it has, it's a Bluetooth keyboard. It can
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:15.560]   switch, it compared to three different devices simultaneously. You can just switch between them.
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:22.920]   So I can first this right now. I've got this talking to my podcasting Mac.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:29.640]   I've got it talking to my iPad and I've got it talking to my Android phone. And such a simple
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:35.480]   little, such simple things make things great. This is designed to be a desktop keyboard. It is
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:41.080]   wireless, of course. But it has, as you can see, this completely nice little shelf lip.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.280]   So that you can, if you're using your iPad, for instance, I'm not going to,
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:52.280]   I don't know if this is going to drop completely, but it has enough room to have like a full-sized
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:59.720]   iPad plus your phone or like a smaller iPad plus your phone plus another device. And it all can
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:03.800]   like be sitting right in front of your machine. And if you think that's a silly thing to do,
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:10.600]   you've never had a situation where you're getting a text message from somebody who's not using a
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:15.880]   desktop, studly chat app. And the ability to simply tap a button on the keyboard and suddenly be
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:21.960]   typing on the phone screen next to you is just absolutely beautiful. And also it goes the extra
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:27.560]   mile. A lot of people are kind of upset with Bluetooth because of interference and all the
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:32.120]   things that Apple said were problems when they announced the reason for deleting the headphone
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:37.640]   jack and creating their own solution. But it also includes their own proprietary, excuse me,
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:45.880]   Logitech's own proprietary system for connecting to your desktop. And as a matter of fact, there's
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:51.960]   a little cubby here that stores the special little USB dongle that will let this thing connect and
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:57.640]   act like a regular USB keyboard without having to configure without having to do any pairing whatsoever.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:02.840]   And of course, it runs on regular AAA batteries so that you can revel in the fact that you are
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:10.200]   helping to poison the planet no less than any other large paper mill in your financial district.
[01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:14.120]   So I'm really happy with it. I think the list price is about 100 bucks. I've seen it discounted
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:20.200]   for about 10 bucks. Just got released last week. And this is probably they sent me for review
[01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:24.600]   last week. And I've already sort of realized that maybe I'm just going to have to send them 100
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:31.160]   bucks and buy one of my own. I was actually on the sofa the day it came with. I often use my iPad
[01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:35.560]   just as my sofa computer for just keeping up with email or just bopping around the net while I'm
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:40.600]   watching TV. And it was such a nice thing to have in my lap with my phone next to it because I'm also
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:45.000]   getting texts and other messages from people, especially since I'm both Android and iOS.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:49.880]   And I really, really fell in love with it. It's a simple idea, but so well executed.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:57.640]   Is it available on the desk? Yep, it's a start shipping just last week.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:02.360]   Okay, you have to find it on. And he always costs. I was like, I don't know. I got to get one and
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.880]   then I can't find it on Amazon and all I could find is on the UK Amazon and then I could find
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:11.080]   it with euros and find it. Yes. And what is the misery? Alex, what about you? What have you got
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:16.840]   for us this week? Yeah, I don't have it with me. But what I have just gotten that I started
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:22.440]   experiment with that I like a lot that kind of takes a lot of pressure on is these, it is a
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:30.680]   nifty mini drive. Have you seen these? So these are this slides right into your, into your SD
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:40.680]   slot. And with a micro SD, you can, you can now add hard drive space, which is something that
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:45.480]   I'm very attached to. A lot of times what I'm starting to use this for, what I began to
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.520]   play with it over the last week is really the idea of taking files that presentation files and
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:54.120]   files that I use all the time and everything else. But right now, I'm sitting on my hard drive and
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:57.240]   some of them are pretty big. You know, it's like all these images that I use from my presentations
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:01.240]   and all these movies that I use. The stuff that I have backed up somewhere else, and I'm still
[01:38:01.240 --> 01:38:05.800]   experimenting with this, but, but things that I don't necessarily want to take up 100 or 100
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:13.320]   megs of gigs of space on my drive. So I've been experimenting with it, it's working really well.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:19.160]   Not quite as fast as the infront drive, but plenty fast to keep a lot of those, those kind of basics
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.880]   and clear off some valuable space on my laptop.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:32.360]   I'm putting two things this week. This is the worst and the best. So my recommendation is the
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:41.160]   new Apple Smart Battery case. I usually use an iPhone plus, but because the iPhone has a better
[01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:46.440]   camera on the regular size one now, I've been using it. The battery life is good. It's an extra
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:50.680]   two hours over last years, but it's not the same as a plus. So I've been using this to sort of
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.120]   top off at the end of the day, especially when we've been out shooting a lot of photos,
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:57.400]   taking a lot of video, maybe catching a lot of Pokemon. I don't know. I don't want to dwell
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:01.560]   in the details. But the nice thing about this, I was a huge fan of the original. I know some people
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:05.560]   really despise the hump, but this is one of those rare occasions where I think Apple,
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:09.160]   you know, they didn't go for form over function. They went for pure function,
[01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:12.920]   and there's several things that are great about it. The first is that because the hump is
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:16.440]   incredibly constricted, it doesn't get in the way of the antennas. And that means that the
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:21.640]   radio signal can go through and it's even got built in antennas so that there is almost no loss.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:25.320]   And the problem with a lot of battery cases that I found is that they're so hard to get their
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.880]   radio signal out that the radio ends up amping up. The phone gets hot and you waste a lot of the
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:34.840]   power that the battery case is supposed to be giving you back. So this is way more efficient.
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:40.360]   On top of that, because it's an Apple product, they have deep integration with iOS. So iOS knows
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:44.280]   it's not plugged into the wall. It knows it's plugged into a battery still. So it doesn't switch
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:49.320]   into full, you know, plugged into a lightning cable mode, which reduces a lot of restrictions.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:54.200]   It lets things like networking start happening, updates start happening. And that can also chew
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:58.760]   through a lot of power. So in this, it stays in low power battery mode while it's connected to
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:04.280]   this case. And as a result of that, I get really, really good battery life. So good that it doesn't
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.200]   bother me at all that what it might look like. And actually it feels really good when you hold
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:13.000]   it because that hump goes right into your hand. And it gives me the best of both worlds. I have a
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.120]   teeny, tiny, skinny phone that fits nicely into even my non hipster jeans during the day.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:22.200]   And then if I need it towards the end of the day, I just slip on this case and it's a powerhouse.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:28.200]   It lasts me well into the next day. So it's available in black this year, big surprise because Apple
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:33.960]   went with matte black and glossy black jet black, sorry, for their phone finishes. So that's the new
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:39.720]   color. No, no variety of colors. So you can't get a rose gold or a gold or a silver. And that'll
[01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:44.280]   lead some people to getting matching cases totally understand. But if you want a really slim, really
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:48.840]   high performance case that you only put on when you really need it, I can't recommend this case
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:55.080]   enough. It is just super, super smart as the name implies, and works really, really good with,
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:59.720]   if I hold it right side up, works really, really good with your new iPhone really well. I need
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:05.240]   that grammar sticker pack thing. I want to make one quick one quick correction. The key
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:10.520]   by K780 is actually $80. Not $100. And it's not on Amazon yet, but you can order it directly from
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:15.320]   Logitech.com right now. Whoo hoo. I can order it because my phone is still alive and I have extra
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:21.160]   storage. Thanks to Alex. It turned out to be an awesome day. Nicely done. Nicely done. What a pro.
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:29.480]   So that's it for Mac break weekly. We survived the the the Leolis day. We managed to make it through
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:34.120]   Andy Alex. Thank you so much for, you know, smoothing over all the gaps that I made and not pointing
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:39.880]   them out and ridiculing me in public the way someone's parents might. I'm not your mom.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:43.480]   Oh, you're muted, Alex. We almost made it.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:49.640]   I was muted. Um, tomorrow, by the way, tomorrow,
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:55.080]   at the ungodly hour of 8 a.m. in the subject standard time, we're going to stream 360
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:42:01.400]   with Elemental and Nokia. That's what I'm sitting outside of. We're putting together a 360 camera
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:06.040]   and the truck's downstairs. And anyway, so if you follow me on Twitter, you'll see that there's a link
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:12.200]   to where to sign up. If you want to actually come here, we've got a couple of seats left. But I'll
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:17.000]   also tomorrow post the link to the actual screen. You will be able to watch it on your desktop,
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:21.800]   like moving your little mouse around. So if you want to check out a 360 live stream, check it out
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:27.560]   tomorrow at 8 a.m. Pacific standard. And I'll tweet it about half an hour before. So and the Twitter
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:32.360]   is Alex Lindsey, right on Twitter. Alex Lindsey, all one bird. That's the best place to find all
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:37.320]   your internet stuff. Pixel core, whatever secret missions you're on. I don't talk about the secret
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:43.880]   missions, but but yeah, yeah, they're there. But the I oftentimes will post hints of things on
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:47.560]   Twitter and Twitter is usually the easiest one. Twitter or Facebook, you can follow me also on
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:52.600]   Facebook. I post more images, I think probably on on on Facebook than I do on on Twitter.
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:57.160]   As to admit, I love it when people try to pick figure out if the picture of Earth you're posting
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:01.320]   is from a space station, lunar orbit or Mars, you know, they're trying to work out the
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:09.000]   exactly. Andy Anako, you're at the celestial waste of bandwidth. You're at the Chicago Sun
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.840]   Times. You were on numerous podcasts, including material. Do you still do an Aqua's almanac?
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.080]   Yes, there's big announcement coming for the Anako almanac on a five by five. So stay tuned for
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.160]   that. But thank you very much for calling out. And you can find Andy on Twitter at an
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:28.200]   not go. You just got to figure out a spell it and then you could to go exactly the price of
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.600]   admission is to spell my last name. They can get my Instagram, my Twitter, my website, everything.
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:35.480]   And what else do you have coming up, Andy? Anything you want to tease?
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:41.880]   Yeah, now that I've actually seen the scene, the how Apple has rolled out the lack of headphone,
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:45.080]   there is a piece in the Sun Times about the headphone jack. And also I'm going to be
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:50.200]   taking a look sequentially at a whole bunch of different Apple products all over again
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:54.840]   that I haven't written about in the past year. Sometimes you write about the iPad and then you
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:58.440]   don't write about here's what it's been like for a year with the iPad. So I'm kind of doing
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:02.840]   starting a series with that. So stay tuned for that stuff too. And I'm sure there's so many
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:07.080]   great new camera phones out there. Where do you post the stuff? Where's the best place Flickr?
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:14.120]   Flickr and Instagram. I just got I just had one of those terrible photo Keena that
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.840]   trade for the international trade show for camera stuff is going on this week. And so I've just
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:24.520]   gotten the press release for the updated version of my Olympus camera with a brand new lens.
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:31.720]   Okay, do I buy? I know that I'm not going to have the self controlled not to buy both of these,
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:37.480]   but is I'm not going to be spending $3,000 next month when it gets comes out or in February when
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:43.160]   I will have lots of spare cash to spend on silly things that make me happy. So yeah, when those
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.000]   when they when I get my hands on the iPhone, you will see a flood of stuff on Instagram and on
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:53.240]   Flickr.com when you're also going to see once I get that camera, essentially me going into a cave
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:58.840]   and just stroking it like all in a stroking at the ring. But without even putting a battery in it.
[01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:11.240]   And precious 4K 4K video uncompressed HDMI to s s d port 20 megapixels 60 frames per second
[01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:20.120]   instilled mode. Take the best beautiful beautiful. And Leo, like we said, Leo is on special assignment,
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:26.200]   but he did talk about his his new iPhone seven on this week and tech past episode. So you can go
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:30.360]   take a quick look at that if you want to see Leo's initial impressions. And you can follow him on
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:35.400]   the social networks because I might my feeling is no matter what remote part of the world he ends
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:40.120]   up in no matter how secret his assignment is, he'll be all over Twitter and Instagram and

[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:24.920]   night. Everybody stop working. I read to the pirate bouncy house. Aren't I the best boss ever?
