[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.300]   Yeah, cookie monster, so it was a good ad to begin with
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.980]   but then
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.780]   Apple released the outtakes its totes adorbs as the kids would say Leo totes totes adorbs
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.420]   You saw the iPhone success ad for the cookie monster. Let me show you now
[00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.860]   I guess I guess these are I mean at first I think outtakes, but really there's a real human
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.580]   It is hand up the cookie monster and so these are the real human who is apparently very funny be good
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.740]   be ready
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.740]   take five
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.260]   You in there? Hey cookie monster
[00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.460]   You know me
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.300]   You know me you're gonna give you a cookie theory
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.340]   Who's saying that was that theory?
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.100]   Is it ready yet?
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.620]   How about now?
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.020]   How about now?
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.500]   How about now?
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   How about now?
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.660]   How about now?
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.540]   What is that?
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.540]   It goes cookie
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.540]   I
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.220]   Guess with you watch
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:39.060]   He got hit was slight me okay me okay me trooper
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:49.700]   This is when you're really getting into the character
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.780]   Hey Siri good night
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:02.500]   Maybe we should be could close me eyes oh
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.060]   Man that's on YouTube that is that was not for broadcast
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:16.100]   I know John Oliver did like some stuff for sesame Street and the outtakes been cookie monster and John Oliver are like even three times
[00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.060]   It's funny. I don't know who operates the puppet now, but it's it's just
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.500]   You know I would I would do a I would watch an hour long stand up special and Netflix with just cookie monster I
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.180]   Well, that's fine his name. Why don't we know his name this guy?
[00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.900]   It's a genius. I guess they don't they sesame Street doesn't want I anybody to know you know the kids think of the kids
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.220]   Well, almost took all the spotlight and poor cookie. Yes. I remember there was a whole documentary. Yeah
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.060]   It's not interesting though that now the the latest wave of Apple commercials
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.660]   It's there's so almost totally the opposite of what every Apple commercial has been about it's always been about all hail the product all
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:05:00.140]   Lay down your soul to the product the product knows everything and now it really are these funny commercials with really famous
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.140]   people that
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.020]   It's it shows off the product certainly but the commercial with like Apple TV
[00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.780]   You could you could do that with a lot of other products. You could have done that with Alexa
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.140]   You could have done that with with Google TV
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:19.580]   And I guess now it's down to let's make a funny 30 seconds or 60 seconds of people are gonna want to send to each other
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.580]   This by the way, it's David Rudman
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.420]   He has been performing as a cookie monster since 1985. He's also baby bear and two-headed monster
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.020]   That
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.420]   We may have seen me as baby bear and 200 monster
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.540]   He's got he's we've got any Emmy nomination, but he should really he really should get more than that. That's that's pretty cool
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.060]   That's terrific. Yeah
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.500]   You know, I was did you see the most recent?
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.180]   Apple ad I thought was a little bit that the other thing is they become mean we talked about the Taylor Swift
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.140]   fallen on her face on the treadmill and
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.620]   The new Apple TV ad well, it's not like Kobe asked him to play fantastic for it really quiet that Michael B
[00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.380]   Johnson
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.260]   Yeah, that's true
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:12.540]   He could have he could have hit back a little harder, but I feel like this is kind of trolling Kobe and I'm not apples never done mean ads
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.140]   I think well, maybe I'm a Mac. I'm a PC. What kind of mean about how about lemmings that was
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.580]   That goes back. It goes back a long way. This is let's watch this a little bit. This is a
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.660]   Open the NBA app
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.780]   Here he is over Jackson see that good as this kid
[00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.540]   That's the guy you're playing in this movie
[00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:40.940]   Cold-blooded assassin locked in the battle with father time. Is that no what a hero on the verge of a steep decline
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.260]   It's perfect. There's no decline. It's it's all ascension. So what part of you hurts the most?
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.380]   I'll tell you I'm playing you all the way through now
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.700]   I mean with a backup and prosthetics and stuff like that. Siri play the curious case of Benjamin Biden
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.700]   I do like how they've worked in
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.140]   20 minutes and 36 very useful Siri commands, but
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:09.140]   It's kind of probably Mike Michael Johnson's brain man. He knows he knows the index of chapters of every movies every
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.100]   You knew right where to jump. This is a follow-up to the Allison Brie game of thrones guy commercial from a
[00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:20.180]   Month or so ago. Oh, I didn't see that one. Yeah, that one's good - not your plump. Is it mean a little bit? Yeah
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.180]   a little bit of the
[00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:28.140]   Also that movie trill is a lot better than any host. Oh the kissing one. Yeah. Yeah, the kissing one. Yeah, we saw that. Yeah, we watched that
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.340]   New agency I would guess
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.660]   And they're doing a lot of internal agency stuff now, too
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:38.100]   But it's also a recognition that it's not just about television advertising anymore
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.420]   But this stuff has to live on social has to be shareable on the internet people have to want it just a great commercial
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.620]   You'll watch it and forget about it
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.020]   But they want stuff that you know Tandy's point that you share
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.380]   Yeah, move around. Yeah
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.460]   She he just can't figure out the king king slayer can't figure out how to kiss
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.220]   What is busy slang king
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:03.620]   I think it's the same set by the way
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.660]   Guys need you on set for the kiss great. We'll be on five. Thank you
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.180]   Sir, you find him a throne. No, no, no
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:17.740]   You might open up a music. What are you doing? Hey, Jeremiah?
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:26.460]   That's not too mean this is the stars are self-effacing which is pretty interesting. Yeah, I mean that's the idea, right?
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.060]   It's self-deprecating humor is is good
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:35.180]   Good good sports. Yeah, but I mean Taylor Swift to take in a face plant
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.700]   That almost felt like Apple getting her back
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:45.180]   Faceplant but then like continuing to sing and shaking it off. Yeah, I guess
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.180]   Oh
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:55.420]   The cookie monster ad is somebody saying chai a day really interesting the return of chai a day to the original
[00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.020]   I forget who shared it
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.780]   But someone said that the the views on that were just astronomical compared to the total views previous commercials
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.980]   Yeah, like some of these new ones are just doing astronomically better than the previous commercial. Well, that's true on social on youtube
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.300]   Yeah, there'll be some virality to mean this
[00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:15.100]   Totally no the cookie monsters not mean. It's funny. It's just funny
[00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.100]   Yeah, yeah
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.540]   But it's it's kind of scary that this this really is like how all entertainment is moving. Yeah, there's there's
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:25.260]   I'm bringing things in like the the Hollywood
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:31.820]   uh like trade blogs about how they don't really care enough the late night wars are not so much about
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:39.180]   viewership it's not even so much about demographics. It's about did you cut or can you create viral content that gets tens of millions of youtube views
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.380]   and
[00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.060]   The and the idea that the reason why it's one of the reasons why the tonight show does so well
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.460]   It's not so much because of the live views written the dvr views
[00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:53.420]   But the fact that he routinely creates content that's going to get 10 15 even 20 million views on youtube over the next three or four weeks
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.540]   Does make you wonder though how valuable youtube view is
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.220]   I'll watch well impressions like you know over and over again
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.220]   But people will pay for that stuff like you they well
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.900]   We know people in the youtube industry who get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's new products
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.980]   I think the real strength though is not the youtube views
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:16.060]   But the fact that you can embed that on many different like on twitter and facebook and get a lot of awareness
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:20.220]   Generated that way those are that money can't buy that kind of advertising
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.020]   Well, not not just that but you also get a really fine grain
[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:29.340]   Report on who has seen it and it's been reached by that whereas even even like a streaming
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:34.700]   Streaming views. You don't know who is in the room. You don't necessarily get breakdowns by time of day
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:37.580]   Netflix for instance is
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.700]   So granular they know they're not only getting the ratings isn't quite so important to Netflix
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.740]   Not like something because they buy and air I hold 12 season
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:53.020]   See 12 episode season at once but they know the exact moment that people are tuning are changing to something else
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:59.740]   And so you kind of got to wonder what happens five years from now when even kevin space against we find out that every time
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.540]   There's a wide shot of a desk people tend to stop and go to something else. So we want fewer desks
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.100]   But we want to we want approval on all of the sets to make sure there aren't so many desks
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.860]   Can we have a can we have a futon in the oval office next next season?
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:22.060]   We are just coming off of the facebook f8 keynote, I don't know if you guys watch that
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.380]   I mean this is I know ostensibly an apple show, but
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:29.020]   If you're using facebook you may well be using on an apple platform
[00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:33.500]   I have to say the thing I was waiting to hear about was most interested in was the bots
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.700]   Although I love and a lot of kudos to harry macraken is just killing it lately on fast company
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.180]   He's written a long read
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:45.980]   About uh the kind of some of the things announced at f8 of course he knew about it ahead of time
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.740]   And then had the hoods but to put what looks like a wax works figure
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:57.180]   Of mark sucker bird as the as the picture is that really mark or is that his madam too? So's mark. I don't
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.980]   No, he's projecting through a
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:06.300]   Unautculus into his iron man suit right now that is in the great tradition of creepy cover photos
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:12.220]   There is something weird there. I think I think he switched to a new foundation
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.500]   It looks like data. Yeah. Yeah jinx. Yomiya coke
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:25.420]   Uh that is creepy weird his emotions about to engage. Yeah, he blinks about as often as real life too
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.260]   Uh, so what did you guys think about the bots now?
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:34.380]   This is this is an area where apple fell behind and I think apple is gonna is gonna maybe
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.300]   Regret it messages, which was the first I think
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.900]   Uh sms app to allow data
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:48.940]   Messaging and and very good because of that right you could use it on the desktop you could use it in
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:55.500]   Instead of using the carriers expensive sms all over the world people use it but it's apple only
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:02.620]   And uh, they really don't have an open api by any means. I mean nobody else can you know can really use it
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:06.140]   I was like the early days of blackberry where they believe it creates platform stickiness
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.780]   So they're loath to expand beyond it. Is that gonna hurt them?
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:14.780]   I mean like it hurt blackberry like the if you can do it really well if you can maintain a proprietary system
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:20.220]   For as long as it adds value and then do that switch as soon as you need to then you get best of both worlds
[00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:24.700]   But what usually happens is the company goes too early and then they lose their the underlying business
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:30.140]   But you know, maybe they can create a new software business or like blackberry that go way too late and an app like what's app is eating their lunch
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.580]   So it's it's a very hard timing thing to nail. Well, look at for instance facetime
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.180]   Um
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.180]   I don't need facetime. I've got face
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:41.980]   Vis video calling built into the facebook app. Yeah facebook app does everything. Yep
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.420]   Let's go
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.140]   Google messenger that does all that sort of stuff and his multi platform
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:49.740]   It's they I think apple is gonna have to rethink this idea of
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.860]   Creating great apps that work and services that work great on all apple devices
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:00.300]   Because it's certainly easier to use message to use a iChat and i'm an old guy so I
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.300]   I chat and I message because it's no because messages
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.340]   Stop exactly stop calling things message and stop calling things pages
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:18.460]   Apple does a lot of things that make things super super easy to use for the first three or four weeks
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:24.220]   But then becomes a problem after a year when you want things to you when you're over the initial company
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:30.860]   Make things work a little bit better. I'm kind of now starting to transition away from uh from apple messaging
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:35.100]   Because uh, it's uh, my phone is is a big part of how I message
[00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.140]   I have realized that I can get by without it just by simply making sure that when I interact with my friends
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.460]   I use messenger instead of the apple product. They're perfectly happy to use pretty much everything else
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:48.140]   That's completely interoperable. I think apple is gonna have to have almost almost
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.380]   A vice president or a czar of interoperability if they want to keep on going
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:57.820]   Because stuff like this when he can't get siri on on other platforms and what's really difficult to integrate siri
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.780]   With third party services and apps and you're trying to compete with a company like google that's
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:10.780]   Does google now the way that they had to launch it but now pretty much any app can now inject stuff onto google now and give have access to uh,
[00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.140]   Interoperability
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.620]   It's kind of hard to it's kind of hard to imagine apple
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.260]   Still keeping up in two years if they don't start to open things up a little bit more
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:25.500]   Well, here's some I mean they have lock-in because if you're going to use sms on your iphone, you're going to use apple's messages
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.740]   Yes first input the fact that i should point out on and read you are not locked in
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:36.860]   You can use a large variety of messaging apps including facebook messenger as your default sms app
[00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:44.620]   And so that means and read users are I mean I switched over I thought well, why not use messenger because that's all it's all in there
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.500]   It depends a lot on on your network too. Like for example, my sister doesn't have a facebook account my mother doesn't have a facebook
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:53.660]   My father doesn't my best friends neither of my best friends have facebook accounts
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:59.260]   They all have iphones though. So for them they just use i'm as they don't even think about it and facebook is not an alternative
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.220]   They don't have what's app they don't I think one or two of them have a google account
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.940]   But none of them use any google communications apps so it really depends especially the tech field that's fine
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.020]   We all have facebook accounts. I'll have twitter dms we have we can pick and choose on a different day
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:15.740]   Every different app we want to use but out there in the real world. I think there's still a fundamental difference
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.820]   Some people will go and get a facebook account and facebook is essentially the web to them
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.780]   They just live on facebook the way I used to live on compu server aol
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.860]   But for other people they only have a device and that device just happens to have an iCloud account
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:32.060]   But they don't really know where care it's just their iphone and they're they're device centric not really platt
[00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.420]   Not really web service or web platform centric
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.180]   Facebook did something very interesting though a while ago and it didn't get a lot of attention
[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.900]   You don't have to have a facebook account to use messenger
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:46.860]   Did you know that I don't know if anybody knows that I don't think anybody knows that
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.940]   But that is very interesting so you can use messenger as a messaging app without having a facebook account that's smart
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.700]   Yeah
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.260]   Yeah, realize that you're looking at three different points of view facebook is
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.820]   Trying to leverage its success on saying you don't need the real web so to speak
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.460]   We will give you everything you want we will give you
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:11.420]   Yeah, exactly. No, exactly. We'll give you private messaging. We'll give you family messaging. We'll give you public news
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:17.020]   We will give you entry points into cnn. We will give you funny videos. We will give you news videos
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.780]   On and on and now they're and now with this the stuff they've been talking about today
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.700]   It's like we will also give you do you want to know when if your flight is going to be on time
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.780]   We will give you with that information as well
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:32.380]   Google's idea is that we will use whatever service you want be whatever you want use whatever device you want
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:38.300]   Because we've got our tendrils out everywhere. We will allow you to what we will we will enhance everything you do everywhere
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:43.260]   Whereas apples point of view seems to be if we control the experience for you
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.420]   You will have a much much better and more secure and more private experience
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.260]   So I don't think anybody's going to win in the philosophy wars
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.900]   But each one of them has some interesting positives and some really interesting limitations
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:05.820]   Could apple should apple consider doing what facebook is about to do with its messenger platform make it be
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:08.700]   a platform for other
[00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:15.020]   You know not developers for other tools facebook showed off that that you can order flowers
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:22.300]   Okay, the the agent services like lion and we chat they've been building platforms and gaming engines on top of them for years
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.260]   Very lucrative. We too. Why hasn't or should maybe apple doesn't want to why wouldn't they?
[00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.460]   They're a platform comps or any yeah
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:38.300]   Again, yeah everything everything they do everything they do filters into how does this sell more iPhones or how does this or actually
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.580]   military point how does this sell the thing that they want to sell in five years
[00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.780]   Uh, the other problem is that I think that they like the elegance of having here is a thing
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:50.940]   We have called serie that is you ask it to do something and it will do something for you
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:57.100]   But we have this separate app just for messaging. I feel as though stylistically they prefer that kind of point of view
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:05.500]   Although, uh, I think we pointed this out last week apple is moving into a realm where it's not just about hardware that
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.500]   Uh, their services are becoming billion-dollar businesses
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:14.140]   And it might be about more than just hardware certainly apple's got to consider that right
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.340]   It's revenue their their number they were looking at is revenue per customer
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.500]   Which is rising because people are now subscribing to things like apple music and doing the program thing
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:26.060]   But it's a very careful balance. You don't you don't want to throw out that huge business. You want to carefully
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:32.060]   Transition through that you don't want a strategy tax either. You don't want it to say oh, it's we're at a hardware company
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:36.860]   So we can't do these other things because that that's going to hurt you too, right?
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.860]   Well, it depends on what it's built on like so if you have a very strong foundation of the hardware then you can add value through the software
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.740]   That's really compelling but a lot of the advice that apple's getting this week
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:51.740]   Uh, especially a lot of the biz pubs is why don't you stop doing everything that you've done to be successful and start doing everything that has
[00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:58.220]   Often failed for many many other companies and you have to be very careful because uh wall street will tell you to do all sorts of things that are completely
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.300]   Not in your best interest and apple's biggest challenge now is migrating
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.780]   So they don't lose that fundamental business model one of the most lucrative business models of our time
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.380]   But transitions like they didn't stop with ipod when they rolled out ipon
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.300]   And yeah, those are very similar businesses
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:17.980]   But apple's always been one of those few companies that did not mistake their products for their business like ipod was not treated like windows
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:24.460]   Would had to be preserved at the cost of every new idea within the company and now they have to get to a point where they don't mistake them
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:30.380]   Being a hardware company for them being a personal technology company or they risk the same thing over a longer span of history
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:36.860]   Yeah, they're also they're also in a really enviable position where they have the because they're not holding up
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:43.100]   90 of all computers on the planet they can actually move much much faster and they can uh, they also have people who are
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.060]   generally using apple products by
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.180]   Everything is a choice
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.540]   But the people who tend to use max or people who have looked at everything else and have specifically chosen this they haven't settled for this
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:57.340]   Or they haven't just said, okay, whatever, I need a computer today
[00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:01.580]   So they have the ability to sort of leverage off of that and say here is the new thing
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:06.060]   And we're not going to let you use the old thing, but you're going to like the new thing and people will usually come on board with them
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:12.700]   It's I don't i'm not a business reporter and I don't know anything. I can I can barely figure out how much money
[00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.420]   Uh, my bank is charging you for every atm withdrawal
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:20.220]   But it's uh, you do look at how much money they make off of every piece of hardware
[00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:28.460]   And you wonder about the discussions that go on inside there of what happens if we are no longer able to make those kind of margins on hardware
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:34.060]   What if what happens when we do have to try to make two or three hundred dollars a year off of each individual user?
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.780]   Uh, how do we how do we go about doing that?
[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:44.380]   Always a challenge as the innovators dilemma you you you want you want to move it in the next thing without cannibalizing the last thing
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:51.180]   Um and very difficult to do and it sacrifices like if you try to maximize product profit on one of your old product lines
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.460]   You often write it into the ground and don't have anything to follow it up with but if you abandon it early you do leave money on the table
[00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.940]   Even it's no guarantee you'll ramp up the next thing so all these things are great challenges more often
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:06.540]   Failure than success in this and most companies don't transition. Oh, yeah, they can't do it
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:10.380]   It's a difficult thing and this is the kind of the crux that a lot of the
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:17.020]   Mainline tech companies are in right now. They're of an age where they have to they have to make this kind of paradigm shift
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.660]   And even google looks old compared to some of the new web company. That's exactly right. It's google
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:26.860]   You know, what's interesting is amazon. I I keep going. I keep thinking about amazon and how they are
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.300]   Uh, well, I mean they have some huge failures
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:37.580]   Firephone most notably, but then you look at the echo and of all of the other companies challenging
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.220]   Facebook's dominance and messaging only the echo seems to have anything
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.340]   Going for it and primarily because it's just a different UI. It's not on the phone. It's a it's a voice UI
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.460]   A place where nobody else lives. They own that
[00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:57.980]   Well, and true, but although that's it has aimed at their primary established market where facebook is aiming a lot of effort on emerging markets and getting the internet into places
[00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:01.340]   Where they hope they'll be significant demand in 10 years. That's true
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:06.380]   That was that was a big point of the speech wasn't as we're looking at what we're we're going to be 10 years from now
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:09.660]   And unlike amazon, which is very much us centric
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:13.260]   Facebook is very very much a global company
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:19.580]   Apple to I mean it's uncertain what amazon could do in china for example where they're established chinese internet brands and retail brands
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:23.660]   And apple and facebook and other companies are investing heavily in those areas and in india
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:29.020]   And that is going to be incredibly important as those markets become bigger and bigger and and the middle class grows and grows
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:35.100]   That's that's they're they're also hedging their bets by being being not just not just selling services to consumers
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.740]   But selling services to people who sell things to consumers
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.660]   they're back end stuff for store storage and
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.660]   and
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:51.340]   Basically a cpu power the and and apps that you can write and then host on their servers and use their use their firepower in order to deliver
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:55.100]   That's a huge huge everybody is talking about even google uses it
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.260]   Yeah, it's like it's like they're there
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.260]   It's a little bit like like it's okay to sell if one company wants to sell light bulbs
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:08.860]   That's great, but it's better to be the company that sells the electricity because that's your your future proof against people coming up with something better than light bulbs
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.740]   Let's take a break
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:16.060]   This is mac break weekly and the anaco from the chicago sun times are nay richy from i'm more
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.940]   Dot com our show today brought to you by audible dot com
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:24.300]   A great place to go my favorite bookstore
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:30.860]   Is an audio bookstore more than almost I would say now more than 200,000 titles of it's not just
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.420]   fiction and nonfiction, but it's it's a
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.500]   Performances lectures the great courses to me
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:41.180]   This was a huge thing when audible acquired the entire great courses library
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:46.700]   These are the best college courses the best college lecturers and you can listen and learn
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:56.140]   I like to mix my my audible experience up. I alternate fiction and nonfiction. I alternate entertainment with uh learning and it's worked out quite well
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.100]   What you and you have an audible pick this week. Why don't you why don't you talk a little bit about it?
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:06.300]   Yeah, I was I was glad there's an audible ed today because just yesterday I bought this book
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:12.220]   Uh called the life-changing magic of tidying up the japanese art of decluttering and organizing love it
[00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:17.740]   Right, which I I not even heard of before but you don't know con marie
[00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.460]   I I did not know well. Okay. If I turned this camera around you would know
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.500]   I cannot pronounce
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:30.300]   Uh, it's it's it's particularly good because one of the as I said before during these
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:36.700]   When we're talking about audible I often use it on my on my amazon echo while i'm cleaning and tidying up
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.100]   I'll be listening to a book while I'm like washing the dishes or mopping the floors and stuff like this
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.220]   And so I only look I did clean the kitchen last night
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:47.900]   Well about an hour after buying it and I really like it a lot
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:53.100]   It's it's like it's like a lot of these like here's how to here's how to organize and clean up
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:58.700]   And but it takes more of a zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance sort of view towards it like saying
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.100]   you know like
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:07.180]   It's a full of practical tips like one of the ones that really kind of hit home was instead of like going space by space
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.380]   Try to think about i'm going to get all of my clothes
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:15.420]   I'm just gonna focus on clothes today. I'm just gonna get all my clothes together and process all of them
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.500]   Uh and and
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.740]   But it also like has things that you gotta kind of see I stopped with the mop and just sort of listened
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.820]   So did did she really say to
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:29.900]   Thank the piece think that thank that old t-shirt for this for thank the soul of this t-shirt for the service that it did to me
[00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:35.740]   In my life and then release it like I'm not sure if I want to do that to old mackereld expo t-shirt for 2003
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:41.740]   But I do take the point so it's a it's it's really interesting to listen to even when you're even when you're thinking
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:46.620]   This is kind of nuts you're at least it'll it's you're at least gets you to think about why you might think it's nuts
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.660]   Uh, and so it's and because I subscribe sometimes I get a little behind on spending my credits
[00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.620]   So I'll have like two i'll be like I'll have two three credits like available to me for like for books that I can get
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:01.820]   And i'll get the two that I really really wanted it then i'll just take a flutter on something and this is the one I took a flutter on
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.660]   I'm just really happy awesome the life-changing magic of tidying up
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:11.980]   Marie condo the author the technique is con marie. She's been promising an ios app
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.260]   For some time now and it was supposed to be out by now
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:18.220]   To have pretty much the getting things done of it is
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.100]   Gtd becomes like a almost like a cult
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:27.420]   In a positive way like a cult in a lifestyle and something that people evangelize i'm finding that con marie is oh
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:33.500]   I I was I was only that I was only the pink mob and then I finally got my green mob last week
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:39.260]   I was I read the book. I got the rules down and I haven't pulled the trigger. I just like I have some trepidation
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.380]   I think about day well, it's well it is because she makes it so much
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:48.620]   Just the introduction is so fun to listen to because she talks about all the seminars that she gives and the stories that she's collected
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:56.060]   And she reads one letter from someone who said not only it got me to think about so much about my relationship to everything in my world
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.100]   That I got a divorce after finishing clon pretty yes
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:04.140]   My husband doesn't spark joy. He's gone
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.340]   And you thank him for his service and then you let him go
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.820]   Yeah, I want to mention so this is one of the books you're going to get a free book
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.820]   So go to audible.com/macbreak
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.780]   You're going to sign up for the gold account. That's a book of months
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:21.740]   Uh, and then you can cancel anytime in the first 30 days. There's a new hamletome
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.860]   The book about hamlet in the musical
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:29.500]   But so pick a book you'll get to keep it and even if you cancel in the first 30 days
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:35.340]   But you're paying nothing but you're not going to want to cancel and I want to encourage you if you're an audible listener to download the audible app
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.660]   Because they have now added channels. This is something new for audible
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:45.180]   And I want to get on some of these channels. They have some of our content on audible, but I would like to see more
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:52.780]   Uh, if you open the app you'll see channels check out channels and it's a ton of additional content. That's absolutely free
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:56.220]   It's just part of the app. So even if you only get one book
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.740]   There is a lot of stuff you can listen to and it's not just books. Although there are books in here
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.780]   There are podcasts. There are lectures. There's news from the New York Times
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:12.860]   Um, this is just a category called stories worth sharing. You can you just start listening. There's comedy
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.340]   on here. There's science
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:22.380]   Um, they've done I think a really interesting thing here by adding these new channels. It's in they say it's in beta
[00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:29.420]   Uh, but you can uh, you can add it if you have the audible app on uh, iOS or android and suddenly there's a lot more
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.940]   In store for you audible and that's free by the way. Um audible.com
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:40.620]   There's some of my books. You can see x surface from the encyclopedia Britannica. That's fascinating
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:45.100]   A lot of these books Andy you might notice are your recommendations
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:53.420]   Almost all of them, uh, there it is mariconda audible.com slash mac break your first one's free
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:57.660]   Like pushers everywhere. We're happy to say it
[00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.340]   Uh, let's talk a little bit about text expander wasn't it wasn't a text expander your pick, uh, rene
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:07.660]   Uh last week. I think it was well. It wasn't a pick. It was a discussion of the pricing change
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:13.020]   So they announced that they were no longer going to just allow you to buy text expander
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:14.460]   outright
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:17.100]   Uh that they were going to charge a monthly fee
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   And there was quite a lot of pushback from people
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.940]   Um, a lot of users said, ah, is it worth it?
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.020]   so
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:34.780]   Uh, they have they have modified a little bit, uh, their stance on this if you go to smile software.com slash text expander
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.300]   You can see greg scounds, uh, blog post
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:40.700]   From april 12th
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:46.460]   Uh, they're now going to apply a lifetime discount of 50 off the they call it life hacker pricing
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.780]   If you were a previous customer, which includes me, that's about $20 a year
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:56.620]   US they were offering it only for the first year. That was a mistake. We value our long-term customers
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.580]   It's important for us to demonstrate interactions. Thanks for bearing with us as we sorted
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:07.900]   Uh, this out so it's still a subscription, but, uh, if you are a existing customer, it won't be as much
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.100]   I have to think this is not merely because of, uh,
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.420]   conversation, but I have to think there may also have been a lack of adoption
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.060]   Not a lot of buy and especially if you weren't enterprise or other high power
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.980]   Not high power, but people who really valued it for business uses and to justify the cost
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:31.500]   And the sinking and the team functionality. This is only a week after announcing it. Uh, they've pulled back a little bit
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:36.460]   Um, it's the same thing. I mean, again, we all used to pay a lot of money for software
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.180]   But back then there wasn't a lot of software and we didn't buy a lot of software
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.860]   I mean relatively speaking
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:44.460]   Uh, if you have a 50 a hundred dollar two hundred dollar three hundred dollar app
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.700]   Maybe you get one or two or three or four five or six of those but you don't get 60
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:53.900]   You don't get 600 of them and we live in an age where most people now do get 60 or 600 apps or more
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:58.300]   Every year and it changes incredibly the value proposition of software for everybody
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.220]   Plus you have this really
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:03.900]   Pricing on, uh, on leasing a piece of software is intangible
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:09.660]   And I think that people can easily be affected by a company they they can't compare it to stuff they used to buy as a kid
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.780]   Uh, they have to you have to compare it to what they're buying right now
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:17.020]   And five bucks a month was kind of tough
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:23.740]   That that's because when you compare it to first is I get photoshop and adobe lightroom plus all of their mobile apps
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.940]   Or something like 10 bucks a month because I've subscribed to the photographer package
[00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.460]   And it does a lot more than text expander does and so
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:34.140]   Yeah, I'm happy to pay 10 bucks a month for the the photography subscription
[00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:36.940]   I agree even off the 365 for a lot of people is very affordable
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.860]   The life hacker account is if without the discount three dollars and 33
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.660]   Uh since a month if you pay for a year
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.100]   Uh, so I think it might have been
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:53.100]   It might have been better to say and others have done this doesn't over well overcast kind of does something else
[00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:58.780]   But uh, it might have been better to say hey the cost of the you get you get it for a year for 36 bucks or something
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.740]   Well, the greater issues they took away the drop box and the iCloud sync
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   So you had you had to basically buy into this
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.300]   You couldn't use it the way that you used to
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.300]   Can you use the old version and uh still yes, okay, so you don't have to upgrade
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.420]   No, but how long can they really legitimately sustain the older versions of those products to like at some point?
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.380]   Like this will be the new normal for them unless they change it again
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.820]   I don't blame them for trying
[00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:25.100]   Uh and the market will
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.860]   Let them know if that's something they're willing to do you don't know what the value is of your product
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.500]   Yeah until you try it
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.140]   Yeah, and I think that this might be an
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.540]   I I I as a consumer I personally have always responded well to
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:43.900]   We're we have a single digit update to the app that adds significant features
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.420]   And we're not making it a free upgrade from the last one we're in charge you $15
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:52.460]   The new version of this twitter client is not going to cost the $15 the last one you bought was a year and a half ago
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.060]   I'm I'm okay with spending that because again
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.180]   I tend to
[00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.780]   Translate that into other things that I tend to buy and I will spend $15 on a movie
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:07.500]   I'll spend $15 on an album that I really really like and it's if I'm and particularly if i'm grateful to a piece of software for making my life
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:14.380]   Easier, I'm kind of happy to pay it. It's just it's oddly enough at the end of the month when I'm looking through my credit card statement every single month
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.900]   I'm looking at all the things I'm paying by the month for all these different services
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:21.740]   It's the reason why I subscribe to the new york digital new york times
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.820]   But I don't subscribe to the digital wall street journal even though the wall street journal is excellent
[00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.900]   I just feel as though I can't buy two
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:34.860]   I really does face me that I'm spending 10 bucks a month extra for something that kind of duplicates this other thing that I have
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.300]   It has like cable and bundling everybody wants to be able to pick their own channel
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:44.060]   But then suddenly hbo is $10 and you know it showcases $10 and you and it adds up to a lot of money
[00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:47.660]   Like I'm only getting three channels for the amount I used to get 50 channels for
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:53.180]   I in my article I wrote a few weeks ago. I was likening it to the market for wooden toys where yeah
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.700]   There's still a thriving market but for very few people at a very specific price point
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:59.420]   And I think apps are going to be like that we're in the era of pop apps
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.740]   And if you want to have an app that's higher priced
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.820]   It's going to be an incredible niche area and not everyone just because you make a great app
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.700]   It's not going to be enough anymore. There's got to be a lot of other factors into it
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.860]   Well the market votes
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.780]   And you know that's business. That's why I give away what we do
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.140]   That's exactly what it's worth
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.300]   It's free
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:27.020]   Let's talk about uh, oh, I don't even know where to start uh the fbi
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.580]   By the way, okay
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.900]   Couple of interesting data points here
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:39.260]   Uh, the fbi of course, you know the whole thing about sewing apple and getting them done
[00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.060]   Pack the iphone the fbi has also admitted
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:46.620]   That an unknown hacker group has had access to their servers now
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.340]   For uh
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.860]   For shrug long for shrug long for we don't know quite a while
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.740]   Uh, that just is an interesting data point
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.940]   Because of course, it's the fbi who's saying oh just give us
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:05.500]   The keys to your encryption will protect them give us the source code and we'll hack it for you
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.500]   Um
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.700]   Wait a minute you there's somebody in your servers and they've been there for a long time
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.700]   And you don't know who and you haven't gotten rid of them
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.140]   Uh
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.660]   Another data point the director of the fbi James komi
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:28.620]   Told the world. Oh, yeah, I have a piece of tape over the camera on my laptop
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.380]   And why I saw somebody who was really smart do it
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:39.260]   This does not inspire confidence. No, no, please have him sit down
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:44.220]   Oh my god, okay
[00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:49.660]   Uh, they have announced officially the hack uh that they used on the uh, five
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.780]   C does not work on five s or later
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:37:01.900]   Um, and apparently now, uh, the fbi the apples decided not to kind of go to court and get them to reveal this security flaw
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:05.020]   Maybe they don't have to now that they know it's kind of limited
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:08.940]   And according to the national journal. They've been briefing
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.420]   Um
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.060]   The congress particularly uh, Richard bur
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:21.820]   Uh, we know no one love is the head of the senate intelligence committee and the author of the fabulous burf feinstein
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:27.900]   Anti-encryption bill and a finer cryptographic mind. You would be hard pressed to find a press to find a brilliant
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.780]   brilliant guy and diane feinstein who is his
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.820]   unaccountably the senator from california
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.220]   Uh, and his uh, his co-sponsor on this bill
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.900]   Uh, anyway, they're getting briefed on exactly how
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:47.100]   The fbi cracked the phone. I'm sure the conversation is something like well
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.060]   You know how phone
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.020]   Has a data
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:57.820]   Oh lord, um see the world as a system of ones and zero. Yes
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:01.660]   I would love you. I would love to be a fly on the wall of that briefing
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.180]   Gave it to my son. He used pengu
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:14.300]   So apparently according to the fbi they told us a today the attack has not been successfully deployed anywhere else
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:20.380]   Even though they did send out a email to all the other law enforcement agencies in the us saying if you need a hand
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.900]   Okay, hacker groups. Here's the exploit. We use any others of you using this exploit
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:30.700]   It's this one with this bit of code. Are you using it? No? Okay, that's good. That's fine. We're fine guys
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:38.460]   And then of course if you go to the eff.org which I encourage you to do uh, there is a california
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.500]   assembly bill
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.020]   uh
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:50.060]   That suggests that nobody should be allowed to sell ab 1681 that nobody should be allowed to sell
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.820]   A smartphone in the state of california if they do not undermine its basic security features first
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.660]   Um
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.660]   And of course if you go to eff.org
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.900]   action, you can
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:11.020]   Sign the petition and by the way while you're emailing your congress critter or actually don't email you should snail mail or call
[00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:16.140]   You might mention that even though bern find Stein is not yet a bill
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.940]   They just circulated a draft for discussion
[00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.140]   That uh, you don't like that idea either
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.580]   Bill this is the this is a
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.860]   I love the wired wired magazine interviewed
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.500]   a security expert
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:35.980]   Who called it ludicrous dangerous and technically illiterate
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:42.380]   Uh, this is not the final so but now's the time to weigh in
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.660]   They bill would not
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:51.900]   And they there is being very specific they say well not prescribing what you should do or how you should do this, but
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:57.980]   Quote to uphold the rule of law and protect the security and interests of the united states all persons
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:04.620]   Receiving an unauthorized judicial order for information or data must provide in a timely manner
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:09.100]   Responsive and intelligible i.e. Unencrypted
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:14.460]   Information or data or appropriate technical assistance to obtain such information
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.020]   Or data
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:21.980]   They say this is a performance standard you have to provide this stuff, but we're not going to tell you how
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:25.420]   To do it. Oh and by the way, it's not limited just
[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.740]   To companies that are making software or hardware
[00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.180]   It also applies to licensed distributors
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:39.740]   All product services or applications they distribute must provide the same easy access that means apples app store
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:45.020]   Google's play store windows store all have to vet every app to make sure
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:50.700]   That there's no strong encryption on it is the name of this the chinese intelligence transparency. Oh,
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.900]   No, it's got the it's got the worst
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:58.220]   The name kind of tells it all it's the compliance with court order is active 2016
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:03.820]   I'm a i'm an alderman in north kalana and i want gps data to make sure that person went to the right arrest room
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.780]   Yeah, there's a good example
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.500]   There's a really good example. It could be used that way
[00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:13.420]   Because by the way, the court could be any court
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:19.820]   Doesn't even government if it doesn't have any court. Yeah, it says court orders, but you know what any government official
[00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.700]   A burger mister of backwood county
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.060]   Yeah, give me an also to me
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:34.860]   With this this is why we need almost constitutional guidance on that that fundamental principle because laws like this are going to be put into play without it
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.860]   Unless there's um almost an amendment
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:42.300]   Maybe even an amendment to the constitution that says here is the definition of the rights of privacy of every individual citizen
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:46.220]   Whether what that should be i'm not gonna i'm not going to say
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:51.020]   But until there's something at that level that can inform every single law that comes out from the top down
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.700]   We're going to see
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:58.620]   Lawmakers try to get stuff like this into play and the biggest the biggest problem with this not just i don't think it isn't just the
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.900]   absurdity of these this actual text
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.780]   but also the idea that it's often the thin end of the wedge that
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:10.140]   how
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:17.180]   Different agencies can then say well if this is if this is true if we've made this statement that it is lawful for us to demand access to this
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:22.220]   Then we can sort of cite this same principle in order to try to demand that in this one specific case
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:26.380]   We can do something that we that has never been lawful for us to do without a warrant
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.500]   And then that becomes the the way that things are are going from day to day
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.140]   And this is very much a worst case scenario
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:36.300]   But the worst case scenario here is pretty darn bad
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:42.300]   So we have to really be aware of how bad we how bad it will be to leave that barn door open. Well, how about this one?
[00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:44.300]   This is a new
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.260]   proposed bill evidence law in new york state
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.980]   uh
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.980]   The drivers involved in accidents
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:57.740]   Would be required to submit their phone to the law enforcement uh roads
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.700]   For roadside testing was something
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:07.980]   Celebrate is developed called the textilizer to determine whether they were using the mobile phone to text before the crash
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:13.180]   What if they were flipping stations on on a music app that's fine that get away with it's caught free
[00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:18.140]   That's why I really dislike these laws because they come around across and they say texting is bad and absolutely it's bad
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.700]   But there's no distracted driver law. It's an anti-texting law
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.620]   You can eat a sandwich over while reading a newspaper and driving 16 miles an hour an iway
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.380]   No technical law are you breaking?
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:29.500]   But if you text even while stopped at the side of the road, you can get a fine
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.300]   We we don't always legislate in a sane way
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:38.060]   Yes, so they also legislate the on the famous piece of largest piece of artwork
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:42.780]   I think in the world is the painting that went on to the boston natural gas tanks on i-93
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.180]   Uh near when you went from boston this beautiful
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:47.020]   I can't remember in 1919
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.500]   They painted these tanks with this beautiful piece of artwork
[00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:54.780]   Should they force these this that facility to be painted gray because that painting is also distraction
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:44:00.700]   But that's me we're we're laughing, but this is first of all this is all this has been happening for a long long time where someone might
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.020]   Uh, you get pulled over for whatever reason and a police officer says can I look at your phone?
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:08.540]   And someone will just it's a police officer. So you hand over the phone
[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:13.340]   What you don't know is that the fact that you said yes, you can look at my phone look can mean
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:17.500]   I can take this into the car and plug something into the usb port that you don't know that I have
[00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:22.140]   That will take all of your contacts and take all of your information because you said I can look at your phone
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.860]   And then if they want it if they want to challenge that you can challenge that in court later on
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.060]   But you have essentially given this person permission to take a look inside your phone
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:35.020]   Uh, but this when he says that is now illegal to not hand over your phone if you are asked
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.300]   This is the again the skinny end of the wedge if you
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:46.460]   Later on someone could make the statement that uh if we if uh if we have proven that we have the right to take a look at your phone
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.140]   To look for evidence that you might have committed a crime during this traffic stop
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:54.540]   We pulled you over something illegal like we don't feel as though that left taillight is actually dim
[00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:56.540]   We feel as though that taillight is actually out
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.220]   That's
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.700]   super super dangerous. That's really like that
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:05.820]   That's that's one step short of knocking from door to door and demanding access to people's homes because
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:10.460]   They smell marijuana someplace nearby and they think that's evidence that you might have a grove facility
[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:12.780]   All the time by the way
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.580]   Somebody who lives in a former grove facility
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:20.140]   Uh, this is the Boston swash you were talking about
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.780]   Um, that's distracting
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:27.660]   Yeah, and people say if nothing to hide you're not gonna worry about uh with these laws
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.300]   But that that is always the rallying cry of the totalitarian regime
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:33.100]   We're always one step away from a dictatorship when you start invoking those
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.500]   Those words
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:38.140]   Uh, eff.org/action
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:42.060]   Uh, if you don't if you don't weigh in on this stuff
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:46.060]   You don't have a right to complain about it
[00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:50.540]   Okay
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.540]   Went by the way, where's my new macbook?
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:54.940]   Wdc
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.020]   Really june, I think so. I mean I hope so
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:46:00.620]   I mean people are all down on intel now because they're going to take talk talk instead of take talk
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:06.700]   But I just want those chips to be good. Did you read uh ben lovejoy's uh opinion piece and nine to five mac
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:12.700]   Not yet. Here's what I do to rationalize apples macbook lineup
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:19.740]   Uh, remember with steve jobs famous quadrant where he came in after uh after john scullie had
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:28.060]   Relaced 8 000 new skews and said no there's four there's home. There's office. There's portable. There's desktop
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:32.220]   um currently afro apple offers uh two macbooks
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:40.780]   four macbook heirs and six macbook pros 12 models and then you can of course customize them further
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.980]   um
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.780]   Ben says we can make this a little bit simpler
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:52.780]   Say so let me see if I can find his um
[00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.580]   I tried that with the ipad this weekend
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:58.380]   It's always easy for us to play backstream quarterback to apple
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:02.860]   But even during steve jobs this time you could get different cpu configuration different memory configuration
[00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:09.820]   In a black macbook white macbook. I think that's okay, right? I mean I think you know, but here's what he suggests see what you think
[00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:12.700]   uh extra entry level 12 inch macbook
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:18.860]   executive spec more expensive but more powerful 12 inch macbook a decent 14 inch pro
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.660]   a better 14 inch pro
[00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:25.020]   Uh a good 16 inch which is a new
[00:47:25.020 --> 00:47:30.460]   model macbook pro and a better 16 inch macbook pro so six models
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:35.020]   Uh the air is basically replaced by the macbook
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:42.540]   You'd have a uh instead of a 13 and a 15 macbook pro you'd have a 14 and a 16
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   I think that that maybe time has come. I don't know
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:50.700]   Uh you get so then you'd have 12 14 and 16 it kind of be a you know a logical division
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.780]   They'd all be retina, right?
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:57.100]   I don't think this is a bad idea effective. I think apple may be moving in this direction
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.340]   There's really some question about what what role does a macbook air play in today's macbook line?
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.220]   It fills the $100 price point which a macbook can't fill yet
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:07.900]   So they that's always it when the future is coming like the original macbook air was super expensive
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:11.580]   So they kept around of the plastic white macbook for as long as they did
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:15.180]   Then replaced that with the intro macbook pro the macbook that became the pro
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:21.020]   But that's the thing with this I would be tempted to go 12 inch macbook 14 inch macbook and then pro versions of those
[00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.780]   You have to go to 16
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:28.140]   Maybe you do but there are some people who just you basically you we need to get to a point where with ipad and with macbook
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:32.860]   Where you're identifying the use cases and you're going to have people for whom the portability is a major use case
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.940]   And some people for whom power is a major use case
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:39.820]   And then you're just giving them a choice of screen sizes and maybe speeds and memory allocations and things like that
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:43.340]   But once you get to those price points all those units cost a certain amount of money
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:47.500]   And that's fine. They fill those slots and then you're like, oh darn we don't have anything entry level
[00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.060]   So we got to keep this thing around it's why we have the ipad
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:55.180]   Two on the ipad lineup because we need a we need an $800 and $100 point of entry machine
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:58.460]   And then well, you know, we still have people who want to scree graphics cards
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:02.460]   We got to keep this old thing around because they really do need and then it's the bargaining
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:05.900]   Yeah, you're right. Yeah, that's what happens
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:12.780]   But you got you got to remember that when when jobs made that little grid that was when apple just didn't have the ability to make more
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:16.460]   Than four products at once now. They are the biggest tech company in the world
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:19.980]   They have particularly in terms of manufacturing so they can make as much as they want
[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:27.180]   I'm also I also think the good better best as a model made a lot more sense when we were always talking about good
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:32.460]   But when there really was just one kind of computer and that's kind of when we when we all started talking about that
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:37.980]   I think that I I think that's both of those sort of lines of thinking are out of date
[00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:43.180]   Certainly further than new apple. I've always had sort of the thought that
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.980]   Apple if there is if there is any
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:52.780]   Vestige of good better best left there now the ipad pro is the good computer not just the good ipad
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:56.540]   But it is it fulfills the role that the that a $900
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.660]   Laptop used to fulfill just five years ago
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.100]   And this is the way that they explain to people that we do have
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.940]   $500, $600
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:09.180]   Computers just as you can get five or $600 dollars dollars computers with windows
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:15.420]   I'm not sure I'm not sure if the macbook error as a name has a whole lot of meaning anymore because they've
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.140]   They've dumbed down the macbook enough that
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:22.620]   There's just not much difference between what a macbook and a macbook error can do
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:27.900]   It's certainly terms of connectivity. There's not a whole lot of difference between
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:37.340]   Uh, what it's going to do in mobility given that you have the macbook nothing again once again call words have meaning call a thing of thing
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:42.140]   All but if you had macbook and macbook pro wouldn't that that would be enough
[00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:49.260]   Mac book now the now the macbook is the 12th the super super slim device for people who are willing to sacrifice
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:54.460]   Who really do want something as light and as slim as possible and eventually they'll get it down to the
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.340]   $900 price point that I think they really do need to have
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:01.660]   Uh at somewhere inside the the the the portable macintosh line
[00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:05.660]   I would be I would actually be kind of kind of surprised if they still had a macbook error
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:11.580]   Just two or three years from now because it used to be used to be you could tell you can tell a really big story by saying
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:15.660]   Oh, we're calling it the air. This was so thin and light. There's really nothing else we could call it
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:21.980]   And now that really is one out of every four laptops of every manufacturer has that kind of slimness and that kind of weight
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.340]   The the least expensive
[00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:30.220]   Laptop from apple is 899. It's an 11 inch air, which is really dinky
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:35.020]   Especially especially with that non retina screen. I could never get into that 11 inch
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:38.620]   11 screen just it scratches you right now. They bleed it's just horrible
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.860]   um
[00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:44.620]   By the way, he he took a poll at the end of it uh and uh
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:50.540]   With 3510 votes 80 percent say say yeah, that's that's the way it should be
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.020]   Apple is one of those things and again
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.260]   I made the same attempt with the ipad line and I don't know if I was successful either
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:02.220]   But it's that it's that next 10 words thing from the west wing where it's too complicated. You think it's too complicated
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:06.060]   I think it's too complicated. I'm sure a lot of marketing people at apple think is too complicated
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.980]   But once you actually have to sell the products, right?
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:12.220]   You have that grim spectrum of realities tearing at you and it's like, uh, we can't get rid of this yet
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:19.340]   Your dependencies. I'd it'd be hard for me to let go of the air. The air is essentially a mac book with connectors
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:25.580]   Right, we're screening ports. Yeah, but what you want is the retinus retin display
[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:27.180]   Yeah, and the mac book
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:31.900]   I mean the mac book is expensive but the technology in there is expensive technology and like with the original air
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:34.220]   It takes a while for that to filter down to mass market
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:41.100]   And we should also point out that apples share of the pc market continues to grow the pc
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:47.260]   Markets dying decline of 11 and a half percent from last year in sales
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.500]   but the
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.900]   Apple market is not as far from dying apple's market share worldwide is now 7.4
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:59.100]   Macintosh has 13 percent of the market in the united states making it the number four
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.740]   pc manufacturer so
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:04.300]   Everybody else really is dying
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:09.500]   Well, people get confused by this too. It's like they think that people are throwing out their computers and they're not as just not buying their computers
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:14.060]   Yeah, the computers are fine. They do all their work increasingly people are replacing some pc's with apple
[00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:18.540]   laptops, which is why apple share is growing but overall the pc market
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.740]   We've we've got stuff that we can email and use the web with most of us are fine
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:28.940]   Yeah, also every remember that you can never forget that apple is the only manufacturer of mac OS and iOS devices
[00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:32.220]   And so every time they come out with a new mac book
[00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:39.020]   It's a really significant product and when they decide to go for a new case design or they decide to suddenly make it available in rose gold
[00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:45.420]   That's now every single mac user every single user of every mac is thinking about maybe it's time for me to buy a brand new mac
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:51.180]   Whereas you can hold on to a windows notebook for as long as you want through people remember that app that
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:55.260]   Microsoft actually had to say look we're serious this time
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:00.780]   Don't make us come to your house and smash your windows xp devices with an axe. It's been 10 years
[00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:07.820]   We are not going to support it anymore. It's terrible. It's dangerous. Please upgrade to a windows 7 machine and a lot of people are still saying
[00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:09.980]   It's fine. Yeah
[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:12.860]   I am on windows xp. Please to give it up. Please. Yeah
[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:19.500]   All the psychologists know about apple watch there's been again the resurgence of these articles saying the apple watch is a bust
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.380]   Uh when you're a bus Leo. It's got no apps
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.220]   I mean you can't you can't really use it with anything. I have a blackberry
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:32.140]   I can use my keyboard shortcut so much faster. I don't think this iphone is going people are nuts at this 600 dollars to buy one
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:34.220]   It's it's it's just not going any
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.900]   How many do we think have they sold? I mean they've sold millions, right?
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:42.140]   Uh, yeah double digit millions double digit millions. I can't call it a bust
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.940]   I I'm maybe one of the first people to say it was a flop
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:52.140]   But I didn't mean flop in terms of market. I meant flop in terms of it didn't do for me at least what I what I would have liked it to do
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:58.380]   Rumor now that we will see a new apple watch sooner than later like the summertime
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:03.260]   And here's one. I don't know is it thinner. They say a lot thinner
[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:09.740]   That's so I mean like it depends whose rumor is you're parsing but uh it looks like we're gonna get an internal update
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.980]   So like an apple s2 computer on a chip
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:15.820]   But not in ukasing somewhere to how they do the s like you know iphone six iphone six s
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:19.100]   iPhone five iphone five s and then a redesign would come later
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:22.940]   And there's been a lot of pushback that apple has to stop doing the s models
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:28.860]   But it's not as though apple has like an iphone eight or or an apple watch three just ready and they're withholding this technology
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:34.780]   Like the four from some war and l s planetary novel they they release the stuff as fast as it's ready and
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:41.420]   Tb the same case. They means that their processor teams have a known thermal target a known package size and they can accelerate the processors
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:43.740]   Faster than they otherwise might so
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:48.940]   The apple watch will you know, we'll get that update will get that better processor
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:55.020]   But it's it's going to be a slow march the same way we went from iphone to three g to three gs to four to four s
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:56:00.540]   We'll go we'll go to the apple watch and then in a few years we'll be amazed at how how fast we progress in such a little time
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:05.100]   Yeah, I believe that apple we really wanted to make sure they wouldn't have to change
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:10.780]   Change a new case for a long time or at least long time relative to to case designs for apple
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.300]   Remember that the iphone
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.980]   Basically held the same shape in the same form factor for the first two versions
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:19.260]   Even though the internals of the iphone two were radically different
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:23.740]   And then also it's not this is different because it's not just making people buy brand new
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:30.060]   Cases and and and card docs a lot of people have been spending a lot of hundreds of dollars on really fancy
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:34.940]   Watch straps some people that I know are really really eager to always buy the new straps
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:40.460]   And you're wonder how much thinner they can make the current apple watch and still make it compatible with those lugs
[00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:42.060]   There seems to be
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.940]   There seems to be plenty of thickness to go around
[00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:51.340]   But is there enough thickness to make sure that the capture is good and your 500 or a 900 dollar or even
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:57.580]   $1,000 bobble is not going to go flying off when you go jogging. It doesn't seem handy. It does not seem credible that
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:01.500]   40% thinner I
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:03.980]   Battery life would take such a hit. Yeah, I don't
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:05.900]   That'd be a surprise
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:10.460]   All I can say is that that would be a surprise to me would run counter to what I've been hearing
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.700]   Yeah, it's like every every time
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:16.700]   You read any of these what I want in the next iphone even from famous people
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:21.180]   It's like delete the bezels make it half as thin twice as long battery life
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:27.340]   And all these other things that like and they think apple's just being mean when really physics is looking at them pointing and laughing
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.980]   And there's constraints there if you want a longer battery life
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:33.180]   You're not going to get much thinner if you want much thinner you're not going to get a longer battery life
[00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.660]   You have to start there's an opportunity cost to all these things
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:39.260]   Yeah, we're gonna and race has something that was super super important to
[00:57:39.260 --> 00:57:47.900]   Every time every time they make a change to the case so many different departments have to sign off on that because it affects so many different organizations
[00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:52.620]   If you if you understood that if one design of not necessarily the iphone
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:58.060]   But for one phone they wanted to make a what seemed like a simple cosmetic change to the case design
[00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:05.260]   And then i'm talking to some some engineers about how that filtered up and down and they decided that we're going to have to underclock the cpu by x percent
[00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:09.820]   Just to make sure it will still be within the tolerances that we have designed for this hardware slab
[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:14.460]   And it was just all really all you want to do is again make I don't want to
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:18.940]   I'm not librarian to say so I don't want to give any hints, but what was just a very very simple
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:22.620]   Non-radical redesign it was like no, we don't we didn't we ran through the model
[00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:26.700]   And we feel as though we would have to undercut the performance of our current hardware
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.820]   Just to make it look the way that you guys want to make it look
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:33.900]   I think as public knowledge that the s1 and the current albewatch runs are just thermal limits
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.540]   I mean they're not they're not dealing with a lot of space and that thing as it is
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:43.900]   Renee also simplified the ipad product line for us. Thank you, rene and you at least stuck to the quadrant model
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.940]   consumer and professional big and small
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:51.980]   I tried big and small even gartenberg gave me it hasled me about that because those are really terrible words, but
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:57.900]   It's and then I started thinking about it as I went through the article and I love one of the reasons I like writing is because it solves
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:59:02.300]   Problems for me like it evolves my thinking as I write right that's why I want to write more because I agree with you
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:05.020]   That's a very it's a rigorous thought process
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:10.380]   Totally so I started with that one and when I when I got to the end I realized that like here
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.380]   I had the difference being whether you had this smart connector
[00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:17.420]   And the pencil or not, but I realized pretty soon all of them are going to have smart connectors and pencils
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:21.580]   And it's really just going to be like you buy as much ipad as you need and then you have a keyboard option
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:24.220]   And a pencil option and it's not really a quadrant anymore
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:30.620]   iPad is one product is what apple believes is the future of their computing and you literally just get as like you've asked them to slice
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.540]   Off as much of it as you need small medium or large and I think you're right. I think this is clearly
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:40.380]   Uh the way and I have to say the pencil is such a success that you're going to want a pencil on everything
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:44.380]   It's so great and I I have to say and I don't know how this would work on a mini
[00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.380]   I think it might be too small on the mini
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:50.940]   But uh this I the keyboard is fine on the ipad pro jr
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:53.180]   Oh, did you see jingly drawing on the ipad pro?
[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:56.780]   Yeah, I was gonna I was gonna say he just got a new like 9.7 and shi pad pro
[00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:00.380]   So he starts posting pictures of like wonder woman drawn in procreate
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:04.940]   And it's like it's jim frickingly one of the truly one of the greatest comic book
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:10.620]   Illustrators of the last 50 years and it's like oh, so that's what's that's what's
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:17.020]   Capable being done apple needs to throw some money at jimley to simply say well you please just do here's 50 000
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:21.340]   A month just do one drawing capture the video and let us post it to youtube
[01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:25.580]   We will sell so many of these damn things. Yeah, he's the gram.com/jimley art
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:29.900]   He has the joker batman and wonder woman up. Yeah, and it's just uh, it's ridiculous
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:34.700]   Somebody has to tell jim that procreate has this feature built in where you just play back the animation
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:38.780]   You don't have to do this over shoulder video. He's on he's on that too. Yeah, okay
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:44.780]   He's posted the actual capture. It is really fun to watch and he's not using a pencil. I might point out this is his finger
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:49.900]   He did a lesson with the pencil. Let me see if I can find the pencil ones because maybe this is older
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:56.060]   And serenity.com/jimley art. Okay. Yeah, he did the wonder woman. I think with uh with the pencil
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.940]   I have to think that uh
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.060]   Everybody who's an illustrator
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:04.300]   It's gotta be very excited about this right
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:11.260]   Yes in the same i've been talking to i have a lot of illustrators who are friends and i've been talking to them about it and
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:18.940]   The the overall vibe that I seem to get from them as a community is that it's like what musicians think of garage band is
[01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:22.860]   Where it's not the sort of thing where they would do the finished thing with it because
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:27.100]   Their workflow and also their publishing needs are too tight into photoshop for that
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:31.420]   But it's perfectly fine for doing a layout sketch is perfectly fine for i've got some ideas
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:35.020]   I need to lay down and not just simple scratchings on a piece of paper
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.900]   But something I can actually use as a put into my workflow later on
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:44.300]   Uh people are people are still bigger fans of the surface pro for stuff like that because it gives them
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.820]   Some of them think that's a little bit more responsive. I can't speak to that
[01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:51.260]   But it does allow them to use all the tools that they're using day-to-day
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.820]   Uh, and it's just as simple as not being able to run the apps that they are used to running
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.180]   If you pull this up for me, uh, Jason, I'll show it
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.580]   So this is a Wonder Woman on Jim Lee art the instagram
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:08.060]   Yeah, it's still looks like he's losing his thumb. I'm sorry. Those are pretty big lines
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.340]   No
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:15.500]   Realize he just this is a guy who he's been drawing for like 34 years in this is this this is his first time with procreate
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.460]   Oh, okay
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:16.940]   Okay
[01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:22.460]   And isn't it but isn't it amazing when you see any I go to comic cons a lot and I just watch these people draw
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:25.180]   And they'll do like commissions like at their at their tables
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:29.980]   And it's just like you're just drawing that stuff. You're not starting with a photo that looks like that
[01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:33.340]   increasing over it. That's coming out of your head. What is talent?
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:38.460]   Talent's kind of amazing, isn't it? Yeah, yeah, it's magical comes out good and it
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:44.140]   You know, he's taking advantage of instagram's new 60 second video, which thank goodness, right?
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:47.500]   Uh, I was worried we're gonna see 15 seconds of this
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:52.860]   Uh one more. It's the joke if you hear the load more. There'll be the joke room Batman below it. Okay. Let me see the joke room
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:59.580]   Oh, that looks pretty scary. He's still using a pen and paper. I notice. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not giving that up
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:04.140]   He's he's the co-publisher of DC comics and he's still just drawing drawing drawing
[01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:07.340]   The stuff he the stuff he posts to to his accounts. They're just
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:14.300]   Full page full page catwoman full page Batman. You're just like this isn't just one piece of art
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.020]   It's not a story, but I just want to stare at this for three hours
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.380]   He says on his post still prefer working on canvas or paper
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.780]   But painting on a plane is a lot easier with tools
[01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:28.060]   Like these he was just on a plane with his ipad pro. He thought well, let me just pull it out and see what I can do here
[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:33.100]   What I like about digital work is the ability to keep exploring so I use it as a learning tool
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:36.540]   So at least for jim Lee. This isn't a final
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.340]   uh, but I imagine
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:45.260]   Younger and artists up and coming artists are probably very I mean why would they use pen and paper? I mean
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:51.020]   They that's for that's for all the workflows as out now all the all the artwork is being transmitted digitally
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.660]   I know one no, I know one illustrator that
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:04:00.460]   It's it's hysterically funny the only time that he he does he does freelance work for a number of different books
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:09.580]   And the only one of the few that he does where he will actually do like actual art on paper still is for the my little pony licensed comics because
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:17.420]   And it's because the my little pony fans will pay amazing amounts of money for original published art and of course there's no original
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:23.180]   Published there's no original like hand drawn art like on paper that you can give them from a digital file
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:29.660]   So he will actually I think he I think he draws it digitally prints it out in blue ink on illustration paper and then
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:34.460]   Does the finishes on that board just so he'll have something he can sell for boku bucks
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:43.420]   Somebody like jim Lee is so used to the the tactile feel of paper and the scratch and the of the car charcoal or the pastel or the pen
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:50.140]   It would be very it would feel I'm sure very weird for somebody who grew up with pen and paper to to start drawing on glass
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.940]   But if you if this is all you've ever known
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:58.540]   Also also it's how you the the incredible stuff that happens is when you have people who grow up
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.820]   Learning to use these tools where they have never picked up. They've never really picked up a pen with ink on it
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:10.140]   I was I've been doing life drawing classes or life drawing sessions with uh, with the ipad pro and the
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:18.620]   It's been wonderful partly because I never really made any headway until I decided to forget about all the technique that I've
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:24.940]   Been learning or trying to learn since I was in college and just simply started what is unique about the ipad pro and pro create
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:30.700]   And when the difficulties is that uh, they start off the model will start off with like five-minute poses
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:33.100]   Then ten-minute poses and then by the end of the three-hour session
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:39.020]   She's here. She is doing like 30-minute poses and it's so hard to like get the entire figure in if you're not
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:44.300]   talented or not experienced like I am and so I realized that wait a minute I can just I can draw on layers here
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:49.260]   And so I developed this technique where I will just simply layer one is I will draw a blob
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:53.900]   That represents every place in this screen that there should be something drawn
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:06:00.300]   And then I will create a layer on top of that. That's a light color that is now here is vaguely not even a stick figure
[01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:05.180]   Here's vaguely what the shape of this body is and then I will add like another layer on top of that
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:11.100]   It's like rec it's like turning a lens and putting it to sharper focus with every layer until they get to the the last layer
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.780]   I'm working on is actually like black inks that are putting in details
[01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:19.020]   And now I'm actually finishing some sort of sketch for every one of these poses
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:23.660]   And it was only because I was using these digital tools that were not even remotely available to me
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:26.860]   When I first started learning how to draw in high school
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:33.340]   So that's that's when I I'm going to be amazed by artists who the first thing they ever picked up was a was a phone
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.580]   The first thing ever picked up was a wack-up ebbler
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:41.020]   And you have to think that uh, this the animation that procreate does and this is not new
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:45.500]   I mean other tools have allowed you to get to see how it works. That's gotta be so educational
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.860]   Exactly. Exactly. It's like oh, that's how they make the eyes
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:52.380]   Exactly when when you get to go to an art museum and you look really close
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:58.220]   You can see where the brush strokes are and that's like oh, I thought that you would have started with it. Oh, okay
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:01.660]   But imagine watching I mean wouldn't you love to watch van go?
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.180]   paint
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:07.980]   Uh, you know starry knight from the first strokes to the last in animation
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:11.420]   What an education that would be
[01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:17.500]   A lot of us artists drunk, uh, so that maybe you don't want to you don't want to be in you don't want to see that when jack and polyp is
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:23.580]   When us use medusa pegas's a theta and titan have in common
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:30.460]   We'll talk about that in just a second but first a word about square space the place to make your next website
[01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:35.100]   Square space makes it easy to set your website apart and create a beautiful
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:37.100]   professional
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.820]   website cover page portfolio
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:42.540]   blog online store
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:50.700]   It all comes with your square space website because you're starting with the templates designed not only by the best designers in the world
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:56.860]   But the best engineers in the world. So every square space site starts looking gorgeous
[01:07:56.860 --> 01:08:02.460]   And then you put your own unique stamp and aesthetic on it and that's easy to do you don't need to be a coder
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:08.300]   It's just point and click drag and drop and make it your own every no square squares. I do not look cookie cutter
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.740]   They all look
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:14.620]   Unique but underneath the hood you've got things like mobile responsive design
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:21.020]   So you don't need a separate mobile site the site looks great no matter what size screen you use every site has
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:26.620]   Ecommerce and really good e-commerce built in now if you are a developer
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:31.420]   I don't I don't want to I don't like talking about this too much because I don't want to scare away people who aren't developers
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.660]   But if you are a developer
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:37.100]   They have an amazing platform and I'm you know what?
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.700]   Lisa is working on her new site for our agency artisanal
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:45.420]   And she said why don't we ever talk about all these developers artists designers
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:50.780]   Who work on the square space platform that you can go and you can hire they have a whole page dedicated to them
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:56.540]   She's hired a great team very affordable cost to help her not just do the design but the content on the site
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:00.700]   Squarespace is an ecosystem if you're a developer take a look at this
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:06.700]   You get full control over the html the css the javascript you've got a jason api
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:11.340]   So you have access to the underlying content management system
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:19.020]   You can start with of course one of those beautiful templates, but they also have a base template that gives you the functionality without any design
[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:24.780]   So you can add your own once you register as developer and flip that developer toggle you can even use get
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:27.020]   an sftp
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:29.900]   Kodah locally upload it. It's amazing
[01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:32.860]   mobile built-in
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:37.180]   Commerce built-in you get a free domain name with an annual purchase
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:41.340]   I just think you have to try it and of course it's easy to try there's my site
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:47.100]   I started with a cover page so I got a little slideshow of pictures and I'm you know, I've run so i'll get another great picture
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.340]   And i'll add it into the slide show
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:53.980]   And that's the first thing I use or seize but that also has links to all my social presences
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:58.380]   That has links to my photos my event. I have an event calendar a blog
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:04.620]   So yeah, if you for instance if say well leo are you gonna be in any b? You can go to leoville.com and see the event calendar
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:10.140]   It's all there. They're they're not just added that one though the paul and uh and mary joe at the meetup
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:13.100]   Yeah, it's kind of a little bit later on anyway
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:17.900]   I I shouldn't be touting my own site the point being this was easy to do on square space
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.300]   squarespace.com
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:26.860]   Use the offer code mac break when you buy you'll get 10 off but it's free to try right now square space
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:32.380]   Dot com don't forget that offer code to save 10 on your new site
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.620]   Ah, let's see
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:42.460]   Um, I don't know where we want to go. Oh, yeah, I mentioned
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:45.980]   so apple apparently project titan we all heard about and
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:54.220]   Tim cook said look we're big enough company. We can have you know a thousand people working on a project that we're just trying out to see how it fits
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:11:00.860]   Like our car project. So don't assume we're gonna do cars just because we have a thousand people and project titan
[01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:04.220]   But titans just the first of the mythological
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:10.620]   Greek figures that might give you some insight into what apples up to they've been quietly buying and leasing
[01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:15.180]   buildings throughout sunny vale naming them after greek figures
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:23.180]   One of the largest is codenamed ria which nine to five mac points out is one of the titans. Oh in greek mythology
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:28.860]   This is the one that has a lot of security and is making a lot of noise
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:32.460]   middle of the night playing playing playing
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.060]   it's
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:38.220]   Furthermore documents filed with the city include areas like lube bay
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:41.340]   tire changer wheel balancer
[01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:45.020]   There's a building codename medusa
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:53.180]   It's a manufacturing facility in sunny vale the plans for this building show areas dedicated to a vision lab and eye tracking
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:56.060]   Clearly not a titan. Why isn't it called cronos?
[01:11:56.060 --> 01:12:01.580]   If if only they would keep to their naming convention we have a theme people
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:04.700]   but remember medusa
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:09.740]   Was uh you cut you cut off her head in another ten appear or and then when that was a hydra
[01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:13.820]   That was a medusa turned you to stone turn you start to look at her. Yeah
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:17.900]   So many stone changing animals in greek mythology at a real phobia about that
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.500]   How about magnolia?
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:27.740]   We used to be a fedex facility and it contains something called as everyone every company in silicon valley should have a regenerative thermal oxidizer
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:30.860]   coats
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:35.580]   Nine to five mac says that's a machine used in manufacturing that can reduce pollution
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:44.140]   Uh zeus is a former research lab in san jose that will be used as a quote interim lab by apple and house researchers
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:48.380]   security also a big deal at this building it is surrounded by a fence
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:55.260]   That blocks not just people from climbing in but people from even looking inside it is get ready for this
[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:58.540]   290 000 square feet
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:02.700]   I don't think that's kind of unimaginable
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.180]   Athena
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:11.100]   Which will undergo a lengthy facilities closure process. These are all I guess I gather uh
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:14.540]   95 mac is getting these all from uh the sunny vale
[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:16.860]   uh planning department
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:22.700]   Oh, there was a link in the article too. I forget where but it there was a report in one of the local papers or local journals about
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:23.900]   Yeah
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:26.460]   They've apples least a former pepsi plant for
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:28.940]   Project titan
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.340]   They want to make sugar water or just make a car
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.260]   In that funny
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:37.980]   There's a little irony in that of course steve jobs lord pepsi co marketing chief
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:44.140]   john scully from pepsi saying you want to make sure your water or you want to change the world now they own the facility
[01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:51.020]   Uh, yes good. That's that's called enterprise this comes from the silicon valley business journal
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:55.020]   and a little bit of enterprise research
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:57.500]   Uh
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:02.300]   Yeah, this is what they're doing. Oh, if you go to the silicon valley business journal, you can see the slideshow of all these
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:03.100]   Yeah
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:06.140]   Tiltups ugly buildings. This is this is the problem with the
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.820]   The south bay is everything is a square tilt up
[01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:12.860]   I mean, I love this stuff because I love codenames. I love greek mythology
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:17.900]   But a lot of it doesn't really mean anything right now. Yeah, it's just uh, it's stuff we can talk about until one day
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:22.700]   We have a car event. This is aria 62,000 square feet on scott boulevard
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:30.940]   Apples not to be confused. It's all Las vegas are ya installing stepper tools. So this would be perhaps a semiconductor a manufacturing facility
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:35.980]   127,000 square foot facility on patrick henry drive. It's called pegasus
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:39.100]   They wiped out the entire interior last year
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:43.660]   And they filed permits to create new testing in mechanical rooms
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:48.140]   And here's medusa the vision tracking
[01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:50.700]   Wow
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:58.060]   Uh a chemical list submitted to that city includes everything from turtle wax bug and tar remover and bondo body filler
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.300]   to purel
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:02.300]   Sounds like they're building cars in that one
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:08.860]   Night automated roving robot bondo. They're just doing a new reality series for the discovery channel
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.340]   We need turtle waxin. We need more tunnel wax and bondo stan
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:17.180]   Friggy is gonna host a new car show on apple music is what's happening
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:24.140]   Guys burger king said that if we have the new theme laptop ready for the big unveil in three days
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:28.220]   We get a $50,000 bonus. I'm gonna need you to do what you can
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:34.860]   Love license. We've looked we've licensed karaoke away from dane's cord and he's gonna show up with a del and we need the car
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:38.140]   pretty funny stuff
[01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:43.260]   But this you know if you've never been to sunny ville or the anywhere in this area
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:45.020]   Um
[01:15:45.020 --> 01:15:49.260]   It's really this is what it looks like. It's just this met kind of this massive industrial park
[01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:56.060]   All over the place people are sometimes shocked that this they go behind the scenes the glitter factory and no
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:59.740]   It's actually a huge corporation a lot of different many how much cleaner going on
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:04.140]   Uh used to be prune orchards
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:07.260]   Nothing but prune trees
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:09.660]   Which I guess are plum trees, right?
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:14.700]   The big mall in the area is called the prune yard
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.860]   Nice
[01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.180]   I'll get you walking
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:21.180]   I used to work down there used to live in san jose
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:24.380]   on the capital expressway used to live down there and it just feels like
[01:16:25.180 --> 01:16:27.420]   It feels like it was all just built kind of you know
[01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:33.580]   Garage band now works with music memos and logic remote and uh, they've added
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.940]   2,600 apple loops
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:40.380]   Uh, this has gotten more and more powerful
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:49.260]   Um garage band 10.1.1. I thought they updated didn't they just oh that they updated in january for ios and now this is for the desktop
[01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.180]   Is that it?
[01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:53.980]   Uh, I think they did both and this is the this is the point one update
[01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.300]   Okay, they went to 10.1. We've previously
[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:59.260]   Great day to be a musician. I'll tell you
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:02.540]   Nice stuff
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:05.820]   Well music memos is to your point about the pencil is that it or Annie's point about the pencils
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:10.860]   It just let someone like taylor swift sketch out a song really quickly so they don't forget what they were working on and then they can move it over
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:14.540]   It's a garage band or logic or pro tools or something and make a real song out of it
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:19.660]   But it helps you get it helps you get that idea in your head down somewhere so you can stop worrying about forgetting it
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:26.060]   It's so funny. So i'm reading that story and I see jason howls face pop up in the in the google drive
[01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:34.300]   He obviously said oh let me find Jason of course is a musician as well as our host of andrade and all about andrade and tnt
[01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:38.780]   I saw you jason all the loops his his face goes boom
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:42.220]   It's kind of fun and google drive you can see who's in the in the dog
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:46.780]   All of a sudden jason shows up. Thank you for listening jason. We appreciate it
[01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.180]   Um, so you see that this just appeared suddenly
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:58.620]   Apples mac lineups will see significant graphics upgrades
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:01.740]   Well, I would expect so
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.460]   According to mac rumors
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:09.420]   Intel's abandoning tiktok. So apple will also abandon tiktok, right
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:13.580]   Yep, that's just that's just what comes with the actions one of the reasons
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:17.660]   We're all waiting with baited breath to see what the new mac books the new skylike stuff will
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:23.420]   Do will there okay? Let me ask about as long as we're talking about this what about mac and toaches
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:26.620]   The desktop version first of all the mac pro
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.260]   Yeah, I mean more
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.260]   Any of those
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:36.540]   A few I mean alex lens. He keeps buying three day three weeks as he
[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:40.940]   So there's there's still a certain level of firepower you can only give with a mac pro
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:44.780]   I don't I don't know anybody who loves it. They just buy it because they they can't get away with anything else
[01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:49.900]   The 5k iMac is obviously a jewel. I mean if you need massive parallel computing though
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:53.820]   It's a really good choice. It is right you're good to get the zeal everybody needs that. Yeah, yeah
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:58.460]   uh, yeah, it's a very specific market. Yeah, and uh
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:03.260]   Be that market particularly doesn't really like the non-upgrade ability of it
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:09.260]   They would very much like a giant tower case that could put a hundred hard drives in and extra gpu's and all that stuff
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:13.580]   And so apples not innovating. Oh my god. They innovated. I mean wrong innovation. Yeah
[01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:17.340]   Uh, so we sky like Scott. I mean
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:22.140]   And we got kabulate coming out to leo. I know they're gonna be bond. They're gonna be behind
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:28.300]   Now it depends on what chips you get. Yeah, so like do they make the right chips available and when and what's the schedule?
[01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:33.740]   Yeah, it's a bit of a mess. I just 14 nanometer has been a bit of a mess. I just yeah, and I just I
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:41.340]   Maybe it's in tells uh fall. It's certainly true that microsoft has stumbled a little bit because of the skylight hardware that they've made
[01:19:41.340 --> 01:19:43.340]   Um
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.340]   So maybe that's part of it
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:48.940]   Apples a patient company. I know it frustrates us, but they'll just look at and they go
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:53.420]   That's not the right chip and it tells go we'll say what best the chip we made and i'll just say that's not the right chip and then no wait
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:57.260]   And we'll get super frustrated because no new mac book and they'll be like make us the right chip
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:00.700]   Reddit releases a
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:02.780]   official reddit app
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.780]   for ios
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:08.460]   Uh, they bought alien blue, but this is apparently completely new codebase
[01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:13.980]   And short on the heels of that apple removes all the other third party reddit clients because they're not safe for work
[01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:17.900]   You just noticed
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:22.220]   Neither is safari by the way, uh, you can surf to any site
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:26.460]   Including reddit including reddit. I don't understand
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:31.100]   There's actually a subreddit called not safe for work. How is this news?
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:37.260]   It's all them extremely not safe for work, but not safe for your home not safe for
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.980]   Justice, it's just not safe
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.100]   It's okay
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:45.340]   And I know it's it's popular to pile on apple review and there's certainly a lot of reason to pile an apple review
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.060]   On occasion, but this this makes very little sense to me
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.460]   Like if we take this as a story like apple review woke up
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:55.980]   Sorry app review woke up one day and said oh oh no there's there's not safe for work on reddit to destroy everything
[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.980]   This one that makes very very little sense to me
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:04.700]   So i'm wondering what what the actual story is here because it's also very coincidental that the the new reddit app launched right before this happened
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:10.860]   So whether that was just an awakening point or whether that uh that elevated reddit like maybe apple hadn't been paying much attention
[01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:17.420]   And now reddit's a premiere partner the same way that other major social networks are a premiere partner and that caused a whole bunch of people who never paid attention
[01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:21.420]   Before to start paying attention, uh, or you know or something else was going on behind the scenes
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:24.220]   I don't know but the linear narrative this makes no sense to me does the
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:28.860]   Reddit app official app does it have the nsfw toggle
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:32.060]   It I believe they're removing it. I believe it did and they're removing it
[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:38.060]   So there is no nsfw content in the reddit app official reddit app
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.420]   Right now i believe there is
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:48.220]   So confusing so uh nine if i mac talk to somebody who does eggplant which is one of the third party clients
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:55.180]   Uh, he reached out to apple was told he needed to remove the nsfw toggle within his app as well as all nsfw
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:56.940]   content
[01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:58.940]   Now his app by default
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:05.180]   Had nsfw content not by the way if you're puzzled not safe for work dirty stuff
[01:22:05.180 --> 01:22:11.260]   He had his turti that's kind of an old fashioned word smuddy even moral fashion all the smut
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:17.420]   Was disabled but there was a switch that would re-enable it apple says it's in their response
[01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:21.580]   It's not appropriate to display pornographic content. There's such a nanny
[01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:26.780]   Well, it's funny because like chrome like they can't ask google chrome browser to stop showing
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:32.540]   You know in a pro well not safe for a content and there's no button as it feels to me like if that button never existed
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:36.460]   This wouldn't be an issue but since that button was they're like, oh, you could just leave it off permanently
[01:22:36.460 --> 01:22:41.580]   Reddit was asked to update the two apps
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:47.900]   It's responsible for official reddit and alien blue to remove the safe for work browsing toggle, but not the actual content
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:53.260]   Now i'm really baffled. Yeah, so
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:23:00.780]   Over the years i get the impression that there's sort of an odd there's sort of an automatic or procedural way that certain apps get kicked out
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:06.300]   But then there it gets one level up to people actual humans who have actual authority who will say, okay
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:12.220]   No, this is not this clearly is not what we were trying to ban against well and the toggle was put in on apples request by i might add
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.540]   But that's but that's okay
[01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:19.900]   That's definitely that's definitely keeping you that's definitely keeping in in the spirit of their ability to simply say make
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:22.540]   Be able to flip a switch and make this thing kids safe
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:31.420]   So i'm i'm sure that they'll at some point they will you'll be able to get to an s nsw and not safe for work content and just browser app
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:35.660]   Yeah, and it also it also bears it should be mentioned that
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:43.340]   It's not so much smut. It's is it's easier to say things that are that many most workplaces would not find appropriate for
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:45.980]   For that kind of viewing or things that might not be appropriate
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:51.980]   For young people to take a look at things even rene wishes you could never see and this is why he's apple
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:58.860]   I mean android, uh, we were asked to update. This is read its official response. We were asked to update our apps to remove
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:04.700]   The safe for work browsing toggle. This is a feature we previously refined with apples help
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.220]   We were surprised by the notice we've just resubmitted our build
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:13.100]   We were not informed that apple would re-removing other apps and we're very upset to see they did honestly
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:16.780]   If we were interested in getting rid of third-party apps, which we are not
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:25.180]   This would be the stupidest possible way to accomplish it. We suggest all third party apps similarly remove settings for safe for work browsing
[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:29.100]   What is apple accomplishing with this besides?
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:34.780]   It's it's not apple. It's it's a couple people in review and these they work for apple and they have the power totally
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:38.060]   But you know this would this will probably get escalated to again
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.980]   It makes it makes zero sense to me this this to me. I don't know how anyone looking at this would say this makes sense
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:46.060]   So i'm i'm suspecting that this will be handled. Yeah, oh, i'm sure it will have always does
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.460]   But this is this happens again and again this kind of weirdness exactly
[01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:54.140]   Yeah, you would think that they would figure out what the ball necks are in the system and improve the system because it's not as though
[01:24:54.140 --> 01:25:01.340]   There's a shortage of reasons why a lot of developers are annoyed with apple and the difficulty of dealing with apples approvals process
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:07.340]   And so this is clearly a this is clearly a sticky part of the process that they really need to mop up
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:13.340]   We just have an escalation like oh we're gonna change an app that is a major social network. Maybe we'll fly this up the flagpole first
[01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.420]   What would be a good way?
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:21.420]   So i i understand and i appreciate apple's desire to offer a family friendly platform
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:25.020]   but the problem of course is you become a censor
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.580]   and uh
[01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:29.580]   There's no way to do that without
[01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:33.900]   Completely censoring the internet. So in fact apple is not a family flint friendly platform
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:38.460]   It's just not that you can do you can surf on a browser to anywhere you want on any apple device
[01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:43.100]   So why even why do this just drop it? Uh
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:48.460]   Or you or have a filter built into all apple products that they're
[01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:50.460]   Censor out adult content
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:55.980]   Well, they say the web is our secondary platform for open content that if you want to use the app store then you're abiding by the guidance of the app store
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:58.540]   And if you don't then they make it as best a possible web
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.900]   Platform experience for you to build outside the app store content on
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:09.580]   Also, it's the the the basic the default position of all censorship has always been it's really super easy and super safe to say no
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:15.420]   It's easier to block and then if someone objects put it back in and apologize and say oh, there was this wasn't meant to be blocked
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:21.660]   But uh apple's not the only company that's had problems with this remember the problems that facebook had where people can't
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.460]   people who are are
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.940]   Breast cancer
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:31.660]   Communities can't share pictures. They can't in some cases. They couldn't even speak about
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:37.820]   uh, their their own bodies without being censored by facebook because there's a bot that flags things as adult content
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:41.180]   Well, let things go. There's a really wonderful website called
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:46.700]   And prepare prepared to giggle. It's called oh joy sex toy that is one of the most brilliant
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:52.620]   It's a car it's a cartoon site that is one of the most brilliant educational sites for sex education for people of all ages
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:56.220]   And that's the sort of thing that would be easily banned even though it's nothing but helpful
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.860]   I actually kind of a
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:01.500]   hysterically funny
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:06.620]   Example of this where I've been taking a lot of photospheres using the using the android camera app
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:11.500]   Where that's where you you know, stay in one place and you basically can cover 360 degrees sphere
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:17.100]   And it'll be assembled by google servers and then you can have this sort of virtual reality sort of 360 experience
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:19.340]   and i've been finding in art museums that
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:26.220]   Sometimes when sometimes things might not line up or someone there might be people moving around and so there might be a little ghost or things like that
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:27.580]   But none
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:30.460]   This is not what's been happening. I've been seeing like there's been an act
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:36.060]   It looks like a deliberately blurred section and blurring out certain parts of certain sculptures
[01:27:36.060 --> 01:27:40.540]   That are just like 1904 things that are that are being
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:43.340]   In a gallery 700 at the metropolitan museum of art
[01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:49.420]   I'm wondering is there a censorship feature built into this that anytime it sees like breasts or butts
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.740]   It's going to try to censor that stuff out
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:56.700]   And I've been making inquiries at google when I have not received a response yet
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:28:01.580]   But it's the sort of problem that it's easy to say no and and make sure that
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:07.820]   And avoid it seems as though there you'll create bigger problems for yourself as a company if you let adult adult
[01:28:07.820 --> 01:28:12.620]   Content through then if you censor it and then simply say oh, I'm sorry that wasn't supposed to happen
[01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:16.620]   I think I think the problem is
[01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:21.580]   The best you could achieve is half censorship, which is probably not
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:25.180]   Nothing but just confusing people. Well, look at an instagram feed
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:30.460]   I mean instagram fans what it believes is nudity, but like there's still all sorts of wacky stuff on instagram and things
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:34.060]   Somebody on instagram decided butts were okay because all of a sudden
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:36.380]   Yeah instagram's just full of butt pictures
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:42.540]   You can have a top with man, but not a top with woman. Yeah, it's worse. Just either let everything or let nothing
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:48.860]   And it's actually having I think a bad impact on society I when the when
[01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:52.220]   Groups in New York started to say well, look
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:55.420]   It's actually not illegal for women to go around shirtless
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:29:02.780]   And cops have to be informed that it is okay for women to sunbathe's nude or even just to take off their tops because it's hot
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:05.660]   Outside and a lot of other people are taking off their tops
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:12.700]   And so my again my growing up in an in a puret and fishing colony in the 70s and days like oh my
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:15.900]   Why would you want to make me topless?
[01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:17.980]   And then I had to start wait a minute
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:24.220]   Well, why the only reason why this seems like a really weird thing for women to do is because i've always been told
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:30.060]   This is a weird thing for women to do and realize that actually it's stupid to just just like
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:30.940]   uh
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:37.820]   I in warmer months you can see women who are who are dressed very very comfortably appropriately for and I walk past and I don't
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:41.420]   Gawk and I don't think it's weird for people for for a woman to be walking around
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:45.100]   Uh in a sports bra imagine like a 1920
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:48.940]   There would just be nothing but ogling because I see her ankle
[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:53.420]   Yeah, and I just I think about things like this and I think about if we were if we
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:59.340]   Stop programming our kids to think that nudity is something shocking and something to be ashamed of
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:01.900]   Uh, and it's always going to be a problem
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:08.460]   That's I think that's a contributor to a lot of the really horrible attitudes that society has towards towards women and towards other groups
[01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:14.300]   Yeah, I mean like we've seen what happened in japan where they they started pixelizing various bits
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:20.220]   So then tentacles became the thing. I mean there. This is just a path to insanity. Yeah. Yeah or pornography will find its way through
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:22.380]   Yeah
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:26.460]   Well, I mean if you want to be a general purpose computing platform, it's kind of I mean we
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:30.620]   There's no nudity on twit. I managed to handle that
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:33.180]   Fix that right away
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:36.460]   Underneath all these clothes
[01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:41.660]   But but but we're not a you know, we aren't trying to show you a full we're not a web
[01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:46.460]   We're not a fully functioning web browsing platform. It's an easy thing to do to be clear
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:49.100]   I mean, they're not I mean not see if it worked doesn't just define pornography
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:52.860]   There's all vast categories of things on reddit that apple's probably not wanting to be displayed in apps
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:56.460]   They're well, then have a but that's the funny thing is they are in the apps
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:59.100]   and all their
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:03.420]   It's a mess leo that's a mess. I don't even know why i'm care about it
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:05.660]   Um
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:09.740]   Here's a here's a keyboard you should not install the hub keyboard for iOS
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:15.100]   Uh, I thought that from microsoft these days what adopi idea this was
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:19.820]   Um apparently it's a keyboard that doesn't just type letters it types applications
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:23.340]   Why wouldn't you want that?
[01:31:23.340 --> 01:31:26.140]   Um it integrates with office for excel
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:29.100]   It integrates with office 365
[01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:34.700]   So you can search through your contacts and documents and share them wherever the keyboard is present
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:37.020]   I don't know just don't install it. It's really ridiculous
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:43.500]   It's remember that the great thing about customizability is that you don't have to create a keyboard that makes sense for everybody
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:50.140]   If but if it makes eight people think oh my god, this is this makes my work my day so much faster and better than it's worth it
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:52.700]   I guess
[01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:55.820]   Uh, it also it's no problem for me if you want to put this in there
[01:31:55.820 --> 01:31:57.180]   I just it seems like dopey
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:32:02.300]   I think I think as a piece of general news though. It's a really great indication of exactly how deep microsoft's
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:08.220]   iOS they're they created it's maybe not quite so much of a surprise that they created such
[01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:12.460]   Great microsoft office apps for for the macbook pro and for iOS 9
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:17.900]   But the fact that they're going to say no, we're even going to do a really weird custom keyboard for phones
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:20.700]   Uh that makes our products much much easier to use
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:25.740]   They're not just simply ticking off a checkbox on a on a product grid
[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.260]   They really do feel as though iOS is a place where they want to be well
[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:31.260]   I should point out this came out for android first but
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:36.620]   Is that have to it's easier and this is we should say from microsoft garage
[01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:40.700]   Which means it's yeah like one of their experiments. It's an it's an interesting experiment
[01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:43.100]   I installed it on android and immediately installed it
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:47.020]   Um, I'm not going to talk about the iphone 7
[01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:53.260]   This is way too early to start doing rumors to the iphone 7 right minute after the six s introduced leo
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:55.260]   You have to start talking about the iphone 7
[01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:58.300]   Uh, how is the se going is it think it's selling well?
[01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.940]   my my kiss kind of
[01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:06.300]   The five s was selling remarkably well when tim clique gave those numbers out of the show right 30 million. Yeah, I mean
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:13.660]   The people have been waiting for this absolutely love it and because they have had they've had no alternative to uh to a smaller iphone
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:18.940]   And again, it's it's not as we've been talking about it's not a chopped down version of the iphone 6
[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:21.420]   It's just smaller and that's pretty much it. So yeah
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:28.140]   Some are reporting according to nine to five. I'm sorry according to mac rumors that uh, there are issues with bluetooth
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:35.980]   Phone calls when the smartphone is paired with a vehicle or wireless headset as some are also saying the same thing with gps voice
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:42.780]   Navigation, I've tried I don't have a I don't have a bluetooth car, but I've tried with headsets and uh lori gill has one and daniel
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:44.620]   Bader has one and none of us could replicate okay
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:49.420]   The issue but that doesn't mean anything there's so many of these things and they're so complicated now that even if 3
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:54.300]   Percent of people have it that can be thousands and thousands of people. Yeah, right? Well, that's right exactly or 1%
[01:33:55.180 --> 01:34:00.460]   And not unusual for a new phone. It's if it's still a problem in in three or four weeks time then it's then it's a bigger problem
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:05.580]   Yeah, are you using the se as your daily driver so to speak? I have been I have been
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:08.940]   Because I like I really wanted to give it when I when I get a review unit
[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:12.300]   I don't want to just do like I do a quick take for people who really want to buy it that day
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:17.500]   But then I try to live with it for a while and talk about battery life and talk about any issues and it's small
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:21.900]   You I mean like using that keyboard looking at that little screen. I really miss 3d touch
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.620]   I use 3d touch a lot on the iPhone 6s and now I go
[01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:29.100]   I find myself kind of pop and press and and get track pads and things and it reminds
[01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:31.740]   It's like I have not been trolled this badly by apple id
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:36.220]   Since there was no touch id on the original ipad air and it would take me three seconds every time to remember
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:41.340]   There was no touch id and then unlock it so I go to do something and I realize uh it doesn't work this way and I have to
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:43.020]   Do it a different way but other than that
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:45.420]   I mean it's a great little phone and whenever people have seen it
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:51.180]   And apple smartly gave me the rose gold version because it draws attention. I like one knows it's a new phone
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:56.860]   Ah, that's such a great little pocket phone. Yeah, I got the rose gold ipad as well. So that looks nice
[01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:01.180]   Own the thing is a great color
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:04.780]   They go with the audience cuz
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:07.740]   Yeah, it looks pink
[01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:10.220]   Does this phone make me look girly?
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:15.660]   Uh, I like pink. What's wrong with pink pink used to be a boy's color in the yet turn of the century
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:21.020]   It's light red leo like very very low. No, it's own the pink on the
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:27.740]   I bought I bought my my first article of pink clothing last year during that horrible winter because I needed some damn color in my life
[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:31.820]   As soon as I put on that pair of pink socks, I realized that I'm an idiot. Why do I not buy?
[01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:34.460]   It's a great color. Why is this the only color that I don't again?
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:38.700]   It's like you are programmed as a kid that this is not a boy's color. You're not supposed to wear pink
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:45.740]   Fight the head. My ami vice as a uh as a good preppy. I've worn pink shirts for years
[01:35:45.740 --> 01:35:50.220]   What about the did you put the shoulder tied sweater leo? Yeah, it's yes
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:52.220]   And I run through the house saying tennis anyone

[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:30.940]   If you don't get the watch you don't get the her mez watch face
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:35.020]   But if you have a her mez watch and you want other her mez bands or you have your existing watch
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:37.100]   You just want to add a little bit of her mez leather
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:41.260]   And for some people these are exorbitantly priced but if you've ever seen what actual her mez bands cost
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:43.900]   These are ridiculously low priced for her mez
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:46.300]   Uh, so it's it exists in this weird netherworld
[01:39:46.300 --> 01:39:49.820]   Uh, if you don't want her mez apple has a bunch of new
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:52.780]   Whole other bands available
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:57.660]   Well, these are review units. So these i didn't actually buy these are the ones that i'm going to be reviewing
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:40:00.460]   But he will be buying some of them
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.940]   And they have great new spring colors available
[01:40:03.020 --> 01:40:06.860]   So here's the the marigold and the red and the sky blue and the navy
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:11.420]   Uh, and there these are are still you know a little bit pricey
[01:40:11.420 --> 01:40:15.900]   But they're nice leather bands and if if you know to Andy's point previously
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:20.700]   I hope they don't change the size of that lug anytime soon because i'll have to read mortgage at that point
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:23.420]   Yeah, they can't do that right they've got it keeps a lug
[01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:27.820]   Especially now that they're releasing i mean they release new bands in september they release new bands in march
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:30.300]   I mean they if they keep releasing new bands to me that's a good indication
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:34.300]   You can never say never with apple because they ditch the floppy and they'll ditch my lug one day too
[01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.620]   But i feel confident that for a while still
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:41.260]   I have the i bought actually a lot of the woven nylon bands. I got one from my mom
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:43.900]   I got one for a friend of mine. They're all really really nice
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:47.420]   I got my sister for her birthday the new red modern buckle and she really loves it
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:51.340]   Uh, so there's a really nice and it changes the entire look of the device
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:55.500]   Which is you know, we don't really appreciate that from a watch or say from a phone or a tablet
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:58.060]   standpoint, but because you're wearing it all the time
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:02.860]   You can change that that little bit of color and it really does give you like a fresh totally fresh
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:07.100]   And you look without changing the hardware resetting everything. I noticed with the nylon bands
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:12.620]   The lug is colored as well as the uh, as the band so you get a little trim. What color should I get?
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:17.900]   Uh, so I have I forget what the pink one is called. I have the pink one my mom has the merry gold
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:19.900]   I'm not even racing the pink
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:25.340]   Uh, I had you know, I had I came I had the I was wearing the black stainless steel watch and the pink and black
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:29.980]   Is just so bad. Yeah, that's pretty. Yeah. I had to go for it. I can't decide
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:33.260]   That's why you have some a black attack. Yeah
[01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:35.260]   Yeah
[01:41:35.260 --> 01:41:38.220]   See how is it go for the like boring like the pearl that's boring

[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:45.180]   Does you have stainless?

[01:43:54.860 --> 01:44:02.380]   I don't even wear the apple watch what am I buying a band for mr. Andy and ako your pick of the week
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:08.380]   Uh, my pick is actually kind of a revisit of something that someone else picked a couple months ago
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:11.340]   Jason snell keeps talking about how he uses
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:16.780]   Oh good. Oh good. Oh good. Got it. My still my still on you look good. The picture quality superb
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:19.100]   All right, at least I got my mouth open and I've got a goofy
[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:25.020]   Uh, but yeah, he's been he's been editing podcast and audio with this really great ios app ferrite recording studio
[01:44:25.020 --> 01:44:28.140]   Uh, and so it was actually when he was on
[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:30.860]   Uh, the ios daily
[01:44:30.860 --> 01:44:35.740]   With you a couple weeks ago. They actually walked through what it's like to edit audio using this app
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:41.740]   And so I gave it another try. I've now edited a podcast with it and I really really am starting
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:45.500]   to get into it. I didn't get into it when he first recommended it because I didn't see him use it
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.100]   it's uh
[01:44:47.100 --> 01:44:50.060]   It's not only is it powerful enough to do multi-track editing
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:54.460]   And the sort of thing we've got three different voices three different recordings and you just need to
[01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:55.900]   uh
[01:44:55.900 --> 01:44:57.900]   cut out the umbs the irms and
[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:01.580]   Switch from one recording to another as you uh as a conversation moves around
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:10.220]   I also love it because it really is an aggressively ios app where uh, the developers have decided that do we want to make this thing
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:13.260]   So fast and so powerful that uh, you can get through
[01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:18.940]   Really really complicated editing things really really quickly or do we want to make it easy to
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:21.580]   To to use the first time you're using it
[01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:27.260]   A lot of it is hidden a lot of the features are hidden underneath the hood where you've got to double tap and you've got to
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:30.060]   Drag with like two three two fingers and three fingers
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:34.780]   But once you figure out what the language of this app is it really is
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:37.500]   Uh, you can get things done super super lightening quick
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:41.660]   And with a minimum of on-screen clutter to get this it is
[01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:46.940]   It's not stuff that you would figure out without looking at a tutorial video or watching jason actually edit using this thing
[01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:52.620]   But uh, if you imagine how many buttons and how many pull up menus you'd have to put on to the screen in order to do
[01:45:52.620 --> 01:45:57.820]   That's the same sort of thing you either got to have a mouse or you got to have all these double tap and triple tap sort of things
[01:45:57.820 --> 01:46:02.860]   So really really happy with it. Uh, it's a they're charging real money for it, which they should do
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:07.820]   Uh, it's like 30 bucks for to 30 bucks plus 40 bucks plus whatever
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:12.220]   Uh, the the actual download is free about to make making it a really professional tool
[01:46:12.220 --> 01:46:17.020]   Uh, it starts getting into a little bit of money, but that's okay because it is a professional tool that will save you time
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.980]   And I can make another how we'll make another 30 dollars
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:21.980]   I might not get another 45 minutes
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:29.100]   Uh, today in order to get this job done and one more it's if it's one more professional tool that lets me use my pad pro
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:33.100]   Instead of taking my macbook someplace. That's that's cheap money
[01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:41.420]   Very nice. Yeah, I downloaded it too when Jason mentioned it. Yeah, fair. I recording studio. I feel like the ipad pro now
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:50.220]   I'm not going to use it. It's not replacing my laptop, but I have to say it's if for creating content. It is actually really a nice tool
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:55.420]   Yeah, absolutely. I'm not missing it at all when I'm when i'm out and about with it
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:59.580]   Um, as a matter of fact, I've got I'm going to a family wedding next week
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:06.540]   I have at the very last minute asked to shoot the shoot the the the ceremony and i'm thinking how
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:12.540]   How confident am I that I can use my ipad pro for everything i use my notebook for?
[01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:20.300]   I'm not sure that I but the fact that i'm even thinking about taking an ipad with me to at least get a rough cut of a wedding video done
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:26.380]   Like the night during the wedding reception or shortly after shows you how much faith I have in ios in the ipad pro
[01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:28.860]   Yeah, pretty cool
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:32.060]   My pick is something we discovered yesterday on ios today
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:36.060]   We had been talking a lot about the fact that the new ipad supports ethernet
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:41.500]   Uh, and a lot of people told me oh no, it's always supported ethernet. You just had to have a powered hub
[01:47:41.500 --> 01:47:43.900]   That was the issue was enough power, but
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:52.380]   You also had to use apples ethernet adapter and we played around a little bit and we found an ethernet adapter that also works
[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:54.620]   And this is from another company. I love anchor
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:59.420]   So if you want to add ethernet to your ipad, of course, you're going to have to get the apple
[01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:00.940]   camera
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:06.140]   Still call it the camera connection kit the new one that has uh, usb 3 and it has power
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:12.620]   And it has a usb dongle and then you're going to want to get this now apple charges 30 bucks for their ethernet dongle
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:19.660]   Anchor makes actually arguably a nicer one. It's aluminum body and it's 20 bucks. It's less expensive
[01:48:19.660 --> 01:48:24.860]   Um, so and we verified that this does in fact, uh, this does in fact work
[01:48:25.740 --> 01:48:27.740]   In fact, we apparently we own a few of them
[01:48:27.740 --> 01:48:33.100]   John said oh yeah, take a few you can get it on amazon and they make i haven't tried the other ones
[01:48:33.100 --> 01:48:36.300]   But they make other things as well like this would be really cool
[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:39.820]   That's that's one that i have i bought that does that work with your ipad
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:42.620]   It does work if you have power plugged into it, right?
[01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:48.620]   Although you do have to be pretty conservative about the other things you plug into those other three usb ports i wouldn't you i wouldn't use it for
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:55.420]   Yeah, be be be careful. So this is and it's not designed for the ipad but you but now any is verified
[01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:59.580]   It's the unibody aluminum 3.0 to rj 45 gigabit ethernet adapter plus
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.820]   three
[01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:08.460]   usb ports it's 26 bucks also high speed for the USB 3 yeah, so
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:12.860]   Uh, that's for the big pro right the little pro doesn't do the high speed unfortunately
[01:49:14.380 --> 01:49:18.300]   Yeah, that's that is that is really great. I I can't really think that you should
[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:23.340]   There would be advisable to have multiple usb dongles plugged into it
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:26.140]   Um, my battery life is terrible. I hate apple
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:34.460]   But we're really we're also talking about ipad errors here and we're talking about the device too, right, right
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:39.260]   Um pretty nice. Yeah, so actually i have i have the usb only one
[01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:45.100]   But i'm thinking it's been a little bit more in getting the usb plus three ports ethernet plus three ports
[01:49:45.100 --> 01:49:49.100]   With that that new camera connector for the ipad though lighten that new lightning connector
[01:49:49.100 --> 01:49:54.380]   That was the sleeper hit of the last event. That's like it's just it's a game changer practically
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:50:01.180]   Do you use it on your smaller i put the junior? Um, do you have a junior? I can't remember
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:06.460]   Are you only on the big you only have the big one? Uh, I have a loner, uh ipad pro mini
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:10.620]   But I don't but my my daily carry around is my personal uh, i've had pro
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:15.020]   And we found we tried a number of batteries although i haven't tried a higher power battery pack
[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:18.460]   You really need to plug it into the wall into the mains as they say
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:22.620]   Uh, i've had i've had some success plug into a really high capacity anchor
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:24.460]   Yeah, but I
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:30.860]   It depends on what you're trying to accomplish if i had again if i've just taken two hours worth of wedding video
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:32.620]   And it's on an sd card
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:38.140]   And if something happens to that card, I'm in a big sticky i would probably want to plug it into a
[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:40.060]   All muck around with that one exact
[01:50:40.060 --> 01:50:42.860]   Somebody's stolen my
[01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:44.620]   Oh here it is. Oh
[01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:48.540]   You don't want to lose this. This is the most expensive piece of the whole equation. This is the 50
[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:51.100]   Apple camera connection kit, but once you have that
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:53.980]   the sky's the limit
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:56.780]   Rocket ship to the moon man to the moon

[01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:11.660]   It's
[01:51:11.660 --> 01:51:18.140]   I've been i've been i've been losing camera a couple of times and my rule for the for the podcasting one is don't is it working
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:22.540]   Yep, great. Then don't do anything then don't mind. We want to upgrade something that's actually working, but now it's not work
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:25.660]   This might so this might be the last time i appear on the show

[01:52:15.580 --> 01:52:21.980]   So i'm i think that we're about above the over just over the halfway point. It all gets very sad now

[01:52:36.700 --> 01:52:43.740]   Not a career or life lengthening sort of exercise, but we couldn't really go through the show with that one mention of hamilton
