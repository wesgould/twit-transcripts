[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie, Andy and I, we're going to talk about
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.920]   Apple event the series season two, the 2021 edition. Apple has probably at least half a dozen events
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.960]   scheduled. Renee and I will go through our predictions for what we're going to see from Apple in 2021.
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.200]   There's a new Outlook client coming to Macintosh. This time it's just the same as on Windows.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:35.920]   Apple kills 39 games in the Chinese App Store and loses their copyright battle against Corellium.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.640]   It's all coming up next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:47.040]   Podcasts you love from people you trust. This is Twitter.

[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.160]   I'm not against caffeine, I just like amphetamine better.

[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.560]   Episode 747. This is going to be a jumbo show. Andy Inako is here from WGBH in Boston. Hey Andy.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.640]   Hey, thank you for upgrading the extra legroom in this seat.
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.880]   We decided to put you in business. By the way, Happy New Year for some of senior in 2021.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.640]   Exactly. Happy New Year to everybody. It's okay for people to not make fun of other people
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.360]   for thinking, "Oh, 2021, thank God, 2020 is over." It's okay to just let people be happy
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.240]   and let people be optimistic. I've never been so glad that just a routine numerical increment,
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.440]   Variable Plus Plus has made me so happy. I'm very, very pleased about this.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:19.040]   We'll see. I mean, we'll see. But I choose to be optimistic.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.280]   It's a decision. You're right. It is a decision to be optimistic. It remains to be seen.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.200]   Also with us Renee Ritchie from youtube.com/ReneeRitchie. Hello Renee. Hello Leo. I'm going to be the
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.440]   pessimist here because it's December 36th and we're going back into lockdown. So Mary 2020,
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.400]   the Snyder Cut to all of you. It is hard to be too optimistic during the coldest for us in the
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.680]   Northern Hemisphere, the coldest time of the year. For you and Australia, our Australian
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.880]   listeners, I'm very jealous, although it's probably burning hot. But we just, it's so, it's,
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:03.760]   even in California, when it's in the 30s, it's just, it's hard to be, I don't know, optimistic,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.960]   I guess. January and February are yuck, yuck months. I don't like them.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.840]   Yeah. See, in New England here, like December is the, is the courier and I sort of, oh, look,
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.560]   it's Christmas in New England, gentle snowfall and like reindeer and stuff like that.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.360]   January and February is the, no, we're going to have nothing but like brown and gray slush
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.320]   frozen to a depth of like eight inches that you can't walk on. It's going to be no matter how
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.400]   you weather strip your windows, the wind is going to find a way to come in. And so this is,
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.960]   this is when even people like me stop saying, this isn't cold, this is crisp. This is, this is
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.560]   the time we start saying it's Chris monkeys, man. Brass monkeys.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:52.480]   It's Chris. Yeah, brass monkeys. So let's see what's going on with Apple. You did a video, Renee. I
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.120]   enjoyed it. I saw it on I'm more with your predictions for 2021. And there does seem to be some
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.880]   consensus that Apple's going to not waste much time with new announcements this year. What do you
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.680]   think is going to happen? I think we're going to start off at the very least with season two of
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.520]   the Apple event show, whether that's two episodes, one in March, one in April, and then, you know,
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.120]   WWDC will be episode three in the summer and then episode four, five and six, maybe in September,
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.760]   October, November, depending on how the world goes, of course. But I think Apple's got that whole
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.720]   production thing into a well-oiled machine. And they're just going to keep feeding us those
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.200]   one or two product, maybe episodes every month for quite a while. It's actually a great idea.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   And why wait till March? Let's start now. You got Apple tags. Let's get them going. There is now.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.440]   Can't start now. Nobody shops in January. We have to wait till people have their money back.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.960]   Oh, okay. March, I think late February, early March.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.200]   Gosh, we could use something in this chilly time to warm our little, the cockles of our hearts,
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.160]   whatever a cockle is. Those air tags are concerning me because at least the images that John
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.360]   Prosserleet have so much text on them. And I don't want an Apple that puts the word Bluetooth,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.840]   LE, engraved in metal on any product visibly that I buy from them.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:24.000]   Is it possible that that's, I don't know, just a pre-production model so that you're right,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.040]   Apple would never do that unless they had to, unless the FCC made them.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.760]   Yeah, I hope it is. I understand on the AirPods, on the case, it says,
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.120]   "designed in California, manufactured in China." And even that is too much for me.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.960]   There's not even an Apple logo on it, but they have that on it. So I'm guessing there is some sort of
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.320]   requirements that have to fulfill. Yeah, in fact, they got a waiver, I think, from the FTC
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.520]   on the iPhone not to have to put all that junk on the back of the iPhone. I seem to remember that.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.960]   Yeah, I mean, the tile tracker looks very, very streamlined and slick. So it's curious to see,
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   it's the thing is the Apple will make, even if it's just a simple tag, a simple tracker,
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.640]   they're going to, by default, design it so that you kind of want to put it on your keychain so that
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.000]   when you just casually drop it on the table, it's the device that lands on top so people can see
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.880]   this cool stylish fog you have on it. And I'm not even kidding about it. So I'm sure that if
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.960]   there's anything that is getting away from just logo, shape, and a shadow line edge,
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.720]   as the only piece of detail, there has to be an actual law that they have to comply with to make
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.680]   that happen. So that's why I don't, when I saw that render, when I saw that image, I didn't think
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.240]   that that was going to be the final thing. It doesn't look an Apple thing.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.280]   I love how John Prosser puts his name all the watermark all over it.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:50.160]   If you're going to be threatened, if you're in a risk like being broken into by Apple security,
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.560]   yes, you may as well get credit for the thing that you weren't supposed to have information about.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.880]   So we're seeing it also started because people would take the image and repost it
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   as it was their own. No, I know why it does it. I feel bad that he has to.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:09.120]   So on the one side, it's just plain white, but plastic probably. It looks about the size of a tie.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:16.160]   It's a plastic circle. On the other side, though, this is interesting. And this is where you say,
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:24.000]   you see the printing design by Apple, assembled in China. That looks like a metal,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.400]   kind of a concave metal, like a little mini parabolic antenna or something. I presume that's
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.560]   the antenna. And even that is fine. But it's just when it gets into like,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   and even like ultra white band, wide band sounds like a cool sort of a tech thing that Apple might
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.720]   like sort of like they put Chris Sapphire crystal on the back of the Apple watch. But once you get
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.800]   into Bluetooth, Ellie, that just I don't want to say Bluetooth, Ellie is like low rent at this point,
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.840]   but it just doesn't seem very auspicious. We should mention process pretty accurate. Yeah.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   Yeah. Yeah. We should mention this is a render that he made from a video he saw.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.760]   So it's a little bit of a tell the video now as well. Oh, as he posted the video?
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.360]   Oh, okay. Yeah. The video was from software, though. It looks like the setup screen animation
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.840]   where the thing spins around. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. So,
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.600]   does he say the provenance of that? Did it come from a beta builder?
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:21.360]   I think he said it was from some software engineer, but it is it's not out yet. So it's got to be
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.800]   from a beta build or an internal test build. Right. Right. Yeah. Let's also remember that
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.320]   however they designed this, there has to be a way to replace a battery and it's Bluetooth,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   Ellie, but Apple is not the company that's going to say, oh, when the battery runs,
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.680]   when a battery runs out, just simply take it to the Apple store, we'll swap you out a new one.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.440]   That was one problem with the tile is the battery run out. You have to throw the tile out.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.520]   Yeah. Which I never felt. Every minute to tell you that the battery is done. Right.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.560]   We had a sponsor called Tracker that was a competitor, no E, and they had a replaceable battery. But
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.560]   as a result, the battery died faster. You know, it was one of those things where you ended up
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.680]   replacing the battery more, you know, every few months. So do you think this might be rechargeable,
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.640]   wirelessly rechargeable? How about that? I would like it really more complicated.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:12.240]   I would be more I would be more inclined to think that given the amount of devices that I had that
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.800]   run off of a 2032 and run on Bluetooth, Ellie, for like a year or more, I don't know why Apple
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.360]   would want to increase the expensive manufacturer also to make it more complicated because that
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.760]   antenna has to be isolated. It has to basically work as a rechargeable device. That's not my
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:36.080]   first indication. You say Renee that there's no plug it would need coils to be inductively charged
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.600]   and it's even more complicated. Yeah, it's not great. But probably would interfere with the
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:46.240]   UBB and then BLE. It is another opportunity to make people angry for using lightning instead of
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.880]   USB-C. So there is that. One more chance. Renee, you say that they've had these for a year.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.240]   We certainly have been hearing rumors for a year and they've been waiting for the market to be
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.840]   right. What do you think that means? The rumors first came out when Apple announced their new
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:11.040]   Find My Network way back at WWDC 2019 and then they put the U1 chip in the iPhone 11 and didn't
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.960]   say anything about it. And then like behind the scenes they were saying, "Oh yeah, it'll help you
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.080]   with directional airdrop." Which is just like, "Okay, that's fine." But originally there was
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.000]   rumors that they were going to make the Find My Network not open source but they were going to
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.520]   license it which they did. You can now, competitors can now make devices using the Find My Network.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.520]   And that people were thinking maybe they want to avoid scrutiny from tile because they already
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.880]   are taking it so much from Epic and other companies. But now it just sounds like they made a product
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.560]   for all of us to go outside and lose our stuff and nobody's going outside and the only place we're
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:49.200]   losing our stuff is in our house. You're right, the time is not right for that.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:55.280]   I also think that MagSafe Duo, they made a MagSafe Duo which they were going to pitch. My
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.760]   understanding is they were going to pitch this as the ultimate premium all-in-apple ecosystem
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.840]   travel accessory. You have a ton of money, you have an Apple Watch and iPhone, you want something
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.160]   that folds up, goes in your bag, goes in your pocket, you can charge your stuff on overnight trips.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.200]   And then they had to announce it in a world where nobody's traveling and everyone just looks at
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.360]   it and goes, "It costs a fortune, why would I ever buy this?"
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.080]   You don't think they do an AirPods-style charging case for it?
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:24.560]   They would still need the inductive stuff because the AirPods are still charging the magnetic
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.880]   connection. And then you get it pretty small. I mean, it works in the AirPods.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:33.600]   It's not a product, yes. It's an Apple product, yes, but it's a Bluetooth tracker.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:40.480]   They don't have a lot of flexibility. They have to make it for a price. As a matter of fact,
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.280]   that's why I was very, very surprised they didn't find some way to release it before Christmas because
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:51.280]   an Apple designed Apple logo official Apple comes in a nice Apple box product that could
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:55.360]   conceivably be bought for less than $50. That's going to sell... Stock and stuff.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.760]   ...angosters, right, exactly. Well, but you need it or not.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.840]   Because the keychain and the wallet and everything are sold separately.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:09.680]   Right. Well, it's sold separately. There's also, from Ming-Chi Kuo,
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.160]   and he's been saying this for a while, pretty strong rumor. He says from the supply chain
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:21.600]   that the Apple, at least the first generation Apple AR glasses will be coming out this year.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:28.400]   You agree? Renee? I think a lot of that depends. I think that's something an Apple would want to
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.000]   show off in person. They would want to have an event where they could bring people in and check
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.120]   them out. So they're going to wait on that. So the world is better by September.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   And they did do the Apple TV when it was called ITV. They announced that in September.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.720]   And then, well, actually earlier this, yeah, I think September, and then the next year is when
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:47.280]   they put it out. The Apple Watch in 2014, they announced it in September and then officially
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:53.200]   released it in March. So they will do advanced previews when it behooves them. But I just don't
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.240]   know what the market is going to look like. I think it'd be a great product for 2020-2021,
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:01.040]   just to be able to put those glasses on and shut out the world for a while.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.560]   But whether they think they can sell enough of them, I think is the question.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.080]   Speaking of Apple TV, I finally broke down. I bought my mom one because I wanted her to use Fitness
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:15.520]   Plus because she doesn't, you know, she's 88. Happy birthday, mom. She sell a couple of days
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.560]   ago, 88. And she used to have a trainer come over a couple of times a week, but she's with COVID
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.800]   didn't feel safe doing that. But she's wanted, she said, well, watch YouTube videos. I said,
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.080]   mom, let me get let me get you set up with Fitness Plus because she has an Apple,
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.760]   new Apple Watch and iPhone 12. And so I thought, well, I'll get the cheapest Apple TV.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:38.800]   Because that'll be enough for her. It's 1080p. She doesn't need 4K, even though she has a 4K TV.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:44.400]   And then when time comes, I can get her a newer one if it has more features. She loves it, by the
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.960]   way. She says, I get up every morning. I can't wait to do my Fitness Plus because I guess there are,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.280]   I said, mom, you're not doing the dance exercises. Apparently, there are some, I don't know if it's
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.360]   yoga or what, where you could sit in a chair and do them. So she's doing like the chair exercises,
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:06.480]   which is for me a huge relief. I got to the Apple Watch for fall detection. I really wanted her to
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:13.120]   kind of keep moving. And it's great. She loves it. So I'm super happy with that. And that's good
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.560]   enough. That Apple TV is more than good enough for that. But I don't know, it feels like they,
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:24.720]   it's been what, two years since the app more three, this is the Apple TV update. It feels like it's
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:31.840]   time. They could put the new A14 in there, make it better for gaming. That's expensive. Again, I mean,
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.560]   that's the whole thing they're fighting with is the, they could put an A1210 and A12, Apple has me
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.440]   saying X like 10 all the time. Now I hate it. They could put an A12X in there and then it would do
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.200]   better. Like right now the limit is HD compositing and higher end Apple arcade games, when an A12X would
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:53.600]   fit that, the rumor is that they might go to an A14X and then get into gaming with a game controller,
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:58.480]   maybe even get some studios the way that other companies have. But the A, I just,
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.400]   that's going to be an expensive box because that's an expensive piece.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.520]   So it's cheaper than a PS5 or an Xbox Series X, right? But the expectations won't be less.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.600]   Like because people are like, nobody's going to spend, you know, a hundred, like over a hundred
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.160]   bucks, 200 bucks on a set top box when Roku is so cheap, or they'll expect something more like
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:22.480]   a console. And then as good as the A14X is, it's not the same class of SOC as what AMD is doing in
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:29.600]   an Xbox or a PS4 is just, especially in terms of graphics. Yeah, especially when compared to the
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:36.960]   cheapest, cheapest Apple TV you can buy right now is $179. And it functionally, it's about at the same
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:44.720]   rate as a $50 Google Chromecast with Google TV, Dongle. If you want to spend the equivalent amount of
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:51.680]   money, you can get an NVIDIA box that is kind of more like a console so much so that it can act
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:59.040]   as an entire self-contained media server if you want to. So it's hard to justify $179 for this box.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:06.400]   Unless they have a really good plan for additional content that is going to put a lot more horsepower
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:12.400]   on the box instead of on the servers. When you think about how many services there are for a
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:17.600]   Microsoft and Google that are going to be streaming games and put all the processing power on the
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.600]   server and just simply use it as a streaming device. And so congratulations, now you can get
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:30.160]   cyberpunk on a $40, $50 Dongle instead of a $500 box. What is Apple giving us in return? So it's
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:36.160]   also just as you guys said, it's an old box at this point. You'd like to think that if they were to
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:42.080]   redesign it, it wouldn't be so much in the names of, oh, well, now we're going to put in a hollow chip
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.840]   reader. Now we're going to have a 3D projector in it more like, oh, well, now we have a better idea
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.600]   of what people are using streaming boxes for in 2021. We're going to make custom silicon that works.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.880]   So it's going to be the best client ever for Google's Stadia or it's going to be the best client ever
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.960]   for Microsoft streaming game services because they've had what they've had a long time to do
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.080]   like gaming on the Apple TV. And it's still just sort of a, oh, yeah, that's right. Well, if you read
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.560]   all the way down to the bottom of the product listing, you will say, oh, yes. And by the way,
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.280]   you can run games on it as well. So they haven't really pursued that as well as they should have.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.400]   Apple did this once before way back when they had the pip in remember that it was a game.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.720]   They ever released it. I don't think so. Yep. Nope. It was really. They blew this.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:33.680]   They blew this one twice. I mean, when the Apple TV was first coming out, then the latest one,
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:40.000]   the Apple, the future of of TV is apps. They had a bunch of iOS game studios ready to put like
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.920]   the best and their brightest on the console because they had so much faith based on the
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:49.200]   iPhone's performance. And then Apple made those really wrong headed, really dumb rules about having
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.360]   to use a Siri controller and having to use on demand resources. And the studio's like, okay,
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.840]   well, wait. And then it turned out that that became a self-fulfilling prophecy and it never
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:03.360]   matured into a proper gaming market. And now when they could have spent all of 2020 saying,
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.960]   look how amazing Stadia and Xbox, I forget Xbox calls it now, you just be game-cast or whatever.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.160]   XCloud. It was XCloud. They keep changing their branding. I think it's still XCloud for the stream.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.560]   The Amazon one and everyone's announcing these and they could have been a year saying,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:23.200]   you know, you can run these services the best. They run the best on Apple hardware.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   Apple TV is the best experience for these things. And instead, they're like, no,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.480]   for some reason, we're going to say these are actual apps and you've got to list them all in
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.840]   the app store and you can't run them. Oh, you want to do Web sites now? That sounds to me.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.000]   Like they have ambitions. They don't want to do Stadia or XCloud. They want to do Apple
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.160]   gaming. But they do Netflix and they have a TV plot like that.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.720]   Remember, they have one streaming service. Remember what's going on? Well, they have Apple TV Plus.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.480]   Remember what's going on now? Is Apple really wants to make Apple services more and more exciting?
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:58.240]   I think, you know, right now there's a problem because you can't buy a PS5 for a series X because
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:03.920]   they can't make them. In fact, Microsoft's going pleading to AMD. We had the Microsoft
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.800]   Chief Marketing Officer on Windows Weekly a couple of weeks ago. And I asked him, you know,
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.920]   why don't you do what Apple does where you can order it and you say, well, it'll look ship in
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.560]   January or March or whatever. At least you people would know they were getting it. He says, we can't
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:26.640]   do that because our supply chain is so wonky. We can't predict. He says, Apple, you got to understand
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.920]   Apple's amazing at this. They've got it down. They've been doing this for years.
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:35.680]   We cannot guarantee delivery in March or April. So we don't want to say that.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:40.240]   AMC and NVIDIA can't make boards on the market that they can't make.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.960]   Right. So this is actually the norm and we're just so used to Apple doing it so well.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:51.600]   They eliminated lines, basically. So I think it's an interesting idea that Apple might say,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.840]   here's an opportunity. I mean, it's only for the next few months, but here's an opportunity.
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:01.440]   Why don't we make it essentially? Don't call it a console, but make it make the Apple TV a game
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:09.760]   console. Get some AAA titles on there. You could sell it for $250 easily, but I think only if it
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.840]   has a streaming services. The same way I wouldn't buy an Apple TV without Disney Plus and Netflix.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.960]   Well, it would be an Apple TV. But it would be in addition. If you buy a PlayStation 5,
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.120]   you've got streaming services on it. You can watch them.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:26.080]   Apple currently doesn't allow them. I think that'll make it a useless box. They have to allow those
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.840]   services in order for it to be a useful box. You mean for gaming. You mean for gaming.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.400]   Yeah, they know. I think you're blocking their mind. You don't have to do that if you get a few
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:44.400]   good AAA titles. You don't need a lot. Traditionally, the Xbox does not launch with great exclusives.
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.280]   Sony does. It hurts them, but Sony does better as a result. But I think...
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:55.520]   Would it be an Insta-buy for you if it had Game Pass and it had PlayStation Game and it had Stadia,
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.040]   all those things? But I feel like Apple's the kind of company that doesn't do it that way.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.640]   They want you to subscribe to Arcade Plus Plus.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.840]   They do it for... They don't make Netflix put all their titles and iTunes. I mean,
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.960]   that's the thing that kills me is they are essentially indistinguishable from streaming video
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:15.200]   services. They just have more complicated control. That's my evidence that Apple has ambitions in
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:22.800]   this direction. Well, it also could be just simple. It's simple dogma. There are very few parts of
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.680]   Apple that really feel dysfunctional. And when it comes to policy regarding the Apple store,
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:34.640]   the App Store seems to be dysfunctional maybe with a lower case D rather than an upper case D.
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:39.440]   So many times we see decisions that are reversed based on... It didn't go up.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:45.360]   A decision was not important enough to go up the food chain for approval. Or it keeps running
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.040]   butting heads for the rule that was set four or five years ago, where a certain app, when a
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.520]   certain app category really didn't exist. And rather than realize that, "Oh, well, this rule is
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.880]   archaic. They'll simply shut out an entire category." When you see the ban on games and the rather
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.720]   silly, "Oh, well, you have to submit each game individually that's going to be available through
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:09.440]   Stadia before we will allow it to blow out your streaming app to go in." That feels like a dogmatic
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.720]   choice as opposed to either strategic choice or engineering choice. And that's given the history
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:20.000]   of Apple with the App Store. I would not doubt that this is just stupid bureaucracy that is
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.600]   interfering with the Apple TV becoming a very useful $179 box as opposed to a very overpriced
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:33.280]   $179 box. All right, we'll see. I'm going to hold out. But everybody here, you're absolutely right.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:39.440]   I mean, Apple has such a great opportunity here to sense the temperature of the room that
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.920]   everybody wants the hottest new games on the hottest new consoles but they cannot buy. It is
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:49.280]   becoming almost like a topic for late night comedians to joke about the in-obtanium of a brand new
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.520]   present generation console. And if you want to run AAA games, there's going to be a point
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:59.520]   which people are going to be sick and tired of the game of acquiring the console and simply say,
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.920]   "Well, you know what? Out of desperation, I bought it on Stadia or I bought it on a strip service."
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:11.440]   Yeah, that's the hope. And I was getting 120 frames per second, I'm getting 4K, I'm getting HDR.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:18.000]   And I just, over time, I had the money set aside to buy a console in February or March or April
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.880]   when they become available. But then I realized I could spend all that money on actual games instead.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:28.640]   So this is an opportunity that I'm sitting on. Apple had the opportunity to buy Bethesda.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.000]   Microsoft ended up buying Bethesda but had Apple for instance bought Bethesda and sitting on
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.800]   Doom. And yeah, right. And they could have, you know, Skyrim and the whole, they could have...
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:45.840]   Bungie. Yeah, there were some opportunities there. And I think Apple, it would be a really
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.200]   interesting play for Apple. Are they? So that's the thing is how all in on the ecosystem are they?
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.760]   I think that's part of the Dogma 2 Andy is... Well, they don't see that hardcore gaming is a
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.640]   profitable, but not profitable, but they think there's a lot of things where they'll say,
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.920]   "Yes, we could make some money on it, but is it a business we really want to be in?"
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:08.240]   And they see casual gaming as being far lower effort and far higher return than hardcore gaming.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.000]   And that's why I mentioned just the services because right now people are playing Cyberpunk
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.880]   on Stadia. Not only can you not get the consoles, you can't get Ampere or Big Navi car. It's like
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.080]   here it is. No, it's not as beautiful probably as it would be on a PC with the right hardware.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.440]   It's the PC version. But it's playable. Yeah, yeah. It's playable. It's frame rates okay.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.560]   You can play the game at least and you can play it on a Chromecast Ultra.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:36.800]   So you can work on the older generation of consoles, which they were ironic. Right.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:43.760]   Goldfall had to give people's money back. I could play it on my Samsung Galaxy Fold.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.200]   It's actually not a bad experience. I got a little Game Controller that attaches onto the
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.840]   better than a PC port. It's not a bad experience. I just feel like that's...
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:25:01.920]   I don't know. There's an opportunity and Apple has been expanding well beyond what we normally
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:07.280]   think of Apple because of this desire to make more revenue per customer and this growth and
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.720]   services. I think there's an opportunity. And they make content now. Remember, Alex was talking
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:14.000]   for years about Apple making content. They're finally doing it. They're finally doing it.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.480]   I wonder what their podcast ambitions are now that Amazon bought one-Dree, Spotify,
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.280]   spot a number of podcast companies. We've always thought that Apple was interested in making
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:30.240]   content, but they haven't yet. And they've hired so many people we know. And Stephen Wilson has left.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.400]   Yeah. So I wonder. Hey, speaking of the Galaxy Fold, there is a rumor that Apple is at least
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:44.560]   looking at folding phones. Is that complete bazooties? Is that nutty? I don't... I just don't...
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:54.400]   I don't see it. Samsung is just right now sort of at the point where they're shipping devices that
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.880]   the people who would buy such a thing are happy with the devices that they're getting. They're not
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.920]   close yet to the point where people who would buy who are just looking for a phone would be
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.840]   willing to spend a couple hundred dollars extra or a few hundred dollars extra for this feature.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:12.320]   They still... It really is all about folding glass as opposed to folding plastic. That really isn't
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:18.320]   there yet. The question is, is Apple willing to sell a $1,600 phone or is Apple willing to blur
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:24.160]   the lines between the iPad line and the iPhone line? I would like nothing else than to see them
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:29.680]   start to make a folding phone. I think they could really do it right. But I don't think that they're
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.440]   never in the business of, "Will we want to be the first with a demonstratable functional product?"
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:40.000]   They want to be the first with a functional and commercial product. And I don't think
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.560]   photable phones are there yet. I agree. I think Samsung is perfect for a photovoltable.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.880]   I think Apple should just get the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac. They're good.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:53.200]   But it's not that they're not working on it. I mean, they were working on a photovoltable prototype
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:59.600]   back with the ARK on 4. But they... No, totally. Except they believe that the tech... My guess is,
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:03.760]   my understanding is they believe the technology is currently like it was in kindergarten. Now with
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.560]   the full two, it's like in grade school and they tend not to ship products until they see what Samsung
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.800]   is doing. They see what Motorola is doing. They spend three, four years on the market. And then
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.280]   they put out their version of it. And there's problems that they want to solve that aren't solved yet.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.880]   But I do think, especially the way they've architected iOS most recently, since size classes and
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:27.200]   auto layout and things like that, it would make a really good experience going from an outside
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:33.120]   display to an inside display, a half display to a full display. And because their tablet ecosystem
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:38.160]   is so rich, just the idea... I mean, except for Instagram, because they'll make an iPad app when
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.000]   Apple freezes over. Instead of that, but like Twitter on the closed thing versus Twitter on the
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.840]   open, all those apps will just work fantastically. So I'd love to see it. But like you said, I don't
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.760]   think they'll ship it until all of those issues are well and mature. Yeah. Let's take a break and
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.160]   then we'll talk about what everybody really wants to know, which is, tell me about the new Macs.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:09.440]   We are still in season two episodes one and two of the ongoing Apple event show, but season two is
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:16.400]   coming. And you think that's when we're going to start to see new Macs, Renee? I think so. I think
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.120]   if they're not new designs, I think if Apple just has the... If they do what they did last year and
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:27.520]   just put an M chip into the existing MacBook Pro's, the higher end 13, and the 16, they could just do
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:32.080]   that as news drops because there's no announcement there. But if they do a redesign, they're going to
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.680]   want to give that a video to show it off and to increase the height. And then I think we see that
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:43.120]   at Dub Dubber a little later. Yeah, boy, I tell you at this point, I don't even... I don't use any
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:48.800]   other computers. Notice I brought my M1 in because I don't want to use that Surface Studio.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:56.960]   My iMac Pro at home, I actually turned it off so I wouldn't use any power because it's just
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:03.200]   painful. I think it's just remarkable what Apple's done and I cannot wait to see the M2.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.360]   The most interesting thing is watching the PC Master Race just come to terms with the fact that
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.240]   they don't actually like Silicon. They like hobbyist Silicon that they understand and can futz with.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.000]   And when anything else interesting comes on the market, they're just so disdainful.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.360]   I'm really intrigued by what Apple's got. We'll talk more, but I'm totally with you.
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.400]   Yeah. Hang on, here we go. We're going to have more with our great friends, Andy Inako,
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.720]   Renee Ritchie, a little program note. Next week, David Pogge joins us, the original
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:37.040]   Macster. Remember Mac world exposed? David would do his show singing his Broadway tunes,
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.640]   rewritten to include. Those are so much fun. David, of course, wrote the missing manuals.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:48.320]   He's now moved on to a new series of books. And he's just written a book,
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:55.520]   which I pre-ordered should come out pretty soon about the end of the world, aka climate change.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:04.320]   Our show today brought to you by Humber. The New Year is here. New Year, New Domain, right?
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:12.080]   Right? Let Humber help you establish your brand, create a new domain, whether you're a blogger,
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:18.000]   an artist, a photographer, create a portfolio. Maybe you're building an online store for your
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.040]   handmade mask creations. Maybe you just want to have a better link to your LinkedIn page.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:30.720]   Humber can get you started with the best domain names and email addresses just for you. I have
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:37.120]   hundreds of hover domain names. Pretty much everything we do at Twitter is registered at hover.com.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:45.760]   The domain name, I feel like this is an advanced tip, but anybody who listens to any of our shows
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:51.920]   should be at least getting a domain name, even if you didn't want to do a website for your email,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:58.240]   for your email. If you're a plumber and you have your customers emailing AOL.com,
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.960]   that's not a good look. That's not a good look. You want to look professional,
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   have your company name.com. You could set up a website later, but just getting the email started
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.320]   is a great way to do it. It's so easy to set up. You can add as many email boxes to your
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.760]   domain as you need. When your domain renews, the mailboxes renew two very good prices.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.920]   I read an article the other day that said nobody should be using free email anymore,
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:30.080]   because nothing's free. Free email, they're mining your data, they're putting ads in there.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:38.960]   If you're a business, get an email address, but get hover email, then you control it, you own it.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:44.720]   Of course, you can use the email app you're already comfortable with. They have web mail for
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:49.680]   you too. If you like web mail, you can continue to do that. I think I love that hover.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.440]   They're not here to upsell you on stuff you don't need. In fact, it's the best domain buying
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.320]   experience ever. That's why we all use it here when we have these brainstorms, Micah Sergeant.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:06.800]   I got to get that URL and register it right away. Hover makes that very easy, because there's not,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.000]   "Oh, maybe you'd like this, maybe you'd like that." They've got great domain and email management
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.560]   tools, pro-level tools, they're intuitive, they're easy to use. I've spent a lot of time in the DNS
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.360]   settings there. I use them all the time. It's really great. They give you who is privacy,
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.840]   by default. You don't even have to pay for it. It's included with your purchase.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.320]   I think people know this, but if you don't, you should. When you register to a main name,
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:36.080]   you have to register with a name, address, and phone number for the administrative contact,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.080]   the technical contact. If you're using your name, your address, and your phone number,
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:45.120]   that's public information. Anybody can find it. Who is privacy protects you? You still get the
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.200]   emails you need, the information you need, but people can't just look up your home address
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:55.520]   on the domain registry. It's a great way to reduce spam, protect yourself from unwanted
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.720]   solicitations, and just people bugging you. Hover Connect is nice to a single one-button
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.800]   connect. You don't have to manage the DNS. If you're using one of the popular website
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:11.760]   companies, Squarespace, or WordPress, actually, it's a blogger, it's dozens of them. You just use
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:17.680]   Hover Connect and a couple of clicks, and you're connected. My kids have done it. It's great.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.400]   For their names, I registered their domains names when they were born. They've got their
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.360]   domain names. As they get older, they said, "Hey, I want a website." I said, " Hover Connect."
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:34.560]   If you're a Hover user, you're a customer, not a source of data. They are not mining you.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:42.560]   They have reliable, tracking-free email. We love Hover. Hundreds of thousands of customers use it
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.600]   for the domain names and their emails, for their branding, whether you're a developer, a photographer,
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:53.280]   a small business hover has something for you, expand your projects, get the visibility you want.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.240]   Here's the deal. If you go to hover.com/twit, and please do so you let them know you saw it here,
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.160]   you'll get 10% off your first purchase of any domain name for the whole first year.
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:12.240]   Hover.com/twit. By the way, they have hundreds of domain names. All the obvious ones.com.net.org,
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:21.680]   but also.ninja.pizza. I have a lot of oddball domain names that I use for special occasions,
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:28.640]   for special usage. We have internal domain names that we use that have odd TLDs.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:36.560]   It's really great to have that available to you. Hover.com/twit. We thank you so much for
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:42.320]   their support. We thank you for supporting us by using that special URL, hover.com/twit.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.200]   You'll get 10% off, so there's a little something in it for you too.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:50.720]   So you wanted to second my emotion, Andy, on the M1 chip?
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:58.640]   Yeah, absolutely. I've said it before that as I was planning my two-year hardware upgrade strategy,
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:06.960]   I always thought that, well, I don't know what I need a Mac mini for my desktop for Mac stuff.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:12.720]   I want to maybe build a super, super, super powerful computer for rendering and stuff,
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:18.160]   largely because, hey, it would be fun to learn how to build a Windows PC for the first time,
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.720]   and also because at the time a year ago when I was making these plans, I thought that, well,
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:29.200]   the only way I can afford on a $2,000 budget, $2,500 budget, a super, super level of performance,
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:32.960]   I want the most bang for my buck. So of course I'm going to go with Intel or AMD,
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.320]   and now that's completely out the window because not only the performance that I'm getting out of my,
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:46.240]   what I call my MacBook Air Plus, my M1 MacBook Pro, but also what I've been learning in the past
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:52.560]   month and a half about exactly what the architecture of this M1 chip is and how, I don't want to say
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:55.920]   easy it's going to be for them to scale up the performance of this.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.640]   And I'm excited, like, well, why would I, if I had two or $3,000 to spend on the most powerful
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:05.200]   machine I could possibly get, why would I not get something based on Apple Silicon?
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:12.000]   So yeah, it doesn't sound dramatic to say that I'm committed to buying the exact same sort of
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.800]   computer I've been using since 1989, but nonetheless, but given that I thought that it was sort of a
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.240]   done deal that for the most power for the buck, I'm going to have, traditionally,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.440]   you have to go for a Windows machine. Now I'm like, no, for the most power for the buck,
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:31.600]   I'm going to go with a Mac. It's just heaven. And now that more and more dev tools, I mean,
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:36.960]   my emacs loads like that and it's, oh, it's beautiful. And I just, I just couldn't be the
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:42.000]   webster like feels like the whole web is sped up and I just couldn't be happy.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.960]   It was always going to be a little bit crunchy for the first three weeks.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.520]   Yeah, lots of different tools have to be updated and for the first few weeks,
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.840]   it was like, my goodness, emulation certainly does run quickly, doesn't it?
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.960]   My goodness, I'm certainly happy with how fast emulation works with the subtext being,
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:03.520]   I really want to see how fast this thing works when it's not faking an Intel chips.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:10.960]   I kind of don't want to put any Intel, any Rosetta to stuff on my, so I'm looking at activity monitor,
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.640]   which now has an architecture tab, which is nice. So you can see, and there are a handful of Intel
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:22.880]   processes here, but one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, most of them are background
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:29.920]   things like a Vox and sync thing. And unfortunately, the IRC client is still Intel, but almost everything
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.200]   else apple, apple, apple, apple, apple, and the real apple devs, you know, the Apple tools that we,
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.720]   you know, that are Apple-ish and Mac-ish and we love, they've really quickly moved over.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   A lot of the command line tools now are M1 native because they always had arm architecture
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.800]   capability. So it was just a question of kind of, you know, making a few changes.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.840]   I just really happy you probably saw the thread from stunt pants on Twitter.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:06.240]   She says, Shaq Ron, I don't know what his real name is, but he was at on the Apple chip design team
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:14.480]   has also worked at Google or he's a kernel engineer. And David Canner tweeted a couple of days ago,
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.320]   the things that make the M1 good have nothing to do with arm that cash is impressive. And
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.320]   stunt pants responded with an interesting thread. He said the premise here is wrong.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:35.600]   Arm 64 is the Apple ISA. It was designed to enable Apple's micro architecture plan way back when 10
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:42.000]   years ago, he says there's a reason Apple's first 64-bit core cyclone was years have had of everyone
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.440]   else. It's not just caches. It turns out Apple went to arm and said, we need a new architecture.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:56.480]   We need a 64-bit architecture. Arm hadn't even started doing it. When Apple began selling
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.840]   iPhones containing an arm 64 chips, Shaq Ron said arm hadn't even finished their own core
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:07.520]   designed to license to others. Arm designed a standard that serves as clients and gets
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:14.400]   feet gets feedback from them on their ISA evolution. And in 2010, nobody really was saying we need a
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:22.800]   64-bit arm core. He says Samsung and Qualcomm who have their own architecture license were certainly
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:31.440]   caught unaware when Apple shipped a 64-bit arm architecture in 2013. Apple planned, he says,
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:38.160]   to go super wide with low clocks, highly, oh, oh, I don't know what that is optimized,
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:45.280]   I don't know, highly speculative. And they needed an ISA system architecture to enable that which
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:53.040]   arm provided. So he says M1 performance is not so because of the arm ISA. The arm ISA is so because
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.640]   of Apple and their core performance plans a decade ago. I thought that's really interesting.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:04.240]   It's also a double whammy because when it first was announced, when the A764 bit was first announced,
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:10.480]   you could tell the savvy industry analysts from the sort of Paola analysts because they were like,
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.880]   oh, 64-bit is useless. No one's going to be accessing large files on an iPhone. They needed
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.680]   a new ISA and they might as well make it 64-bit because you're not going to keep an ISA for that
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:25.760]   much longer on 32-bit anyway. And they're not a merchant silicon provider that has to
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:30.000]   keep something on the shelf and reap as much profits as they can from it. So that whole
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.080]   transition to the A7 was just setting Apple's architecture up. And like you said, wide and slow,
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:41.200]   it turns out that, and I don't know if the Apple actually planned this or this was a happenstance
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:46.000]   because Apple's goal was that efficiency, but it turned out the more efficient they were,
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.480]   the more performant they were, and that running things wide and quote unquote slow,
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:56.400]   I think the difference was described as like Intel's like a hose. They want to pump as much
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:01.120]   water through the hose as possible, but that will always be a brute force application
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.040]   where Apple just opened the dam and let the river come through. And the river doesn't have
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:09.760]   the pressure of the hose, but it is so wide. It's not flowing as fast as the hose, but it is
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:13.600]   flowing so much water that you more than make up for it in volume in this case.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.960]   Yeah, by the way, oh, oh, oh, I should have known is out-of-order execution, not orange orangutan
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:29.200]   overalls. And it's interesting because Intel got bit by out-of-order execution and branch
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:37.360]   prediction. That was how Intel's big flaws ended up being biting them in the butt. I guess
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:43.440]   ARM had some of those issues like with meltdown and specter, but not to the degree that Intel did.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:50.240]   So maybe this is an advantage in a way if they can do, you know, speculative execution,
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:55.120]   out-of-order execution and not have the meltdown specter flaws,
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:00.960]   that might be another big advantage over Intel we haven't even thought about.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:07.680]   I was reading last month about the difference between the instruction to coders and Apple
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:14.000]   Silicon versus Intel and how doubling the number of instruction decoders on this chip plus the fact
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.280]   that on the AMD architecture, because every instruction is four bytes as opposed to they
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:23.360]   don't know how many bytes it's going to be. So the architecture also has to figure out,
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:30.080]   before we chop this up into microcode, we have to figure out exactly how long this instruction is.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:37.040]   It's removing a lot of burden off the CPU, giving it more opportunity to simply use this processing
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:42.560]   power to just actually do calculations. And this is the thing that really, really, really got to me
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:47.760]   because I'm part of a problem is I'm very, very old school and I think, oh, well, of course,
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:52.480]   more cores, more threads. That's it makes sure that it can record run very, very cool.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:58.240]   It sometimes I forget about the nuts and bolts of actually what makes the CPU work.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:06.160]   And as a lot of people who are more expert in this kind of architecture than I am,
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:11.680]   started to understand the super, super, super technical white papers and dumb it down like Eric
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:19.040]   Engam wrote a paper on on Medium that was called the why is apples and one chip so fast that pulled
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:24.560]   together like eight different things that I was at the time trying to digest. And that gave me my
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:33.360]   Oh, Oh, okay. Now I get because I mean, when we were talking about the shortly after the when
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:38.080]   we were talking about speculation about apple silicon before it was formally announced,
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:43.040]   we were trying to make guesses as to how long until they could actually make something like
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:49.280]   like the Mac Pro, something that is super, super powerhouse. And at the time, like my understanding,
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:54.480]   both from public and not public information was that it would be very, very easy for apple to do
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.120]   something like the machines that they introduced at launch, which is a very, very basic Mac mini,
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:04.080]   a very, very simple Mac book air, but creating that kind of a powerhouse,
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:10.080]   micro mini workstation was going to be not necessarily an order of magnitude more difficult,
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:14.640]   but it was going to be a challenge to get to that level of performance. Now it seems,
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:18.800]   like I was saying before, it seems as though it's a problem they have to solve, but it's not
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:23.600]   something they have to invent it simply. It's simply how many boosters can we add to the stack
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:29.200]   to make it from a rocket that puts us into Earth orbit to when that puts us into translunar orbit.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:35.520]   Yeah. So Renee, I think that's reasonable. You're thinking, if they do announce something in the
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:41.200]   spring, it will be just a refreshed chip. As if you were putting the next generation, you know,
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:45.280]   the 11th generation Intel in there, except you're not, you're putting an M1. Do you think it'd be
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:51.840]   like an M1X or an M2? How long before we see those? Well, I think the number is tied to the
[00:44:51.840 --> 00:45:00.320]   silicon generation. And right now M1 is an A14. It's the A14 ISA, an IP generation. So an M2 would
[00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:06.240]   be an A15 generation. It would have that generation of, it's called IP, intellectual property is how
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:11.440]   they define the generation of the blocks on the chips as well. So it's just a weird term that,
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:16.560]   but it's that generation of a silicon IP. But an M1X, which we've heard rumored about,
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.720]   could be anywhere from, right now you have four efficiency, four performance cores,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:26.400]   which is what you'd expect to see on an A14X that would go into an iPad Pro. But the rumor is that
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:33.680]   it'll be from eight to 16 performance cores and up to 16 graphics cores for the M1X. Like,
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:38.480]   let's just call it an M1X because it's, it makes sense. What Apple could call it anything they want,
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:43.360]   they could call it like M Hamburger if they wanted. But that makes a lot of sense for this chip.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:49.600]   And then the desktop chips, which could be an M1T or an M1Z would be like 32 to 64. And I think
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:54.320]   some rumors for a Mac Pro have been 128. And the nice thing about this architecture is that they
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:02.000]   built it to scale, they built it to scale down to the watch and up to the Mac Pro. Just right now,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.040]   by a little bit clock speeds, because you just have a bigger thermal envelope and bigger chassis,
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.840]   but mostly just the number of cores that they can put in. Yeah.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:15.520]   And part of it, but let's also, let's also not ignore that this is a system on a chip.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.600]   So we're talking about not only wanting to get more performance, but also wanting to get more
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:24.800]   I/O. Well, that was my question is, is what they have to do to get more thunderbolt ports in
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:30.720]   more RAM. I mean, you can't more displays, yeah, more displays. That's those are the three big
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.480]   problems right now, right, with the existing. Well, I think that they've daughter boarded RAM. I
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.160]   believe they've daughter, not daughter bars are wrong term, they've off boarded the RAM on iPads.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.960]   I believe previously, that's just an architectural design, but it should have no impact. The only
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:47.520]   thing is they won't they probably won't do dims because that would probably mess with their universal
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:53.280]   or they can make a bigger chip and put more RAM there. I don't know what the with the bus.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.640]   It doesn't have to be on board either as long as yeah, as long as it's transferring.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.360]   I like the universal the unified memory architecture. I like that.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.800]   And they can add more thunderbolt controls like they just put two on this one, but there's no reason
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:11.600]   that's part of the SOC, not the processor. Yeah. The SOC, the controllers are on the SOC and then
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.560]   they have, I forget the name, there's a translators or something that goes to the actual
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:22.880]   ports on the trip. It'd be interesting to see if maybe they had some unified memory architecture
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:28.800]   RAM and then some dims, which would give you upgradability, but would also give you like for
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:34.800]   like 16 gigs of high speed. So I have asked and from the people who are no longer at Apple, but
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:39.440]   used to be and worked on things like this, the solution would have to be incredibly elegant and
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:45.120]   brilliant, or it would be incredibly ugly because you'd have to sort of either make it CPU only memory
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.880]   or figure out some sort of module that would plug into the unified memory system.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:52.960]   And there's nothing like that now, which is not to say that that's not the kind of problem
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.960]   that Apple is ideally situated to solve, but it also could be like the first generation could be
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.880]   an ugly, ugly hacker. Yeah, could be a little glitchy. Yeah. So more ports are doable. What's
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:09.040]   the issue with monitors and the M1? Why is that? It was getting the 6K support. It just
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:14.800]   they could only get that on one by having the they could I believe they could have made a choice.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:19.600]   It could have had up to two 5K display support or one 6K display and because the only display they
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:25.920]   make is 6K they opted. But where does that come from? Is that part of the GPU? Is that is there a
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:31.440]   separate video? Traditional computer is GP on their older computers. It was it was GPU bound,
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:35.360]   either the embedded GPU or the discrete GPU. But I think they just they have a separate
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.320]   controller block, I believe for that now. So that would be again another system on the chip thing
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:45.600]   as opposed to a chip thing. Yeah, and expect like the next generation higher in Mac Pros will have
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:51.360]   much better monitors. Yeah. So it sounds like all three things are
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:57.120]   handle more more Thunderbolt 4 ports, more monitor support. Well Thunderbolt 4 is a good question.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:00.320]   I would love to see Thunderbolt 4. They've only done Thunderbolt 3 so far. Oh, this isn't
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:07.200]   Thunderbolt 4. I thought it was. It's USB 4 Thunderbolt 3 not USB 4 Thunderbolt 4. And I'm iffy as to
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:11.360]   where because they folded the Thunderbolt 3 standard into USB 4. It's very confusing.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.240]   And they all look the same, which is the most
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:22.240]   innovating thing in the actual one. So annoying. All right. So this spring maybe we'd see an X.
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:29.040]   I have to say I want to replace all my Macs. I probably can't afford to. But I just want to
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.400]   replace all my Macs. I don't want to have any Intel. Get rid of all the Intel.
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:36.880]   Yeah. This is where like my being a cheapskate. This is where it all pays off.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:42.400]   This is where my determination say no, it's not enough that you want it. You have to prove to
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.960]   yourself that this is going to be enough of an upgrade in terms of what problems that you'll
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:52.240]   no longer have to deal with or opportunities you can now pursue. And it was painful dealing
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:57.680]   with a 2012 Mac mini as my most powerful desktop back for a number of years. But yeah.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:05.760]   And by the way, just for Renee, you make the plea, international please for services, please
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.360]   every country. Let's not leave our friends to the Great White North out.
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:17.760]   It's not like we're lucky because Rogers was a co-owner of the magazine service that Apple bought.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:22.240]   So we have Apple News Plus, which most other countries don't. But when you look at the things
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:26.400]   that they've rolled out, like when they own everything like TV plus and Apple music,
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.320]   they rolled it out to 100 countries all at once the same time. But when they don't,
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.120]   when they have to deal with all these licensing issues or banking systems,
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:37.680]   like Apple card is still US only. Apple cash, I believe, is still US only.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.640]   Apple pay a lot of the series services. A lot of that stuff just isn't international. And
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:47.120]   international customers pay the same, if not more in many cases for the Apple products and don't
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.400]   get anywhere nearly as much services support. So I think that's something they have to really focus
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:56.320]   on. All right. We're here. We're running through this brand new show that
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:04.080]   Apple has. It's called the Apple event series and or the event show as Renee calls it. And we're
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:12.880]   going to get to season two, episode three in a moment. Renee Richie is here. We're actually,
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.440]   I love this is the backbone of the show is your is your video. You got to see it. It's at imore.com,
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:26.080]   Apple 2021, Andy and not co of WGBH in Boston. So season two, episode three, that's this summer.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:32.640]   I think they had such success with WWDC in the virtual format this year. I would be surprised
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:39.840]   if they did. I mean, it'll be too soon to not do it. I think they've got to do virtual in 2021.
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:45.680]   Conceivably 2022, they could do kind of a mix. I expect that's what they'll do because people do
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:50.160]   want to get together and they like the parties and all of that. But I just love the virtual
[00:51:50.160 --> 00:51:54.640]   conference. The virtual keynotes. I think Apple's really knocked it out of the park with that.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:52:03.360]   So we'll see iOS 15. Yeah, big sir. It won't be will big sir become will be.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:08.240]   So I'm so confused about this because it didn't go to 10.16. It went to 11. But then it wasn't
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:15.120]   like 11.0.1. It was 11.1. Yeah. So is it 12 this year now? Maybe it's just 12. Yeah, maybe it
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.080]   just be 12. Because it goes from like never changing the number to changing the number real fast.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:27.920]   I don't know. We'll see. But there will be a new Mac OS. There'll be a new iPad OS, a new iOS,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:33.440]   a new TV, a US and watch OS. Do we know anything about them yet? They're not in beta yet, are they?
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:39.680]   No, they start working on like I think in as soon as the other the previous version goes out,
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.680]   marketing pushes down everything they want, engineering pushes up everything that they've
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:49.840]   thought of. And then Craig sits down with the other the other executives and goes through the
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:55.760]   giant pile on his desk to figure out what's acceptable. What's it's attainable in a year?
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.400]   And he always picks too much stuff. And they have to kill stuff.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.960]   Well, but it's not really like I think some people look at it like like there were all these
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:10.160]   rumors about how the iPad the AirPods, AirPods, Macs were missing features. But that's every
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:14.400]   product they just don't usually get reported on. And there's been a ton of iOS features that were
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:17.920]   set up to release and didn't get finished. So they were just went into the next version.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:19.520]   Right. That's just normally what happens. Right.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:28.400]   And that might be June when they start talking about things like, well, an iMac Pro, I don't
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:34.800]   think a Mac Pro quite yet, but an iMac Pro perhaps. You think? And maybe it's only the color now,
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.760]   because like they were they introduced that new Mac mini and they made it silver again,
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:42.320]   because the previous Intel one was was space gray. And this one was not as capable.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.680]   Make it pink. So I think I think silver means consumer and space gray means pro.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.000]   Oh, that's interesting. That's that's a thought.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.320]   But the Mac Pro is silver. See none of this. I need a consistency back Apple.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:01.200]   I did leave out iPad and I think you you thought and I think everybody agrees.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:05.520]   This spring will bring us a new iPad Pro. We're due for that, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:10.800]   And everyone wants to see it with an M1, but M1 is just an a 14x with Mac specific, not just,
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:16.000]   but it is an a 14x in architecture, like in terms of the cores it has plus Mac specific IP.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.160]   So and I think a lot of people want that Thunderbolt controller on it now as well,
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:25.680]   because the iPad Pro is slower than the Apple Silicon Macs. So if you have that in there, plus
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:30.960]   mini LED display, because Apple still doesn't like OLED at larger screen sizes, but if you have
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.480]   mini LED in there, I think that starts to be a really compelling. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:43.200]   All your money, Leo, how about an S E? Will they do an S E this year? iPhone SE.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:49.040]   The rumors stop the rumors. There was a lot of rumors that there would be an Apple and iPhone
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.760]   SE plus and then that there would be an all new iPhone with an LCD screen, like an iPhone 10R,
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:58.240]   but with touch ID instead of face ID and the power button. And then like a couple months ago,
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.480]   those were just like, nope. Yeah.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:08.240]   Yeah, it's it's all the reports that we're getting are that it's just not selling all that well.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:13.280]   So that does mean they'll take it off the priceless, but it does mean that whatever plans they had for
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:18.480]   whatever the best case scenario was on how we can stuff even more capability, you know,
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.920]   this and maintain the price point is not maybe quite so important as putting those resources into
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:30.160]   the next iPhone. I'm sorry, the next money making iPhone. The next crazy.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:35.760]   Well, the S E's make money for them, although I guess the mini is kind of an S E sort of.
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.440]   They split the market though, because the original S E was a lower cost and smaller sized iPhone,
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:45.360]   and now you have a lower cost iPhone that's not really that small, any small iPhone that's
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:49.200]   not really that lower cost. So however many people were combined into that one market,
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.480]   you know, how that's put between those two devices. And I think that's a huge difference.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:56:02.240]   Yeah, yeah. Let's see. Is there going to be a episode four season season two episode four in the
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.120]   in the that's when you that's when you have a surprise guest appearance from the
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:08.240]   from a character from the cinematic font shows up. Yeah.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:16.320]   From the quest or from Ted Lasso. Yeah, well, we know there's going to be iPhone 13, although
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.760]   will they skip 13? How superstitious are they for and that was a bad that was a bad number in Asian
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.080]   markets? Right. All right. Yeah. 13 is fine.
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:32.480]   You say that it looks like Lidar on everything. Yeah, Lidar and all the they should be the same
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:40.000]   basic chassis with Lidar on all the phones, but because the LTPO OLED panel yield rates are way up,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.080]   it should finally be promotion on the iPhone, which means there's like me will be
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:49.920]   ecstatically happy. Some like Marquez Brownlee will get his 120 hertz, you know, scrolling,
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:54.720]   and people like me will be able to watch 24 frame per second movies at the proper speed like Hollywood
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:57:03.840]   always intended. What else? I'm sorry. I'm just just reacting. Don't worry. We're still watching
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:09.360]   it on a six inch screen, but at the right frame rate. If you hold it close enough, if you hold it
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:15.280]   close enough, Andy, it looks like a 65 inch screen. I wonder if Apple will do. I mean, really,
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:23.200]   this whole post is prompted by the fact that Apple had three episodes fall of 2020. Will Apple do a
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:28.320]   triple header in the fall of 2021? I think that goes back to what we were talking about at the
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.720]   beginning about whether they decide to show off something in the VR AR automation space a little
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:41.040]   bit early. That would be a really good season finale. Yeah. Also, whenever they do AR, are they
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:47.360]   going to are they going to drop it as a demo? Or are they going to present it as, hey, all developers,
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:52.560]   here's here's some. Are they going to do it the way they did the M1, which is we have some hardware
[00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:57.600]   that we never intend to ship as a real product so that you can actually get out and start to create
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:01.760]   experiences so that when we do do the real product at an end of an unknown later date,
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:07.920]   you will have we will have software the consumers can actually use. It's it's it's going to be one
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:14.160]   of the most delicate product and product demos they've ever done up. Even better than the iPhone,
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:18.080]   I think it's going to be up there with the iPad where they're going to have to do a lot of explaining
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:23.040]   and manage a lot of explanations. Excuse me, a lot manage a lot of expectations. And also,
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:30.640]   make the make the explanation of why this is not necessarily why this is not Google Glass. Please
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:39.440]   don't think of it as Google Glass. Why this is not not those those eyeglasses that that Amazon is
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:45.040]   selling to make sure that it gets it gets it gets Amazon software as close to your brain as possible
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:50.720]   that please please open up your brain and see this as a brand new thing that we are trying to create
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:56.480]   a brand new experience with. Although it's it maybe this the stakes aren't quite that high. I remember
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:01.600]   they they stumbled hard on the Apple Watch as long as they got the hardware right they were able to
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:06.960]   spend a couple of years figuring out that okay it's not for opening garage doors remotely with live
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:12.240]   video. It is actually a fitness platform got it. Okay, forget what we said at the Apple lunch.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:19.600]   Yeah, I remember that video of the garage door opening. I'm still waiting for that. I think the
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:23.360]   process will be the same though. I think like with with the Apple Watch, they announced it in
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:31.040]   September at that huge that huge Apple iPhone and everything demo and nobody got one nobody saw it
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:35.680]   again until March the next year but they brought developers to campus to do those kitchens where
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:40.160]   they got to try their their code on actual watches but you couldn't leave with them. You had to come
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.880]   in test your apps if you left they could watch to stay in the lab because they weren't any on the
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:50.480]   market yet. Right. And that would probably be if they allowed apps like if they're capable of running
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:54.240]   my guess is all run extensions where the original Apple Watch did because I can't believe that
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:59.440]   have a lot of onboard resources. Yeah, it's it's weird. I still don't I still can't come up with a
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:06.240]   good picture of what Apple would do with a wearable than a our device because for all the reasons
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:11.520]   that we've discussed previously, it is such a hard nut to crack starting with try to get somebody who
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:16.160]   does not wear glasses to put something on their face that doesn't really help them out unless they
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.040]   are wearing them on a regular basis. And that's just number one on a list of eight improbable
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.200]   things they need to solve by lunchtime. I mean, apparently don't work with sunglasses,
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.760]   which is the way that you would get other people to wear them. Yeah.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:34.480]   It's it's it's it's I just don't I don't know of display technology that would work the way that a
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.600]   lot of people seem to want a pair of Apple AR glasses to work. It will it's like right the
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:44.720]   technology is still either really really good at putting like a notification or a graphical ding
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.720]   is information somewhere in your field of vision where you can see it but other people can't.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:56.160]   It's really good at creating a narrow sort of like periscope style AR experience. Very bad
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:00.080]   at creating any kind of an immersive what you would think of as an immersive AR experience.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:08.640]   And again, it's the question of how buddy Holly ish. How Elvis Costello ish. Even dare I say
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:13.920]   Roy Orbison ish. They're apples willing to design the high end all the technology. Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:18.480]   According to Hollywood, I need to be able to look at somebody and see if their leather outfit
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.760]   would fit me since I've come back in time. If anybody though could get people jumping on a new
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:30.320]   technology like that, it'd be Apple. Yeah. People have such faith in Apple and what they can do
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:35.040]   that that's the one company I can even think of in the tech space where people would just sight
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:42.320]   on scenes say, yeah, well, I if Apple's doing it, it's got to be good. And will we be disappointed?
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.240]   It's going to be good. Right? I mean, Apple won't do it unless there's something of real value.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:51.200]   I understand it's not. Yeah, it'll expectation should be set on this firmly like phasers set
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:56.800]   phasers firmly to first gen. Yeah. And also the Apple put a lot of investment. We're talking since
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:02.640]   we're talking about the the role of the original Apple watch. So so I've never been at an Apple
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   event where there was such like a palpable like invisible wall between riffraff and the beautiful
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:17.040]   people because they had so many people from like style and fashion and design there that they
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:21.120]   have they had a I mean, they had special air for those people that we were not allowed to breathe
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:28.880]   into. And a lot of that not that $25,000 gold watches that too. But but but what I'm getting at
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.080]   is that they they're the company that could design something that someone is so pretty,
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:42.240]   so engaging and so stylish and also such a symbol of who you are and what you can afford that a lot
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:49.040]   of people would would buy this even if all it did was put like an orange LED. And to say, oh, by the
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.560]   way, you're watching needs to be recharged. A lot of people would buy it just to say, Oh, look,
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:57.600]   I've got the Apple logo here. Look, can I can I? There are a lot of people who are like, as as
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.840]   people as some people were complaining about the AirPods, Oh, well, I don't want this lollipop sticking
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.760]   out of my ear. There are a lot of people are saying, can I make it larger? Because I can't I
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:10.560]   wear my hair as long and people can't see that I've got the latest the latest Apple earphones. So,
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.920]   one other technology we should mention that Apple is almost certainly going to
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.840]   start rolling out probably early this year is mini LED displays. Currently, they use OLED displays
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:33.600]   for their phones. They use LCDs for their computers and their iPads. Where will we see mini LED and why
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:40.400]   Renee? Mini LED is going to replace my belief is that it's going to replace all the LCD displays.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.880]   And what it basically does is they'll still use really they'll still use OLED on the phones.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.480]   Well, I think micro LED is going to replace the OLED on the watch first and micro LED is way
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.280]   full on the same way that's OLED did. Yeah, but I think that's the that's the why we're not going to
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:59.200]   see mini LED on those devices. Those are going to wait for micro LED, which is essentially a better
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:06.720]   version of OLED. And these are mini LED is of confusingly named milli LED is a better version of LCD that
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:12.720]   gives you OLED like performance by using really, really tiny pixels and local dimming areas.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:18.160]   It's not quite as good as OLED, but it also doesn't have just the incredible amount of problems that
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:21.760]   you know that display manufacturers have to mitigate on all that all the time. Yeah, and of course,
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:27.760]   CES, which is next week, we're going to see both micro and milli LED TVs, but they're different
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:37.040]   technology. The micro LED is an emissive display that actually can be built up in blocks. So you
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:43.840]   could have it as small as an Apple watch. And then you can have as Samsung did last year at CES,
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:49.440]   a hundred and I don't remember how big it was 180 inch. Well, three inches wide.
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:57.600]   But that's an expensive days there. Samsung is selling a micro LED TV if you have $160,000.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:01.360]   If you're a basketball player, yeah, a basketball player, they have a TV for you.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:05.120]   Yeah. But so the technology is coming and I've talked to Scott Wilkins in our home theater guy,
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.880]   and he says it's probably going to be affordable in five years. It's not that far out. But that's
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:16.000]   a different thing that's emissive that is more like OLED or even CRT because you don't have a
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.080]   backlight. The mini LED is just a better backlight tiny little LEDs that have so you have more of
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:27.520]   them. So you can have local dimming better. It's like OLED only without the problems. You get the
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:32.160]   better color, better blacks, which is a big deal brighter, but also you can drive it without
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.640]   worrying about without worrying about worrying about burn in and takes up so much less power.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:41.840]   But my power is going to be a big one because that's, you know, OLED. I've had I have an OLED
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:49.120]   thinkpad yoga Lenovo thinkpad and it's a beautiful screen I've ever seen,
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:53.520]   but battery life is terrible as a result. So you pay for that. And the contiguous brightness on
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:59.200]   screens that are larger than iPhones are not is not great yet. Yeah. I have not seen big quality
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:05.920]   problems. I mean, after all, we have 70 inch OLED TVs. I'm very different technology though. Like
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.680]   if you look at the technology used for television, just mostly based on a filtering system where
[01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:16.160]   the phones are the like the Pentile pixel layouts and you get smearing at low brightness levels,
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:21.120]   you get pulse width modulation, you get off-access color shifting, you do get like they're really
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:26.480]   good at stopping burn in now, but they do have burn in and they have like the blue sub pixels
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:31.760]   still burns out faster. So they have those weird layouts. It's not an RGB stripe. So the sub pixel
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:37.120]   anti like there's just a ream of of issues with OLED. It looks fantastic though. So we use it, but
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.560]   it could be better. There's a lot of reasons to go to mini LED. And again, it won't be quite as
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.520]   good as OLED, but it'll be better than regular LCDs. So yeah, and we'll see those next year,
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.880]   you think on most of the LCD devices. I'm hoping this year, like the rumors are
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:56.240]   this year on this year. I'm confused about what year I'm in still. So 2021.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:02.560]   And this year, I still keep I still keep running hellscape on my checks. Well, we now know if we're
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:10.320]   out of it or not. All right. So good. All right. That was that was fun. Looking at all the possibilities
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.920]   for for this year. Can I mention one more big one? Yeah, looking for Leo and that is the iMac.
[01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.800]   I think like the next generation iMac, if they just keep the same design, whatever, it'll still
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.920]   be nice and faster and quieter, all that. But if they do ship that new design that's been rumored
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.720]   for years where it's it doesn't look like so like curved anymore, but it's it's
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:36.480]   ultra flat like an iPad or like a MacBook. I think that that is going to put a lot more
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:46.640]   luster back in the Mac lineup. Yeah. Cool. I think like I said, I just want to replace all
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:53.440]   my Macs. I don't know if I can afford it, but I certainly will try to.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:08:00.160]   Can I just say that I'm so happy to have like it's like it's like watching watching those videos
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:06.160]   where someone is launching one of those like $30,000 like model aircraft that's like a perfect replica.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:11.760]   And you're like, this has been what's been like for me to watch like Apple's Mac Mac line releases
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:17.120]   over the past like four or five years where it's like, okay, don't crash it, don't crash it,
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:22.560]   don't crash it. Oh, dear, he's got that really horrible keyboard like, oh, oh, it's a really
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:29.520]   underpowered like oatmeal box instead of a really good desktop. Oh, and I'm so glad to be optimistic
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:36.560]   and and to be to be not thinking about my my escape routes from Mac, which is something I've
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.560]   been doing for the past two or three years. Okay, let's let's not if we're if we're picking
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:45.040]   a new word processor, let's make sure we pick one this multi platform in case we have just
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:50.640]   make case our next laptop is gonna run Windows or Linux. And now I'm like, no, I'm on board. I've got
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:57.760]   the I'm not back to the six color logo, but I'm back to the black logo, definitely.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:03.360]   Yeah. All right, well, I have a kind of a bunch of stories because I really wanted to kind of go
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:07.600]   through all of this with you guys because I'm excited about the future. And it is the first
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:13.760]   show of 2021. But a bunch of other things happened this week. So I'll run through them.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:22.960]   Apple took something like 39,000 apps out of the app store in China. This is due to a
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.400]   government law in China that said you have to be licensed to be an app developer.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.040]   These all these apps kind of had their head on the block. Because of that,
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:39.360]   Apple actually removed more than 46,000 apps in total 39,000 of them were game apps.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.800]   Out of the top 1500 paid apps on the app store, only 74.
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:56.800]   Wow, only 74 survived. So NBA, 2020, Assassin's Creed. Yeah, they're probably all Chinese
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:05.280]   games. Wow. Wow. Big, big, big call. You know, I don't know what you're going to do.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.280]   Apple sent a notice out to developers saying Chinese law requires you to get,
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:16.240]   you know, a license. And they said, we're going to kill it December 31st.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.960]   This is going to be part of the app store review. And if you operate in China,
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.560]   I don't think you can flout that law. So that's what happens.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.200]   Yeah. And they've had, they've had almost an entire year to, excuse me, developers have had
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:35.120]   almost an entire year to keep up with this. So it's of all the reasons why we've had to
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.320]   report a story of Apple limiting things inside the app store for the Chinese market.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.840]   It is the least morally repugnant one, perhaps we've done in a while.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.360]   Yeah. And I wouldn't expect them to do any different, I suppose, you know, yeah, you know,
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:55.920]   Apple really has made some waves. Facebook hates it. What's app is pissed with their new
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:11:02.960]   policy of exposing, you know, the privacy, nutrition labels and, and exposing, most importantly,
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:08.480]   the one that really is killing Facebook and what's app is this right at the beginning when you run
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:15.200]   the app, it says, this is wants to use the Apple ID for advertising. Do you want it to? Would you
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.840]   like to block it? This is a setting that's been in iOS for some time. But now it's right up front.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:26.960]   Everybody's upset about it. Ben Thompson did a great piece on Stratecary today about the tyranny
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:34.160]   of the default. And it's one of the things he's talking about. You know, if the default is privacy,
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:43.360]   which Apple is slowly making it, then people are going to be private. And I think that's probably a
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:47.440]   good thing. His article is about more than that, though, actually, it's worth reading if you get a
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:53.840]   chance at Stratecary.com. One of the things he proposes towards the end is kind of new defaults.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:03.840]   He runs a little video clip that's very famous of Steve Jobs many years ago talking about life and
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.840]   saying, you know, at some point I realized that all the rules, you know, most people just go through
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:14.080]   life going, well, these are the rules. You have a family, you make a little money, you just, you
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:17.840]   know, you go through life. He said, some point I realized all the rules in life are made up by
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.760]   people that are no smarter than me, by which, by the way, in his head, he's thinking you're a
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:27.280]   dumber than me. And I can make up my own rules. And that's what Steve did, by the way.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:33.360]   And sorry, to be fair, these are the sort of proclamations you can make when you already
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:39.440]   have a buttload of money. Yeah, and he's like 25. So, you know, it's easy to think that when you're
[01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:44.480]   young, but but it is a good point that, you know, we kind of just the status quo always wins.
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:53.120]   And so he does propose some new kind of status quo defaults, including free speech. More information
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:58.560]   is better than less information. And the solution to misinformation is to improve our ability to
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:05.360]   tell the difference, not not trying to suppress speech. The second one is the default that the
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.720]   status quo, it should be the default that the status quo is a bad thing. This is going to be
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.400]   against human nature. That's a this is going to be tough. Instead of justifying why something
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:19.280]   should be done, the burden of proof should rest on those who believe things should remain the same.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.400]   And it should be and this is a third one. These will be fairly controversial. I think it should
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.320]   be the default to move fast and value experimentation over perfection.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.560]   Yeah, see that's to me,
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:34.560]   the rubers out on the podcast yelling at him at the same time.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:42.400]   It's a that that's problem. That's a problem because I understand the sentiment. I like this
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:49.360]   the basic sentiment, but that's the sort of that's the sort of position that the technology industry
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:55.440]   hasn't earned yet, because we don't have the representation amongst the core of engineers,
[01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:03.120]   so that when something is being developed, how a technology is going to affect everybody is
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:08.400]   there's an engineer who there's an engineer there who's going to say, no, I know that a lot of people
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.160]   are you're absolutely right. It is a big pain in the butt that you have an address book that
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:19.680]   where contact information keeps going on a date. And I suppose on a whiteboard, it would be wonderful
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.520]   if I could simply have an app that would just go and go look for all public sources to automatically
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:30.560]   go out and find out why this number is out of order and what the correct number for this contact is.
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:36.240]   But speaking as a woman in a city, there's a reason why I don't update. I don't give out my phone
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:43.680]   number to other people. So I do appreciate the idea that if people should have a reason to stop
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:49.920]   something from happening, but nonetheless, we have seen a lot of problems caused by the fact that
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:55.760]   a lot of engineers are being done. The people who are moving fast and breaking things are
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:01.520]   wealthy, wealthy white male developers who are solving problems that are affecting them in the
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:10.000]   San Francisco Bay Area and not even wealthy black men and wealthy black women who are living in
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.400]   the San Francisco Bay Area. So this is, again, good things. It's called privilege. It's a position
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.560]   of privilege. And it's hard when you're in a position of privilege to understand what it's like to be
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:27.440]   normal. There was a really good thread on Twitter the other day from Stephen Deal. I don't know how
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.200]   to pronounce his last name, but he was like, the difference with Facebook is that Google could
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:36.240]   fix its content moderation and stop its military contracts. And it would still be Google and Apple
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:42.880]   could fix its supply chain and fix its pricing, fix its sourcing. It would still be Apple and
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.040]   it was not going to treat its workers better. It could stop self-dealing. It would still be Amazon.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:54.400]   Netflix could stop making Tiger King. It would still be Netflix. But if Facebook stops, what makes
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:01.040]   it egregious is stops being Facebook because their business model is based on promoting and
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:07.680]   feeding us the worst parts of ourselves. Here in Forbes, there was a great article. I think the
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:14.000]   title is WhatsApp, soundly beaten by Apple's stunning new iMessage app. It's Zach Dauffman.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:20.320]   But the really interesting thing is the graphic in here comparing the privacy label for iMessage
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:26.640]   to the privacy label for WhatsApp. And I have to think that consumers when faced with this
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:34.400]   might say, "I'm not sure I want to give up all of that stuff." And WhatsApp says very clearly they
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.800]   share it with Facebook. They collect all this information and they share it with Facebook. So
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:44.480]   I think they said they wouldn't when they were bought. Right. Well, notice the founders are gone,
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:51.760]   long gone. Yankum collected his $30 billion and moved on. But in Brazil and in many countries,
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:57.040]   WhatsApp is just the default. You have to use it. You're not going to look at iMessage no matter
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:04.080]   what. You have to use it. Yeah. Let's see. We were talking about updates, but there is an odd
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:09.920]   thing happening with Google Apps on iOS. Google's been updating them on Android,
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:18.960]   but they haven't updated their apps on iOS in some time. Fast company speculating perhaps
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:26.160]   they don't want to be subject to the privacy labels. If you update your app after December 8th
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:33.440]   of last year and Google hasn't, you have to start publishing that privacy information.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:36.000]   Do you think that's what's going on or is that a conspiracy theory?
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:43.120]   They can't hold up forever. Eventually they have to do it. It's probably timing and it's
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:51.280]   probably messaging. That would be my guess. Either that or maybe we better
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:56.240]   simply make all of our apps web apps from now on. We don't want to have to deal with any rules.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.960]   To me, that's always been the big difference between Google and Facebook is that I can't think
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:05.840]   of a Facebook. Facebook offers me nothing that would make me ever tap that box where Google offers a
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.400]   whole bunch of really useful services. Like their photo app, I don't use it, but I can see why
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:16.240]   somebody would want to use it. I use YouTube, I use Gmail, and I can see why somebody would want
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:21.840]   to use those things. Facebook is not giving me, Google is doing what I want them to do. That is,
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:26.640]   give us your data and we will give you this. We will make it worth it for you because of this.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.480]   And they're able to make that argument. For a lot of people, they win that argument.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.720]   I feel like Facebook doesn't even try. They just think they're entitled to our data and don't have
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:39.600]   to give us anything in return for it. Also, they're being cute about it. Facebook is
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:46.160]   the New York Times and the Washington Post saying, "A character with your root boxes,
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:52.240]   small business, safe, small business." No one's fighting for you, American small business, but
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:57.760]   we have picked up a red banner of revolution. Like, "Oh, wait, no, we're not communist. We're
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:04.160]   testing at Zuckerberg's." There is a small business that a little David that beat Apple Goliath,
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:13.120]   Corellium. They make software that help people find bugs in iOS. And the way they do it is they
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:20.880]   run a iOS emulator that you can use on Windows or Linux so that you can kind of bang on stuff.
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:33.600]   Apple said, "No, that violates our copyright. The judge, in the case, ruled that Corellium's
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:39.600]   creation of virtual iPhones was not a copyright violation, in part because it was designed to help
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:45.680]   improve security for all iPhone users. Corellium, the judge says, isn't creating a competing product.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:54.720]   It's a research tool for a small number of consumers." Apple hasn't said whether they're going to appeal.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:02.480]   They worry, at least they said in the lawsuit, that Corellium's products could be used by bad guys
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:10.560]   to try to find ways to hack iPhones. They say Corellium doesn't care who buys their product,
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:19.120]   which Corellium denied. And the judge agreed. I think it has to appeal. I think a lot of
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.640]   the copyright stuff, people get angry at Apple from all the copyright stuff. They have my understanding
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.880]   of the laws that you have to defend. Even if you lose, you want to lose based on a court decision,
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:31.360]   not because you didn't prosecute it, because part of having a copyright is proving that you've
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:40.480]   been prosecuting it. Right. Is that trademark law? It is true in trademark. I don't know
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:44.960]   if it's true in a copyright. I think that's the Disney clause, why Disney is so vigilant about
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:51.760]   their Mickey Mouse. I don't know if Apple necessarily needed to win this. I think
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.480]   them prosecuting them and losing it is probably the best solution for everybody in this particular
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:02.640]   case. As usual, the bigger the company gets, I think the more important it is that they're not
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:08.720]   satisfied with them simply saying, "You can't do this because we say so." They have to say,
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:13.360]   "You can't do this because actually you brought it in front of a judge and an outside person with
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:18.160]   no particular interest in Apple's success or failure or whims or particulars decided that it
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:24.880]   was okay for us to enforce this." The more that they're forced to debate these things in court,
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:29.040]   the more that argument is going to be part of the discussion whenever they think about
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:32.880]   creating a new policy. Say, "Well, what if we get sued about this? What if the developers don't go
[01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:38.160]   for this? What if the EU decides that this we are basically self-dealing by making the Supreme
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:43.920]   Install app? Should we open this up a little bit further?" The more people sue, I think the
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:50.320]   trolls, but the more actual interested parties can sue about this, the better it is for everybody.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:56.720]   The judge didn't dismiss the case entirely because he said, "Well, the copyright part doesn't hold."
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:03.840]   He said, "The DMCA does prevent circumvention of security measures, and it's possible that
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:11.120]   corollium does violate that." He asked for both sides to submit a status report by January 11th,
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:16.000]   and he will decide at that time how the case proceeds. There is still a part of that case
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.080]   continuing. I just wanted everybody to know I'm using amphetamine right now,
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:30.160]   and I love it. I use amphetamine right now too. I used to use caffeine, but now... Are you dealing
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:36.160]   with Chuck? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but yeah. Amphetamine. So caffeine was a long-standing app that would
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:45.680]   keep your Mac from sleeping, as caffeine does, but actually enjoyed it when a developer,
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:52.640]   William Guffstice Gustafson, said, "Well, you know, I can make something that's even better than
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.320]   caffeine for keeping your Mac awake, and I'll call it amphetamine." He's been selling it on the
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:06.880]   App Store for six years, but you got to notice December 29th threatening to remove the app because
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:13.360]   it was named after an illegal drug. The guideline at issue is 1.4.3, stating apps that
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:18.000]   encourage consumption of tobacco or vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:24.160]   are not permitted on the App Store. I don't think the name, or by the way, the icon, which is a
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:30.080]   little amphetamine pill is encouraging the use of drugs, but I kind of understand.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.440]   It was incompatible with the bake tap, wasn't it? It was causing something with a weird
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:37.760]   intro. In compatible with the bake tap. Oh yeah. I'm just kidding. If you're baked,
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:41.440]   you're right. No, that's a good point. I should have another app for my iPad to bring it
[01:23:41.440 --> 01:23:47.840]   for my Mac, so I can bring it down after using amphetamine. I hope all the people who work at Apple
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:52.160]   who have ADHD and take medication for being able to set them straight on the fact that, no,
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.240]   we take amphetamines twice a day and it's actually very, very good for us.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:01.040]   That's right. That are always. Next question, please. Three different flavors of amphetamine salt.
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:04.720]   Guffstufson tweeted, "Just got off a call with Apple.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.760]   "Appeal accepted, amphetamine will remain in the App Store.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:12.240]   "Thank you all for your comments, opinions, and action. We made all agree, but I'm happy we have
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:17.040]   "the freedom to express ourselves today." So Apple has... The appeal process seems to be working.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:20.000]   Yeah, the announcement was the new deal process. The new deal process seems to be working.
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:26.480]   And by the way, I love amphetamine. I'm using it now because when I go to sleep, the chatroom
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:32.320]   turns off and stuff. While I'm using my Mac on the show... I can't even tell what to talk about.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:40.160]   Obviously, it also becomes a really big problem because amphetamine, it's sort of like if BB
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.600]   edits said, "Well, you're not explaining what BB stands for and it could stand for something naughty,
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:49.360]   "so we're going to force you to change the name of your app." But well, this is what people know
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:56.960]   are at five. Right. It's a big deal. So amphetamine, if it was forced to change the name of its app,
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:00.080]   it's on its level, it would have to start off at ground zero again.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.760]   And by the way, amphetamine is free, but you can buy Guffstiff's in a cup of coffee.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.040]   Apparently, he's not against caffeine.
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:20.400]   Six years, that's been around, which is pretty funny. It's got a lot of nice switches and settings.
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:27.520]   And oh, and by the way, I think it's Apple. Yes, it's M1 compatible.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:32.960]   It's amazing how many of the apps that we really, really rely on are the ones that simply allow
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:39.520]   us to tell this operating system, this hardware, "Please stop trying to help me. Just do exactly what...
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.440]   Don't do that thing that I don't want you to do that you keep thinking you're helping me by
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.160]   doing automatically." And that's one of those apps. You're not my computational parent. Yes.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:54.240]   New member of the Apple Board of Directors, Monica Lozano. She's the president and CEO of
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:26:02.560]   College Futures Foundation. A long time editor and publisher of La Opinion, the largest Spanish
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:09.760]   language newspaper in the US. It's great to have a Latinx board member. She's on the board of BFA
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:17.040]   and Target as well. And I think this is a good diversity move for Apple. And frankly,
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:20.160]   more than diversity, she's really accomplished and interesting.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:25.600]   Percet. A good get. That's the way. Former board member at Disney.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:30.880]   "We were doing affirmative action for Richard White-Guy, who was getting on this unfurly zero
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:34.960]   competition for board seats." Those rich white guys, they don't need it. It's okay.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.480]   There was no competition. They didn't have to earn their seats. They just got it because they
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.400]   were rich white guys. They actually have to solve against competition. What do you have against that?
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:49.920]   What a year 2020 was. One was for app stores, both Google's App Store and Google Play
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:56.800]   soared to record-setting heights. Consumers spent $111 billion globally
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:03.040]   on in-app purchases, subscriptions, and premium apps across both marketplaces. But it was really Apple
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:10.880]   that made the lion's share of the money on this graph. The blue is Apple. The black is Google.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:18.640]   Both had roughly 30% growth. But since Apple started at 55.5 billion,
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:24.400]   30% is $72.3 billion in 2020. This is according to a censored tower.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.320]   That's why everyone wants to make an app store all of a sudden.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.720]   Since there's some good money, there's some good money in the apps.
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:36.880]   You don't have to worry about chamfer angles either. It's just electrons.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:41.120]   There's many electrons out there as you can pick up and put in your basket.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:48.000]   I'm actually really interested because both Fortnite and Google and Microsoft have all
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:54.320]   decided that they can put their streaming gaming services on iOS just by doing it in the browser.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:58.400]   How much money Apple is giving up by doing that? That's ridiculous.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:05.360]   Yeah, but for one thing, Apple can't turn that off because then they really would get an antitrust.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.200]   No, I mean, if they had just had acceptable streaming policies, they could be making a
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.360]   small percentage of that as well. But I'm actually encouraged by this capability. In fact,
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:18.560]   I've been playing with WebAssembly because I'm sure that's what they're doing. It really is
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.640]   amazing what you can do in the browser now because of the support for WebAssembly. It's very...
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:26.960]   And I'm guessing we're going to see WebMettles so that existing
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:32.240]   Apple ecosystem apps would work really well on iOS.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.920]   Wasn't that be cool?
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:42.960]   You wonder how Apple would react if there were coalition of app developers that are in,
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:47.760]   let's say, product lines that Apple distinctly does not approve of, and they decided to create a
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:53.680]   very, very friendly and safe front end to installing these web apps and for discovery of these web apps.
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:29:00.000]   And suddenly, it's not as though these apps were cutting into app store downloads,
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:05.200]   but they were enough of a presence to really move the needle. And suddenly, you suddenly,
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:11.360]   you have people who are on the subway using the kind of apps on the iPhone that Apple does not
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.960]   want the Apple logo to be associated with. Like porn apps, like games that are really,
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:23.040]   really super explicit. You wonder if Apple, in the worst case scenario, isn't creating a problem
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.480]   that in the next few years, they would much rather not be part of.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:32.560]   I was joking before about Google taking all of their Google apps,
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:37.440]   excuse me, their Google office apps and stuff like that and making that into
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:43.280]   web apps that they never have to have any sort of a review process forever.
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:49.040]   But nonetheless, if Facebook decided to do that, if all the social media companies decided to do
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:52.080]   that, if Google decided to do that, Apple might be out.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.120]   You're going to get an Outlook joke right then.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.600]   Oh, I'm about to talk about Outlook, actually. That's an interesting segue.
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.960]   There's going to be a brilliant joke and you step out of it. But that's fine.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:05.600]   Okay, I'm sorry. Let's back it up. My fault, my bad. I'm sorry.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.720]   Joking, joking, joking. I had no joke planned.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.120]   Oh, okay. And we put them on the spot.
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.960]   Probably going to be pretty bad anyway.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.360]   We're going to talk about this tomorrow on Windows Weekly.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:21.600]   But Microsoft has a new version of Outlook they call codenamed
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:28.160]   Monarch, Project Monarch. And it's their one Outlook vision.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:34.640]   They want to make a single Outlook client across the web, PC, and Mac.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:38.560]   This is actually a problem right now because Outlook can mean a lot of different things
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:42.560]   depending on which Outlook you're talking about.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.320]   Power of software.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:52.960]   The project will deliver Outlook as a single product with the same user experiencing code
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:58.400]   based on Windows or Mac, smaller footprint accessible to all users, whether they're free
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:04.080]   Outlook consumers or commercial business customers. This is from Windows Central.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:11.120]   Zach Boughton, who is a very good reporter.
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:14.480]   He says, "I'm told the Apple feature native OS integrations
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.120]   with support for things like offline storage, share targets, notifications, and more.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:26.080]   It's one of Microsoft's goals to make the new Monarch client feel as native to the OS as possible
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:33.040]   while remaining universal. It's not tomorrow. It's probably going to be at the end of 2021.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:38.400]   And it won't replace the mail app and the calendar app on Windows 10 till next year.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.400]   So that means probably not till next year for the Macintosh either.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:46.160]   That's something Microsoft needed to do.
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:49.440]   I hate Outlook.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:55.600]   If they can reinvent it and make it useful, the premise of it is great.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.960]   It's email, calendar, address book all in one.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:03.920]   But isn't it so weird that we're seeing this? I always thought that Android was a really
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:08.240]   un-Google-like product and that they should have brought WebOS and made WebOS the future of their
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:13.440]   like-ry. Oh, they're native platforms because it was such a Google-like web forward thinking
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:18.880]   forward product. And Microsoft was the opposite. They are the native platform builder.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.520]   And now they're doing web apps before what Andy was saying before Google is doing them.
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:27.840]   Yeah, I wonder if it'll be PWA, a progressive web app or something else.
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:31.840]   Sounds like it's not electron. Thank goodness.
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:35.840]   Again, that goes along with this whole web assembly thing.
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.480]   I think we're really getting to a time where the technologies on the web are so powerful now
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:45.760]   available that there really is no reason an app has to be what we think of as a standalone.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:50.560]   You don't need cutting edge perth. Back then, it took me 20 seconds to open a calendar app on
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:54.080]   my WebOS phone. I loved it, but it was 20 seconds to open a calendar app.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:58.480]   And that's no longer the case for a calendar app. No, but WebOS is fast.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:04.640]   WebOS is very fast. Also, given the idea that if you're going to be
[01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:08.880]   giving your email, you're required to have a connection with the internet anyway,
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:14.160]   it really is the ideal sort of fodder for a web app. I do use Outlook as my mail host.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:19.040]   And I initially thought the wall would probably be just using it using like a mail.app with it
[01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:23.520]   because it is an exchange server. And it's a standard that can be supported by third party apps.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:27.760]   But I just found myself liking the web interface so much that actually had to,
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:31.760]   actually had to, after a few months, I had to remind myself, oh, but Andy, you're not downloading
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:37.200]   anything from anything from the server ever. I had to write a script for my server at home to
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:41.760]   make sure that always like downloads the IMAP, excuse me, downloads the exchange mail.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.760]   So I have a local copy of it. Otherwise, it just caches it. It's not a permanent
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.880]   Yeah. Yeah. And if something were to happen, you know, it's something where to happen that would be
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:55.920]   that would be bad. But yeah, this is the sort of stuff I really, really want to see having.
[01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:01.120]   One of my main machines is still a Chromebook. And one of the first things I had to unlearn
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:07.680]   about it is that yes, it can run, you can install native Android apps and run apps locally. But
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:14.240]   that's not the ideal way to run this. And I'm constantly surprised by how much I can get done
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:19.440]   just through what is just simply a Chrome browser window. And it makes you start to think about
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:23.840]   how much overhead are you kind of giving up by having different little code modules for
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:28.560]   for every different app bundles for every single thing that you need. How many problems you're
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:35.600]   creating by always having to keep these different apps up to date. It's there there could be a time
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:41.040]   when the rest of the world kind of catches up to Chromebook to Chrome OS in the sense that a lot
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.960]   of different developers will realize that, well, why are we trying to deploy an entire AAA game to
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:51.360]   every single platform that has to support it? Why don't we just put it up on a stream and just do
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.440]   a really good streaming client that could access it from the server on and on and on again? Because
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:35:01.440]   we've I would not I would not have guessed that Stadia would work as well as it does. But for at
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:07.040]   least for someone who is not an intense gamer such as myself, someone who maybe has $60 to spend
[01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:12.000]   on a good racing game every now and then, but who can't bring himself to spend $500 and to
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:18.080]   throw enough elbows at Walmart to get a top generation game console, it is a damn good solution. So
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:23.760]   don't fall behind by being stuck on desktops apps on the desktop anymore.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:28.320]   I also think it's kind of a harbinger of the future of computing, which I keep talking about,
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:34.960]   but I really feel like streaming server based computing is kind of the future in general. I mean,
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:40.560]   if you could play, you know, Cyberpunk 2077 at a decent frame rate off of Google servers
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:46.480]   on any low and slow device that, you know, running an operating system is the least of it.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:51.840]   There Amazon has added Mac minis Intel Mac minis, but some of the Mac focused
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:59.440]   cloud companies are adding M1 Mac minis now, I think. Yeah. Is it Mac stadium? Yeah. Yeah.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:05.120]   I think that's very interesting too. How long before you just don't you don't buy a Mac,
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:10.960]   you just buy a client, a thin client? No, we drive manual cars here, sir.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:20.320]   No, I have that camera with a call up with a new Raspberry Pi that's all in one.
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.360]   It's an all in one keyboard kind of like a Commodore 64. Yeah. And it went from something
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.880]   that I had to buy because I'm with, I'm like with Raspberry Pi is what what Renee is with
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:35.760]   watch bands. If it exists, I have to own it. And it's gone from something that I wanted to have
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:43.040]   for the library to it is now like in the living room on a on a table as a very, very full featured,
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:47.600]   full-throated computer that I actually do real work on when I don't necessarily want to have to
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:52.640]   pull my laptop out from wherever it is before. It's unique. There is the bare minimum is
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:58.480]   in computing right now can do amazing magical things now. And that's what people, I think it's
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:02.880]   going to change a lot of people's minds once they realize that maybe the minimum buy in for
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:10.480]   computers no longer $1000, even $500. It's $200. It's $250 or it's whatever you pick up from the
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:13.920]   side of the road that I look for. Especially if there's something heavy duty you need to do and
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:19.760]   you can just stream it. You know, you could play Cyberpunk 2077 on that on that Raspberry Pi.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:25.440]   So that's where I really think that we're in it'll probably be a hybrid thing. I'm not saying it's
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:31.680]   going to replace the idea of, you know, a one desktop one CPU. But I, you know, I think in a lot of
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:36.080]   circumstances, certainly in businesses, you don't need to have a CPU on every employee's desktop.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:41.040]   That's great. I mean, he's going to be so happy. Who?
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:48.000]   Scott McMealy. Oh, yeah, he said it, you know, the network is the computer. Yeah. I mean,
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.400]   bring things full circle. I was talking earlier about how a year or two ago, I was thinking if I
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.840]   have to spend two or $3000 on the most powerful desktop in my office, the value proposition is
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.920]   going to be Windows. Now it's actually flipped the other way where I kind of still need to have
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.160]   Windows in here again, because of the work that I do after make sure that I can run
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.600]   capable software. Now it's more like, yeah, I wonder how much of a how much of a Windows
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:17.440]   desktop I can make for $500. Knowing knowing now that even for $500, even if it won't be a gaming
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:22.960]   desktop, but it will still be a very, very capable and in many, it'll be a modern budget PC as
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:29.440]   opposed to a three or four generations old piece of thing that was obsolete by the time I actually
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.120]   put the first layer of thermal paste with my thermal paste applicator.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:36.960]   Right. Well, I was watching that video last night.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:43.200]   Sorry. For most people, I mean, this year, Microsoft's going to start offering Windows
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:49.120]   virtual desktop is one of the reasons I'm not too worried about the loss of bootcamp on M1
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:55.440]   Mac, because if you could stream Windows, that for most people, I don't want to own Windows.
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:59.360]   Maybe there's some times I want to use some Windows stuff streaming. It's fine with me.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:05.280]   You install software over the over network. Most of your files are for most people,
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.920]   a lot of people, your files are in the cloud, your media is in the cloud, now your games are in
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:14.000]   the cloud. It's again, so long as you've, something has a really good efficient one gigabyte
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:22.560]   ethernet port, let alone 10 gigabytes, you're good. As long as it can render graphics really fast,
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:31.600]   you're good. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's all the news that's fit to fit this show. So this would be a
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:39.360]   good time to get ready for our picks of the week. Who should I start with this week? Let's start
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:45.360]   with you, Renee Richie, your pick of the week I'm intrigued. So I've got to, first one is that
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:49.680]   mutual friend often guest on the show, Georgia Dow has finally launched her YouTube channel.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:54.000]   Well, it's about time, Georgia. I know. I don't know why she was lollygagging,
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.360]   but it's a channel where she's going to do psychotherapy tips and tricks. Nice. Did you help
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:04.240]   her set the camera up and everything? It really looks beautiful. Yeah. I did. Her and her family
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:10.080]   helped as well. So we worked on it as a community project with me just giving my advice here and
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.920]   there. Yeah. Yes. Although she made a lot of decisions, her and her husband had a lot of
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.800]   decisions about the lighting and things that were very different than what I suggested. I think
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:21.440]   way smarter. And she's also much better on camera than I am. So I'm anticipating she will get to a
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.720]   million subscribers way before I do. I even just a little bit before I do, but way before I do.
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:33.680]   Live a better life. Georgia Dow now has her own channel on YouTube. Once she gets to a thousand
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:39.440]   subscribers, that's when she can have her own custom URL as a hundred subscribers for a custom
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:44.800]   name and a month. Okay. So you've got more than a hundred. She's got 764 subscribers.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:52.880]   But I suspect she's going to, the month isn't up yet. So I, but I think we'll give you this special
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:41:01.200]   URL. But just for now, just search for Georgia Dow on YouTube psychology, technology life. And I
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:07.440]   see there's also the Apple Talk podcast there as well. We try. We try. Nice. What's the other pick?
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:12.160]   The other thing is I've been collecting SD cards and I didn't have a good place to store them. So I
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:17.200]   got this from PolarPro and it's just a very handy. I wanted something very nice. Like, you know,
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:23.760]   that was sturdy. This is nice. I like the brass. So this has both SD cards and, and what is important
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:29.360]   to me is CF Express cards, which you can get the big old CF Express cards. You can get CF
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:36.320]   CF Express type B cards, which Canon uses and CF Express type A cards, which Sony uses,
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.400]   because why should anybody use the same type of CF cards? That would be silly. That would be ridiculous.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:45.520]   So this case, you can put the SD cards underneath and then the CF
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:51.200]   Express type B cards on top of them. And so I can hold four of each card. They have other
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.840]   kinds too. They have just SD cards and they have other. Yeah, you can get up to 24 cards in the SD card
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.520]   edition. Yeah. That might be the one I end up getting. Yeah, I really like that. And it looks good.
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:06.160]   Looks really pretty. Yeah. I use a soft case right now. I think this is, I think I need this.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:13.040]   From that I had to and just nervous polar polar pro filters dot com.
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.880]   They also make good filters. Yeah. Well, they're kind of known for that. This is cool. Yeah.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:21.600]   They have a little partnership with Peter McKinnon or somebody. I don't know.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:29.440]   Andy and I go pick of the week. I am so embarrassed that last week, our last one before January 1st,
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:35.760]   I forgot to plug the comicbook fonts dot com. They do that every year. I've bought so many fonts
[01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:41.600]   because of you. January 1st. Yeah. And I feel bad about it because it's their entire. They do
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:46.400]   these professional display fonts and handwritten letter fonts. They're still they're still worth
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:51.760]   recommending the but the reason why I was kicking myself because I usually remember to recommend
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:58.400]   them on January 1st because they drop the price of all of their fonts to one penny per year since
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:04.080]   the year of Christ's birth. So so every font was $20 and 21 cents, including the ones that were
[01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:12.240]   $140, including the ones that cost like $15. It's all $20. And so I to sort of make it up for you,
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:16.720]   I'm going to recommend an even better deal on fonts. It's a site called font squirrel.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:21.680]   Font squirrel dot com. This is now there are a lot of different if you do a Google search for free
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:27.280]   fonts, you're going to find a wretched hive of scum and villainy behind almost every link because
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:32.160]   they just get fonts from places and put them up there and then whether they're legal or not.
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:36.800]   Font squirrel does a really, really good job of making sure that the fonts that are inside this
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:42.480]   library are at the very least free for commercial use. So if you're if you want to do a sign,
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.720]   if you want to do a t-shirt, if you want to do a logo, if you want to just print up a letter or
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:50.640]   whatever, that's perfectly fine. You can download the fonts and use them free of charge. Many of them
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:56.800]   are also free for use on the web. Many of them are also free for use on on ebooks. But at the very,
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:02.640]   very least, when you're in a position where you you're trying to create an invitation to like a
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.840]   Harry Potter theme party and you wish you had this sort of spooky sort of display like alchemy
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:14.160]   sort of display font and you're saying, well, maybe if I just take Helvetica and I stretch it this way
[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:18.800]   and I add some spatter to it and it's going to look out lame, but you can go to you can go to
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:24.480]   font squirrel dot com. Look at all their categories for display fonts headings bold. It's it's hand
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:30.640]   drawn fonts. It's retro novelty fonts. They're all really nicely categorized. And then you might find
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:38.560]   there you go. I want this one. Especially it looks like a old ribbon kind of sailing
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:43.600]   typewriter. I love that. Yep. Yep. You can get the things like if you want the Star Wars font,
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:49.920]   you just kind of you can't fake it. You just got to find the star wars. And the and distant galaxy,
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:54.560]   which is free on on fonts girl, not quite as good as what you get on comic book fonts because they
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:45:00.560]   do a lot of that stuff where they're they will it's sort of like the the fake fake fragrance where
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:05.280]   they say it kind of sounds like what it's the commercial variant, but it's just fake enough to
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:10.160]   make you understand what's going on. But it's but it's still very, very, very good. So this is it's
[01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:13.760]   a really good resource. You definitely want to bookmark that and have it in your in your menu
[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:21.120]   because honestly, there's there are very few things that separate like the people. There
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:24.960]   are people in the office men in the office who like wear clip on ties and then there are people
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:30.480]   who know how to actually tie a necktie. And I think that fonts are kind of like the same sort of thing
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:35.680]   where they're the people where again, content matters, the actual words matter. I'm not saying
[01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:40.160]   that it doesn't, but I'm saying that there are people who like they're using Helvetica,
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:44.320]   they're using myriad, they're using like the stuff that came built in like with their operating
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:49.840]   system. But then there are the people that actually found that big heavy marker brush broke one so
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:54.880]   that when they put that thing on the on the sign on the on the on the on the on the on the fridge
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:46:00.160]   in the break room that says there's a reason why I put my labels on my sandwiches so that you have
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:05.200]   no excuse for stealing my sandwiches, stops stealing my sandwiches that you take you take that seriously
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:11.360]   that person actually that was malice of forethought he actually came out and chose the right threatening
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:16.720]   font to put on that he didn't just use Helvetica you better you better be prepared for a mouthful
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.640]   x-lax if you stare if you steal this person's this person's because he has the thinking of a
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:24.480]   ronneland. I risk it from Saturday Night Live it's a pirate skit all over again Andy.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:30.880]   Oh I love these I just like looking at fonts this is a great place just to go and look at fonts.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:36.720]   Especially this on Saturday Live. Excuse me. No I don't remember that I'll have to look for it.
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:41.200]   It's it's Ryan what's his name Ryan Gosling and he sees that they use papyrus for the avatar
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:44.960]   poster and he can't understand why some white human being would do that to another one and
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:51.280]   it destroys his life in like a five minutes. I'm the same way when I when I see people who have like
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:56.160]   like tattoos like across their chest and I don't think that oh you're ruining your life or oh why
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.880]   did you put something like that across your chest I'm like why are you using an all caps display font
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:05.440]   that is why are you using a black letter font and all caps you're not supposed to use all caps in a
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:10.800]   black letter display font and I'm saying oh well actually that person got that in prison he probably
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:14.800]   wasn't thinking about that and also you probably should keep your mouth shut about his choices
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:24.560]   and typography Andy. My pick of the week is the solving a massive problem that we have all been
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.600]   subjected to if you've ever been on a zoom call with somebody who decides to type.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:36.800]   It goes. Sorry. It goes right in the microphone. Are you angry with your keyboard sir?
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:46.880]   Believe it or not there is a new app called Unclack that is designed to mute your mic
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:55.760]   automatically when you're typing and then unmute it when you stop so if you've got that person in your
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:03.360]   life who just can't help themselves they have to type you need unclack.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:11.520]   Is this something you're looking at on a podcast? I don't know you have it started login you can
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:19.200]   customize it even have a six color menu bar icon. It's you know that's pretty much it it's not you
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.760]   know it's not it just does the job it just does the job on clack.
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:28.320]   Sending someone a link to this is like offering someone a breathment. Yeah you're supposed to
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:33.840]   you're supposed to say the message is really clear you're supposed to accept it and accept like the
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:38.800]   they gave you an open door to solve this problem with dignity if you don't accept this. If you don't
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.960]   put the door we marked for you we're going to push you through the most embarrassing door possible.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:47.680]   McIntosh only you got to give it to the windows guys too I'm sure there's something.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:52.080]   Unclack unclack.ad.ad.
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:58.720]   I want to send AJ Coderman like some so I hope he does a kickstart or something for
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:03.280]   a companion app for the people who have the boom mic that's pointed right at one of their nostrils.
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:07.040]   So you can just hear the.
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:15.120]   I'm sorry and by the way you've made me so happy to know that this thing that someone said god
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:19.280]   dang it I had it with a I'm gonna write a piece of free software so I never have to deal with that
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:25.440]   again. And it even has a switch so if you want to type really loudly while you're talking on zoom
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:32.480]   you can you can pause it so that you know you get a chance to express yourself. Unclack.
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:38.880]   Ladies and gentlemen that concludes this thrilling edition of Mac break weekly again next week
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:44.720]   David Pogue will join us. There should be a lot of fun. I kind of like it's just the three of us
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:50.400]   sometimes you know gives us more time to talk and all of that too. I like it. You'll find Renee
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:57.680]   Richie on youtube youtube.com/Renee Richie he also writes for iMOR and others and what is his what
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:06.320]   is his hat say it says something the north. The truth yeah we the north so that's you we the north
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:11.840]   right yes that's the Toronto Raptors I believe in the sports ball in the basket sports ball we
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:19.200]   yeah Toronto Raptors we the north which is interestingly grammatically bizarre but it's not incorrect
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:27.200]   think differently oh yeah think differently we the no there should be a week we comma the north I
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:34.640]   think is I think would fix that we comma we would look ugly and thank you for being here Renee we
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:40.320]   really appreciate it. Thanks Danny and Akko when are you going to be on GBH next hopefully we're
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:46.400]   going to be back to Friday so 1 p.m. as usual so that's Friday at 1 p.m. this week go to wgph news.org
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:52.560]   to listen to it live or to stream it later about three hours afterward. Nice thank you Andrew thank
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:57.840]   you Renee thank you all for joining us we do Mac break weekly every Tuesday morning 11 a.m.
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:04.240]   pacific that's 2 p.m. eastern time 1800 UTC as with everything we do we have a live audio and
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:09.760]   video stream that you can tune into if it's just the behind the scenes making of stream I know it
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:17.440]   looks kind of like the show you know with some exceptions that's a twit.tv/live mostly the exception
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:22.800]   is it's not exact it's on TV channels so it's like exactly at 11 a.m. you know there's stuff we got
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:29.760]   to get ready and do things and stuff like that but if you want to do that twit.tv/live and if you
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:37.920]   are doing that you should probably be in the chat room too because they're watching live IRC.twit.tv
[01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:45.440]   it is time for our twit audience survey we do this every year as a way to we don't want to spy on
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:52.240]   you we don't we and we don't have the ability to spy on you so once a year we like to guess ask
[01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:57.440]   you some basic questions get a little bit of an idea get to know you a little bit better so
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:02.480]   when advertisers say well do you have any men listening we can say yes as a matter of fact that
[01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:09.920]   kind of thing and and people are always very helpful doing this and we really appreciate it
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:19.040]   this year the survey is at twit.tv/survey21 for the 2021 survey it's not a lot of questions
[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:25.760]   if you don't want to answer a question you don't have to sometimes I get people saying well you don't
[01:52:25.760 --> 01:52:31.600]   give me three choices for operating systems and I want three don't worry about it it's not it's not
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:36.480]   that you know just do what you can answer the questions you can as best you can but it is very
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:44.000]   helpful to us so we appreciate it twit.tv/survey21 of course this show and all of our shows are
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:50.320]   podcasts that means they're available on demand audio and video and there are a couple places you
