[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show that covers your Macintosh and Apple stories in obsessive detail.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And this is a good day to do a Mac Break Weekly. Thank you, Apple, for having your events on Tuesday.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Because we've just finished the big Apple October event, joining us to discuss starting all the way to the left, Mr. Renee Ritchie of iMoor.com, who was covering it for iMoor's new events page. Nice to see you, Renee.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Thank you, Leo, for the first time in forever, we cannot say it's a slow news day for Macs.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Well, that's what happens is we have these big announcements. We wait, wait, wait, wait, big announcement.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Also, nice to have Alex Lindsey here. He's the guy everybody wants to talk to about the Mac Pro.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   So we'll be questioning him in detail soon. He's brought a few tablet devices.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So we're talking about what you carry around when you travel. And so I thought I'd pull out of my bag.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   All of the tablets. We use them for a lot of things. So we've got a couple of these little...
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   You've got five phones. These are just iPod touches. Oh, three iPod touches.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And then I have the Droid Max rules. Droid Max battery life. Yeah, battery life. I have my iPhone.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I haven't got the five yet yet. This is the Nexus 7. And there's a mini.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And there's a Maxie. And there's a Maxie. And then there's an air. And an air. And I'm missing one of the air.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It's like the 11 inch, not the 13 inch air.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   No, yeah, if I'm going to go small, I'm going to go all the way small. And then the air.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So small, I go home. Is that your motto? Exactly. And then my retina. But yeah, we use these a lot for displays
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   when we're doing live events. So a lot of times I throw them up. You know, this is like...
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I think I should talk about this before, but these little...
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You know, these little guys. So you'll...
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Yeah, I bought one because of you. I've got a whole like little... Yeah, these are like stands for phones.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You go like this. They're great on flights too. So anyway, but the...
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   You don't have to do the whole demo now. Save it for later. Save it for your pick of the week.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   But that's why I had all those things done. It's nice to have you back. It's going to be back.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And Alex is... I also asked Alex for a toilet recommendation.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And I gave you more detail. I didn't shoot any video though because I think that was appropriate.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   We're getting a total... Washlet. You're going to get 300 or 400.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I'm going 544. Oh. Oh. Oh. That's the one where you got...
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   You got scented air blown at your kuchi. And it's got remote control.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   It's a remote control. Yours doesn't have remote control. No, my son was like...
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   My son brought one of his friends over to show him his...
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Sit on this. No, no, no, no. You're like, "Look at my dad has a toilet that has a remote control."
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Anyway, sorry. Andy, it not comes here. He's sorry.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   He's actually taking advantage of this moment to finish his 3,000 word magnum opus.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It's now up to 3,644. I was saying we had to get it up and not down.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Oh my God. I'm converting. I'm converting. See, the thing is like,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   usually I'm live tweeting my thoughts as I go. And then I realize that, wow, I could actually go away.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   He's typing this into a window and get paid for it. Yeah.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   So now I'm taking essentially what are like 130 tweets and saying, "Oh, some adverbs have really dressed that up nicely, wouldn't it?"
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Also joining us from the Maccast, Adam Christensen's back. Hey, Adam.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So I imagine you were watching with a great interest as well.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I was following along. Yes.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   What do you think? What do I think? I think not a lot of surprises, but some good stuff in there.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   A few surprises too, which is always nice.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   The iPad has been renamed the iPad Air, which is an interesting strategically, an interesting chain.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Yeah, I found it interesting that the room seemed to not know what to do with that information.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Like it was like golf clap or something.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   If you watch the video, the room was baffled much of the time.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   The room was not the usual clack of Apple fans.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It was a kind of, they were all kind of, "Huh?"
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I think they wondered, I think some of them stayed up to watch the Nokia event earlier today.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I don't know what was going on.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It was so very common in several places. It felt a little odd.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   There was some uncomfortableness early on with some of the folks at Tim and a couple people were stumbling a little bit.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Yeah, they didn't feel well rehearsed for some reason or not as well as they usually are anyway.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Not bad, but just different.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Usually they've got this like boom, boom, boom, and there were a few flumfers around.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Does that indicate, do you think that maybe they changed things at the last minute?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Sometimes that happens, right?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Those are really hard.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Used to happen with Steve.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   They are.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I think that I did an actually a really good job that was very demo-heavy.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Especially going back and forth.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I'm afraid I work on these events.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Not this one, but events like this.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You can feel it.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   You just look at it and you just go that.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Every time someone does a demo, we always tighten up.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I wonder that we've read that story in the New York Times.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It's assumed to be a book from a wired editor about the iPhone release in which we mentioned this a couple of weeks ago.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   We found out later that during the iPhone original announcement in 2007, they were engineers sitting in the front row with Scotch.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And every time their portion of the demo went well, it took a shot.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   They were wasted by the end of the demo.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   The demos are white knuckle events in front of lots of people.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Everything went perfectly.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Not a flaw.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   So just a quick, I don't need to probably do a rundown since everybody watching this show by now has probably absorbed everything.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   They started off talking.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   They actually kicked right into it.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   It was an hour and 24 minutes and it was packed as it was last year with almost refreshing almost everything.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   In fact, I could shorten this discussion by saying what they didn't refresh.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   They didn't refresh the mini, much to Alex's disappointment.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   That might show up on the web, though, Leo.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   They just didn't talk about it.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   They didn't talk about it.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   They didn't talk about a 4K display for the new Mac Pro, which seems something that's missing since they did talk a lot about the fact that they can support a 4K display.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   They didn't talk about updates for Final Cut Pro either, even though they have in the past said that the Mac Pro is designed to work with Final Cut in some unspecified way, implying there's a new Final Cut Pro.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   They didn't announce a host of new colored covers, nor were there any type covers.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Those are some of the things that you could speculate about.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   There were no Mac Pros, which I was expecting.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   No, you were no color Mac Pros.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   But they did announce OS X Mavericks will be free.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   That was kind of, maybe not a surprise, but welcome news.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Is there any software that Apple sells now other than Final Cut X that is not free?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Just the Pro apps, like Logic and Aputure.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Right.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Here is, by the way, the are now offering it.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I just went to the App Store, I've been checking this whole time.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   OS X Mavericks, Power to the Desktop, Tour to New Features, OS X Mavericks, Springs Maps, and iBooks to the Mac addresses, Finder, Tabs and Tags, Enhances, Multidisplay, Support.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Very welcome for anybody using multiple plays.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And it's not just free.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   It's free if you have anything going back to Snow Leopard, I think, and on any hardware that supports it.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   You don't have to do that incremental upgrade anymore.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   You're just everyone's getting it for free going back, I think, to the Intel Mac.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That's a benefit for everybody.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Everybody, from developers to end users who won't have to worry about security.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I've started the download.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It is 5.29 gigabytes.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   If Skype suddenly dies for all of you guys, I apologize.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It's my fault.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   A lot of bits.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Wow.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   My advice would be, as we have advised in the past, if you have to put in a multiple machines as I do,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   to download it but not install it immediately, but to extract the installer from it by inspecting
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   the package contents and putting that on a USB key or something like that.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Safari 6.1 for OS X Mountain Line is asking for an update as well.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   I'm not sure why.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   I'll probably ignore that.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   If you don't want to update, they still want you to get all the security patches and stuff for Safari.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Very, very important.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And I think that's the other reason Apple wants to give this away.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Tim Cook early on mentioned that's, what was it, 70% of almost 70% of all iOS users were already on iOS.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Well, and this is a huge advantage when it comes to over Windows and Android is the fact that there's so many,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   is such a unified, now, a unified OS for, you know, when it comes to security, when it comes to software development,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   when it comes to Apple software development, having everybody on the same, you know, mark is real.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Really distinct.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It's one of Apple's advantages.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And I think they are definitely playing to their advantages and away from their weaknesses.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   It's amazing to see that, you know, Google historically subsidizes everything with their services.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Like you get everything for free, but they put ads on it.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Amazon gives you everything for free or, you know, very low cost, but they use content to monetize it.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And Apple's finally letting those hardware profits subsidize all of their stuff.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   So you're getting Mavericks free and iWork free and iLife free on the backs of all their hardware profits.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And it's an interesting model and perhaps a much more competitive one for them.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   That was also a welcome announcement that they are, they've rewritten from the ground up iWork.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Do they say iLife also rewritten from the ground up?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I think they kept on saying it.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And I think that part of that ground up, what they're kind of implying also is that now that the iOS and the,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   your iOS and your OS 10 have the same code or sharing a lot of the same code.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I think that, I think that's what you need to do if you're going to make,
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   if you're going to make the conversion in the next year or two to, to a unified operating system,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   you need to change all of your OS's and, I mean, all your apps.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I think that's what they, in my opinion, that's what they probably do.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   By the way, I'm downloading 7.0.3 on the iPhone.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Now they also push that out.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   It's been, you're not crash.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It's got a lot of stuff in it.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   It's got the i.2.2 chain stuff.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   It's, it fixes a lot of bugs and it offers several new features.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   So this is to go with Mavericks.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Okay.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So, what else?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Mac Pro, December.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   By the way, you can't buy any of the new hardware they announced today.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   You know what, you can't even pre-order it.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   You can't even the Mac Pro's?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I thought they could.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   You could, you could get the Mac Pro's.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   So, but the, what I thought was interesting is the Mac Pro, you still can't spec to see how much it would cost to have whatever you're going to get.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   So you can see what they've set up, but you can't actually go through them, do the spec.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   They did come in with a fairly high price point for the base model, $2,999.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And then one model up, which is only the six cores, $3,399.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   They did mention that.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   $3,999.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   It's on the website.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   It's $1,000 bucks more for the next one.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And so they're still at 12 core, which we would assume is $4,999.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Ah.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Probably, yeah.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   That's my guess.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Ouch.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   You running out to buy one, Adam?
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   A Mac Pro.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   No, that's a little more than, than I need for what I do.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   You know, I'm the audio guy these days.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   It's not too much for anybody.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Everybody should have one of these.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   The price tag's too high.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   They are.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   My credit card's going to get a big dent on it in the next couple of months.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Kind of do for one of those.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   I have the original retina.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   So, yeah.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   That's a year old.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   You're in a half-old now.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Then I realized, too, I'm going to spend about $1,400 probably on iPads if I get one of these.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Ah.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.240]   I'm finally, well, you know, I've been waiting because I have this big, my iPad is my truck
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.080]   version, which is the three because of the four.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.080]   I was like, man.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.440]   Yeah, there wasn't enough reason to go to the four for me.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.000]   But the bigger reason was this stupid 30 pin.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.440]   Like, you know, it just like driving me crazy that I have a 30 pin and everything else.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.360]   So, you can still buy a 30 pin iPad oddly enough.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.360]   Apple is keeping the iPad two around.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.840]   It is the least expensive iPad ever at $2.99.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.360]   It seems odd that they didn't keep the iPad.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.360]   No, no, I think it's a $3.99.
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.360]   Isn't it a $3?
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360]   $2.99 for the two.
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.920]   Oh, it's the mini that's the old mini is $2.99.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.920]   That's right.
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.000]   So $3.99 and it's not the three, not the four, but the two.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   The three wasn't good.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It wasn't good.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   That's good.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.840]   I think that's clearly, that's not for people buying one iPad.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.280]   That's for people who are buying 500 iPads.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.920]   That is, I think, the educational iPad.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.920]   Well, and also Enterprise.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.400]   There's some, I bet you a bunch of companies have committed to, you know, hardware devices
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.400]   that are connected to them.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.840]   A lot of people are using, you know, they have a lot of add-ons that they've built,
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.840]   slide in.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.960]   You go to these companies, a lot of them really have built out around the iPad.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.440]   And I think that for them, and they're probably pretty sensitive about losing that 30 pin.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.760]   But the iPad 3 has a 30 pin, right?
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.760]   It does.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   It does.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.960]   The iPad 3 was not good hardware.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.880]   That GPU could barely push the retina display.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.200]   And if you look at performance, the iPad 2 was, and the iPad 4 were way better at doing
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.400]   almost any GPU-based task in the iPad 3.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.960]   Yeah, because they were only pushing 10, 24 by 7, 68.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.760]   They were a lot lower res.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.120]   Huge retina attacks.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.080]   One thing is very interesting about the new iPad Mini is it is no longer a really a compromise
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.080]   device.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.400]   It includes the same processor as its big brother, a higher pixel per inch than any iPad.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.920]   It's 326 pixels per inch.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.320]   You're really just choosing size now.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.440]   You're saying I want a smaller size.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.920]   Same screen resolution as a 9.7.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.760]   Which I think a lot of us said, I mean, a lot of us were not like, you know, it's not
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.640]   really, it wasn't about price.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.200]   We chose it for size, not for price.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.400]   Battery life's still 10 hours on both devices.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.800]   That's kind of a miracle.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   Does this change, Renee?
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:54.680]   When the iPad Mini came out last year, I was really bemoaning the lack of retina.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.120]   You pointed out that that would be difficult to do at the same price point with the same
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.120]   battery life.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.360]   They did in fact increase the price of the Mini 2 399 now.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.840]   If you look at that diagram that Phil Schiller showed off about the layers that they had
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.880]   to do to make the iPad Air and the same thing had to happen with the iPad Mini, they just
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.480]   couldn't technologically make it last year.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.160]   It was that old saying, you could have retina, you could have light, or you could have 10
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.320]   hours of battery life pick two of them.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.800]   And they chose what they chose, those devices.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.440]   Now they figure out a way to have all three on both devices.
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:30.920]   So exactly what you said, you can choose just the screen size and you get the thin device,
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.360]   the light device, and the 10 hours of battery life.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.800]   It is a miraculous piece of engineering.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   It's an interesting market.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.120]   They're going into Casey Johnston on ours Technica.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.200]   She's a degree in applied physics.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.600]   So she's the right person to put this table together.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.240]   Because during this event putting the table together, comparing different tablets, this
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:57.320]   is the table for the smaller tablets, the iPad Mini tablet, the second generation.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.680]   And it's three quarters of a pound, the heaviest of all of its brethren.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:07.520]   But easily the fastest, probably easily the fastest with the A7.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.560]   We don't know RAM.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:13.440]   It's got the most storage options, including 128 gigabyte storage for people like Alex
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.440]   Lindsey.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.440]   And 256.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:20.400]   Battery life, also very competitive at 10.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.640]   But it is the most expensive comparing it to the Nexus 7 and the Galaxy tabs and the
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.120]   Kindle Fire HDX7, which is the newest of those.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.120]   Good.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.680]   They've improved the camera, acknowledging, in fact, even in their video that people
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.240]   use iPads to take pictures.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.240]   Which is silly.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.240]   Sorry.
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.240]   But even the ads showed it.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240]   It's fine.
[00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.480]   Hey, it's the camera you have, in many cases.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.040]   I don't think the actual optics change.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.360]   I think it's still 5 megapixel.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.880]   But the A7 image signal processor is just so much better than the A5 chip used to be.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.600]   So it would be a good choice then, camera wise.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.400]   And again, that amazing 326 pixels per inch, which even beats the very high-res Nexus
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.280]   7 and Kindle Fire HDX.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.480]   I mean, that is-- I mean, it's only a couple, but it doesn't--
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.680]   Yeah, the same screen is the iPhone 5S.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   Same resolution.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.680]   And same density.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.680]   And same density.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.680]   Right, right, right.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.880]   Bigger resolution, same density.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:17.880]   That's going to look good.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:25.560]   I don't know how much of-- it's going to matter now, but I mean, it's also 64-bit, right?
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   So--
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.560]   I think that's big.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.400]   And they pushed that a number of times, saying that's why we can make, for instance, I work
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.760]   the same across the board.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.560]   What else do we get from 64-bits?
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.880]   Well, typically you say memory allocation, but that doesn't make any difference.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.560]   We don't even know what kind of RAM is in this.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:44.560]   No, it's a double register.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.080]   So you can keep a lot more stuff in the chip without having to go out to RAM, which is basically
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.080]   like-- you know what?
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.080]   You want a lot of RAMs.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.240]   You don't have to go out to disk.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.480]   The same way you want a lot of registers, you don't even have to go out to RAM.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:59.000]   And the ARM V8 architecture is so much better than the V7.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.200]   It's just a cleaner, much better system command tools that you can get a lot more to performance
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.760]   just by having that cleaner.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.600]   I mean, it's sort of like when you went to 64-bit with the iPhone 5S, everything just works better
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   from a developer point of view.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.720]   Yeah, I'm looking for a time movie and I photo and all of the image processing and
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.240]   processing there I think should be a lot better.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.480]   I think the other thing is that this will allow Apple to make a new iPad that has more
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.480]   application RAM.
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.320]   That's really the only thing that I was really, really switched my antenna when I heard about
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:36.680]   64-bit on iOS, that it allows you to multitask, which hopefully will enable Apple to make
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:44.040]   multitasking less painless if they really are making the iPad Air into the professional
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.400]   model for business people who want to get stuff done.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.160]   I hope that that's a nod towards their ability to allow you to do more things better with
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.960]   this thing as opposed to being locked into one window, one task at all times.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.080]   iPad pro rumors, Andy, we should start them now.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.520]   I started them last year.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.120]   I get a dollar every time someone mentions iPad pro.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.120]   No, it just takes that URL.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:09.000]   That was the most interesting thing I think from the entire keynote.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.440]   I think Apple really did loudly make that statement.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.480]   The other thing is that I think this is the first time, we said this during the live coverage,
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.640]   I think this is the first time that Apple has ever talked about the iPad working with
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:29.440]   documents because it says it allows you to work with more documents and allows you to
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.960]   open documents faster.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:37.120]   You're not teaching us to play the piano unless you understand that we will probably be taking
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.920]   this out and editing Microsoft Office stuff on this.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.920]   I have to see how it's going to work.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.800]   The amazing thing was them saying that they have feature parity between the desktop and
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.160]   iOS on iWork.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.160]   That's a huge thing.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:56.960]   It's one of the things, the surface, I think, it's big failure was Microsoft not doing word
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.200]   for touch.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   I keep saying that.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.440]   I think had they done that, they would have gotten a lot more traction than they did.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.160]   Why I think if you look at having iWork being free, having collaboration now available,
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:14.120]   having parity across the platforms, I think it's really a compelling story for maybe not
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:20.840]   large businesses that are still stuck in Word, but a lot of small businesses, I think, smaller
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.400]   schools, that type of thing, I think it's very compelling.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.920]   When they announced iWork collaboration, I pulled a scot-borne.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.800]   I took Google Docs out of my pocket, I threw it on the ground and I stomped on it.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.800]   It's so painful.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   Exactly.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.440]   And it will work on Windows, right?
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.840]   If you use the web browser.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.840]   In the browser.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.840]   Yeah, it works quite well.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:46.280]   Not only that, but I've been using it on a Chromebook that costs 200 bucks and it's not
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.280]   bad at all.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.720]   And I think that the interesting thing will be to see how for organizations that are really
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:58.960]   using it, the real question is how does the document management work in comparison to
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.960]   Google Docs?
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.240]   Because that's part of it is setting up permissions and who's going to be able to do what and
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   all of those things are still things that may not be totally refined in the first round.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.680]   But I think that's going to be important for Apple to pay attention to now that they have
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.160]   collaboration figured out.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.360]   I mean, it's huge jump to be able to do collaboration on a document that you can actually send
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.480]   to a client and be proud of rather than the crud that comes out of Google Docs.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.640]   And we use Google Docs every day, but man, I just don't understand why they didn't.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.480]   It's utilitarian.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.480]   It's very bones.
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.680]   It's like an 1847 of docs.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.840]   You can't set up a 16 by nine in Google's presentation online presentation tool.
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.840]   You can't set up 16 by nine.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:37.480]   You have to like download somebody some third parties template.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.480]   No.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.480]   It's horrible.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.000]   They can be cry Alex.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.560]   It does make keynote very useful.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   If you can create a keynote feature parody, which you haven't had in the past, create a
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.200]   keynote of the desktop and bring it to the eye and just open it on the iPad.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.520]   What I'll be interested to see with keynote is if they go into a position where you can
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:58.520]   actually present remotely or present having multiple people be able to present at the
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   same time with a collaborative mode.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.880]   Because we do most, I mean, a big chunk of what my business is to do collaborative events.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:11.040]   So we have, you know, we have one coming up like nine different cities around the world
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.840]   and being able to have a singular keynote that everybody else, everybody's running from
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.240]   place to place and you're not streaming it.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.240]   It's all local to everyone.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.000]   You know, that's kind of the holy grail of that process.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.480]   And so I think that that's the kind of thing that I think Apple would be hopefully that
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.520]   they're looking at it if they haven't already done it.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.080]   I haven't downloaded it yet.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.800]   So you're watching Mac break weekly.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.560]   We've got Renee Richie from iMore and Alex Lindsey.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.320]   Nice to have you, Andy Inaco and from Maccast, Adam Christensen talking about the big Apple
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   announcement.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.680]   This is Apple News 2 and we'll talk about 703 and what it does on the iPhone and just a
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.480]   little bit also a new job for David Pogue.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.320]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Shutterstock.com.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.720]   We have to update this every time the copy point on how many images it is now over 30
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.800]   million royalty free stock images.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.560]   They added 200,000 this week alone.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.200]   So it's going up and up and up and up.
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.440]   New images all the time.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.280]   So every time you go, you get something new, the best search engine of any of these companies
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.240]   because you can find not only search for nouns, like I don't know, give me a noun, owls.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.960]   I'm going to search for owl pictures.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:25.560]   But you could also search for nouns with modifiers like happy owl, sad owl.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:28.200]   How about because it's Halloween?
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.680]   A scary owl.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.200]   Can we get some scary?
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   That is a good one.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   That's a.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   Ooh, here's spooky owls.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   Ooh.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   Ooh.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.520]   So you never, you have so much fun with Shutterstock.com.

[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.080]   You'll never hear me say that.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   Not spend money, but instead just create a free account because then you can collect
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.040]   images into your light box, share them with colleagues, use it as inspiration.

[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.680]   Don't forget to not only photos, but also illustrations, vector art and video as well.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.360]   1.3 million of the best royalty free stock videos.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.120]   They have feature clips, free clips.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.160]   I want you to visit Shutterstock.com.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.360]   Create that free account.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.200]   Start playing with the light boxes.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.080]   Take a look at the color wheel too.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.400]   You can actually, and this is important for designers, say I want it to be in this color
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.400]   palette.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:29.160]   You can have green scary owls or better than green, you know, whatever, Pantone 3782 or
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.160]   whatever.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.400]   They've got an amazing iPad app, which I bet will look even better and be so sweet
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.920]   on the new iPads, which allows you to search on the go display images during presentations
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.120]   and won a Webby award.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   Just gorgeous.

[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.560]   We thank them so much for their support of MACBreakWeekWeekly.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.320]   I would imagine that a lot of their users, if not the majority, are MAC users and very
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.040]   interested in the MACPro.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.520]   All right.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.240]   So let's, I'm just curious, how many of you will buy an iPad Air?
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.240]   Maybe.
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.240]   That's only because I saved over.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   I don't know.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.240]   I'd be a little bit more interested in the Mac Pro.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.960]   I'd be a little back and forth if I hadn't, but I hadn't.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.880]   I still have a three, so it's a huge jump for me.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.600]   So it's three definites, one maybe and I'm probably going to end up getting the iPad mini
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.080]   with Retin to display.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.640]   How many of you mini with Retin?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.640]   I'll get that one too.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.640]   You too.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640]   You're not going to get Andy.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   No.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.640]   Why thumbs down Andy?
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:03.480]   I have absolutely no need for a mini iPad because I use my iPad as a real computer.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.880]   So if I'm leaving the house with an iPad, it's with a big one.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   You want the big one.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   I want that big editing window.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.640]   I want that big battery.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.160]   For me, the mini is just too cramped.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.640]   The apps that I want to use on it are just no use to me and that's great.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.640]   You're not near sighted enough then because what I do is I just get, I just put it right.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.040]   I take off my glasses.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:26.320]   I put it right here and it's the same angle as, you know, it's the same size as the big
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.320]   one.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.160]   I just have to do it like this.
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.040]   I don't look so good on the, I can do it with the phone.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.720]   Also it means that facial recognition software at the stadiums won't recognize you as the
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.280]   guy who got drunk and dropped his pants in the hole in their second.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.240]   I got a picture of my mini.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.240]   All right.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.240]   Let's see.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:50.000]   Now, now we can also stipulate that let's assume you have infinite money.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.960]   Because I understand that this is starting to add up here.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.200]   We've got a mini with retina.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.160]   We got a iPad Air.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.200]   How about a MacBook Pro with retina?
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   13.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.040]   I kind of like the 13.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   I'm 13.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.840]   They said that 13 is lighter and thinner.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.840]   They didn't say whether the 15 was lighter or thinner yet.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.920]   I haven't had a chance to check.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.920]   15?
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   Anybody?
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.920]   15?
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:15.920]   Alex, we're just going to assume I'm buying everything.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.760]   So the thing is, I just want to make sure that, you know, before I get it.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.760]   I get that.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:19.760]   I get that.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.760]   It's a company.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.760]   You know, so this is, I don't buy anything personally.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.520]   I don't think I own, I don't own anything.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.240]   You know, I just have a company that owns lots of things.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.280]   And so we use this for live production.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.560]   And so the, we're always upgrading our main systems to the fastest, whatever we can.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.120]   But as Renee has pointed out many times, the original MacBook Pro with retina really
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.280]   is underpowered for the amount of pixels it's put in.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.040]   That's been, that's been my complaint about the retina.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.680]   Is that, is that I just felt like they didn't have enough graphics power to push it correctly.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:50.080]   And so I think that now hopefully, hopefully this fixes that and actually makes it a real
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   right now.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.960]   I have the 2011 Thunderbolt and it, 15 and it works great for me.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.600]   So I'm, I, as much as I'd like to upgrade, I don't need to upgrade.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.600]   So I probably won't.
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.280]   I had that one out of my head, that exact computer.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:05.680]   And then I got the retina MacBook Pro and it's like broadband.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.680]   You can't go back.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.680]   It's just one thing.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.520]   I don't want to go forward.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   I don't know.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   I have to see.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.240]   I don't go forward because you can't go back.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.360]   I had, Renee, I had a different experience.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.680]   It's like I, I had a loaner for like about a month and a half, maybe two months.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:26.320]   And whereas I, whereas when I had to send back the 10 inch, the 11 inch MacBook Air, I
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.800]   really felt some abandonment issues.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.960]   I liked the retina display on the MacBook.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960]   I just didn't need it.
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.240]   I mean, this is not something that I'm spending my face, my time with my face close enough
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   to it that I really appreciate it.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.520]   And I'm sort of going through a minor crisis of faith, faith this month after, especially
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:47.840]   after seeing today's announcements because I feel as though I'm going to either, I'm
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.000]   going to need to either buy a brand new iPad because mine is now two or three years old
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.440]   or buy a or keep using the iPad as my iPad, but buy a MacBook Air because now that they've
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.720]   got the house world processors, damn, it's a lot of battery life.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.520]   And that really tips the scales and favor wanting to have this thing.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.000]   And now that the prices have dropped on the retina MacBook Pro though, though, now that
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.280]   and now that it's actually, I think the, the, the, the thinness of this is now so thin
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.960]   that I feel as though it actually makes a difference.
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:22.960]   And so now I'm thinking, geez, do I spend $1,300 on either a MacBook Pro?
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:28.640]   Or a MacBook Air or save some money and just simply get the best iPad Air I can get.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.200]   I today, I can't tell you what direction I'm going to go in.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.760]   I know exactly what you mean.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.560]   For me, it's just raw pixel count because the retina MacBook Pro, it looks great, but
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.840]   you can also put it into that non retina mode.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:44.880]   And then you have so many pixels to do final cut or Photoshop or anything that it's, I
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:46.960]   just can't use anything else anymore.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.200]   But it's that is exactly what Alex said, that retina tax was so high on that device.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.360]   So anytime you try to do anything with windows flying around, you could just go make a cup
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.680]   of coffee.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:59.200]   So I'm looking forward to the new one, especially, I think the 13 inch is going to be amazing
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.320]   because it's really light, really thin.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.880]   It's essentially a retina MacBook Air, which is the machine I've always wanted.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:08.320]   And I have the new air and whenever I get small text, it kind of, I die a little bit
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.520]   inside like with the, the current iPad mini.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.040]   So I think the retina 13 is going to be the sweet spot for me.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:21.760]   I think Apple's entire lineup, both in the iPads and their notebooks has gotten to the
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.400]   point where they're back at that hitting every price point.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.360]   I joked a little bit, in terms of pricing and availability, some consumers are going
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   to be really confused.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.360]   I mean, it's almost going back to just in terms of pricing of models and the slight variations
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.960]   in options to the performance, performance days, not that bad.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:44.280]   But I mean, you get my point, there's so many options like I'm having in mind, do I
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:49.960]   want the iPad mini with the retina display or am I going to get the full size one or
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.680]   am I going to get both or I mean, there's just, they've hit every little hole and every
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.440]   little price point for everybody.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:00.280]   But at the same time for guys like me, there's just slight differences between each one and
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.760]   you got to kind of decide what compromises am I going to make?
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.560]   What, what things am I going to do with it?
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.680]   You have to think long and hard, I think.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.700]   Do we think, Renee, that the, the retina has solved the speed issues that the moving to
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:17.520]   has well, the iris graphics on the lower on the 13 inch and the G force on the higher
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.160]   end 15 inch.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.780]   Is there, we're not, is that going to eliminate that those slowdowns?
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.200]   Yeah, my understanding is that it does the first generation of every retina device has
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.520]   been painful like the iPhone four, the iPad three, the retina MacBook Pro, because Apple
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.100]   is redlining those GPUs.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.260]   They are firing at maximum all the time and that limits what they can do when you start
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:43.000]   adding extra load to them, but like with the a six chip set now the a seven chip set, the
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.480]   Haswell processor, I forget the quad core when I think it's crystal well or something
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.400]   on the on the 15 inch.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.120]   The new Intel chips are just way better at pushing around those pixels and that will
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.960]   take, it'll sort of do in third gear what it was trying to do in fifth or sixth gear
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.320]   and that should make just enough difference for it to become enjoyable again.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:08.700]   I didn't, I'm just gonna say I did not enjoy it before, but you could just be hated.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.700]   No, it was great except for those times you tried to do like expose for instance, or
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.220]   you tried to move a window around sliding hole windows, things like that.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.220]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.780]   There was some tearing and stuff like that.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:24.980]   By the way, I'm only 20 minutes away from Mavericks.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.380]   Very excited about that.
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.380]   It's huge.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.380]   People go HD again.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.060]   My seven oh three has download on the iPhone.
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.680]   They tell me in the chatroom, one of the things I didn't like about iOS seven was all that
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.840]   swimming and whoop, whoop, whoop.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.480]   Although I like that part.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.880]   Yeah, it makes me feel like I'm working harder and I do admit that it's better on a five S where
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.240]   there's enough horsepower to kind of make it more smooth.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.220]   You said it would be Renee, but apparently there is the setting now to turn off motion
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.240]   turns it off completely.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:56.840]   The biggest problem that I had with iOS seven is that it wasn't interruptible.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.940]   I mean, all the icons come flying out like warp space, but on the older version of iOS,
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.740]   the minute you touch the screen, the animation ended or you could start moving things and
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.760]   now they make you wait till the end of the animation.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.620]   And I'm hoping that gets fixed eventually because then it won't matter how long the animation
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.620]   takes.
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.340]   You'll just be able to use it whenever you want to use it.
[00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:14.820]   So what's new in seven oh three?
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.260]   Well, as you mentioned, the key chain now is iCloud.
[00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:18.260]   That's great.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.740]   I feel bad for the folks at one password because but not LastPass.
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.260]   LastPass is goes to other platforms.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.660]   Yeah, we use it across the top.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.660]   So does one password.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.820]   So if you're using more than just Apple stuff, well, not only that for us.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.700]   It's the fact that we use it as an enterprise level.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.700]   So we're sharing.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.740]   I can share passwords with other people in the company without giving them the password.
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.740]   Right.
[00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:39.740]   I think that's great.
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.420]   The biggest problem for me is the master password because as far as I know, iCloud key chain
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.020]   doesn't let you have a pin code or master password.
[00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.860]   And so I just can't use it because I won't give my phone or my computer to somebody who
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.620]   can then access all of my credit cards.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.100]   Suddenly it's all there.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.100]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.260]   Yeah, I want that master password to be like an extra layer of protection between my computer
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.340]   and people who aren't me.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:04.380]   So in the 703 there's an update to the touch ID lock screen.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.860]   I think it's slower to go in a slideshow mode, something like that.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.020]   Wikipedia search and spotlight along with web search and spotlight.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:17.740]   Obviously clearly influenced by Microsoft's new Windows 8.1 search.
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.460]   You're nodding as if I'm not making a joke.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.460]   They check it out.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.860]   That was an iOS 6 and they took it out for no good reason in iOS.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:23.860]   Put it back.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.860]   Put it back.
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:30.580]   So I think the work app improvements accelerometer fixes that people were complaining about the
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.140]   accelerometer in the compass app.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.620]   The compass app being off.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.620]   It's always off.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.620]   Has it ever been accurate?
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:37.620]   No.
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.620]   Okay.
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.620]   Maybe it will be now.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.620]   I always like look at it.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:41.620]   I move my phone around.
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.620]   I'm like, there's a file.
[00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.620]   No way I am not pointing that direction.
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.620]   It's a phone.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:45.820]   Siri and voiceover issues are fixed.
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.660]   Although somebody in the chat room saying that Siri was turned off for him with the update.
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:51.420]   So make sure you check.
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:56.340]   This is the lock screen bug, bold text setting for dial pad.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:02.140]   This is nice thin, sans serif fonts were too little for some people.
[00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:07.620]   Anyway, it's worth always upgrade, right?
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:11.380]   According to Q and X monkey in our chat room, the keychain will now no longer work unless
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.740]   you have a passcode set.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.660]   That makes sense.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.660]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:16.660]   That's what Renee was talking about.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:17.660]   You don't want to have.
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.300]   You should never have anything.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.300]   You should never have anything.
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:27.820]   If you have mail in general, if you have mail activated on any device that is walking around,
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:32.460]   you should have something at least some kind of key code because people, once they get
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:38.100]   into your mail, there's all kinds of bad things that can happen.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.060]   So that's up now and probably should.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:48.100]   You're the one who said don't ever get the first version of any OS update.
[00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.100]   Don't get the test machine.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:54.580]   The second fix, because the first fix introduces new bugs, get the second fix, 702.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.580]   Now we're at 702.
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.580]   If you're in production.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.300]   It's probably okay to go to iOS 7 now, right?
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:04.020]   Well, I went early and I pay the price every once in a while because if you had your iOS 7,
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.340]   like your phone crash, oh, yeah, many times.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.340]   It was great.
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.340]   It was great.
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:11.300]   It was great is that I haven't had time to get mine replaced and so my button doesn't work.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.300]   My little off button.
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.700]   So if it crashes, you just have to run it in a battery.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.700]   No.
[00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:18.460]   There is no way.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.660]   There's no way to reset it without that.
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.660]   Without the two.
[00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:22.660]   You better get a new phone.
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:26.820]   I found that you can burn the battery from 90% to zero with the phone on all the time.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.620]   If you just walk around and go like this, it'll only takes about 20 minutes to get down.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.700]   Apple says they've also fixed the blue screen of death because there was that.
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.180]   I work blue screen of death.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:36.860]   They say they fixed that specifically.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:38.740]   I didn't have that blue screen of death.
[00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:40.860]   I tried.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.020]   I got it to work.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.020]   You could force it.
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:44.020]   Got it to work.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.260]   I really wanted a blue screen on my iPhone.
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.260]   Where's my blue screen?
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:50.500]   You just can't get to it anymore.
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:37:00.820]   So I guess that's pretty much the story on iOS 703 now available for your iPhone.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:01.820]   I presume iPad.
[00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.820]   Is it iPad as well?
[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.820]   I think it would have to be.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:06.820]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.420]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.940]   Somebody's connecting me with a specialist.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.060]   I didn't click anything.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.060]   But I'm...
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.460]   Jatina Maria wants to start chatting and talking to...
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.460]   Hey, Jantina Maria.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.940]   You got to say start chat.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:19.940]   I don't know.
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.940]   Really?
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.940]   Say hi.
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:22.940]   Okay.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:25.060]   I have to tell her on Mac break.
[00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:31.560]   Hey, when will the new Mac Pro ship?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:32.560]   How can I assist you?
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.300]   When will the new Mac Pro ship?
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.660]   Let's see what Jantina Maria says.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.380]   This is probably an invasion of privacy, except she's not an audio person, right?
[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.380]   Maybe.
[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.380]   Maybe she is.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:45.380]   Probably not our last name though.
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.780]   You go to 703, you get the hola, hello.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.900]   Our feeders ain't bone Jew or thing.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.300]   I got to start it over.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.300]   Jumbo.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.300]   What's up with that?
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.300]   That was really nice.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.300]   Yeah, right before the show.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.380]   And I don't know my iCloud ID.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.980]   So you get to the point where you have to put your iCloud ID in.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:01.980]   I can't get to one...
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:03.380]   This is a point update.
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.380]   They shouldn't be a complete...
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.460]   Any time they change iCloud, they make you sign back into it.
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.460]   So this is the iPad of the iCloud keychain stuff.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:11.060]   So you've got to sign back into iCloud.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.340]   You've got to sign back into your Wi-Fi network.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.340]   I mean, it's weird.
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.340]   Update the other updates now.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.260]   Choose a Wi-Fi network.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.260]   Yeah, doomed.
[00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:21.260]   You've got to put in your password.
[00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:24.620]   I got to choose the FBI surveillance fan again.
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.620]   I really do want to...
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.860]   Oh, see, it knows it though.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.340]   So I'm just going to choose it.
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.340]   Oops.
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.580]   It has a check mark.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.700]   Oh, no, it does want the password.
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:35.700]   Why is it?
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.700]   So it's because of the iCloud update.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.700]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.860]   Because it didn't do it for 702, did it?
[00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:40.860]   No.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.820]   And we'll only ask your password if it's not restoring an encrypted backup, which unfortunately
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.060]   the iCloud ones aren't yet.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.380]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.460]   It's not in the question mark.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.780]   It's an exclamation mark.
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:53.780]   Incorrect.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.780]   Oh, God.
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:55.780]   What does she say?
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.340]   I will be more than happy to answer your questions about shipping.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.340]   Cool.
[00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:01.340]   When?
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:07.620]   Will it ship?
[00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.780]   This is a bot.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.740]   Otherwise it wouldn't say that, right?
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:13.060]   A human would say that.
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:17.220]   A human would say, "Oh, yeah, well, I can't tell you or something."
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.460]   It wouldn't say I'll be more than happy to answer that question.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.420]   It'll say December, didn't you watch the keynote?
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.860]   I think I'm talking with a bot.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.780]   Or someone following a very specific instructions.
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.860]   Do you think she's pasting it in?
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.660]   It's got a flow chart.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:37.940]   Yeah, she's searching through her intro.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:38.940]   I don't know.
[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.180]   Why did he ask me that?
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.380]   Is this store help or Mac help?
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:45.180]   I don't even know where I got here.
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.820]   It's apple.com.
[00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:48.660]   Or is it?
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.660]   It just happened.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:51.660]   It's a fishing site.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.140]   They're fishing for Leo's--
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.620]   I did buy the MacBook Pro with Retina 15-inch.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:01.900]   You start asking her non-tech orders, like, what is the temperature in Zimbabwe?
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.900]   What is it like where you are?
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:06.780]   What's the color of the sky in your world?
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.340]   She's really thinking.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.340]   She's like, she's asking for a manager right now.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:14.340]   Er, er.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.580]   Oh.
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.580]   Dot, dot, dot.
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.780]   I'm checking the info here in our Apple Online store.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.460]   Well, I could do that.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.420]   You should tell her that.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.220]   Please allow me just a few more moments.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:29.140]   No, you should respond.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:29.620]   I found it.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.340]   It's December.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.380]   Oh, oh, yeah.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.060]   I just found it.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.660]   Never mind.
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.300]   I'm feeling terrible now.
[00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:38.740]   I would be terrible on one of those prank shows, you know?
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.780]   I feel guilty.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.300]   Dot, dot.
[00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.900]   We totally buried the lead, Leo.
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.540]   Not only is there no touch ID on the iPads, there's no gold option.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.060]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:48.780]   Shock, there's no gold.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.820]   Oh, are you really?
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.020]   Do you really think that Apple's going to have sort of hold up like a big huge tablet
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:56.540]   of the--
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.300]   It's opulence.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.780]   We think opulence.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.780]   Opulence, I think.
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.500]   The only person who would actually be using one of these solid--
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.900]   one of these big gold iPads is the sort of person who wants to walk around with, like,
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.020]   pointy shoes with tassels hanging off the phone.
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:15.380]   But here's the only thing about that is that we made a lot of fun of the gold iPhone on
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.380]   this show.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.900]   And it is the only one I've seen in the wild.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:24.740]   Like literally, the only iPhone 5S that I've seen in the wild is the champagne one.
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.860]   It's the only acceptable option, Alex.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.860]   I understand that.
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.860]   You have only one.
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:29.860]   I don't have one yet.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.860]   I'm busy.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:31.860]   Opulence, I has it.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:32.860]   Yeah, it has it.
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:33.860]   Oh, you OK?
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.860]   There you go.
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:35.860]   It's not that gold.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.820]   That's one of the reasons.
[00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.820]   It's just not that gold.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.820]   It's gorgeous.
[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.820]   You know, it's beautiful.
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:44.380]   It's precious to be with you.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.380]   It's opulent.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.260]   And I use one of those little dinosaurs.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.740]   They're precious.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.980]   And I do like the fingerprint reader.
[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:52.580]   I'm a little-- OK, now here we go.
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.220]   Set up iCloud Keychain.
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.100]   iCloud Keychain, this is new.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:01.940]   Keeps the passwords and credit cards information you save up to date on the devices you approve.
[00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.380]   Information's encrypted and cannot be read by Apple.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.220]   So let's press the setup.
[00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:11.060]   Your security code could be used to set up the keychain on a new device.
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.660]   Use passcode.
[00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.500]   So now it wants my phone number.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.540]   I'm not sure why.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:18.780]   It should have that.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:19.780]   It's your phone.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.420]   It's the same phone I'm using.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.420]   Thank you.
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.140]   And there's a phone number.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.380]   Oh, it's going to send me a text message.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:29.220]   Now it's saying welcome to iPhone.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.300]   Get started.
[00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.940]   Well, that was a very odd experience.
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:35.940]   I'm not sure.
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.460]   Maybe it's going to send me a text message later.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:38.820]   I was thinking about it.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.660]   Working.
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.620]   I do wish they'd had the Touch ID.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.340]   Why do we think they didn't do Touch ID in the new iPads?
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.620]   I think they want to figure it out.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:48.420]   Like you're like, why--
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:49.420]   It's too early.
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:54.100]   Like, let the 5S do its thing for-- and the next version has it really-- you know, they'll
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:58.100]   knock-- why have a whole bunch of people have bugs rather than just the folks with the 5S.
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:58.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.540]   Also, don't they want to keep that component for the pro?
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.540]   But the huge stuff, are you sure?
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:08.900]   They sell so many more iPhones than they do iPads.
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.500]   And if they want to have a bottleneck, don't they want to make sure that they're not causing
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.420]   the bottleneck or they're not coming through on throats there?
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.340]   Because of the iPad.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:16.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:19.820]   That's the only thing I could think of too, is if they just can't make enough sense.
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:21.340]   I'm sure they'd like to.
[00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.580]   Sarah Lane pointed out, once you use the iPhone 5S and you get used to it, you really
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:26.980]   don't want to type in your ID.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.980]   It's just a pain.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:30.100]   It's more of a pain in the butt.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.900]   Oh, hey, Mavericks.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:34.020]   To set up Mavericks, click Continue.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.020]   You're so adventurous.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.380]   Oh, this is so exciting.
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.820]   I've got two updates.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.140]   And one day I'm feeling very updated.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.140]   Updated.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.140]   Did you read that?
[00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.140]   I forgot to read it.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.140]   Oh.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.220]   It's like Christmas and your birthday all wrapped together, Leo.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:52.700]   Are we recommending that people do this, what I'm doing now, which is installing in place?
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.420]   Maybe not while they're on a show, but--
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.420]   Oh, come on.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.060]   It's just never stopped Leo before.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.060]   Never stopped me before.
[00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:04.580]   Trying to install your computer will restart automatically in eight seconds.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.540]   Please check what the chat person said.
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.140]   Oh, I forgot the chat person.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:09.140]   Oh, no.
[00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.900]   Are you still there?
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:11.900]   Not till December.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:12.900]   Great.
[00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:13.900]   Thanks.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:14.900]   Gotta go.
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.900]   Gotta go.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:17.900]   Upgrading.
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:21.540]   I am upgrading to Mavericks.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.540]   To Mavericks.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.540]   Bye.
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.540]   Bye.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.540]   By Gentina Maria.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.540]   You're just waiting for you now.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.220]   OK, now Mavericks wants me.
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:31.940]   Click restart.
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.340]   OK.
[00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:34.340]   Close other applications.
[00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:35.340]   Yes, that's fine.
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:37.140]   Bye, chat room.
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:43.940]   Wow, is this multitasking or what?
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:50.900]   While my computer's rebooting, I'd like to talk to you about huffer.com.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.540]   Maybe by the time the ad's done, Mavericks will be installed.
[00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.180]   I doubt it.
[00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.420]   To finish that, you know, it's like half an hour or two minutes ago.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.620]   It's just like all of a sudden.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.620]   Better bandwidth.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:03.620]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.500]   Huffer.com is the reliable domain name, registration and management service.
[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.500]   It's easy.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:09.500]   It's simple.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.500]   It's no BS.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.380]   They think everyone should be able to take control of their online identity by having
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.060]   their own domain name.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.820]   This is like the one way you can really do it effectively so that your email always
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.500]   goes to that domain.
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:25.060]   You can use Huffer to forward it to Gmail or anywhere else you want.
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:27.140]   And if you decide someday, I don't want to use Gmail.
[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:28.980]   I want to use Joey's mail.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:32.940]   You just change it, but your email address doesn't change because you own that domain.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:33.940]   That's great.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:37.860]   Huffer takes all the hassle out of owning and managing domain names.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   Very easy use.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:43.660]   Friction free, powerful domain management tools.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:45.140]   Clean as you can see on the website.
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.140]   Clean, simple website.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:50.340]   Visit huffer.com/macbreak right now.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.500]   We're going to give you a little discount.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:52.940]   But let me tell you a little bit more about this.
[00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:55.260]   By the way, they now offer Google Apps.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:59.260]   Basically, everything you already love about the full suite of Google's productivity apps,
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.820]   Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, but your domain name.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.020]   So it's like mail.mydomain.com.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.980]   It's awesome.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.180]   You can all, if you have already have the domain name, they can do it too.
[00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.060]   But the nice thing is you get support from Huffer, not Google.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.260]   And Huffer really is good.
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:15.260]   It's good.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.460]   That means that someone is there to answer the phone.
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.220]   Yeah, Google, Python script answers the phone.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.940]   With Huffer, nobody's actually human.
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:26.180]   In fact, the human empowered to help fix what's great about Huffer, they won't put you on
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:28.580]   hold till they solve the problem.
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.580]   I love Hovers.
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:31.460]   That's actually a huge sale point.
[00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:32.460]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.460]   Just like--
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:34.460]   It's the same price.
[00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:35.460]   We use a lot of Google.
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:38.220]   But with support, you can actually call.
[00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.700]   25 gig storage on the Gmail.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:41.940]   30 day free trial.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.700]   So you can cost you nothing to try it.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.860]   Yeah, but once you try it, how do you get out of it?
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:51.860]   You can also, Chris Huffer, his domain registrar, you can register all the big domain names.com.net.org.
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:56.860]   They also have .pro.tv.moby.biz.io.
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:58.420]   That's what I always want.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.420]   I want L.io.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.420]   Then I'd be Leo.
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.220]   I think it's gone.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.220]   There's no EO.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.220]   There's no Estonia.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.860]   Oh, there must be EO somebody somewhere.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   L.E.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.420]   You don't want to get Captain?
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.420]   Leo.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.740]   The port.me is still available.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.740]   So LeoLove.com.
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.300]   For the next 10 seconds.
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.300]   That's available.
[00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.300]   Oh, no.
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.300]   It's $349.
[00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:19.300]   It's a premium.
[00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.580]   Somebody's thinking, Leo will buy this.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:22.580]   I am Laport.com.
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:23.580]   I like that.
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.580]   Or Leo Laportas.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.020]   That's a good one.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.100]   Now, one of the things you might want to look at is going for, if you can't get the
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:34.340]   .com, which you usually can't, you get the .net many times.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:39.300]   That's probably a little bit better than some of the other weirdo ones.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.300]   Like Moby.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:44.300]   I think a lot of people use it to separate their mobile.
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.380]   Yeah, but I don't think, you know, even with Twit.tv, people still ask me.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.380]   Twit.tv.com?
[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.380]   No.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.380]   Twit.tv.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.380]   Right.
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:54.540]   So, and you think they'd know about that one.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.580]   .net is always, of course, available at Hover.com.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.580]   Give them a shot.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.780]   You get 10% off when you use the UFR code MAC break.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.420]   That makes it even more desirable.
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.020]   And their concierge service makes it easy to move your sights to Hover.
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.020]   I did that.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.020]   This is all we use.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:08.020]   I got them off the GoDaddy.
[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.020]   I moved all of mine too.
[00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.020]   It's fantastic.
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.020]   Well, it's Canadian, so you know they're nice.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.020]   Yeah, did you really?
[00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:15.020]   Oh, Hover.
[00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:17.220]   I did too.
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:20.340]   Hover.com/Macbreak and use the UFR code MAC break and you get 10% off.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:25.620]   Well, I got to tell you, the OS X install is just going great here.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.340]   Can you see my screen?
[00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:31.100]   Not that one.
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.060]   I might have to hold it up because it's great for you, but it's not great for me.
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:35.060]   It's a bit of the upstate.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.780]   It doesn't like your monitor input.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.420]   Oh, if I just take the monitor off, maybe that's it.
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:41.620]   Sure, that's all it is.
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.620]   Give it a shot.
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:43.620]   It's getting a little hot.
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.620]   Doesn't like the mirroring.
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:45.620]   Oh, you're right.
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:46.620]   It was the mirroring.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.620]   Because now it's working fine.
[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.300]   You can't see it, but it says 31 minutes to install.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.300]   Just like that.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.300]   So that's what it was.
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.540]   It's going to be the Mac break tech support.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.540]   You are good.
[00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:55.540]   Yeah, you know.
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.180]   Man, I don't think Jatina Maria would have known that.
[00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:58.180]   Like a couple monitors.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:01.420]   Hey, Jatina Maria, what is this thing I'm seeing?
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.460]   So I'm going to leave that off until we're done.
[00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.260]   Or maybe I could put it in now.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.500]   Maybe now it wouldn't confuse it.
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.500]   Maybe.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:09.500]   I bet it would.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.500]   You probably shouldn't have it.
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.420]   Well, it's probably because the OS, the installer doesn't have the--
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.580]   The external screen is too simple.
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:16.580]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:17.580]   Too simple.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:18.580]   Why are you doing this?
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.580]   Why?
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:23.180]   Why are you installing an operating system in the middle of your show?
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.180]   You fool!
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.980]   Well, I don't know.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.900]   You get one person who just wrote 4,600 words during the show.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:30.900]   It is toasted.
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:31.900]   It is in my head.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.540]   It is hands I'm now done.
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:34.540]   OK, now--
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.540]   Wait a minute.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:36.540]   Wait a minute.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:37.540]   You filed?
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.540]   He's been awfully quiet.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.540]   He's good.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:45.140]   All I've heard was-- Ladies and gentlemen, Andy and Aco.
[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.140]   Wow.
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.140]   Round of applause.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.140]   Thank you.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.140]   The multitasker.
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.140]   Called a working writer.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.140]   He's a working writer.
[00:49:52.140 --> 00:49:54.140]   That is awesome.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:58.060]   So, will that be on the website like in minutes?
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:02.660]   They'll probably want to read it through at least once before they click the button.
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.020]   You still have editors.
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.020]   How nice.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.020]   That's pretty nice.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.660]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:13.020]   So I see I'm not going to ask Alex, are you going to buy these?
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.060]   Are you going to buy questions or dumb to ask you?
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:16.060]   Yes.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.060]   How many of the rest of you--
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.060]   How many is it going to buy?
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   Yeah, how many?
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.140]   How many of the rest of you are intrigued by the Mac Pro?
[00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:26.140]   Remember when they nested it at WWDC, all we could think is, God, that's going to be
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:29.020]   expensive and not upgradable.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:35.060]   And why are they concentrating on aesthetics when Pro's couldn't care less what it looks
[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:36.940]   like and just put it under the desk?
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:40.260]   But you know what Pro's maybe have that techno lust thing go on?
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:44.100]   But I think that also what Pro's are looking at, I mean, as a Pro, I kind of, I guess,
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:45.100]   maybe.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.100]   Yeah, you're a pro.
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:48.980]   I think I'm going to go on TV.
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:52.260]   I think for me, when I really got my head around the idea that the reason that it's
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:59.700]   round is not to make it look nice but to centralize the cooling, which greatly reduces the overhead.
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:00.860]   And you saw how quiet it is.
[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:04.700]   It's actually as quiet as the Mac Mini, which means virtually silent.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.100]   I mean, it's under 15 dB.
[00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.100]   I mean, you can't hear it.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:09.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.100 --> 00:51:11.780]   And so I think that there's a lot of-- I mean, we have problems right now with our, you know,
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:15.900]   in our server area in DC where we, you know, have power issues and being able to reduce
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:20.340]   all of those would make a big difference when you have a bunch of computers stacked up.
[00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.420]   So I think that I think that it's pretty compelling.
[00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.420]   It's a compelling machine.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:29.620]   I would also say that contrary to what you're saying, Leo, I think that this is the one
[00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:34.900]   machine that Apple really was free to go nuts on with the styling because Pro's don't care
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.900]   what it looks like.
[00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:40.700]   Slants is not totally impractical to put on a desk and to maybe move around from place
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.700]   to place.
[00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.380]   So long as you deliver the performance, they don't care if it looks like the severed head
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.380]   of a Stell Getty.
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.380]   They'll do it.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:51.500]   So-- and also given that this is not a machine that has to have a screen attached to it,
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:54.500]   I mean, the iMac, this is-- they're done with it.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:58.220]   They can't do anything more with it than it's a flat panel screen.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:01.700]   There's going to be some sort of a base that you might be able to see part of while you're
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.780]   using it.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.940]   That also provides no opportunities for real design flair.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:10.180]   This is a computer where they can make it look like whatever they want to look like.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:15.580]   And they can make that a combination of productive, effective feature design and just making
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:20.060]   it look awesome, just really tickling your response of Apple designs, really, really
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.060]   cool stuff.
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:25.780]   I don't know if Apple's had a chance to do that ever since they created the Swingarm
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.340]   Chrome iMac with a floating screen.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:33.300]   So I think that this is-- I don't think that they would create a stupid looking Mac just
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:35.460]   for the purpose of design flair.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.980]   But I really have to think that part of it was we have an opportunity here to really
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:44.060]   design something that is a complete statement about we're going to not-- we're not going
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:47.140]   to be tied to any previous design or any previous expectation.
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:50.260]   We're going to build what we want to build and show that we're the only company that
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.220]   can make a computer quite this good.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.220]   That's an opportunity.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.220]   Why don't we give you pro computers?
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:59.460]   Well, yeah, and they're not-- you know, pros aren't as cost sensitive so that you can really
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:02.940]   also add all those features that the engineers, of course, want.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.940]   Right.
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:07.860]   I heard an interesting-- a pro I know said something interesting and he said, "I'm even
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:12.940]   considering getting this instead of a new MacBook Pro and then just getting a 15-inch
[00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:15.820]   monitor and having that be my remote setup."
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:16.820]   We--
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:17.820]   Just because it's so small.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:18.820]   We're definitely looking at--
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.620]   You can carry-- you can carry that around.
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:23.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:25.780]   I mean, he does look like a vice photographer.
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:30.740]   He can take his full rig, the full power of everything with him and just a smaller monitor
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.500]   to use on site and then you just-- yeah, I mean--
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:36.620]   Well, there are no moving parts so you don't have to worry about that, right?
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:41.820]   And when you look at what we have to do, what we used to do to take computers to on site
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.220]   to do live streaming or whatever--
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:50.660]   Well, like, I know we had this massive 1650s or 1640s or whatever that had these huge cases
[00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.580]   to put our MacBook Pro's in.
[00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:53.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.180]   Then these retinas came out and we were able to stream from those but they're just on--
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.180]   they're just peaky.
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:58.860]   You know, they're just barely powerful enough.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.980]   So the idea of being able to throw a couple of-- you know, build like this, build three
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:06.580]   or four of them and just slide them into a pocket I think is actually pretty compelling.
[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:10.140]   The minute Apple showed this off on stage, one of our videographers, Martin Rice, started
[00:54:10.140 --> 00:54:13.820]   measuring backpacks because this is going to be the thing he puts in hotel rooms, he said.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.380]   Well, you know, we actually have brought the cheese grater down to CES and it's a pain
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.380]   in the butt.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.380]   Yep.
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.380]   So I guess you're right.
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.020]   It sounds weird but I mean, when you start to really think about it and you think about
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:29.820]   the size and you know, think of some of the cool compartment camera bags and stuff, you
[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:34.140]   can get-- this will actually fit in some of those larger camera gear bags very likely.
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.580]   You're totally fit in my bag.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.460]   I mean, somebody look up how much it weighs.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.380]   Again, Alex, you have to have one-- you have to have two of them on your backpack like
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:43.380]   the rocketeer.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.380]   It's the only accessible.
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.380]   And there.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.380]   I'm there.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.980]   Well, you know, someone else I think, Kai Rock, I think, mentioned that the other one
[00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:54.380]   that was the other round one that was using for heating was the cray.
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.220]   Yeah, it looks like a shrunk cray.
[00:54:56.220 --> 00:55:04.180]   Gray was the one that was a core and a seat, had a pleather seat all the way around.
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.460]   There has to be a kickstarter to like a miniature version of like the salon seat.
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.180]   Just drop over like a ring, use an S&S D card reader or something.
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:16.460]   Well, the funny thing is like, you know, the story is is that when Steve Jobs left Apple,
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:20.460]   he went to-- he went and he's the only person to ever walk-- walked into the crate to buy
[00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:21.460]   a computer.
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:24.140]   And he said he wanted to buy a computer to design his new computer--
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:27.140]   His next-- his next computer.
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:30.340]   And Seymour Cray thought that was really funny because he designed the craze on a Mac.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.340]   Did he really?
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:32.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:33.340]   That was what he said.
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:34.780]   What a great story.
[00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:39.420]   I would really love a clear-- for a kickstarter, a clear cover for the Mac Pro because it looks
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.660]   so good with that cover off.
[00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:43.620]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:49.020]   Or how about like a vinyl, like a vacuum-- a vacuum, like a paint job makes it look like
[00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:52.740]   a big Pringles can.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.700]   So many kickstarter opportunities here.
[00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:55.700]   Or whiskey.
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:57.180]   Deep pants is five kilograms.
[00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.700]   That's 10, 11 pounds.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:02.340]   That's not light.
[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.340]   It's lighter than cheese grater.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.580]   I say a lot lighter than cheese grater.
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:07.380]   No, that's caribou.
[00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:09.580]   Two of them are caribou.
[00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:10.580]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:16.060]   It's actually-- but it is actually lighter than a Macintosh portable.
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:17.060]   That was 16 pounds.
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.060]   Right.
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:19.980]   Well, there you go.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:24.980]   Now where do I find the keychain settings in 703?
[00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.380]   I know I'm jumping all over the place.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.380]   I apologize.
[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.140]   But I'm installing a Mavericks.
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:30.540]   I'm installing 703.
[00:56:30.540 --> 00:56:33.260]   I got to-- you know, so many things to think about.
[00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:34.580]   Where is that keychain here?
[00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.980]   I don't see it.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.940]   Oh, well.
[00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:42.700]   Well, maybe I should get Gentino on the line.
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:44.060]   Hey, you're ahead of me.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:45.700]   I haven't dove in yet.
[00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.860]   Hey, Gentino, where's the keychain?
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.420]   I hear this keychain thing.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:50.420]   What is it?
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.060]   Geez, you answered everything, Nalio.
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:53.060]   Yeah.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:54.620]   How long do I cook my turkey for on Thanksgiving?
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:55.620]   Let's go.
[00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:56.620]   I should have asked her that.
[00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.100]   Hey, how was Canadian Thanksgiving?
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:00.100]   It was fantastic.
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:02.500]   It was during Singleton, so we had a lot of Americans in town.
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:05.140]   And we had to explain to them not only is it in October,
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:07.020]   but it's on a Monday, which was very, very good.
[00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:08.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.420]   And you still have turkey, right?
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:11.340]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.500]   Sure.
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:13.980]   And Brom Lake Duck.
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.140]   I mean, it was quite a feast.
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.140]   Ooh.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:17.060]   Yummy, yummy, yummy.
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:18.460]   It's in the iCloud settings.
[00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:21.500]   iCloud, mail contacts.
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:22.460]   Oh, there it is, keychain.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:24.460]   It's on by default, I guess.
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:25.780]   So let's tap it.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.140]   And all you can do is turn it off or on.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.500]   Not a lot of-- you can't reset the password or anything.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.100]   Just off or on.
[00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:34.180]   There are a lot of extra features.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.380]   But Apple has a very straight line.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:37.100]   Don't wander around.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.140]   We saw that line.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:38.660]   Straight.
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:39.620]   Wasn't that funny?
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:45.140]   Tim Cook showed a road sign with a meandering, crazy road.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.820]   And he said those other guys, obviously,
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:50.180]   pointing to Microsoft's troubles with Windows 8.
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:51.460]   That's very interesting.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:54.820]   Once again, talking about the difference between trying to--
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.220]   there's still Adam and about putting a multi-touch interface
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:58.860]   on a desktop operating system.
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:57:59.360]   Right.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:04.100]   And you've got to admit that so far, the marketplace
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.300]   is proving them to be correct.
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:07.180]   No one has created a compelling version of that
[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.380]   for desktops yet.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:11.420]   Chris Tuttle's pointing out that the internet traffic, according
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:15.340]   to Akamai, is running 66% above normal right now.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.980]   And you know exactly what that is.
[00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.020]   It's not people downloading Windows 8.1.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.420]   I'm almost certain.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:22.220]   New.
[00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:23.060]   There's quite--
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.740]   That's another good thing to point out.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:27.820]   I mean, there's a reason why Apple gets such high adoption
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:30.780]   rates, because they really do remove every barrier,
[00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:33.300]   every obstacle they can possibly put between a user
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.740]   becoming aware of an update, getting access to that update,
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.140]   and then downloading it.
[00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.140]   When I was shocked at how difficult it was to upgrade
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.180]   from Windows 8 to 8.1, because I assume, OK, there
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.780]   is a feature called Windows Update.
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:48.820]   That keeps my thing up to date.
[00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:51.020]   So I'll-- OK, didn't tell me about automatically.
[00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:51.500]   That's OK.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:52.940]   I'll go into this little control, and I'll
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.860]   click it to have a check for updates.
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.780]   And it found an update to some sort of keyboard driver.
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.020]   OK.
[00:58:59.020 --> 00:59:01.220]   So then I flipped to another section.
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:03.980]   I left Metro Land and went into desktop land,
[00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:06.260]   found another version of Windows Update that said, hey,
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:06.780]   good news.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:09.180]   There's a way to add features to your device.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.580]   Just purchase a key and plug it in right here.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.980]   And it's supposed to be a free update.
[00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.900]   And the only way to get it, for me,
[00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:18.660]   was to actually go into Microsoft.com,
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:19.860]   look for the product page.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.500]   There was a link there for the update,
[00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:26.060]   which Glory B launched the Windows Store app
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:27.580]   on the Windows device.
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:29.340]   And gave me the free update that way.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.780]   Compare and contrast to who have a device.
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:33.300]   It tells you, oh, by the way, do you
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:34.540]   want your machine to be better?
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:34.740]   Great.
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:35.460]   Click this button.
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:36.820]   I'll take care of it for you.
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:41.060]   And the fact that goes all the way back to 2007 iMacs,
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:43.420]   it doesn't-- it'd be able to skip to the head of the line.
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:43.820]   Doesn't matter.
[00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:45.700]   You didn't buy the previous three or four.
[00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:46.220]   That's true.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:48.700]   It's simply that you go, that is amazing.
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:50.260]   And not a penny for that.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.540]   Great.
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:53.540]   You know, we've heard from a lot of people,
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:57.100]   or I've heard from a lot of people who, for instance,
[00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.700]   wanted to get the new iPhone and so forth and says,
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.740]   well, you have to have iOS--
[01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:04.980]   I mean, sorry, iTunes 10.
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:07.500]   And then they try to download it and says, well, sorry,
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.980]   you can't download iTunes 10 on Snow Leopard.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:12.620]   I mean, it was a great deal of frustration.
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.980]   And that's all gone now, suddenly.
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:16.100]   You're all in the same way.
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.220]   Well, and I have to say that the whole-- the entire Mac app--
[01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.860]   I mean, the Mac App Store process is--
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.820]   now when I buy apps that aren't on the Mac App Store,
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:27.460]   you just kind of go, oh, this is going to be a pain
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.540]   for the rest of my life.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.900]   You know, I'm like, you know, like,
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.060]   because 90% of the apps on my computer now,
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.620]   except for some really high-end pro ones
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.100]   and a couple weird people in New Mexico,
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.980]   are-- all of them are all on the Mac App Store.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:43.180]   And I have to admit, if I have to compare between two of them
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.100]   that aren't one that isn't one that isn't,
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.180]   the feature set better be great on the one that isn't
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:49.220]   on the Mac App Store because it's such a pain.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:51.500]   I should point out, some of the disjoint you had, Andy,
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.980]   was because you were trying to do it the Windows way.
[01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.460]   And Microsoft has basically shifted to the Apple's way
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.620]   where it's in the App Store.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:00.620]   And you go to the App Store, there's a big announcement.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:03.860]   Here's Windows 8.1, a free upgrade.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.340]   So--
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.660]   The software update on the Mac will still send you
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:06.340]   to the store where--
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:07.180]   It'll still let you know.
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.660]   --it didn't send me to the store.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.100]   You have to go look for it.
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.420]   To me, it's that if there is a place that says,
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.660]   click here to get updates to your machine.
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:16.460]   That should find updates to the machine.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.380]   No, I agree.
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:19.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.220]   It seems logical.
[01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.140]   That's crazy.
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:22.940]   That's crazy, John.
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:27.220]   Microsoft and Logic often don't really kind of remember that.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:27.980]   We had our windows.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:29.580]   That's by far the biggest difficulty
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.300]   of having an office that has both Macs and Windows devices
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.300]   in it.
[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:34.900]   If there's something that I need to do on Windows,
[01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:37.540]   I almost have to set that for a special day
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:41.540]   where I don't even touch a Macintosh because I will inflict
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:43.940]   an expectation of simplicity upon Windows
[01:01:43.940 --> 01:01:46.460]   that Windows never promised me it was going to deliver.
[01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:47.740]   That's unfair of me.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:50.420]   Well, and if you had a, for instance, as Tom Merritt did,
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:55.180]   the Surface RT running Windows 8 and tried to update
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.900]   to Windows 8.1, suddenly you had a useless brick.
[01:01:58.900 --> 01:01:59.980]   They fixed that problem.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:03.020]   But for a while, they pulled the Surface RT update
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.900]   because it was breaking machines.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.060]   I think that's a pretty serious.
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.660]   It was breaking their own first party machine, which is?
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:10.500]   Their machine.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.020]   Right.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:12.180]   That's some random hardware.
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.300]   Their machine.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:15.300]   Even when they control the entire widget,
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:17.740]   that's not a widget that you want to do whatever
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:18.460]   you do widgets with.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.900]   Well, and contrast that to, here I am installing OS 10 Mavericks
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.580]   during the show.
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:24.660]   We're down to four minutes.
[01:02:24.660 --> 01:02:26.340]   We haven't proven that I was going to work yet.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.260]   That's true.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:29.540]   I don't want to go with right here.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.460]   I would not comment.
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:31.460]   It's all I'm saying.
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.620]   Yeah, I don't want to be too cocky.
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.740]   Have you gone to the McKee Story Conference
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:38.540]   because you have brilliantly put in the ticking clock
[01:02:38.540 --> 01:02:40.340]   that will keep audiences riveted?
[01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:44.260]   I feel like I'm an episode of 24 here.
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.820]   And we're going to tell you how this turned out
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:46.660]   right after the next break.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:47.900]   Before you restart.
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:52.940]   What else did we learn?
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.020]   New new I work I'm thrilled about.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.380]   Is it going to be updated?
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:00.020]   Because what this said is I'm getting I life 11.
[01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.820]   So I don't know.
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:03.300]   It is.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.980]   It comes with drummers.
[01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:06.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:08.260]   Yeah, there's new features and they got new skins.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:08.700]   OK.
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:10.620]   And come all the drummers.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.580]   All six people need it.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.020]   Kyle.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.020]   Go ahead, Adam.
[01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.220]   I said, I think they're all 64 bit on iOS.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:19.420]   So they've all been optimized for the new A7 processor,
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.380]   which did help.
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.380]   That's awesome.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.180]   I kind of see that.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.340]   That was a lot more tracks.
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.340]   Sure.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.180]   Yeah, that was an impressive demo of the GarageBand.
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:27.980]   You got to be drummer.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.140]   No, your own personal drummer built in.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.780]   You know, I know everyone's making fun of it,
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:35.740]   but there's an awful lot of school presentations
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.580]   and corporate presentations.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:37.380]   And the drummer would be great.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.300]   You know, but just having general like things
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:40.620]   that will kind of build, I think we're going to see.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:42.380]   I don't know if there's more of that on GarageBand,
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:46.180]   but I know that I have made a lot of corporate music
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.740]   on GarageBand.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:48.260]   Right.
[01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:48.940]   A lot.
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:51.540]   So it really is a great way.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.260]   Like you get a client that just wants--
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.540]   they just want something that sounds like something else.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:57.580]   And you just kind of get something kind of close.
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.700]   And they're very happy to have that in the back of their video
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:02.260]   rather than you buy a needle drop that sounds like crap
[01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:03.620]   for $1,000, you know.
[01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:05.380]   So make your own needle drop.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.580]   Exactly.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:08.060]   And usually in 15, 20 minutes, you
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:09.980]   can get something that clients are really excited about.
[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.820]   I'm also thrilled that I can use my slow motion video
[01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:14.860]   from my 5S now on--
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.140]   That's my actual iOS device.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:17.140]   And I can see it.
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:19.580]   And slow it down even more.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.100]   Or you can see that.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:23.980]   You did point out something, though, that I was disappointed.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:26.100]   I was really sort of expecting Apple
[01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.420]   to give us more of a demo of, here's
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.780]   the love that we're going to be putting into the iOS versions
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.500]   of iOS work.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.660]   Here's the love we're putting into the iOS--
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.420]   I'm sorry, the macOS versions of iOS work.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:37.300]   Here's the love we're putting into the macOS versions
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:38.260]   of iLife.
[01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.020]   They sort of mentioned, oh, and we flattened this out.
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:44.740]   Oh, but here's what we've done to the iOS version of GarageBand.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:48.460]   It's like if you keep expecting to see a lot of support
[01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:52.940]   for you as a macOS user, it's almost as if Apple doesn't--
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:56.140]   Apple still seems to be highlighting
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:59.620]   the efficacy and the importance of iOS and iOS devices
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:00.460]   over macOS.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:03.820]   I think I really want to see a great new version of Aputure.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.860]   I really want to see a great new version of iPhoto.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.180]   And I just wasn't seeing it there.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:10.820]   I was surprised that they put that kind of a focus on iOS today.
[01:05:10.820 --> 01:05:12.900]   Well, the on-show offer pages when they show us
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.780]   the art text, right?
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:15.860]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:17.020]   Word art, we call it.
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.420]   Word art, yeah, that's called.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.700]   And they had any kid do it in a constant word art.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:22.300]   Yeah, but I still think--
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:24.540]   I think the point of that is really what they were--
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:24.860]   I mean--
[01:05:24.860 --> 01:05:26.740]   --exclusionally showing was that we can do something
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:27.700]   that Google Docs can't.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.100]   But that's because you knew what to look for.
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.700]   Everybody else was looking at the bad Word art going.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.300]   Because they're correct.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:33.700]   Really?
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.860]   That's the feature they want to highlight.
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.740]   You know, where is the--
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:40.260]   is it beveled with an inner glow?
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:40.940]   Ooh.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.140]   It is you.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.140]   It is.
[01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:48.220]   And at the same time, it wasn't a little bit disappointing
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:52.660]   to see that we saw the first version of iWork
[01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:55.740]   for the web well before we saw the next version of iWork
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.900]   for Mac OS.
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:58.540]   And so, of course, we look at this.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.060]   OK, it's a very, very flattened version
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:02.340]   where they put all the control panels and all the settings
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:04.420]   things and all the toolbars inside one window.
[01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.300]   Because, of course, they have to because it's a web browser.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.380]   But, yeah, I wonder what we're going to see when they really
[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:10.020]   do revitalize iWork.
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:12.380]   And I haven't used the new version of iWork yet.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:15.020]   But initially, I have to be disappointed that they made it
[01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:16.460]   look like the web version.
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:17.380]   Or at least they--
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.940]   I hope they didn't simply say, well, we have to make this
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:21.940]   so that we have a web component of it
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:25.660]   so that people can use these apps outside of the Apple
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:26.460]   ecosystem.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:28.420]   And then they simply said, OK, well, what do we have to do
[01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:31.060]   to the desktop version to give it parity with the web version?
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.580]   I hope they didn't do that.
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.780]   And I hope that this is as easy to use and as comfortable
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.780]   to use as the previous edition is.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:42.140]   But I'm not a big fan of everything in one window user
[01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:42.660]   interfaces.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.420]   I mean, sometimes you have things on multiple screens.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.260]   You have a use case that you really can't predict.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.020]   So we'll see.
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:53.020]   But I have to admit that that's on my list of, oh, dear,
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:55.100]   things to check out carefully when I get my hands on the
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:55.860]   actual code.
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.580]   I was pleased, though, and I mentioned this during our
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.140]   broadcast, that they didn't go full screen on many of the
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.540]   apps that they showed that this is on a desktop.
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:05.260]   In fact, I was really pleased they kicked things off with
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:07.260]   Macintosh.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:08.500]   I think there was a clear message there.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.580]   We're not abandoning computers as successful as we've been
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.140]   with mobile.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.980]   We are not abandoning Macintosh.
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:17.460]   I still think the reason they did that was to hold the
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:19.980]   press before they talked about it.
[01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:22.380]   Force them the year about the Macintosh.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.580]   Because I think that--
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:26.260]   You know, you're here for the iPad, so just hold on.
[01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:27.580]   We got an hour's worth of crafts.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.420]   The opening band, I'm telling you.
[01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:30.300]   I think--
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.860]   At least it's on stage.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:34.220]   At least they didn't do what they've done a lot of times,
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.580]   which is just update all the hardware, update the software,
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:37.900]   not do an announcement.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.900]   So they definitely-- it was great that they included it.
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:43.820]   It could have been a much shorter event and just done iOS
[01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:44.140]   stuff.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.220]   So I think that that's great.
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.540]   But I do think that that was the opening band.
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:49.340]   They made a very big ecosystem play out of it.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.740]   Not only did they show I work across all the platforms in
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.380]   the web, but they have iMovie.
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:55.140]   They did announce new features for everything.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.300]   So for example, all the stuff that used to be in the cards
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.900]   app is in iPhoto now.
[01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:00.340]   iMovie has iMovie theaters.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:03.100]   When you save your movies, it goes not only on your Mac, but
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.740]   on your iPhone.
[01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:05.500]   You can watch it.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.540]   I hope that doesn't count against your iCloud storage,
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:09.140]   because that'll go really fast.
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:11.700]   But they did announce that you have all these new features.
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:15.300]   Even iPhoto, I think the new Photos app on iOS was made by
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.780]   the color team that Apple bought.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:20.620]   But the new iPhoto app, they had new views for the photos.
[01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:22.780]   Everything sort of got--
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:26.060]   not just a visual refresh, but got several key features.
[01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:29.060]   Physics in the keynotes, you can now put physics in your
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:30.180]   slide transitions.
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.220]   And there's new templates for numbers.
[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.420]   So everything did get a nice little bump as well.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:38.660]   And I think iPhoto, either Aputure or iPhoto--
[01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:40.700]   I think that within the next two years, I think we might see
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:44.660]   Apple really look at the Photoshop market as a viable
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.260]   market for them to not try to replace Photoshop, but to
[01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:51.220]   start aggressively adding more editing features that they
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.220]   haven't added up until now.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.340]   I think that at some point, they're going to use that.
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:59.700]   I mean, they could take a lot of that business away, especially
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.780]   if they're giving it away for free.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:04.340]   There was also, I think, every single major section contained
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:08.900]   either an explicit or explicit subsection or just even a
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:11.220]   nod to, this is the Apple ecosystem.
[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:12.820]   This is how we've got the--
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:16.540]   we're giving you hardware features by expanding the
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:17.660]   software, not the hardware.
[01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:19.300]   So we're giving those things for free.
[01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:21.740]   And they talked about iPad.
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.740]   I wouldn't call it suspiciously long, but I thought it was
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:26.100]   interesting that they spent so much time at the very, very
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:30.020]   top selling us once again on the importance of the iPad and
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.500]   the validity of the iPad, which is, me, look around you.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.100]   You don't see people--
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:36.860]   this is something I didn't really realize until I was
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:40.620]   writing this in my coverage-- that I have seen people in
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:45.420]   Boston, tourists in Boston, using Blackberry Playbooks.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.020]   I swear to God, at least twice.
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.340]   I've seen people using Blackberry Playbooks.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:50.500]   They're not even--
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.660]   The MIT flea market?
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:55.500]   No, I'll tell you exactly where.
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:59.420]   In Copley Square, facing Trangy Pitcher Trinity Church,
[01:09:59.420 --> 01:10:00.940]   and in the public garden in front of the
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.460]   Stattoo George Washington.
[01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.220]   So I can--
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:05.140]   Exactly.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:10.660]   But I have never once, not once, seen anybody in the
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:14.460]   real world using a Samsung tablet, not once.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:17.180]   I've seen Galaxy Notes all over the place, of course,
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.580]   regular phones all over the place.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:21.540]   I have never seen a 10-inch tab or even a smaller tab out
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:22.060]   there.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.700]   So I thought it was kind of interesting that Apple spent
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:27.180]   Tim Cook personally would come out and say, here is the
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:28.740]   case we're making for the iPad.
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.180]   Here's why it's so important.
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.260]   And here's why they didn't say this.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:34.740]   But I think the message was, here's why this is still the
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.980]   only real tablet that's out there.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:37.780]   And it really was.
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:38.780]   I repeated that message.
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.780]   We don't just create hardware.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:41.780]   We don't just create software.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:43.820]   We don't just create services.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:46.260]   When we create the sun, we create the earth.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:48.060]   We create the atmosphere between these three.
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:50.380]   We are the only company that can control the weather for
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.500]   each and every one of our users.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:52.140]   And come on in.
[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.460]   It's sunny.
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.380]   Well, then they have a challenge, because they have to face
[01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.260]   companies like Amazon and Google that can give them
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:00.500]   a better way, because they make money on the back end.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.980]   And so Apple has to have something.
[01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:07.180]   Hey, speaking of the playbook, BBM is out on the iPhone.
[01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.340]   Hey, this is a pretty exciting day for me.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.220]   I can use--
[01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:14.460]   well, yes, send me push notifications, by all means.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.420]   Can we send pins, Leo?
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.340]   Pardon me?
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.180]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.420]   That's the only problem.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:24.700]   I need to know your PIN, your BlackBerry ID.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.620]   Does that make it more secure?
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.660]   Mail me and ask for it, but it's really tedious.
[01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.660]   Who would you--
[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.780]   and yet millions have downloaded it, according to the stories.
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:36.900]   So I'm going to give them my email address, because you know
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:38.020]   what?
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:40.540]   I got to get in line to use BlackBerry Messenger.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:41.140]   Yeah, sure.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.180]   You can download it, but--
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.500]   My absolute favorite thing is their implementation of
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:46.580]   push notifications.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.940]   I'm going to show you, because they're brilliant.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.340]   Here, this is the implementation of push notifications
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.300]   for group messaging.
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:55.580]   Let's see here.
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:00.580]   So it shows you the first two characters of every message.
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:01.580]   That's it?
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:05.580]   Oh, man, that's useless.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.580]   So--
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:07.580]   No.
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.660]   --W-I-N-A-S.
[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:12.100]   Well, I think I know which message I want to read,
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.220]   and I couldn't even share this message in a group chat.
[01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.940]   I mean, that screenshot in a group chat.
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.180]   Sorry, not interested.
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:21.260]   When you've reached the front of the line,
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.180]   you'll receive an email telling you,
[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:29.500]   you-- this is so-- I feel like the 1990s have come back.
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:30.740]   What does that say?
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:32.100]   Is this the interface?
[01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:33.100]   That's a group message.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:33.540]   Let's see.
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:35.300]   Can you show it?
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:38.100]   Well--
[01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:39.700]   And once the keyboard comes up, it is never
[01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:40.940]   not ever going away.
[01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.820]   Oh, no.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:46.660]   That doesn't use the gestures that they put into BlackBerry 10?
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:50.700]   So originally, it was not compiled to run on iOS 7,
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.020]   but when it failed to launch last month,
[01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.500]   they recompiled it for iOS 7.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:58.180]   So yeah, you have the sidebar, and you have the iOS 7 keyboard
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:12:59.740]   now.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:01.700]   But it's clearly--
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:04.580]   Andy, if you have tried using an Android app on BB10,
[01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:06.940]   you know what it's like to use a BB10 app on iOS.
[01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:11.700]   All right, enough of that.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.220]   Enough of that.
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:12.900]   I don't want to be down.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.220]   I mean, it's nice that they did it.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:15.420]   It's just--
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:17.100]   I'm surprised how many people are downloading it.
[01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.500]   It must be all teenagers, right?
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.220]   I just think it's nice that the young men and women
[01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:22.820]   of that company are still plugging away.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.620]   At least, you know when potential investors are coming in
[01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:30.500]   for a tour, because that's the day they have to look busy.
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:31.340]   And what do you know?
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.980]   After random typing, they actually made an iOS client for BBM.
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.620]   They decided to actually release it.
[01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:37.180]   The last person to leave the building,
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.940]   please switch off BlackBerry Messenger.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.580]   Thank you.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:42.500]   It's hugely popular in Sri Lanka, Leo.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:43.180]   Sri Lanka.
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.660]   Oh, I'm restarting.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:47.300]   I'm going to take a break when we come back.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.060]   Mavericks first boot.
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:50.620]   Woo-hoo.
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:51.860]   We'll see if it worked.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.460]   By the way, that last minute is like eight minutes long.
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.220]   Yes, that is.
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.820]   It was fast and unexpected.
[01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:58.460]   But boy, it says I'll be done in a minute.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:01.500]   And it's longer than one of Leo's commercials.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:05.780]   Now I have to wait seven minutes to complete the installation.
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.380]   It's time for the--
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.900]   What was it doing before?
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:10.140]   It was-- what was it doing before?
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:16.180]   My question exactly is now completing the installation.
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:17.460]   Let's make-- this is very stressful,
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:19.220]   because an operating system installer
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.780]   could go horrendously wrong.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.780]   Yes.
[01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:23.300]   Yes.
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:24.940]   Seems like the type has gotten smaller.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:26.060]   And is that the logo now?
[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.220]   Because it's very plain.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:29.300]   It's like the iOS 7.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:30.340]   This is more.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.060]   Very plain.
[01:14:31.060 --> 01:14:31.580]   Well, it's an X.
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.140]   Johnny Ives has just gone, you know.
[01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.780]   Oh, at least you're seeing a color gradient.
[01:14:35.780 --> 01:14:36.900]   Oh, yeah, I can see it now.
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:37.460]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.300]   If you look carefully--
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.180]   It's a lot of depth in there.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.100]   It's 2D, but it's--
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.260]   Nothing there.
[01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:42.900]   There's some like, ocean.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.420]   The never-wrenched--
[01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:43.740]   The never-wrenched--
[01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:44.660]   Until the color white.
[01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:47.300]   But you have to really zoom in.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.700]   Our show today brought to you by 99 designs.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.220]   The world's largest design, marketplace.
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.020]   Look, you know, you can't do everything.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:57.100]   We've all got our own set of skills.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:00.260]   And some of us can talk for a living.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:02.180]   Some can program for a living.
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.060]   Some can cook.
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.220]   Great chefs.
[01:15:05.220 --> 01:15:07.100]   Not everybody can design.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:08.740]   There's a lot of people who shouldn't.
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:09.180]   No.
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:09.660]   No.
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:10.660]   You can't don't.
[01:15:10.660 --> 01:15:12.380]   I have huge respect for designers.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:13.180]   I'm not--
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.020]   And I think I don't work on my car.
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:15.420]   Right.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:16.900]   So, you know, I get somebody to do that.
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:21.340]   So if you're going to do something that needs to look good,
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:22.140]   get a designer.
[01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.380]   And the best place to go, the biggest marketplace
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.500]   of designers, a quarter of a million designers,

[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:34.540]   I'm going to so try this.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.140]   I'm not actually familiar with this.
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.820]   I once designed my own business card.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:39.580]   Oh, man, was it ugly.
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.700]   I should bring it in, because it still have them.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.340]   A lot of them.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:44.260]   I was too embarrassed to give it out.
[01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:44.860]   T-shirt.
[01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:46.260]   We've done T-shirt design there, and it
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:47.780]   got great designs.

[01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:25.340]   I mentioned chefs, your menu should look as good as your cooking.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:26.660]   Don't design your own menus.

[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:11.300]   Anyway, great stuff.
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:12.620]   We don't have to go there.
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.220]   You go there.
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:19.300]   99designs.com/mbw.
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.540]   So four minutes remaining to my Mavericks.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:22.540]   So I had to--
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:27.460]   Can I take one moment to say my 4,600 word news item
[01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:30.980]   has just gone live on Great Chicago from the Sun Times.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:34.060]   You can tell me that editor read every word.
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.820]   I'm sure that everyone was fact checked and everything
[01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:37.900]   like that.
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:40.500]   I'm sure there's probably nothing to worry about.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.940]   If you go to Chicago--
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.940]   If you go to Chicagogrid.com, I think
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:46.140]   is now the feature story up there.
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:48.100]   That is awesome, Andy.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:52.820]   We have watched journalism actual happen on this show.
[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:53.540]   Exactly.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:55.900]   This is like American Chopper, where you can actually
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:00.140]   see them build the bike and argue and throw things.
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.500]   That's so cool.
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.220]   Chicagogrid.com.
[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:04.820]   That's their business.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.060]   That's the Sun Times business site.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.260]   That's awesome.
[01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:10.420]   Very, very awesome.
[01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:11.340]   There you go.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:13.260]   I guess, see.
[01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:14.580]   And wow.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:17.020]   Who needs brevity?
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:18.300]   4,600 words.
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.340]   So it's sort of--
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:21.340]   If you don't have time to watch the entire video--
[01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:22.860]   He's a feature lister.
[01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:27.940]   It's a play-by-play of writing as the keynote was going on.
[01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:30.980]   So pretty much has pretty much every detail and also
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:32.660]   observations as I go.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:34.300]   Hey, let's all go to the site and crash it.
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:37.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:37.300 --> 01:18:39.100]   That'll help with contract negotiations.
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:43.300]   You know, I'm sorry to be sending so much traffic to your site.
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.340]   Everyone go to the-- what is it?
[01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:45.220]   Chicagogrid?
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.180]   Chicagogrid.com.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.100]   Everybody right now.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:47.600]   Right now.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:50.220]   And then go immediately go to Andy's article.
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:51.860]   So they know that's what drove the traffic.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:52.660]   Yes.
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:55.540]   I hit refresh seven seconds ago, and it's not responsible.
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.540]   We killed Chicago Times.
[01:18:57.540 --> 01:18:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:00.220]   Woo.
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:02.660]   They really ought to be on Squarespace.
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:02.860]   Really?
[01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:03.500]   It's not loading.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.020]   Look at that.
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:05.020]   We killed it.
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.180]   We killed it.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:09.260]   The power.
[01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:10.580]   Andy can't have nice articles.
[01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:12.580]   Apple may not let me into their--
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.980]   Well, I think because you're still waiting for a--
[01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.420]   you're still waiting for a Maverick,
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.620]   so I couldn't just read it.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:19.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:20.660]   I'm not supposed to be comparing this latest--
[01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.220]   No, it's only two minutes remaining.
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:22.740]   Two minutes.
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:24.060]   Great stadium rock show.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.740]   At the end of 2013, an Apple has already keynoteed out
[01:19:26.740 --> 01:19:28.340]   with their sea boats out, so to speak.
[01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:32.100]   Oh, please stop me if you're--
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.380]   we're going to get to our picks of the week,
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:38.380]   but I'd like to give each of you while I'm less than a minute
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:40.540]   remaining, so you know that's going to happen anytime
[01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:45.420]   in the next 15 to 20 minutes while I'm rebooting Mavericks.
[01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:48.900]   Final thoughts on the announcements Apple made today.
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:51.860]   Let's start with you, Adam Christensen.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.380]   I'm excited for new iPads.
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:54.900]   It's probably probably the biggest thing
[01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.500]   that's what I've been waiting for before they came out.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.060]   I really wanted that.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.060]   I skipped forward.
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.140]   Like, I think a lot of us.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.380]   Yeah, I did.
[01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:01.940]   Me too.
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:03.420]   So I have a three.
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:06.820]   I'm excited to get the air thinner and lighter.
[01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:09.140]   I also really-- I love my mini.
[01:20:09.140 --> 01:20:11.660]   Actually, my minis become my main iPad that I care
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:13.060]   that I grab when I leave the house,
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.660]   so having a restaurant is just going to be that much nicer.
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.580]   So that's what I was most excited about.
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:20.300]   But then I was-- the fact that Mavericks is free,
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:22.580]   I get to save 20 bucks, that's great too.
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.060]   So lots of good stuff in there.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:25.780]   I'm looking forward to seeing the new iWork apps.
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:26.500]   I don't know.
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.260]   A lot to parse.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:32.900]   Andy, pick a couple of those 4,600 words.
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.980]   I just overall-- I'm just really, really happy overall
[01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:38.420]   to see that the product line, I think,
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:40.820]   makes a lot more sense than it used to.
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.580]   I think because the fact that they drop the price
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:46.060]   on the MacBook Pro, now it's more of a credible choice
[01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:47.740]   for so many other people.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:53.020]   Now that they have given more attention to the iPad Air,
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:56.020]   especially with what you now do with the A7 processor,
[01:20:56.020 --> 01:20:59.180]   now it is even a greater value if you're buying a $500 tablet
[01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:00.100]   now.
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.540]   And with the availability of a less expensive iPad mini,
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:07.620]   now I still think that the price of the Retina--
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:12.620]   of the mainstream Retina iPad is 400 bucks compared to 230
[01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.740]   for the Nexus 7 and the Kindle.
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:16.380]   That's still a hell of a lot more money.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.300]   So that's more-- it's kind of interesting question.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:21.180]   But now that it's a $299 iPad, I think
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:22.700]   that now there's a lot more opportunity
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.100]   for people who have wanted this sort of technology,
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:26.740]   but maybe have not been able to justify it.
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:28.260]   So I think that's-- it was a great day.
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.500]   Good.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.700]   I, for one, am just a little baffled
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:35.220]   why given that they said the mini's coming out this month,
[01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:37.820]   there's only eight more days, nine more days,
[01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:39.260]   that they couldn't give us a date.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.620]   What it means is for the next nine days, you and I
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.260]   and a lot of other people are just-- because I don't think
[01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:44.540]   they're going to be in short supply.
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:46.140]   I really do think that there are issues with that red
[01:21:46.140 --> 01:21:46.940]   in this place.
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:48.620]   We're just going to be watching, watching, watching,
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:50.260]   watching, watching, because you've
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:53.340]   got to be one of the first people in line to get one.
[01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:55.260]   I'm never the first person anymore.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:56.860]   I just wait until the line subsides.
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:21:57.820]   Do you have some good people do that?
[01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:58.620]   No, I'm just busy.
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:00.060]   And then I go, I still have five.
[01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:00.900]   I don't have the five guys.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:01.420]   I used to.
[01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:01.940]   I remember--
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:02.940]   I used to have the nine.
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:03.260]   We leave.
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:05.780]   No, you'd call Travis down at the Apple store
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:07.540]   and say, whatever Apple's announcing today, put it aside.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:08.540]   I want one.
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:09.420]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:10.260]   They don't do that anymore.
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.620]   They're like, we can't help you anymore.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:16.580]   But yeah, I think that most of the stuff was incremental.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:18.020]   Very, very exciting.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:20.660]   I think the things that I'm still kind of keyed up
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:22.980]   about is collaborative in iWork and the fact
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.060]   that all the software is moving to free,
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:26.540]   if that moves to pro, it obviously
[01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.820]   affects my business dramatically.
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:30.900]   But even now, I think that those two things
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:34.300]   are very, very interesting and unusual trajectories that
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:35.940]   could put a lot of Apple's competitors
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.420]   under a lot of pressure.
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:42.940]   I am a little surprised they didn't do the free pro stuff.
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:43.820]   I don't know if they're going to be--
[01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:44.660]   They may still do it.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:46.060]   I don't even know if that'll happen.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.740]   If it happens, it's almost at a level of antitrust.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.140]   I mean, that's why, right?
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:54.020]   The thing is that it would-- I mean, like for Adobe and Avid,
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:56.660]   it would be a catastrophic effect.
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:59.340]   Because you're talking about Mac Pros that
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.380]   are designed to run 4K, which is what's
[01:23:01.380 --> 01:23:02.700]   going to happen next year.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:05.260]   4K is going to be huge on, ironically, on the web,
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.860]   more than TV.
[01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:09.780]   But being able to produce Mac 4K is going to be a big deal.
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:12.140]   And being able to do that inexpensively, even the $300,
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:13.380]   if you have to spend it.
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:16.140]   But still, it's going to be a huge hit.
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:17.860]   How do you-- I mean, as a company, like my company,
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:20.060]   we buy more motion than After Effects.
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:22.460]   Because I have a handful of After Effects things,
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.660]   which we use a lot.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:27.660]   But I'd rather use motion because $50 each.
[01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:30.140]   Renee, your thoughts?
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:32.580]   I understand a lot of people now, they read the blogs.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:34.740]   It's almost like if you read the entire plot to a movie
[01:23:34.740 --> 01:23:37.140]   on Wikipedia and then go see the movie and think
[01:23:37.140 --> 01:23:38.900]   that it's boring, that's a problem
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:40.220]   that we're going to have to reconcile.
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:43.340]   Because more of the stuff that Apple does at such huge scale
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.220]   is going to leak out.
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:46.100]   And if you read that stuff, you're going to watch an event
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:48.460]   and say, oh, it's not that interesting.
[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:49.780]   There were no surprises.
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:51.900]   The best way to not be surprised is not to read the internet,
[01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.620]   which is not realistic.
[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:56.580]   I do think that I was disappointed there was no touch ID
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:59.080]   on the iPads because, like I've said before,
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.260]   using a pin code now makes me feel like an animal.
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.100]   I want to have touch ID everywhere.
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.060]   I want it on my house.
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:06.060]   It's just a great technology.
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:08.340]   I think the iPad Air is fantastic.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:10.060]   The Retina iPad Mini is fantastic.
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:11.980]   I'll be getting both because I honestly
[01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.220]   don't know which one I'm going to like better.
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:17.220]   Previously, it was about portability or that great screen.
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:20.460]   Now it's like portability and productivity maybe.
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:23.060]   And I'm in the same kind of quandary Andy mentioned.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:26.740]   I'm leaning towards the Mac Pro 13-inch Haswell update,
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:29.580]   but there's so many good options now.
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:30.660]   I work going free.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:32.540]   I work going collaborative.
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:33.660]   It is huge.
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:36.140]   I use Google Docs all the time.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:38.540]   I do not enjoy it any of the time.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:41.740]   And if Apple can nail the sort of workflow
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:46.020]   that Google provides and do it in an elegant, non-eye abrasive
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.580]   way, I think that will be fantastic.
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:50.220]   But this to me is once again-- and I
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.260]   don't know how long they can do this for because it makes
[01:24:52.260 --> 01:24:53.980]   them suffer the rest of the year.
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:56.220]   But for the last two October's in a row,
[01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:59.860]   Admiral Tim Cook has stood on the top of his aircraft carrier
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.940]   and said, gentlemen, clear my skies.
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:05.180]   And they have just let everything loose.
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:06.620]   And it's a fairly stunning display
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:09.140]   of Apple's ability to project product at this point.
[01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:11.300]   And it will be interesting to see what they can do now
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:13.860]   that they can make two iPhone lines, two iPad lines,
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:15.580]   a bunch of computer lines all at once
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:18.020]   as we start going into next year and maybe more
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:20.020]   diverse product ranges.
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:22.740]   I did order the 15-inch MacBook Pro Red.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:24.860]   You know, I have to say, when you look at that much new hardware
[01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:26.700]   that came out, especially the Mac Pro, which
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:31.220]   is extremely pregnant for a lot of people that want to upgrade,
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:33.060]   I am going to make the big prediction.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:36.300]   The Q4 will be the biggest quarter of Apple's history.
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:37.700]   The big quarter.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:40.780]   I'm going to go out there and say buy 20%.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.540]   Like it's going to be a huge, huge update.
[01:25:43.540 --> 01:25:45.300]   I mean, huge, huge quarter.
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:47.060]   I should have saved the money on the retina
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:48.340]   bought Apple's stock.
[01:25:48.340 --> 01:25:49.700]   He's like going to pay for it.
[01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:50.700]   He probably could.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:52.020]   That was dumb.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:52.860]   That's our advice.
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:54.140]   Don't buy any of these crap.
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:55.060]   Just buy Apple's stock.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.780]   Then buy it when you make the stock.
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:58.620]   It's spoken to my bunch of people that don't have any stock.
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:00.820]   Yeah, we know none of us do that because we're not--
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:01.740]   we kind of not--
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.780]   don't want to play in that space.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:05.900]   Yeah, I got the one with an Nvidia graphics,
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:07.980]   the higher end one.
[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:08.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:09.980]   Are you buying stock, John?
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:11.060]   No.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:13.100]   You are not an advisor.
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:13.860]   Don't listen to you.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:15.620]   Oh, yeah, I'm not a stock advisor.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:18.140]   What is the disclaimer I'm supposed to give for the SEC's
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:18.980]   benefit?
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.660]   If you listen to me for stock tips, you're a nitwit.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:23.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.980]   How's that?
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:25.500]   Oh, sure.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.620]   Dastless with your legal boilerplate.
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.020]   Here's the iCloud keychain.
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:34.980]   So you saw it when I upgraded to 703 on the iPhone 5S.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:36.180]   Same thing here.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:39.420]   iCloud keychain keeps passwords and credit card information.
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:40.020]   Sit it up.
[01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:41.820]   And then I guess in order to set it up,
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:44.580]   I'm going to have to give it my iCloud credentials.
[01:26:44.580 --> 01:26:47.580]   Although I already did in the previous screen on the--
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:50.140]   this is a Mavericks first boot.
[01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.820]   That desktop is mine, I think, not Mavericks, but I don't know.
[01:26:52.820 --> 01:26:58.180]   Oh, now this-- the iPhone didn't ask for a four-digit numeric iCloud
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.700]   security code.
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:01.500]   It was your pin code on the iPhone.
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.380]   So it's already the pin code on the iPhone.
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:04.460]   I don't need to do it again.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:08.660]   But since I don't have a pin code on the Mac, I'll do it.
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:10.500]   It doesn't have to be the same, right?
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:27:10.940 --> 01:27:12.860]   And then it says, give us a phone number that
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:15.060]   can receive SMS messages.
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:17.500]   And this will be verified if you forget.
[01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.020]   I'm going to see if I can use a Google voice, because sometimes
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.060]   you can use a Google voice number.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.860]   Sometimes you can't.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:25.260]   That'd be nice if I could.
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:28.140]   It can receive an SMS, so it didn't say no.
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:29.820]   Setting up your Mac, you could show this now.
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:32.980]   I don't think we're going to give away any secrets.
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:36.620]   TextExpanderWarning, I have to reopen for textExpander.
[01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:39.380]   I'm just going to ask for my iCloud password.
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.700]   TextExpander and a bunch of apps that use accessibility
[01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:44.860]   got kind of washed out because Apple moved entirely
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:46.660]   where that is run in settings.
[01:27:46.660 --> 01:27:48.460]   So you have to go to security now in settings
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:50.540]   and enable them on an app by app basis.
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:51.380]   Oh, OK.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:54.900]   That's going to be a pain.
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:56.340]   So I won't do that right now.
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:58.700]   Somebody said, go look at your battery.
[01:27:58.700 --> 01:28:01.420]   That's changed a little bit.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:02.100]   Oh, look at this.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.660]   Apps using significant energy.
[01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:06.340]   And of course, it's just booted, so spotlight's the first.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:07.860]   But eventually, it will show apps that
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:09.060]   are using a lot of energy.
[01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:10.660]   That's cool.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:11.980]   What else should I look at?
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:12.900]   This is my first experience.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:14.940]   Apparently a lot of companies were not thrilled with that feature, Leo.
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:16.580]   Yeah, they don't want you to know.
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:19.020]   But if you're on a battery device, that's great.
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:20.220]   Flash.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:23.180]   I'm most excited about being able to run two full screen apps
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:23.780]   at the same time.
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:26.180]   Yeah, I think that's a nice feature.
[01:28:26.180 --> 01:28:27.620]   Finally.
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:30.980]   Let me just-- remember, there was a Safari update
[01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:32.020]   before I ran this.
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:35.620]   I would guess, yeah, that's taken care of in the Mavericks updates.
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:38.060]   So you don't need to do that before you do your Mavericks update
[01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:40.780]   if you're going to do the Mavericks update.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:43.260]   Digital Camera Raw compatibility update, though.
[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:45.020]   I don't know why.
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:47.220]   I guess that's just by chance.
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:49.580]   Do you want to automatically install updates when they are ready?
[01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:50.940]   That's a new feature.
[01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:53.740]   No, I don't think it's new, but you definitely don't want to do that.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.580]   What?
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:55.220]   Of course I do.
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:56.060]   I know.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:57.020]   What?
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.980]   Until you know exactly what it's going to do to your computer.
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:02.580]   Any time there's a significant update, I want to see--
[01:29:02.580 --> 01:29:04.540]   I always check, I'm more.
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:07.500]   I always check the size to see if there's a headline saying,
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:10.220]   "Don't for the love of God and all that's holy,
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.900]   allow this new update to come in."
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:13.660]   I always turn on the other Mac updates.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:14.500]   So I'm going to turn it on.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:15.500]   Yeah, I'm looking at--
[01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.500]   Here's a nice new feature.
[01:29:16.500 --> 01:29:18.660]   Updates installed in the last 30 days shows you which updates--
[01:29:18.660 --> 01:29:19.940]   because of the automatic updates.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:20.940]   Right, right, right.
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:23.140]   That's probably-- you might want to know what got broken.
[01:29:23.140 --> 01:29:26.500]   Why your computer isn't starting here?
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.700]   Anything else I should look at?
[01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:34.700]   There's the beautiful island of Santa Rini in the Greece.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:35.500]   Maps is nice.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:37.380]   iBooks is nice.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:39.540]   Oh, yeah, we have maps and iBooks now.
[01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:41.540]   They've added that very nicely to my doc.
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:45.460]   My doc has kind of changed its appearance as well.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:46.980]   All right, well, there you go.
[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:48.500]   That was not a painful upgrade, and I
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:53.420]   was able to do it during the show without error.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:54.900]   So always nice to take that chance.
[01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:57.300]   I think I'll likely never launch iMessage again now
[01:29:57.300 --> 01:29:59.660]   that I can reply right from the notification feed.
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.900]   That's not really looking forward to that.
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:02.420]   Because I--
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:03.100]   I just so--
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:03.100]   I just so--
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:04.540]   I can't really open it on my Mac.
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.740]   Yeah.
[01:30:06.740 --> 01:30:08.540]   I want that on iOS so badly.
[01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:11.980]   Totally not fair.
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:15.220]   Yeah, that should be on the lock screen.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:16.140]   All right.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:17.620]   Meh.
[01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:19.300]   That might be a security problem.
[01:30:19.300 --> 01:30:20.340]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:20.820]   All right.
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:21.140]   All right.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.820]   Your buddy picks up your phone and is
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:26.340]   replying to your text messages right from the lock screen.
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:26.980]   I don't know.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:28.740]   Apple Maps knows where I am.
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:30.580]   How do it know?
[01:30:30.580 --> 01:30:32.100]   It's using Wi-Fi.
[01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:34.300]   Wi-Fi to locate me quite accurately.
[01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:35.940]   It's a people.
[01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:37.380]   I think that's exactly--
[01:30:37.380 --> 01:30:40.700]   it even knows exactly where I am.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:44.980]   Right next to the naked skin care and waxing.
[01:30:44.980 --> 01:30:45.980]   I had no idea.
[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.660]   I didn't either.
[01:30:47.660 --> 01:30:49.940]   You learn something every day about your building.
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:52.060]   To have a side like this in this economy, Leo,
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:53.020]   I'm very impressed.
[01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:58.180]   It's more of a hobby than a business, but--
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:00.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:00.460]   All right.
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:03.500]   Time for our picks of the week.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.500]   Let's start with Adam Christensen.
[01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.900]   You got to pick for us?
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:07.460]   I do.
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:09.700]   I never know if this has been picked or not before.
[01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:10.900]   No, because you're not a regular.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:11.420]   That's fine.
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:15.140]   Try to check the website, but hopefully no one picked this.
[01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:18.740]   I am actually going to pick something called Flipcase,
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.060]   which I can't even use.
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.620]   It's specifically for iPhone 5C.
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.660]   And someone cleverly figured out
[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:29.420]   that if you take the case off the back of your iPhone 5C,
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:31.580]   Apple's new case with the little holes,
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:32.220]   put it over.
[01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.260]   They wrote a connect for style game for it
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.020]   that you play through the holes on the case,
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.620]   but you put it over the front of your screen
[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:40.660]   to create almost like a physical board.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.540]   So it's just your simple connect for game.
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:43.740]   You could download it and--
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.220]   That's hysterical.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:45.940]   Isn't that great?
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:47.780]   That's so great.
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:50.540]   So I love the thought and the creativity behind this.
[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:52.620]   And even like the UI is set up.
[01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:57.140]   It makes me want to run out and buy an iPhone 5C in a case.
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:57.420]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:59.580]   And what I'm hoping is this triggers
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:02.220]   some other creative people to create case style.
[01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:04.340]   I expect a lot of kick starters to come out of this
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:08.380]   with the case style games that combine digital and physical.
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:11.940]   I love that sort of thing because I'm a big board game player.
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:12.860]   I love board games.
[01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.780]   And so anything that combines the digital and the physical,
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:16.780]   I'm always intrigued by.
[01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:19.780]   So I want to pick this one just because it's really cool,
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:21.980]   even though I don't have it or can't use it.
[01:32:21.980 --> 01:32:25.260]   And now, as Womper Mill says, we now know why it's the 5C.
[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:26.300]   It's the 5C.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.220]   It's the 5C.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:30.140]   The C stands for connect for.
[01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:31.500]   Andy and Ico, your pick of the week
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:33.260]   besides your great article.
[01:32:33.260 --> 01:32:34.140]   Thank you very much.
[01:32:34.140 --> 01:32:35.340]   Two quick ones.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:37.060]   One is a tweet that I just saw.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:40.500]   When Fleishman retweeted Bill D'Roshi saying,
[01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:43.020]   a line that if I had seen this 45 minutes ago,
[01:32:43.020 --> 01:32:44.500]   I'd be thinking, there must be a way
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.820]   that I can steal this line and pretend
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.300]   that I came up with it first.
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:49.300]   He says, now I get the tablet wars.
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:52.740]   Surface equals below, air equals above.
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:55.580]   Ooh.
[01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:58.220]   But the other pick is, believe it,
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:01.140]   it's actually a feature on the Apple TV
[01:33:01.140 --> 01:33:04.260]   that I had not started using until about a month ago,
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.900]   which is the podcast feature.
[01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:09.740]   Because my podcast listening has been defined by whatever
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:12.060]   phone I happen to have a pod catcher on.
[01:33:12.060 --> 01:33:14.660]   And so I'm either like Bluetoothing it to someplace
[01:33:14.660 --> 01:33:16.580]   or I'm listening to it in the car.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:20.020]   It made me realize that using it on Apple TV
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:24.140]   sort of turns the Apple TV into the old timey, old console
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:26.340]   radio of the '40s and the '50s.
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:28.180]   It seems like there's so many podcasts where
[01:33:28.180 --> 01:33:31.180]   it's like a 90-minute podcast or a two-hour podcast.
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:34.740]   And I might not have room for it in a week where I have lots
[01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.660]   and lots of really big podcasts to listen to.
[01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:38.860]   But given that the living room has good speakers,
[01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:40.900]   it's a place where I can do cleaning or just simply
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:43.740]   lay back and relax, I'm actually using that feature a lot more.
[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:47.700]   So it really got me thinking that maybe streaming podcasts,
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:49.500]   as opposed to downloading them and then playing it
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:52.180]   on mobile device, is really even a better way
[01:33:52.180 --> 01:33:53.100]   to listen to podcasts.
[01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:55.460]   So I appreciate that new experience
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:57.740]   and that's really got me using the Apple TV
[01:33:57.740 --> 01:33:59.540]   even more than I was using it before.
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:01.460]   By the way, we didn't mention that, but there were rumors.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:05.020]   Maybe there'd be a new Apple TV and there was not.
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:07.660]   You have a release a software update.
[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:11.460]   It seems like, I mean, isn't there the perennial rumor that,
[01:34:11.460 --> 01:34:12.940]   oh, this is the time--
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:15.060]   this is definitely the keynote in which Apple's going to announce
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:17.580]   that big, big, big huge deal they've been working on
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:19.460]   with all the major cable companies that will let you buy.
[01:34:19.460 --> 01:34:22.820]   Any channel you want, a la carte for $1.99 for eight years.
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:23.540]   Yeah, right.
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:25.420]   You know, and, OK.
[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:27.820]   Well, we just got to have--
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:29.500]   he dust that off, you polish it up,
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.660]   and you hope that people don't check the sell-by date
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:33.420]   on that rumor every time you try to use it.
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:34.700]   I think they just need to--
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:36.060]   I think that'll come after the announcement
[01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.700]   that Apple bought all the entertainment industry.
[01:34:38.700 --> 01:34:39.620]   There's only one bottom.
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.620]   There's only one bottom.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:44.060]   We just bought them, and now all their content's on iTunes.
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:47.300]   And not on Amazon.
[01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:50.100]   Mr. Alex Lindsay, you brought a pile of crap.
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.540]   What's your pick of the week?
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:52.700]   Hold on.
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:53.620]   It's going to be--
[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.220]   It's a program?
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:55.340]   Is it the BlackBerry Messenger?
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:34:56.020]   No, no.
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:57.020]   Look at me.
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:58.020]   Look at me.
[01:34:58.020 --> 01:34:59.020]   Take a picture.
[01:34:59.020 --> 01:34:59.820]   Stay very still.
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:00.420]   Stay still.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:02.220]   I was getting nervous, and Alex does crap like this.
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:05.220]   I've been modeling Leo's head for like a decade now.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:05.820]   All right.
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:06.420]   It's all right.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:06.820]   Here we go.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:07.220]   Hold on.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:07.420]   OK.
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:08.020]   Stay still.
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:13.820]   I take it.
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:15.220]   I shouldn't love.
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.220]   Mm-hmm.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.220]   Mm-hmm.
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:19.020]   Mm-hmm.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.020]   What have you done?
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:22.220]   He's making a 3D me.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.420]   Oh.
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:25.020]   It's a parallax view of Leo.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:26.020]   Well, it's a 3D model.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:29.420]   It's not very-- it doesn't handle distance very well.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:30.220]   Should I show it over here?
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:30.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.020]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:32.620]   It's ugly.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.420]   It's actually building like a low-res 3D model,
[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:37.620]   and then mapping you back-- camera mapping you back onto it.
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:40.220]   And apparently he's coming out of my ear, which is great.
[01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:40.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:40.620 --> 01:35:42.220]   Well, it doesn't handle monitors.
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:44.020]   It's like that very well, because they're not--
[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:44.820]   It's kind of cool.
[01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:45.620]   It didn't--
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:47.620]   It's actually building a little low-res 3D model.
[01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.220]   Is it building it as we speak?
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:49.820]   Well, it built it.
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:50.820]   It's getting better.
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:52.020]   Like, there's more to it now.
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:53.220]   It might be building it.
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:54.220]   So then what?
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:55.220]   It's called scene.
[01:35:55.220 --> 01:35:56.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:57.220]   Sorry.
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:35:58.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:35:59.220]   And then what do we do?
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.220]   You don't do anything with it.
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.220]   That's it.
[01:36:01.220 --> 01:36:02.220]   How does it compare to one's own catch?
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:03.220]   One, two, three, D.
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:04.220]   And so, one to three D catch is great.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.220]   It just takes longer, and to be honest with you--
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:07.220]   They did that pretty quickly.
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:10.220]   But I just did that really quickly, and it's just something--
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:11.220]   it's fun right now.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:13.220]   To me, I see like there's a lot of places they could go with it.
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:14.220]   You could share this on Facebook.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:15.220]   Yeah, you could share that if you want.
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:16.220]   Is it a video?
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:17.220]   What is it?
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:20.220]   It's just a-- it's a-- I don't-- it's some kind of little 3D piece.
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:24.460]   I'm not sure what it'll do when it goes on Facebook.
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.460]   But it's--
[01:36:25.460 --> 01:36:27.460]   You could say that about most teenagers.
[01:36:27.460 --> 01:36:28.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:29.460]   Exactly.
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:30.460]   So I have some of my--
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:31.460]   Is that free?
[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:32.460]   I think it is free, yeah.
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:34.860]   I'm downloading it right now to make the scene of you.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:36.860]   Anyway, S-E-N-E.
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:37.860]   Yes.
[01:36:37.860 --> 01:36:39.860]   All right.
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.860]   And so anyway, it's free.
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:47.100]   Here's my-- let's see if I can-- there's my--
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:49.100]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:50.100]   Like when it works.
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:51.100]   It's my daughter.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:52.100]   This is daughter.
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:54.100]   It was getting awfully big these days.
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.100]   Yeah, she is.
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:57.100]   That was kind of a neat effect.
[01:36:57.100 --> 01:36:58.100]   You know, it's just-- and it's really--
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:02.100]   You know what would be great if you could make this your parallax desktop on the iPhone 5?
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:04.100]   Yes.
[01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.900]   So I think there's a lot of places that a little-- you know, this is a free little app, but
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:08.100]   it's doing a lot of work.
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:09.100]   So it's--
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:10.100]   That's what's always amazing to me.
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:11.100]   Right.
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:14.100]   Is how much it did in such a little time.
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:15.100]   Exactly.
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:16.100]   So--
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:17.100]   Oh, your battery's dying.
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:18.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:21.100]   That's why I have a max.
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:23.700]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, what's your pick of the week?
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:26.100]   Well, I was going to pick BBM Leo, but since we already talked--
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:28.100]   No, you can pick it.
[01:37:28.100 --> 01:37:29.100]   Come on.
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:32.100]   It is a great way for me to keep in contact with all my friends from Crackberry.com.
[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:33.100]   So it does have--
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:34.100]   That's good, okay.
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:37.100]   Because they don't use iMessage very much.
[01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.100]   No, I'm picking Flint.
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:45.100]   And Flint was a great-- we use Campfire for sort of our virtual office and mobile locations.
[01:37:45.100 --> 01:37:46.100]   Right.
[01:37:46.100 --> 01:37:48.100]   So the Campfire apps are not great.
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:49.100]   37 signals.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.100]   Why would you use Flint on the Mac?
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:51.820]   Yeah, 37 signals, absolutely.
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:37:54.340]   And I've always used Flint on the Mac because it looks nice.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:55.420]   It works well.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:59.300]   But on iOS, there's just not been any great options, though.
[01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:01.700]   First party Campfire app, not great.
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.460]   Some of the third party apps, not great.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:05.340]   But Flint is now on iOS.
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:09.340]   So we have-- here we have all the different rooms that we use on mobile nations for all
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.700]   the different sites.
[01:38:10.700 --> 01:38:11.700]   And I can quickly go.
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:13.020]   I can see what messages are new.
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:15.820]   I can go into, for example, iMOR is Campfire Room.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:17.620]   I can just see what everybody is doing.
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:21.740]   And it's never as good-- it's never as good on mobile as it is on a computer.
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:24.180]   But it's good enough that I can quickly see what people are doing.
[01:38:24.180 --> 01:38:29.380]   If they need anything, I can send messages to people and I can keep in contact.
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:30.580]   And it's really elegant.
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:35.380]   It's an iOS 7 app, which means it has all support for things like the backward-- I handle
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:36.380]   that.
[01:38:36.380 --> 01:38:40.980]   But the backwards gestures, it's just a great-looking, great-working app.
[01:38:40.980 --> 01:38:46.420]   And if you live in Campfire as a lot of people who have highly dispersed teams and a lot
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:49.260]   of remote workforce, it do.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:53.220]   It's just absolutely the best way I've found to use Campfire on iOS.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.500]   So it's Flint, just like the Mac.
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.860]   And CBM.
[01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:03.300]   And BBS, because you know, proudly Canadian.
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.300]   Proudly Canadian.
[01:39:04.300 --> 01:39:07.340]   And let me try a scene of just my mug.
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:08.340]   All right?
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:11.220]   Because the mug doesn't move, right?
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:13.260]   Finest subject with lots of green dots.
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:14.260]   What?
[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:16.260]   It's joking around.
[01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.260]   No, no, no.
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:19.220]   It'll show you green dots once you start it.
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:21.500]   Because it's basically fine in subject with a lot of detail.
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:22.500]   Oh, it's doing it.
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:24.500]   It'll create lots of green dots.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.500]   I get it.
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:26.500]   Okay.
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:27.500]   So let me stop this how-to.
[01:39:27.500 --> 01:39:29.820]   The last thing I want to do is learn how to use it.
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:30.820]   Exactly.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:31.820]   So there you go.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:32.820]   I just want to use it.
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:33.820]   So then you hit-- pull back a little bit.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:34.820]   Two few dots.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:35.820]   Try a-- well, there we go.
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:36.820]   Lots of dots on that, right?
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:37.820]   Right?
[01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:38.820]   So you're going to carefully rotate up.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:39.820]   Yeah, not move.
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:40.820]   Not slow.
[01:39:40.820 --> 01:39:41.820]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:39:41.820 --> 01:39:42.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:43.820]   Oh, just rotate, not slide.
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:44.820]   Well, kind of orbit.
[01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:45.820]   Orbit.
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:46.820]   Orbit the thing.
[01:39:46.820 --> 01:39:47.820]   Yeah, we'll see.
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:48.820]   Okay.
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:49.820]   Move around the subject.
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:51.700]   Okay, it says it's done.
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:52.700]   Let's see.
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:54.380]   Whoa, that's pretty good.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.380]   It doesn't work out really well.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:56.820]   Yeah, because it didn't move, right?
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:40:02.700]   So now I have a-- if you were selling mugs, this would be a great way to send 3D renders.
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:04.940]   Well, again, and this is their version one.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:05.940]   So I mean--
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:06.940]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:13.780]   I'll share that on Facebook and we'll see what happens.
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:16.460]   I was going to mention Hop.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:17.460]   So I had mentioned Ping.
[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:22.220]   I don't-- I think I'd mentioned Ping before, which is a new email solution.
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:25.140]   The idea being treating email kind of like instant messaging.
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:26.220]   And it really-- I've used it.
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.780]   It's really cool.
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:32.300]   Unfortunately, they got sued by the golf club manufacturer, or not sued, but they got a
[01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:35.300]   very nasty cease and desist.
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:37.620]   And so they had to change the name and hold off.
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:40.740]   They were going to come out September 18th.
[01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:41.740]   So it's out now.
[01:40:41.740 --> 01:40:43.660]   It's Hop, not Ping.
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:44.660]   So just think of the full--
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:45.660]   Oh, right.
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:46.660]   Get it?
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:50.100]   And unfortunately, I'm 10,000 in line, so I can't show you.
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:52.260]   I probably got rid of the invitation I had.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:53.260]   Lines are horrible.
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.260]   Huh?
[01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:55.260]   Those lines, those--
[01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:56.260]   They're really long.
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:57.260]   They're really long.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:40:58.260]   How long is it an app as horrible?
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:40:59.260]   It's a long line.
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:00.260]   10,000, 40.
[01:41:00.260 --> 01:41:01.260]   You're falling behind.
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:02.260]   How did you--
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:03.260]   I'm calling you Zach.
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:04.260]   This is like--
[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:07.820]   It's like a proxy server, Leo, and just spoof the response from the server.
[01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:10.940]   But I having used this, and I used it with a developer one night, and it really is kind
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:15.340]   of fun because, among other things, it's more like chat, even though it is using email
[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:16.940]   as the back end.
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:23.380]   And you can take-- the developer said, we've got badges, free badges from anything on the
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:27.220]   net because you could do a web search and put any image into a Ping message.
[01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:30.340]   So it's really easy to add messages.
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:32.740]   You know how a lot of companies make money on the sticker packs?
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:37.380]   Well, basically, you can use anything that's on the internet and use it as a sticker in
[01:41:37.380 --> 01:41:38.540]   your email.
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:39.540]   I like this a lot.
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:42.140]   It'd be worth signing up so you can get in line two, "Hop."
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:44.380]   Is the name not Ping?
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:45.580]   Let's all get in line together.
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.220]   Yeah, didn't Apple have to license Ping when they made the music?
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:49.220]   I guess so.
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:53.540]   Because the Ping people were really nasty to do with this app and basically set it behind.
[01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:56.180]   It'd be a little more polite to somebody who has a trillion dollars.
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:57.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:41:57.180 --> 01:41:58.180]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:41:59.180]   Yeah, they--
[01:41:59.180 --> 01:42:03.140]   Well, and I think probably they could have fought it, Hop could have fought it, but they
[01:42:03.140 --> 01:42:04.780]   thought, well, why?
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:06.940]   Let's just get this thing out the door.
[01:42:06.940 --> 01:42:10.220]   Very interesting use of email.
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:13.900]   And I liked it a lot, especially if you're working-- if you still find yourself exchanging
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:17.500]   emails a lot, as you seem to be doing, with people that you work with, this would be a
[01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:19.420]   good way to add this capability.
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:21.020]   And they're all stored as emails.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:22.020]   Right.
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:24.540]   Hey, that's it for this edition of iPad Today.
[01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:26.620]   OS 10 Mavericks is on my desktop.
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:28.020]   Make it yours too, why not?
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:30.140]   It's cool that it did that.
[01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:31.540]   They're calling it 10.9.
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:32.540]   I thought it was 10.
[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:35.140]   Didn't he say the 10-- oh, because they started zero.
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:36.140]   Right.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:37.140]   From zero, the programmers.
[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:38.140]   The next one is 10.10.
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:41.220]   Yeah, this is not 10.10.
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:42.300]   I hope you enjoyed this.
[01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:46.900]   If you did not see the Apple event, of course, it's now on the Apple site, but you could also
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:52.300]   go to our Twit Live special and watch the Apple event with our commentary in the background.
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:58.780]   I want to thank Renee Ritchie for being here from iMore.com, and we'll see him next week.
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:01.220]   I'm sure Alex Lindsey from Pixelcore, you're going to come back?
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:02.220]   I'll be in Rwanda.
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:03.220]   Oh, but you might go to Rwanda.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:04.220]   But you might go to Rwanda.
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.220]   I've got lots of bandwidth in Rwanda.
[01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:07.940]   And we have to show you the new Green Screen Studio.
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:08.940]   I'd like to see it.
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:12.980]   I'd like to see if we could get some of these-- I mean, these are like the ministers of
[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:15.100]   information technology are all coming to Rwanda.
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:16.100]   Wow.
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:17.100]   So maybe we'll see if we can find some of them on there.
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:18.100]   We'll set aside a little time.
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:19.100]   OK.
[01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:21.100]   Did I say it's iPad Today?
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:22.100]   Yes.
[01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:23.100]   This is not iPad Today.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:26.100]   What kind of was iPad Today?
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.100]   It was Mac Break.
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.900]   I was going to say it.
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:33.980]   Wait till next week when we're saying, OK, big show last week when we got this week.
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:40.860]   Kensington has a new iPad stand that-- that's why I ordered everything because it's supposed
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:42.860]   to come by next Tuesday.
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:46.820]   So if I-- that's the only thing I could order.
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.940]   Later in November from the mini, I misspoke.
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:50.940]   I thought it was later-- I thought it was this month.
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:53.220]   I remember first for the iPad Air.
[01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:57.100]   So-- but I will have a MacBook Pro with Retina display by next week.
[01:43:57.100 --> 01:43:59.660]   It's nice of Apple to stage out our money spending.
[01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:01.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:06.060]   And now I know I have to save at least $3,000 for my new Mac Pro.
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:07.060]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:09.780]   Which by the way does not include a monitor.
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:16.220]   Andy Inako has filed-- let's bring Chicagogrid.com down one more time in honor of Andy.
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:17.300]   We brought it down.
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:18.300]   That's awesome.
[01:44:18.300 --> 01:44:19.300]   He's at the Chicago--
[01:44:19.300 --> 01:44:20.300]   The shut's a mad boy there.
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:21.300]   Yeah.
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:22.860]   I think you deserve a raise now.
[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:25.580]   You might just go into the other and say, "Hey, anything happen on Tuesday?"
[01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:26.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:28.060]   So his web server is running.
[01:44:28.060 --> 01:44:29.060]   A little hot.
[01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:30.220]   They're on Amazon.
[01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:32.020]   You'd think it could have handled the traffic.
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.020]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:35.180]   It was a spike Leo.
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:36.180]   Exactly.
[01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:37.180]   Yep, I'm sure.
[01:44:37.180 --> 01:44:38.180]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[01:44:38.180 --> 01:44:39.180]   They're up now.
[01:44:39.180 --> 01:44:40.180]   They're back up.
[01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:41.700]   There it is.
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:48.420]   And thank you so much to Matt Castes, Adam Christensen for making some time for us.
[01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:49.420]   Hey, you're welcome.
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:50.740]   Thanks for having me again.
[01:44:50.740 --> 01:44:55.340]   MacCast.com, if you want to listen to the original Macintosh podcast.
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:57.140]   How many years now?
[01:44:57.140 --> 01:44:58.140]   Nine, I think.
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:44:59.140]   Wow.
[01:44:59.140 --> 01:45:00.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:02.300]   December 2004.
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.140]   Easily predates this.
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:05.140]   Yeah.
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:06.140]   Well--
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.140]   Well, actually, probably--
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:09.140]   Not quite too much.
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:10.140]   I can't remember what--
[01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:14.060]   Because we started-- Mac-- MacBrick started his video, just Mac Break.
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:16.220]   And then we did the audio later, Mac Break Weekly.
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:18.860]   It's an audio version of the video show.
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:19.860]   Your first one, I remember you--
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:21.860]   I think it was January 2005.
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:23.500]   And the CineAlta.
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:24.500]   2000.
[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:25.500]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:26.500]   No, no, no, no.
[01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:27.500]   It was the first 1080p.
[01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:30.660]   The first one was Amber and you and I and Emery Wells--
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:31.660]   The Mac World Expo.
[01:45:31.660 --> 01:45:32.660]   --at Mac World Expo.
[01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:34.460]   So it would have come out in January 2005.
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:35.460]   Right.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:36.460]   So you beat us.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:37.460]   Yep.
[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:38.460]   Right after.
[01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:39.460]   Yep.
[01:45:39.460 --> 01:45:40.460]   Just a little bit.
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:41.460]   Hey, nice to have you all.
[01:45:41.460 --> 01:45:42.460]   We do Mac Break Weekly.
[01:45:42.460 --> 01:45:43.460]   Normally, we do a little earlier.
[01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:45.460]   We were waiting till the end of the Apple announcement before we started today.
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:51.260]   But normally 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time, 1800 UTC on Tuesdays.
