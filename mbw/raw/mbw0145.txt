[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   We couldn't do to it without it.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It's time for MacBreak Weekly, the show that covers all things Macintosh.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Ladies and gentlemen in studio with me today, of course,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Alex Lindsey, the lovely and talented Pixel Corpian.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I'm a Pixel Scorpion.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   A Pixel Scorpion. A Pixel Scorpion.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I don't know what that means, but I hope it's good.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   The Jolly laugh that of Scott Born, we welcome him back from his
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Fortress of Solitude.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Very sorry to have missed last week, especially with the
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   iPhone announcement, etc.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   But I enjoyed watching the coverage.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Well, don't feel too bad.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I flew Andy all the way out here and he missed it as well.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Andy and I collated.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   I didn't miss it, sir.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I was standing by saying, guys, tell me exactly what you want me to
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   do and I'll be there.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I was like George Harrison and let it be.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Telling Paul McCarty, if you want me to play fast, I'll play fast.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   If you want to play soft, I'll play soft.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Just tell me what you want to do and I want to make happy.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's my fault entirely.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I blame myself, but you got at least you got to go to the keynote
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and you did come back the next day and explain all.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So that was, you were in studio.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And how do you like your seashell?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   You still liking that?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Oh, loving it.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   That's the new Asus.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yeah, very, very good, very, very smart machine.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I love the, it's a keyboard with whatever else around it you need
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   to support a keyboard.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Now that I have Windows 7 running on it, I like it even better.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I understand that you bought a Samsung.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Yeah, since I, you know, I thought, you know, we got to diversify.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   So you've got the seashell, the 1008HA basis.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   In case we get hit by that one type of Windows virus that only
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   affects the Asus model, but that's not a vice versa.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's not a ridiculous thing to think about in the Windows sphere.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I was just curious to try the, I mean, now that I wasn't bound
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   by the need to hackintosh, because I have an MSI win, which I got
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   because it's hackintoshable.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   The NC20 has almost a full-size keyboard and a 12-inch screen
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and it really is, it's pretty spectacular.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   That's exciting to be left to.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   This year I've become a real convert to, to netbooks in general.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I even think that if you're a Mac user and you're not interested
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   even in converting it so that we'll run Mac software,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   it's a hell of an accessory to have, especially if you have
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   something that's as compact as the, as the Asus that, again, can fit.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's, it's, it's like a clutch purse, even if you don't have the
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Internet tactical pants for the pockets that are big enough to stick
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   in the back pocket.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I mean, it's, it's a hell of a handy thing to have.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You think that, you think that now, now that you've seen the value of this,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   that there's a, that you have a drum beat to get Apple to do something like this?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I don't think they ever will do anything like that.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I think you're right.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I think you're right.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I mean, and, and that's okay because they're not the only computer
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   company out there, but it does go to, go to sort of the point that
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   sometimes good is good enough.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And a $400 notebook that's this small and this light and this convenient.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   That's good enough for me.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I'd rather, I was talking to a developer as a matter of fact last week
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   who had a really awesome iPhone app and I really wanted to have it.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I really was looking forward to, I was writing the review in my head
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   because it was a really, I can't talk about it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It was a really, really wonderful application.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And he's telling me about this one feature that he wanted to put in
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   involving syncing between the desktop and the, and the handset.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And I'm saying, you have been holding onto this for seven months because
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   you cannot get that one feature.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   And it's a nice feature, sir, but release it now.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Give us something to look forward to for 2.0, but give us this great thing
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   right now.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   We want it.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   We can use it.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Your software is no use to us if you're not going to release it.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   What's that saying the, the, the perfect is the enemy of the good or the
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   better is the enemy of good.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It's from Voltaire and it was, it was one of the things that they used to say
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   in the Apollo program a lot when they're trying to, when they saw a project
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   start to get away with them, say, look, we have this deadline.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You know, you will always, it's like the difference between, it's like trying
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   to draw a perfect circle.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You could always freehand, you can always draw a better circle, but sometimes
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   it's good enough.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I mean, good is a, is an attainable goal.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Perfect is a better is a goal that you'll always be chasing.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You'll never finish anything.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Unless you're Steve Jobs.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   So there are some stories, however, there are some things to talk about.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   For one thing, I'm very pleased.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And I know, I think Andy has something he might want to say along these
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   lines to see that my three GS, you know, while we were doing the show last
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Tuesday, I didn't tell anybody.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   I ordered.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   What is it coming?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   32 gig while we were talking about it.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   While we were talking iPhone GS, you might have heard me get quiet for a moment
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   there.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And I pre-ordered it.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So that was June 9th and I just got the email this morning.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It's shipped from Shenzhen, China.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It's another one of those drop the ship.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   It's on the boat.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   No, it's UPS.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   They say delivery date the 18th.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Which is tomorrow.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I mean, that day after tomorrow, Thursday, a day early.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   So I, yeah, so I was pleased.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I saw some other people on Friend Feed who also had, you know, got that email
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   that said they were going to get it by Thursday.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   So maybe we'll get a little bit early even tomorrow.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I suppose, you know, because I ordered it on the 9th, if you ordered it on the 8th,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   you could conceivably get it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Hello tomorrow.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Perfect.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Perfect.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Okay.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You just changed headsets.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   This is just a prop.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   That's good.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It's a good prop.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   You know what it is?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   What are you using for that ADD?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Is that the CN transfer?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I'm using that sure thing that Alex talked about.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   But I've been using it every week with no problems.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   You know, it's what we remember we had that with Andy when you plugged into,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   was it the left port or the right port of your MacBook?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   On the MacBook, nothing.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   The forward port is a good one.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   The backward port, the one closer to the front edge is the good one.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The one closer to the back is the not so good one.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   And I will troubleshoot it later.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Yeah, yeah, we don't have to worry about it now.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But it was something that somebody told me last week was that one of the ports is a direct connect.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Another one goes through some stuff.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Was it you who told me that?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I don't know what we were talking about last week, but we were talking a week before that one has one will
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   sometimes won't power stuff correctly and the other one will.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   And one will be a good audio and the other one will.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   That's always been the case on all of the MacBooks.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I think the thing is that you have one USB port that has its own bus and its own hub.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   You have a second one that's shared with all the USB devices that are built into the system.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   So got it.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So that would make sense.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Anyway, when is your iPhone supposed to arrive, Leo?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   The 18th.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Did you order second day shipping?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   No.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   They didn't even give that as an option.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   They have free shipping.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   They said it will arrive by the 19th.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   You know, that's what they say on the end.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   They gave me the option of next day shipping.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Did you do that?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And have you gotten your notice?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I got my confirmation.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It's supposed to be here tomorrow, I think.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Oh, so you'll get yours tomorrow.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Okay.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   But are they saying that it's going to arrive on the US tomorrow or it's going to arrive
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   in your hands tomorrow?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I can find him.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Every time that Apple has lent me an iPhone or an iPod, they can't even ship it to me so
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   that it arrives.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So that I have at 10 AM on Friday.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I always have to wait for Saturday morning delivery.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So I'd be really shocked if they announced that it's going to ship on X date on X time
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   and anybody got them early.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   It's interesting because I've heard from a lot of people including Scott, this is the
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   UPS tracking.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   This is not it'll be a town.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   This is it'll be at your door.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   It's expected delivery date.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   That's what it said.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   But in any event, I'll have it here pretty darn soon.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.280]   I'm kind of excited about it.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:32.440]   I was very excited about the announcement and looking forward.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.920]   We didn't get your analysis.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.000]   Anything you want to add to what we said?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.160]   Well, I think you guys did a good job.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.880]   I mean, the main thing for me is that I'm surprised at the ability to do video.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.960]   I did buy, which Apple already shipped me, one of these little add-on battery pack thingies
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.400]   so that I can get more battery life.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.200]   But having 32 gigs of storage and ability to shoot video like a little quick video cameras
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.200]   is pretty cool.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.120]   But the three megapixel camera with the touch focus, that I predicted this on several shows
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   I've been on lately.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.440]   I'll tell you what, we will see that absolutely positively make its way to DSLRs.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.800]   Oh, the touch focus.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.120]   Yeah, that's kind of a neat feature.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.960]   Because, you know, everybody's going to live view on these digital things, reef cameras.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.920]   So, you know, imagine just looking at your live view and going, I want to focus on that
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.880]   and it'd be so much easier to do that.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.000]   And away you go, I think that is brilliant.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.080]   And I can't even wait to see now that we've got these new camera capabilities.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.800]   I just am so excited about what the developers are going to do with this.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.000]   I mean, everyone says, "That's only 3 megapixels in the camera on blah, blah, blah, blah,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   "as 5 megapixels won't."
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.080]   You know, I had more than 100 photographs published from my original Canon DSLR, which
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.560]   had a 3.3 megapixel camera on it.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.960]   You know, I think we're going to see a lot of new videos.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   It's funny.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.560]   I mean, it's not a feature that other cameras haven't had.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.880]   One thing that I was surprised that they didn't talk about is that I would be very surprised
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.280]   if within the first month or two we didn't see a direct upload to YouTube.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   So you're sitting there on your iPhone?
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.280]   I think they said they were going to do that.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.280]   Did they say that?
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.280]   I didn't see that.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.280]   I didn't see it either.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.280]   But I heard him say upload to YouTube as if it were something.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.440]   So you can shoot a video if your iPhone is already logged into your account and has
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.720]   all the information, you theoretically could be able to shoot a video, click on it.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.240]   And by the way, there are apps in the app store that will do that.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.000]   But I think that having it just built in will be.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.320]   And this has been happening with other phones, but I think especially when you look at what's
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.160]   happening in Tehran right now.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   Look at that.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.520]   All of the video we're seeing is from camera phones, because if you're a camera crew, you've
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   been thrown off.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.720]   If they're taking your cameras.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.360]   So the stuff you're seeing on broadcast is coming from the camera phone.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   And it's good.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:52.600]   And the thing is, I think that we're really looking at, it's not the, and it's just that
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.880]   it's hitting the iPhone world.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.720]   I mean, this is our little Mac world.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.000]   I know that other phones have been able to do this for a while.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.320]   No, but Mac users do more.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.880]   I think this is the difference.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.880]   We've seen this before.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.240]   But what's the number one camera on Flickr right now?
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.240]   Iphone.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.240]   It's the iPhone.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.840]   And when this video hits, I think it's going to be the number one camera submitting to YouTube.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.840]   I agree.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.280]   And it doesn't have to be the best camera.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.680]   It doesn't have to be, you know, it doesn't have to be the first camera.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.640]   It's just because for some reason, iPhone people and Mac people in general do more with
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   their stuff.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.920]   Well, the other thing is there are lots of phones that have cameras, but that doesn't
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.320]   mean they work well or that they're intuitive or that they're easy to put into the workflow
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.720]   and that they don't crash the phone.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.520]   I mean, that's going to be the real thing.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.920]   Now I am concerned about that.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   I'll be honest.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.840]   One of the things that worries me is that I know it's old fashioned.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.880]   I know it's crazy, but I actually use this thing as a phone.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.240]   And I need the phone part to work.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   Right.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.600]   Sounds like a man who has friends.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   Damn you, Scott Borne.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   Damn you to hell.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   Yes.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.960]   I just actually want to be able to pick up the phone and call somebody sometime.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.280]   And if I can't do that because all the other apps have crashed the phone part, I will not
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.280]   be a happy camper.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   It'll be a small.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.320]   But I think that's what Apple spent by Apple incorporating this, not a jailbroken phone,
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.080]   but Apple actually incorporating the data Apple putting, making sure the video giving
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:23.480]   it was a more powerful processor to work with when we actually get the video.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.320]   I don't expect it to have a stability issue.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.200]   What I do expect is that I think it's going to be seamless to get this up on the web to
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.280]   get this on YouTube.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:38.000]   And I think it's really, I think we're going to see a huge turn in the kind of coverage
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   that you get of these events.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.160]   I mean, if you can imagine those of you watching at home, I want to thank Nate 123 in our
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   chat room.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.360]   Here is an image from the iPhone of the interface.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.560]   Let me make it a little smaller so you can see email video, MMS send the mobile me send
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.560]   to YouTube.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.560]   Yay.
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.840]   Now that's from the camera roll, but presumably the video.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.560]   Oh yeah, videos in the camera roll.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.520]   See, there's video over at the left there.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.320]   So your video and just like with iPhone or your video and stills.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.120]   The other thing to remember is that there's basic editing within the iPhone 2.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.240]   So you're really able to, I mean, this is a news crew on the, you know, in somewhere
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.520]   like Iran or whatever.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.480]   This is the dream little camera that you can, you can sit there and upload stuff and get
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.640]   it out quickly, you know, and so until they figure out how to block the ports.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.800]   There's one real quick thing I want to say that I find interesting though.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.080]   And maybe I missed it because I wasn't there this year, but I haven't seen a lot of detail
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.560]   if any on what the processor is.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.800]   No, they haven't said they don't say they even say the processors twice as fast.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.760]   They said the phones twice as fast, which is a fudge factor.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.480]   If you ask me, I don't bet the processors not twice as fast.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.960]   It's just that they have a whole bunch of different benchmarks ranging from twice a little
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.960]   less than twice to three or three point five times.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.520]   And with each one of these benchmarks, they say specifically what that is.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:03.000]   This is the highest speed boost, the test that they cite is opening an Excel attachment
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.760]   and rendering it according to again, the chat room, which has been very good on this.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:13.600]   They say that a overseas international carrier has accidentally released this information.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.200]   It's a 600 megahertz presumably arm processor.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.360]   And this is a big one 256 megs of RAM, which would make a huge difference in speed.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:23.360]   Right.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.760]   Yeah, it specs on the original 3 Jr. correct.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.960]   And that would be double the original the amount of application RAM.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.680]   Yeah, double the processor.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.680]   No, it's not.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.760]   It's only about 25% even not even that much.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.160]   The price and the processor like five.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.840]   What was I said?
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.400]   First one is for 12.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.640]   So there's 50% more.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.280]   Well, I mean, it's in a lot of RAM.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:48.240]   Apple kind of smart not to disclose the megahertz ratings of their microprocessors because it's
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.680]   a phony baloney number.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.800]   And you can get involved in the tyranny of tables very, very quickly.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.640]   It's not a significant number to anybody.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.700]   What's significant is how much faster is this now than it was then if you have a side by
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:05.320]   side speed test between the iPhone 3GS and the pre which one can get over Wi-Fi, which
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.640]   one can get web pages faster, that sort of stuff.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.600]   So I'm looking at a non tech they did a good a good review where they break this down,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:20.040]   including all the chips they can be an ARM Cortex a eight.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.520]   Or maybe it's I don't know.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.520]   I'll have to I'm scanning.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:23.520]   Well, no, no, no, no, no, I was.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.760]   I was on the fence before, but now that I know that it's an ARM.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   That's like way.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.000]   So this is well there you go.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.960]   Someone posted that that T mobile posted it and this is in wire.com 256 megs of ram and
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:42.360]   is double 128 megs of ram from the original iPhone and 600 megahertz instead of 412.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.320]   But it's not just that because look at this.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:53.400]   The the cash is from 16 level one cash or I cash to 32 from decash from 16 to 32.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:56.000]   That makes a big difference in the L and the L one cash.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.480]   It also has L two cash, which of 2015, which the previous one did not have at all.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.080]   And the thing that the thing that the L two cash makes, the stage pipeline versus a stage
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.880]   pipeline.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.560]   It's got two issue with instead of one issue with.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:15.600]   So I think there there this is a much more sophisticated processor in here and 65 nanometers,
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.840]   which means it's smaller and cooler.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:21.960]   So that may in fact, you may be able to put a faster processor and get better battery
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.200]   life out of this.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.280]   So this is so there's the others wired has the secret iPhone specs at wire.com and also
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.440]   a non tech has a review with a lot of information on here.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.800]   But they they move fast, don't they?
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.520]   Where where they get the information?
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.520]   Good question.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.840]   They haven't taken one apart.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   I have to be intensely suspicious about it.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.680]   I can I can believe that a manufacturer, you know, let the horse out of the barn early
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.680]   about a certain chip design.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:52.000]   But I think that anybody who purports to have real information that didn't come out of,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.720]   let's say a 30 minute briefing with Apple on Monday Monday last week, I don't buy it.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.160]   Well, we'll know in a couple of days because all those people that buy the phone strictly
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.240]   so they can tear them apart and put all the pieces in parts up on the internet will answer
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.240]   the question, right?
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.080]   Yeah, but it's unfair, Scott, because in a couple of days, we'll have hard information
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   and we won't.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.080]   We won't get a specular.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.920]   I do exactly this won't be valuable to anybody.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:21.200]   But now we can say, well, you know, I suspect that there's the arm process.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.280]   It was starting to look long on the two.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.720]   I wouldn't be dashed surprise if they didn't find some sort of an atom, you know, but the
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:32.040]   value comes in our incredible analysis afterwards, Andy.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.440]   See, we we we break down what that actually means, all those numbers and stuff and blah,
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   blah, blah.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:44.760]   The value is that you get to see a string forward when we're talking about this or.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.720]   I'm keeping my old iPhone just in case.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:54.440]   Coming to an on and they don't say where they got it, the iPhone 3GS uses a Samsung SOC.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:02.920]   That's the I guess the GPU and it's got a Cortex A8 arm processor and a power VR SGX.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.040]   So maybe that's a GPU.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.360]   So I'm I like I said, I'm just scanning this now.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.280]   So I don't have a digested all of this, but it is pretty.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.600]   Did you did you see the news on the MMS Leo?
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.680]   That AT&T isn't going to support it till when are they going to support it?
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.680]   Do you know that?
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.040]   I don't know that, but I do know they're not going to charge extra for it.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   That's good news.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.280]   In fact, I also saw, which is kind of surprising, MMS will be embedded into the texting as well.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.200]   So you'll be able to put pictures in your text and so forth.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   I think that's cool.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.520]   They said that it's coming later.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.120]   The SOC is the overall thank you CPU clock.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.600]   SOC is the overall architecture.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.800]   So it's a Samsung architecture that they're using.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.400]   I think it's going to be a great update.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.600]   I'm excited to get.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:54.640]   If you add L2 cache and double the L1 cache on this thing, that makes a big difference.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.480]   And what Anan saying is, here comes the gaming platform.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.000]   Yeah, they have graphics.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.240]   There's built-in graphics processing now.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.800]   What would really be fun is to find somebody that was smart enough to compare what this
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.640]   throughput looks like against PCs we could buy years ago.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.760]   Yeah, I would be excited just to see like a standard like DOS emulator for the iPhone.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:23.000]   I want to be able to run like Lotus 123 with a backslash commands just so I can appreciate
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.240]   what we have right now.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   Well, I just want to-
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.200]   DB2 on the thing and see where we're really at there.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.320]   I just want to point out as we look at the specs for this iPhone that I rendered shots
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:40.960]   for Star Wars on a 240 megahertz Mac.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:47.760]   And it had, in the middle of the production, I bumped it from 128 megs of RAM to 192.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.640]   I had to write a three-page paper on why that made sense.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.360]   Now, how long did it take to render a single frame on that?
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.360]   About nine minutes.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.360]   That's not too bad.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.600]   Yeah, but anyway, so when we look at the power that we're putting into our pocket at
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.440]   this point, I mean, it is remarkable.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.080]   Yeah, I mean, what I'd really like to see is a rendering.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.400]   I'd like to build a render farm with iPhones.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.320]   Well, this is the thing is that these-
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.720]   Why not?
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:17.000]   Well, so you could have a bulletproof vest where each resistant panel is actually an iPhone
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.400]   and it's actually rendering the live CGI background plate for the green screen while
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.400]   you're in a war zone.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.880]   Perfect.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:31.120]   I'll put in $50 worth of the development capital if you can find the offices and investors
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.920]   who I think we got something here.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.440]   I might also point out that this is pretty much the same hardware that's in the Palm
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.940]   Prey.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.360]   The difference is I think that the iPhone's software is a lot more tuned.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:46.000]   The Prey is on such a fast platform and feels a little bit sluggish.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.480]   Hey, Leo, while you guys were doing the show last week, I was out checking the lines for
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.480]   the Prey.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.680]   I did find one with 11 people.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.680]   Don't knock the Prey.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   I like the Prey.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   I'm not knocking the Prey.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.680]   I'm just-
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.640]   And we're going to be grateful that the Prey exists because the Prey is going to make the
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.680]   iPhone better because there's some- Actually, I think the Prey really hurts Blackberry more
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.680]   than it hurts the iPhone.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.480]   I think it's really aimed at the Blackberry.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.780]   The two of them squeeze- Well, RIM is the Prey.
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:17.860]   The Android and the iPhone, I think, are really- Blackberry is going to have a hard time over
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.900]   the next couple of years between those three phones.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.900]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:25.860]   You know, putting cupcake on the G1, the new Android firmware, I went 5, really improved
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.860]   it.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:27.860]   It's actually a much better phone battery.
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.580]   Life's improved and it's a snappier phone, has some nice features.
[00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.620]   My daughter was using it until the iPhone comes out so we can get her new iPhone.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.660]   She said, "I might want to keep this G1."
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.460]   Wow.
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.460]   So, yeah.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.680]   So there's less sensitive to the battery life.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.280]   Well, she doesn't like you.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.760]   I said, "Yeah, it's a terrible battery life."
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.040]   I said, "Well, how long- She's about a day and a half."
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.280]   I said, "That's great.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.780]   That's about what you're going to get with the iPhone."
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.240]   She said, "Oh, well, that's terrible because she's used to a regular phone."
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   Right.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.580]   And that's one of the things people have to go through when they first get a smartphone
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.220]   is that the battery life- I think the one thing-
[00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:05.280]   The one thing I got used to is I went out and invested in a lot of those little cradoles.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.560]   And I have- I have- That's the nice thing about the iPhone.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.560]   It works with all of your iPod.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:13.400]   So what I did is I've got a little- I've got iPhone cradle.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.400]   Everywhere I go.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.900]   So I plug in at the bed at night, in my office, in the kitchen.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.200]   And I just set it down all the time.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.120]   You know, when I'm not using it, I just get it charged back up again, top it up.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.440]   And then I also have a Mophie, which I would not travel without.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.640]   I know, so my little battery pack-
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.320]   What a battery pack does I get out of the Smophie thing.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.560]   Speak up where we're losing.
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.560]   We're losing.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.800]   How much battery life should I get out of this Mophie thing?
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.440]   It should double- It should just be like another iPhone of battery.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.440]   Oh, cool.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.440]   I- I-
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.040]   So it'll- The Mophie- That's the new one too.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.120]   I think that one's the super slim one.
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.040]   Mine isn't as cool as yours.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:55.480]   I just saw one, a friend of mine, Quasi Collison has one that he was-
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.440]   His is that version and he loves it.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.080]   He said it changed his whole-
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.080]   I'm not kidding.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.280]   I know something that big around.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.280]   It's not- It literally is-
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.280]   It's very-
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.520]   It feels like the version one iPhone.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   Really?
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.520]   Leo, if you can't see, but it's-
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.240]   Hold it up a little higher.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.560]   It's very thin on the side.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:12.560]   It is amazing.
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.560]   It is- It is amazing.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.560]   This is the-
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   Where's the battery, Scott?
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.560]   Is it the bottom?
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.560]   Yeah, it's just the shell.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.560]   Oh, the shell itself.
[00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.560]   Oh, well, that's pretty impressive.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.560]   Okay, I take it back.
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.560]   And it doesn't weigh that much.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.000]   It's very little to the phone.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.360]   And that's an entire another charge.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.840]   Well, I'm gonna get one then.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.960]   Yeah, it's really worth it.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:29.960]   There goes Scott.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   It just disappeared.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.400]   And here's the thing that's-
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   And he's still there.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   And here's-
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.800]   And here's what's great about that is that basically you can-
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.640]   What I like about it is that I can charge it when I'm using my phone.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.120]   So my phone is with me and that's just plugged in somewhere.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:45.120]   It's a USB.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.200]   So I'm charging it wherever I need to be.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   I have one of those.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   I can- I'll need that for China.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.880]   'Cause I know what kind of battery situation I'm gonna have.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.400]   Now the only thing I would think about is the-
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.880]   I can't remember the other company.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.040]   Justine has the other phone that-
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.920]   I have the other one as well, but that's got a big battery.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.920]   It's too bulky.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920]   Yeah, that's good big battery.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   I think I have a light with so fast shooting videos.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.920]   Yeah, I have a lot of videos.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   It might be good.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.920]   You know what you really need to do?
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.920]   You need a little steady cam for your iPhone?
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.680]   I think I'm gonna be-
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.720]   You know, I'm glad I got it in time for the trip because-
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.240]   And I presume Andy, you'll bring yours too, 'cause I think we'll be sending video back.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   Oh, G.L.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.160]   Cost us $80 per minute on Sean.
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.360]   No, wait a minute though.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.360]   You call ahead.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.320]   You call AT&T and you buy $200 a month.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   Well you have your choice.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.400]   I think it's 50 bucks for 50 megabytes.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.680]   You can get to pick what you want.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:35.080]   So I'm gonna get the international calling and then I probably will get the biggest data
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.080]   plan.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   It's a great memory to turn it off.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.960]   Yeah, and then at the end of the month you can turn it off.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.200]   So I will do that.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.360]   And that way I'll be able to be really fun and if we could upload-
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.560]   And I presume China has a fairly good 3G network in the cities anyway.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:52.640]   Yeah, but I'm absolutely ignorant as to what we'll get to the Great Firewall of China.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   Well, I know.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.880]   It's gonna be like being in Tehran and they're saying, "Are you twittering?"
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.880]   I don't even know.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.160]   Unfortunately there's something going on where I need to sort of keep in touch with what's
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.320]   going on in Massachusetts.
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.320]   And I don't know.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.160]   I have to sort of say, "Well, here's what we'll do if I can get email in China.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.160]   Here's what we'll do if I can't get email in China."
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.160]   So it's frustrating.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.160]   Again, one of those things we sort of take for granted that well we have the government.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.520]   The government is very nice.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.400]   They open our envelope, they read, they photocopy it, but then they fold it back up.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.160]   At least they pass it on.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.160]   Yes.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.480]   They're a little soggy from the steam, but at least they pass it on.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.520]   I can see an hour to worry about telling us that we're doing it.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:34.400]   We're gonna have to go to China and see if we can find a bail agent to get you two out
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.400]   of jail.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.720]   You know, I was actually fantasizing about that this morning and thinking, "What would
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   happen--"
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.880]   What did the prison guard look like with you?
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880]   No.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.120]   Not that kind of fantasy.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.520]   I was just thinking, "What would happen if Andy and I, and maybe Don McAllister 2, were
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.560]   just snapped up--" Put into a labor camp for 12 years?
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.440]   Well, you know, we've got-- you know, we worked with a woman who was an editor at Tech TV
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.520]   who is now-- she works at Work2Current and she's now being held by Corinna Thor, South
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.520]   North Korean-- North Korean.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.200]   What if something similar happened to you, me, and Don in China?
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.080]   I would come get you for one thing.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.520]   Well I think there'd be a-- I think we'd have-- just write a letter to the president.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.520]   That's all I ask.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.600]   No, I'd come get you.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.600]   You would?
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600]   I would come get you?
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.360]   Oh, it'd be like Blackhawk Down kind of thing?
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.360]   I would come get you.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.360]   Just leave it at that.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.360]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.360]   It's cool.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.360]   Scott Bourne.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.600]   You know it's like Rambo 8.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.600]   Scott Bourne.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.120]   He's going to Don the Vest one more time.
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.720]   He puts on the beret and Scott Bourne.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.320]   No, I'm going to pay somebody to Don the Vest.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   Oh, okay.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.320]   Army Rangers, Scott Bourne.
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.120]   It'll be a good movie.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   I like for it.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.080]   When you get to be my age, you don't pull the trigger, you pay somebody to pull the trigger.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.720]   Just remember, Blackwater is now-- what is it?
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.720]   C, Z, Z--
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   Oh, I got--
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   I got better guys than both.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:52.720]   Oh, oh.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   Andy, we're good.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.040]   You know, maybe we should just see if we can get captured just for the fun of it.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.080]   Well, again, I was seeing this more of like a hoping Crosby Road picture.
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.080]   Do you ask if you like--
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.080]   We're on the--
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   Do you want to try to scan the local consulate, then we're on the run, and I'm like, I don't
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.440]   know why you keep getting me in these little fixes, Paul.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   I don't know.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.440]   Andy, it's just part of the fun.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.680]   I've got the range of little canoe up the anxiety.
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:17.680]   We'll get out here.
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.680]   Boy can say--
[00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.320]   I think Chuck Norris is available.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.480]   John Claude von Dom, it'll be fun.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:27.600]   Hey, listen, Chuck Norris is older than me.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.600]   Yeah, I know.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.600]   But he could kill all of us with one flick of one flick of one flick.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   Absolutely.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   One tone is--
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.720]   Just do me a favor and don't get arrested because I don't want to have to call in my
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   favorites.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.560]   I'm not going to try to get arrested, but if it happens, I'm calling in my favorites.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.560]   You'll know.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.760]   I had to worry about this once with Alex.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.640]   He was going to go to some deep part of Africa, and I was rounding up the troops and getting
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.640]   them ready just in case he got caught up and stuff.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   Thank you, Scott.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   It's good to know we have friends.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.600]   The Sog Harbor militia will be coming.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   There's evidently.
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.520]   He's up there.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.200]   And I've heard that there is a UH60 sitting up there in Park Park ready to go.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.440]   Now we should say the mix saying, hey, Chad is not that bad.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.840]   No, we're being silly.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.920]   Of course we'll have a great time.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.920]   I've been--
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.720]   I don't want to say I have any influence, but the day of 9/11, there was.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.440]   There was a cruiser sitting literally outside my studio because I'm up against the water
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.040]   and it did have cruise missiles on it.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   I'm just saying.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   Wow.
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.040]   Wow.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   Okay.
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.840]   I have to come back to if I had to fantasize about something, again, sultry female prison
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:32.840]   guard.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.520]   We don't tell you have nothing American, but we have problems with our iPhones and we want
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   to enhance this.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:44.120]   And it's our air conditioning is broken down, so we must be stripping nearly naked while
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.120]   we fish.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.120]   Oh, no.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.120]   I'm not going to say that.

[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.120]   I'm not going to say that.

[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   I'm not going to say that.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   I can't wait.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.120]   No, but neither processing power of the graphics is ever going to make it happen, so it's only
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.120]   worth it.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.040]   No, the one thing that we missed last week, or I missed anyway, I don't think we talked
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.760]   about it on the show that I'm a little bit more perturbed about, is that we talked about
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.280]   the new 13-inch.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.480]   We did not talk about the fact that they revved the 15-inch at the same time.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   So the 15-inch removed the battery.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.480]   It removed the removal battery.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.480]   There is no removal.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.120]   And it went to an SD slot only.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:34.120]   So there's now, you have to go to the 17-inch to get an express slot.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.560]   But that has an unremovable battery.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   Who has a removable battery?
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.760]   There's no more at all.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:45.680]   And the 15-inch, which is the really the workhorse of doing video production on the road, 17-inch
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.440]   is just too big for the most part.
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.520]   17-inch is like my desktop that I want to have.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.520]   You don't have that car.
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:52.080]   So now I'm going to baby this machine.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.080]   I'm really like, I'm not going to, I mean, this round, I'm skipping this round.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.760]   You're like getting spectacular battery life.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.760]   You just see some of the reviews.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:02.400]   I mean, a seven, eight-hour battery life on these 15s.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.120]   I have 12 with my batteries.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.000]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   You can either have one battery that goes, I don't want a few hours.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.240]   I need to be able to swap.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.920]   Or have a few extra batteries.
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.920]   I have four batteries.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.360]   And so the thing is, is that I, and I need those four batteries.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.400]   If I'm flying to Tokyo, or if I'm flying to London, I need 10 hours of storage.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   If I'm out on the road.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.520]   No, no, no, no, you just need four laptops out.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   Oh, that's it.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.520]   Instead of buying more batteries, buying more laptops.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.760]   I wasn't applying the Scott rule to the issue.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:33.160]   You know, I was, I, I just buy more laptops.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.160]   Yes.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.400]   So, but that's, I think that was a mistake.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.760]   I said the MacBook, the only one now is the white MacBook is the only one with a removable
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   battery.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.960]   And that's really too low end for.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.960]   No, yeah.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.920]   I mean, the 13-inch, when I, last week I was talking about the SD slots fine, because I
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.680]   think the people who buy 13 inches, the SD slots fine.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.320]   But when you move into the, taking it away from the 15-inch, I think was going too far.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:57.800]   I also like the fact that I could open up my MacBook Pro and put an SSD in it.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.040]   And that really improved the power and the speed of it.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.040]   I think, I think it's doing that.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   I think it's doing that.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.360]   And this current 13-inch I think is, is going to be remembered as one of those classic Macs
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.280]   that was built really well.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.880]   And then they, you know, went off the road for a little while and there'll be another
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:12.880]   one.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.160]   But, you know, there's, there's, there's a handful of those.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.160]   And this is one of them.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:19.440]   And I think that they've kind of hosed the, this generation.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:20.880]   I'll buy one when this one breaks.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.880]   But I'm not, I'm not.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.040]   Well, you might be unique in your needs.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.000]   I don't, there's a lot of people talking about it and they kept on saying, well, I can't
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.320]   believe that what they did to the 15-inch.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.880]   And I was like, what did they do to the 15-inch?
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:35.560]   And I had to actually go, yeah, I had to go through, go to the Apple Store.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.680]   Because I think I just completely missed that that happened during WWDC.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.440]   I think I, I thought it was just the 13-inch release.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.120]   And I think it was a, yeah.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:47.840]   Apparently they're telling me in the chatroom that the SATA bus is also slower on the, on
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.840]   the 13 and the 15.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.120]   It's SATA 1 rather than SATA 2.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.120]   That's correct.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.200]   So that's one and a half gigs instead of three gigs.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.640]   That's a significant difference as well.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:02.040]   I said on a 13-inch, not a big deal, but a 15-inch is really where a lot of us were.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.280]   So they're pushing people to the 17s is what they're doing.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.120]   I know we don't want the 17 because I can't open it.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:12.320]   I can't open it on the plane unless I'm flying first class, which I'm not all, all the time.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.320]   Like Scott.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.640]   It works, I was going to say it works fine for me.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.440]   And then my own comfort, sir, is that I need to be able to prepare for your project during
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.000]   the flight and only the first class seats with the seat in front of me being purchased
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.640]   so that I know that no one's going to lean in front of me will allow me to do that.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   You know, here's the thing.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:39.080]   I upgraded to the 17 with this most recent switch when the ability to put eight gigs
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.520]   of RAM came out in a, in the laptop.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.240]   And I'm using it now as my desktop and I don't regret it.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.000]   It's performed really well.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.920]   I've never had any trouble with the battery life.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.720]   And again, I don't fly to Africa like, you know, Alex does.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.960]   But I think that they did get a lot right.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:46:01.200]   I am concerned about the 15 inch missing so many of these features because there are
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:07.200]   a lot of people who do rely on the high end video production capabilities of the express
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:09.920]   bus and not having it in the 15.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.640]   I mean, I think it's, I'm not quite sure what Apple was thinking.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.040]   I don't know if it's an oversight or, like you say, they really want to push people to
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:20.640]   the 17, but I don't see what the advantage of that is.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.200]   People are telling me again in the chat room that this SATA issue may be a bug in the firmware
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:28.800]   since it is the same chipset or it may be intentional.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.600]   And you know, there's software degrading it.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.920]   Although that seems like a dumb thing.
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.680]   If you've got the hardware in there, why not just let it do what it can't?
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:36.080]   That might be something that Apple will fix.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.240]   Finally, speaking of fixes, Apple pushed a new update today to Java.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.240]   This was that bad job.
[00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:42.240]   Oh, thank goodness.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.240]   Goodness.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   Good to say.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   Listen to us.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.240]   It's a nasty one.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:52.760]   In fact, it was a real problem because the security researcher who discovered it finally
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:58.320]   tired of asking Apple to fix it and released sample code, which a couple of weeks ago,
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:01.920]   which meant that bad guys were writing presumably.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:02.920]   I don't.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.920]   Yeah, put it.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:04.920]   I put a timeframe on it where you need to fix it.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:05.920]   You got to fix it.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:06.920]   You got to handle it now.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.120]   And so it worked and Apple did in fact.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.720]   So if you update your Mac today, you'll get a new Java.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:14.000]   Although for some reason, on my system, maybe I have to close everything.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   It's not up.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   Sorry, we can't update your Java.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   Don't know why.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   Not enough coffee.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.920]   Don't know why.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.920]   What other stories?
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   Let me see here.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   I had another one.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   Oh, yes.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.280]   This is from Marco.org.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.160]   He was at WWDC.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.280]   He's an iPhone developer.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.000]   Did Insta paper, which is fantastic.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.720]   He's also the chief developer at Tumblr.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.280]   That great, you know, Tumblr.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.800]   And he was a little upset about how Apple treated developers at the last session of
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   WWDC.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:51.160]   It was about publishing in the App Store.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   He says, "I can't tell you what it was about because, of course, we're NDA'd."
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.640]   And this is something Apple's really, you know, all along has made it really hard for
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.680]   iPhone developers to talk.
[00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.800]   It's traditional that NDA WWDC.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.720]   So I guess, you know, they don't want, that's why they don't let journalists in there.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.000]   But apparently, normally, you know, and there's an audience Q&A session, there was
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.360]   this time scheduled for an audience Q&A.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.520]   But the talk ended after 45.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.880]   He says, "Lightweight minutes."
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:25.320]   And then the Apple employees scurried off the stage saying, "Thank you, bye."
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.960]   The audience had a lot of questions about the App Store.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.160]   As we all do, about the process, about, you know, what's going on.
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.160]   Why is it taking so long to do updates?
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:39.360]   Marco, in his read his blog post, is very perturbed about the way Apple runs its App Store
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.800]   business and feels it's really unfair to developers.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:47.720]   I mean, again, we get to the same conversations.
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.320]   It seems as though Apple has nothing to say and no justifiable.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:57.080]   They basically are asking the questions that were liable to ask them are going to be, "Please
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.920]   explain your irrational behavior."
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.760]   And the only explanation is our behavior is irrational.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.320]   Where ways are mysterious and do not tip the best of knowledge, you know, one.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:12.360]   It's a bad, I mean, the way I heard of it wasn't just, this guy had a big slide deck
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.040]   and he just blew right through them.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:18.400]   Not only that, but the Apple folks were in the front row who were nominally there to
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.560]   field Q&A afterward.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.040]   They also bailed very quickly.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.120]   I guess they got confronted in the hallway afterward and they were forced to answer some
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:29.280]   questions, but the answers were more of, "We can't answer that."
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.480]   Well, I'm sorry, we're not talking about that.
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.800]   Good question, but we can't talk about this at that time, which explains why they bailed
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.120]   because they knew that they really didn't have anything to say.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.600]   I mean, this is going to become a bigger and bigger problem as the months go by until
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.480]   Apple simply says, "We are now too big and this problem has become too annoying not
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.680]   only for developers but also for us that we're going to have to essentially create our own
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:54.160]   agency whose job it is to run this part of our program."
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.840]   The issues that developers are having are things like unpredictable release times.
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.880]   You can't charge for an update.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.560]   You can't refund a customer.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.040]   I mean, it goes on and on and on.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.200]   It's a very difficult store to work with.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.000]   And the real problem is, of course, the approval process, which is a completely opaque.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.240]   What worries me double is that one of the excellent new features of iPhone 3.0 is that
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:21.840]   external hardware, like custom design, external hardware, can now communicate very intimately
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.400]   with iPhone apps.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.120]   My dream app is just a keyboard that I buy for a little pocket keyboard I buy for 50
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.840]   bucks that comes with a word processor.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:35.640]   That I can actually work process, word compatible documents as I go.
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:40.440]   And think about 100 different items like this that where, "Wow, this could do so well if
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.440]   I were to simply use this as the dock connector for this."
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:46.400]   And then that would be the controller for this wonderful little application.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:52.040]   It's hard enough to convince a developer that to devote many, many hours of his own personal
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.520]   development time to build an app that may or may not get approved.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.000]   It's even harder when these are professional software houses where, "Okay, we're going
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.680]   to budget $45,000 to build this app on the basis that we think that will sell a lot more
[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.960]   than $45,000 for the downloads."
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.440]   And taking the risk that, "Okay, well, maybe it might get refused."
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:16.200]   Now, add onto that the problem that we're going to have to spend $500,000 to design the
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.160]   electronics of this device to get the tooling up and going, to get the testing up and going,
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:25.520]   to get maybe even FCC approval for this thing, only to know that, "Well, maybe the attendant
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.680]   app that makes this run will not work."
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.680]   Now, there's another conversation that I've had with Apple earlier that external hardware
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:38.880]   is going to be handled by the iPod hardware program and not by the App Store program,
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.720]   but 6.5,000 or the other.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:44.960]   If Apple decides to simply not approve that little word processing app that makes the
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.760]   keyboard work, well, there's no point in making the keyboard, is there?
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:52.760]   Well, I think so, but I think that if you're spending a significant amount of money on
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   development, I think that there's a conversation.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:03.240]   When I'm trying to figure out what we can and can't do, it is a matter of going through
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:08.720]   the channels and their pretty traditional channels, figuring out and doing tests.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:13.400]   I mean, a lot of the stuff we did with the, I just know that I find that the podcast management
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.400]   is a little opaque.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:17.600]   It's not much different than the apps store.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:22.840]   There was a lot of just trial and error that we did on our end to figure out what worked
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:27.120]   and what would make sense, and we're still figuring it out.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.320]   And some of it is talking to people at Apple, but a lot of it was posting stuff and seeing
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.320]   what happens and measuring it.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:35.600]   And you throw the fence, yeah.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.920]   Well, you throw things at the wall and you see what sticks and you see what doesn't stick
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:44.560]   and you see where it shows up and you slowly triangulate exactly the best way to release
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:48.160]   a new show or to promote a new show to make sure it works.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.160]   And there's plenty of things that still frustrate me about, you know, for instance, the podcast
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:59.120]   area of iTunes, but it's still, it's still where 90% of my podcasts or our content on
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.440]   a pixel for the pixel core gets downloaded.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.280]   So I'm not, I'm complaining, but not that much.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:06.320]   Yeah, you know, it's tougher for app developers.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.920]   I mean, that's really there.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:13.440]   They're facing some real difficulties, you know, this is not unlike every other channel
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.760]   distribution problem you'll hear from any kind of manufacturer though.
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.080]   This is not new.
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:23.960]   I mean, people who want to sell books and videos and posters at Walmart have to go through
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.160]   a series of Byzantine rules.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.880]   It doesn't matter where you want to sell your product, you're going to have to deal with
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.880]   it.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.280]   Now I'll say this, I wish that they were a little more transparent about it and I wish
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.840]   it were easier to figure out what you're supposed to do.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.360]   I do believe that that does hamper some development.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:44.120]   On the other hand, knowing that you've got the power of that thing behind you, there's
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:49.400]   no other business I can think of that you can get into where you have the potential distribution
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:53.680]   partner of somebody with the cloud of Apple at such a low fee.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.960]   Now what could Apple do?
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:58.040]   They could charge more money than the developers would scream about that.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:01.840]   They'd say, well, I don't want to pay that extra percentage, but it's probably extremely
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.880]   expensive to manage and run this operation.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:09.920]   I've had talks with companies before about these sorts of things and one of the things
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.480]   I would for instance would have loved to see Apple do someday is to have an app store
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.520]   for photographers where you could sell your photographs or whatever.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:23.640]   But just imagine what it would like to have a million people send in their photos.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.640]   How are you going to manage that?
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:25.800]   Who's going to pay for the bandwidth?
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:27.520]   Who's going to pay for the administration?
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:31.920]   There's a real hard dollar cost and Apple has to run a business.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:34.360]   They have to be holding to their stockholders.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.720]   I think they could have done it a little bit better.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.320]   But I just think the people complaining are people who are complaining without having
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.320]   had real world experience.
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.440]   I don't care where you want to sell your product.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:47.320]   Costco, Walmart, Sears, you've got to go through this same stuff.
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.320]   Live with it.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.240]   Not necessarily true.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:55.120]   The problem with the app store is that if you talk about a poster one to be sold through
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:58.480]   Walmart, if Walmart turns me down I can go to Costco.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.440]   If Costco turns me down I can go to any other store.
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.400]   If all of them turn me down, well, what do you know?
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.560]   I'll just run it out of my garage and I'll sell them out of my garage.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.080]   As long as the postal inspectors aren't going to get angry about it, that's not a problem.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.960]   The problem is that if Apple says no, that's it and a story.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.560]   This piece of software is not going to exist and it's not going to get sold.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:20.760]   And so even as just a good faith gesture, Apple needs to demonstrate that they are good
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:24.040]   custodians and good gatekeepers of software going into the app store.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:27.760]   They really need to be able to say here is exactly the reason why we did not allow this
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:29.480]   piece of software in.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.480]   Take it or leave it.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:37.840]   With regard to that point, I tend to maybe agree with you, Andy, but you still face that same
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:43.680]   kind of thing, maybe not because the app store is the number one place to sell the apps.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.200]   You could sell apps otherwise, but you can't get them to work on the phone if Apple won't
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.200]   approve them.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.200]   So that part I agree with.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:53.040]   But beyond that, everything else you're seeing here is what people have to go through to
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.880]   sell retail anywhere.
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:56:03.200]   Well, and the other thing is that if this is really that problematic, you can't sell it
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.960]   for the iPhone, but you could create something for the Android or for the pre or so on and
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:11.840]   so forth, that would be more like going to Best Buy instead of Walmart.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:14.520]   Walmart is the biggest market that you can get into.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.360]   And if they don't go to another phone and develop for it.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.760]   And all I'd say is that there are 35, is it 35,000 applications right now?
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.160]   I mean, somebody's getting through the sample.
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.160]   Apple said 50.
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:30.400]   So 50,000 apps and they've just downloaded over a billion of them.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.400]   I mean, somebody's getting through the SIV.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:36.240]   And I would say that I just think people who are having trouble are pushing the outer
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:44.720]   bounds of what, and we develop for Apple and I constantly consider the middle road.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.240]   I do not, when I'm developing for Apple, part of the cost is, is that because we develop
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:52.520]   plug-ins, so it has to work inside of Apple products.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:54.000]   And we take the middle road on it.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.680]   We do not try to push the outer envelope of what is going to be a problem for Apple.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:59.080]   And we're very successful at that.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.400]   That is a point that Marco makes.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.520]   There's a big difference between developing for a Mac and developing for the iPhone.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.440]   I mean, you could sell it yourself on the Mac.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:09.600]   You can't sell it without Apple and you have to go through their Byzantine process and
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:12.200]   their opaque approval process.
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:14.960]   You act as if you can tell what Apple's going to turn down.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.960]   You really can't.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:19.680]   Well, I mean, the stuff that has been, that I've seen turned down, the stuff that I've
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:22.840]   seen turned down so far is stuff that I would have looked at and gone, yeah, we're not
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:23.840]   going to bother.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.840]   You know, like we wouldn't bother doing that.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:28.760]   But there are also developers out there who have updates that have been hanging fire for
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.280]   two months.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   You can't charge for up.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   There's a lot.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.280]   Anyway, Marco makes some good points.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.440]   I could see why developers are upset, but I also can see why they stick around because
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.360]   they can also make a lot of money.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.920]   It's, you know, Apple is providing you with a platform.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.840]   They're providing you with a channel.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:48.840]   If Apple would let me sell my photographs in a app store like situation, I'd do whatever
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:50.360]   I had to do to do it.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:55.280]   I mean, whatever it was, I would do it because you would never have that.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:59.280]   I mean, when I run the app at your nature photography workshop for Apple and they put
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.840]   it on their homepage, do you know what?
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.240]   It's every single time without exception as much as we try to prepare for it, it shuts
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.240]   down our server.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.240]   Right.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.240]   Right.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:14.920]   I mean, to have that kind of cloud, you know, me personally, I would say, well, sometimes,
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:18.880]   you know, it's tough, but the potential rewards are amazing.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.560]   I do agree that this is a very sticky point when it comes to the approval process.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:28.400]   I do think that there are some accountability issues there that should be addressed.
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:32.200]   Apple should make it clear what you have to do or not do to get into the store because
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.520]   when you can control what gets onto the phone altogether, that is different.
[00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.240]   Andy's point is right there.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.120]   Everything else, it's just whining to me.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:45.800]   It's a chance to make a lot of money for doing very little work and in terms of the retail
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.800]   side.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:48.720]   I'm not saying it's very little work to develop, but it's very little work on the
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.720]   retail side.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:51.920]   You just let them be the retail store.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.400]   And the fact is no matter how many people whine about every aspect of Apple and the
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:02.760]   iPhone, everybody continues to support it and it tends to be the most popular, you know,
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:05.800]   phone in that class and all that stuff's happening for a reason.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:09.400]   Well, I think the reason that you think you think your brother Josh is a great guy.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.800]   You just wish he didn't drink so much.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.400]   That doesn't mean that you're going to go.
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:13.400]   That's exactly it.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.880]   You just wish he didn't drink so much.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:15.880]   Right.
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:16.880]   That's a good analogy.
[00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:21.720]   So does he drink?
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:26.720]   My mom and dad, they kept having girls until they had a boy and said, yes, it all is right
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   and correctly.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.560]   We are now done.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:29.560]   We are done.
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:31.560]   All right.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:35.560]   Well, I mean, the good news is there's competition.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:37.720]   There is a Walmart.
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.880]   There's a pre-and a number of, I'm sure a number of developers are saying, well, we're
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.800]   just going to see if the pre takes up, we'll maybe do it for the pre instead or we'll do
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.960]   it for the blackberry.
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.720]   There is a choice in that regard anyway.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.720]   Right.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.720]   All right.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.720]   We're going to get to our picks of the week in just a second.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.320]   Gentlemen, line your software up.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:58.320]   I'm definitely afraid somebody else will have picked this one, but hey, okay, we'll just
[00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:59.480]   stay away from my pick.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:02.480]   Maybe I'll go first, then I'll be screwing you instead.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.280]   Oh, no, I'll do it.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:09.320]   More Chinese fantasies are we getting here?
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.320]   I might have a conflict now that I think of it.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.760]   I might not be on my way.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.400]   Have a great time staying home in Boston area.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.600]   Now we're going to talk about audible right now audible.com/macbreak.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.520]   I'm starting to load up the iPhone with books for the trip to China.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.520]   Are you Andy?
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.360]   Are you doing any China specific reading these days to get ready for the trip?
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.200]   Yes, as a matter of fact, I don't have, unfortunately I don't have the book in front of me, but at
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.480]   WWDC, I had like a large group dinner with a whole bunch of developers and one of them
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:45.720]   actually lives in Beijing and living there for like three, four years and set me hip
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.720]   to.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.920]   Of course, of course it's obvious, but it doesn't occur to like a stupid like tourist that there
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.080]   is, of course, in China, in a major Chinese city, there is American town.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.440]   Oh, I never thought of that.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.480]   So probably there's like the there's a West side and an East side of the city.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.400]   There's one side that you go to if you sort of want to make bump into people who speak
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.800]   English and you can get a hot dog and then there's the other side that is very, very
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.560]   much like where you are and the culture you're in.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.120]   And he recommended a book that is all about the very, very true history of the city going
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.120]   back to you.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.120]   I want to read that long, long way.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.400]   And so as a matter of fact, I have it written this one of those things that haven't gotten
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.560]   to, but you reminded me to make sure I order that book on Amazon.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.640]   And send me the info.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.360]   What I was doing, what I've been doing is downloading language lessons.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.960]   You know, we talk about audible as a as a purveyor of fine literature.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.320]   And of course they are, but they also have language.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.240]   So there's Chinese for beginners here.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.480]   There's Chino da Kata di, I don't know, everyday Chinese, but that's for Spanish speakers.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:49.400]   I don't think it's going to be so useful for me.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.160]   She know that I'm not Spanish.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.640]   I think it's not funny.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.400]   Yeah, I can't get that English to Chinese things.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.160]   So I'm going to try learning Spanish first and then work from there.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.720]   Here's the one I'm going to get though.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.240]   People phrases, China Chinese lesson one 60 less.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.640]   He's going to rest me.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   Yeah, whatever you want to the girl, but leave me alone, please.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.560]   I am not a journalist.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.560]   Really.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.960]   I think the guy in the side burns a smuggling microfill.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.400]   Yeah, I wonder if that's in there.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:17.400]   Which luggage is here?
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.240]   That would be really useful.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:25.400]   Audible dot com before I travel, I always go to audible and download books, information,
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:30.320]   hardship, lessons, whatever it is that I need to take with me because it's on your iPod
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:34.960]   or your iPhone or your Zoom or your Kindle or your GPS.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.440]   It's there with you the whole time.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:40.760]   It really is a great way to carry a lot of literature in a very small space and listen
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.000]   and learn.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.920]   I was just talking to a woman at the airport, a Chicago airport, we were waiting for a flight
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.280]   and she was talking about, oh, I'm listening to a great, it wasn't even like I'm reading.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.000]   I'm listening to this great book and she goes off on and on.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.480]   I said, that's available and audible, right?
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.000]   She goes, yep, that's exactly where I got it.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.320]   She went and it was just, it's the first time I've talked to someone in the wild.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.120]   You know, like, you know, like, like other than like my clothes, like people, just a random
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.760]   person who they're not, they're not even referring back to a book anymore.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.680]   They're just saying, this is what I'm listening to right now.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.600]   They don't say, read, they say, listen, listen to this.
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.440]   I'm listening to this from them everywhere.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:17.280]   So just a, just as a little important thing, Andy, you might want to know this phrase, very
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.280]   important.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:21.120]   Let me see if I can play it for you.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:23.560]   Well, I guess it's not that important.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.560]   Come on.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.560]   Oh, never mind.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.800]   Yeah, I was trying.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:33.240]   Believe it or not, I found this, this application, another thing that I don't have, Andy with
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:41.760]   me, but I should give it to you, this application that teaches you Chinese writing by sort of,
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.840]   it almost turns into like an amazing race challenge where you just see this thing.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.040]   Basically have to figure out what the strokes are, what order they come into.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.920]   And then you simply, the judge simply says, nope, that's not it.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:52.920]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.320]   It's verse the down stroke, then the curl and then the dash that, oh, because it starts
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.320]   off with the pick.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320]   That's right.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320]   You have to do it in the order.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.480]   Well, this is what I was, this is what I was going to show you was the difference between
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.600]   men and women for toilets.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.840]   It's very important that you learn this.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.600]   The character knew for men.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.520]   Good news is a character for female and non is the character meant.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:15.880]   Know that difference.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.960]   And then they have a little quiz on here.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.760]   So which bathroom do you go into?
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.280]   Mm, d-d-d-d-d-d.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.040]   The picture to the right, that bush looks very, very inviting.
[01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.480]   That's the one I would choose as well, Andy.
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:34.700]   And that's why you and I are going to share a jail cell.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:41.120]   Anyway, audible.com/macbreak is a place to go to sign up for your gold account.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.980]   And the first book is free.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:44.700]   That's what we like about Audible.
[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:46.200]   They want you to try before you buy.
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:50.320]   And there's so many great choices, whether it's literature, you know, it's Bloomsday.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:54.720]   I wonder if they should-- we should see if they have Ulysses.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.240]   This is Bloomsday, you know, June 16th.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.240]   It's the day that Ulysses takes place.
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.680]   Ulysses is the perfect, like, audit--
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.440]   Yeah, because you can't read it, really.
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:09.080]   Well, because you can basically start to go to bed, start playing, and then when you
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:11.480]   wake up, you find the tape is at the according to the end.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:12.480]   You can say yes.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.240]   I've made it all the way through Ulysses.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.440]   James Joyce, amazing novel.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:22.720]   I actually like it, and there are several versions of Ulysses.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.960]   Abridged and unabridged.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:30.080]   I'm going to go with the unabridged by-- narrated by Jim Norton and Marcelo Reardon.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.120]   You know, on Bloomsday, you're supposed to actually listen to the whole book all the
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.120]   way through.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.080]   You know, that thing's so long that the first guy, his son, had to finish reading it
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:39.080]   for him.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:42.240]   27 hours, 21 minutes, normally $104.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.240]   Wow.
[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:44.800]   But you can get it for free.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:46.800]   Audible.com/--
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.800]   Here's a little Ulysses.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.040]   I wonder if they do the last part.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.600]   I'm having trouble getting my audio out of my-- Mac.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:55.120]   I'm going to have to fix that.
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.120]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.120]   You can go listen for yourself.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:02.680]   You think of so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.280]   Now it's time for the moment you've all been waiting for.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.280]   The picks of the week we will start with the man is sitting right across from me.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.280]   Alex Lindsay.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280]   The pressure.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.280]   The pressure.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.280]   Just don't pick mine.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.280]   Oh.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.280]   I don't think I will.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:16.280]   Okay.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.280]   Mine's free.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:24.400]   Mine is-- well, you can get a free version, but mine is $14.95.
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.320]   And this one I'm going to-- I suddenly realized I should find out who suggested this.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:35.120]   So this is someone actually-- a Twitter follower put me in touch or sent me to this website.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:43.320]   So many people have heard that I will complain a lot about the doc.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.480]   So I don't like the doc very much.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:45.480]   Yes.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   I know that.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   You hide it.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:48.480]   You get rid of it.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:52.520]   Well, I constantly talk about how nice it would be to have the doc turned off.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:57.960]   And so anyway, so I had a suggestion and I'm trying to find it really quickly, but I can't
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:00.720]   now from a Twitter follower.
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.680]   And it's called Doc Gone.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:05.680]   Okay.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:09.440]   And this is-- it is such a great-- and I apologize to the person I can't find right
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.440]   now.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.640]   Someone-- I got a lot of retweets of my last Twitter thing.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640]   And so now I can't find the pages.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.880]   It's a scroll off.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:22.700]   So anyway, so this is it's called Docgon and it's made by old dash jewel.com old jewel
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:26.920]   software that make lots of little apps this is share where you can download it. It's the
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:31.080]   full version is thirteen dollars and ninety five cents and worth every penny now because
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.440]   what it does it's it's a preference pain and once you install it you simply set up a key
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:42.520]   stroke that will turn your doc off. Love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:49.580]   When you're doing when you're doing professional apps no matter what side you put the doc it
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:54.440]   pops out when you don't want it to. So I'm on final cutter. I'm in shake or I'm in motion
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:59.340]   or in cinema 40 or Moto or whatever and there's always something wrong with the doc popping
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:03.540]   up and it drives me absolutely crazy and this turns it off. You just hit a key stroke
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:07.500]   boom it's gone. It's called Docgon. It's thirteen ninety five for the full version.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:12.220]   You can download it free trial. Once again old jewel software and I highly suggest that
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.820]   I want them to be successful because it was such a great a great it's very well implemented
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:21.360]   to I had a version I had an apple script that did this. But it it what it actually deleted
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:28.160]   it like you would buy off from the from the resources not read and yeah it caused a Photoshop
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:32.600]   to crash which is all well I decided probably got to stop. This is a much kinder gentler
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:37.700]   sort of way to do it. I haven't had any stability issues after installing it. So anyway doc
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:44.840]   on Docgon. Docon. Docon. You hate the doc so much that you would change careers in order
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:48.200]   to find a job that did not require Photoshop so that you could continue to like use this
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:53.920]   utility. Yeah the cross the thought had crossed my mind. But no I just don't understand why
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:59.480]   we can't turn it off and now I don't need to because I can't. Hey yeah. Now of course
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:06.080]   as soon as snow leopard comes out of breaks but maybe not updates updates Andy not go
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:14.180]   your next my friend. My pick is an iPhone application. No I was hoping that Leah would
[01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:19.420]   say oh no they probably pick mine is not so far I'm in the clear I'm going to say is
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:26.580]   a Mac file utility. Oh no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mac file utility you got a little close.
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:32.060]   I'm cringing. Oh. Mine is an iPhone utility. The one of the weird things about apps in
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:38.940]   the app store is that. Oh God I mean the different software developers just firehose
[01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:44.100]   the app store with 14 different versions of the same basic tool and the difficulty is
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:49.140]   that oftentimes you'll see G. I which here are eight different camera applications I wish
[01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:53.620]   I could get the self timer from this version the photo editing from that version and the
[01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:57.460]   library features and the posting features of this version because those that's the one
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:03.060]   feature I like from every one of these things and for me I spent a lot of time buying dashboard
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:08.940]   apps for the you know what if you have a car mount for my iPhone and that thing that
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:14.940]   gives you useful information about how you're driving while also removing the temptation
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:19.500]   to just what and I just put move that into the Twitter client and I can just sort of
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:24.620]   like look to see if I'm getting any tweets and like that there's a whole bunch of different
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:28.940]   apps available and all of them have like one or two things that I sort of like but I finally
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:34.460]   found the one that it's updated two or three times that has every single feature that I
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:39.820]   like from every other dashboard app it's called a smart H. U. D. and I've got it on my
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:47.220]   iPhone here. Oh and it is absolutely everything that I want this app to be number one it's
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:51.780]   it's very very pretty. It looks like sort of thing that would be developed for the console
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:56.220]   of your car not like a little apple not like an application that was bashed out in just
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:01.220]   in just a day or two. Secondly a lot of them work like this but this one also works like
[01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:07.300]   this because the auto rotate is enabled because I have mine like just mounted in the car mount
[01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:14.260]   like this so that I can like operate the music player and other features like that with it
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:19.020]   in this orientation but on top of everything at that everything like that it has every
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:23.020]   feature that I want. I want the I want the speed indicator I want the compass so that
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:28.740]   I can see what heading I'm onto now this version just uses the GPS information to sort of figure
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:33.260]   out what direction you're heading I'm betting that when the 3GS comes out the updated version
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:39.140]   that gets that directly from the from the magnetometer but it will also tell you you
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:44.340]   can also set three different tiers of speed limits so that I simply have it set to please
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:50.420]   give me a gentle alert at 35 miles an hour 55 miles an hour and 70 miles an hour so whether
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:54.580]   I'm driving locally or driving on the highway or driving to another state where the speed
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:59.900]   limit is 55 and not 65 it's not it's not a junk jerk jerk yourself out of your seat
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.340]   and smash your head to the center of it's such a loud alert it is simply it's just a
[01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:07.540]   little tone that says oh I must have just gone above 70 miles an hour it'll give you trip
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:12.500]   time it'll give you a distance on this trip it will also there are two versions one will
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:17.780]   also alert you to the presence of speed cameras nearby it will give you well that's that's
[01:12:17.780 --> 01:12:23.260]   that plus speedcams it's same press so you should skip right yeah the colors now don't
[01:12:23.260 --> 01:12:26.700]   be bamboozed by the color scheme in the app store the color scheme the app store looks
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:32.620]   incredibly ugly but this one is by default it's very very tasteful very very simple
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:37.700]   and like I said it's exactly what what I'm looking for it's a utility it's a dashboard
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:42.220]   thing it gives me the I can just glance at it for like half a second and it's like another
[01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:45.860]   rearview mirror really it just gives me the information that I want incredibly quickly
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:51.620]   and lets me put my eyes back on the road where they belong 99 cents buy buy buy it for me
[01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:56.060]   it makes it makes you wonder when when someone's gonna make one of these great little cars
[01:12:56.060 --> 01:12:59.500]   that just lets you take the dashboard and just pop your iPhone and oh would that be cool
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.860]   be awesome it could be even better than that this is another one of those really great opportunities
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:08.940]   now that you can build hardware that communicates with iPhone software almost every car built
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:15.460]   after I think 1999 2000 within like the last seven or eight years actually has a standard
[01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:20.020]   data jack under the dashboard and so you can go on Amazon right now and buy these little
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:24.340]   dashboard monitors that will take information directly from your car's computer right so
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:27.620]   it'll tell you here's what your fuel efficiency is this one of them that's even designed to
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:31.540]   be a coach to just give you a light on your on your dashboard on the indicator that simply
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:36.380]   says you're driving very green very well oh no you're not driving in a very fuel inefficient
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:41.900]   way I cannot wait to see what happens when I can buy like a $50 or a $60 hardware car
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:46.460]   kit that puts not only the dashboard adapter that gives me the audio not only powers the
[01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:50.500]   thing but also lets me run an app that simply says here's how your car is going right now
[01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:55.340]   here's exactly how fast it's going not based on GPS but based on the computer and underneath
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:14:00.420]   your hood your car things is doing 58 miles an hour so guess what I'm just gonna say you're
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:05.500]   doing 58 miles an hour that's gonna be so I might have to buy a new car just to have
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:09.500]   a newer car that has that feature on it you want that one application for the iPhone
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:14.420]   well I just think I think I think it would be totally reasonable for a car manufacturer
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.180]   especially now the car manufacturers are trying to think outside the box of just literally
[01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.420]   having a version of the car that you get especially if a media pad a larger version of the iPhone
[01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:26.820]   came out of having a car that was literally you know you an option could be I don't want
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:32.060]   the dashboard I just want a slot for my media phone to pop in where I have my all my data
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:36.380]   I have direct connection to the engine I have you know all that information you know I think
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:40.820]   that would make a make a lot of sense I was actually I was actually considering that that
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:47.380]   once I had to buy two iPhone 3G's to write in the least edition of my iPhone book and
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:51.100]   I've got these I've got this like hour and a half commute several times a day excuse me
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:54.300]   several times a week and occurred to me that she you know I don't really look at the speed
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:58.260]   monitor anymore I look at these like little speed box programs you know instead of the
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:02.500]   dashboard what would prevent me from just like putting a strip of velcro like on top
[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:06.820]   of the dashboard like that just installing this so I can look at it through the steering
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:10.540]   wheel as I drive instead of having to have it in the amount I've been trying to I've
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:15.260]   been actually trying to figure out how to get because I have a GPS unit in my in my
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:19.460]   CRX I'm actually thinking of building this nice little soft pad that I can put over over
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:24.060]   top of the Jeep over the top of the the GPS that won't hurt it so my wife can go back to
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:29.020]   using it but I can have my little iPhone in there and just run my turn by turn my my
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:33.820]   music everything else you know from where the GPS unit is sitting right now because I
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:40.260]   it is so like using rocks after using you know the iPhone for for mapping.
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:48.220]   How about staying alive how does it do that not you staying alive the program oh I thought
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:54.500]   I stayed alive.
[01:15:54.500 --> 01:16:01.500]   Actually no as you can see I've even on battery I essentially turn this on about 15 20 minutes
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.420]   so it just keeps it keeps itself.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:07.940]   It will keep itself alive and obviously if you have the music player in the background
[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.660]   it'll stay alive and stay lit in the foreground.
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:14.180]   Obviously you would not want to have this just on battery all the time running this
[01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:18.620]   application but it's a absolutely it does absolutely the appropriate thing that should
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:23.060]   be doing when it's mounted in your dashboard so yeah there that's that's another feature
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:27.020]   that's a problem with some of these other applications where it's like I'm driving and
[01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:31.860]   the screen goes dark and I'm like did it not occur to you sir that I might actually be
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.740]   using this in the car.
[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:37.420]   Might not have to simply reach over and have the screen every time that I was.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:41.540]   Yeah that's what I was worried about that's good to know that it keeps it stays alive.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:42.540]   That's good.
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:46.780]   What feature on the less laws to have a big cartoon app cartoon hand leave out of the
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:51.700]   screen just slap you silly but I don't know how they do that so there is a way to tell
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.900]   the iPhone don't go to don't go don't sleep on me.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:56.900]   I guess I don't know but I don't know why they do.
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:57.900]   That's cool.
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.540]   Some do some don't.
[01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:03.540]   Thank you Andy now one more chance for me to get screwed and that's going to be Scott
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:04.540]   Borne.
[01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:11.500]   Don't use any of the guesses that we've used we know that it's not an iPhone app so make
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:15.180]   sure.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:19.620]   There's no chance I'm going to pick something I'm pretty sure you've never used.
[01:17:19.620 --> 01:17:22.220]   Excellent I like that even better.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:24.820]   Fluid Mask 3 is my pick of the week.
[01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:28.300]   That's when you have like a sinus thing and you keep it in the fridge and then you pull
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.100]   over your eyes.
[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.900]   It's very comfortable.
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:37.300]   Surprise surprise it's a photographer's application works on max $150 available from
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:44.500]   Verus Tech V-E-R or Veritas Tech V-E-R-T-U-S-T-E-C-H.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:49.940]   This is a cool program if you have to mask somebody out of a still photograph.
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:54.140]   You can use this program to do it and what's really cool is if they have wild hair it even
[01:17:54.140 --> 01:17:58.700]   masks around the hair.
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:03.340]   It says it's user friendly it does have a little bit steeper learning curve than they
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:06.420]   imply but once you get the hang of it it's no big deal.
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:10.260]   It's very fast rendering speeds very fast.
[01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:15.500]   It does work with a Wacom tablet or Wacom tablet depending on how you pronounce that.
[01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:22.940]   Works even for Windows but the thing I like about it is that it allows way more control
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:28.140]   than Photoshop does and it actually works stand alone without Photoshop.
[01:18:28.140 --> 01:18:32.740]   You don't even need Photoshop you can just run an image through this and it now goes
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:34.420]   full screen something I never did before.
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:38.620]   I've used it for a while but if you need to mask somebody out of a photograph so you can
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.780]   put them into a different photograph.
[01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:43.700]   I'm sure Alex has something that does stuff like this for video and maybe even for stills
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:48.660]   but for the lowly still photographer this is one that I like.
[01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:49.660]   The fluid mask is very powerful.
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:52.500]   I've heard this yeah a lot of people recommend it very very good.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:53.500]   This is the one.
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:54.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:55.980]   Yep that's the one for me.
[01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:56.980]   That's a 50 bucks.
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:57.980]   Can you try before you buy?
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:59.540]   Yeah there's a free trial.
[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:00.540]   Free trial.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:01.540]   Cool.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:05.700]   E-R-T-U-S-T-E-C-H dot com.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:06.860]   Fluid mask three.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:11.220]   Just search Google from Fluid Mask three if you forget the URL.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:14.900]   If you do this sort of thing you'll want to invest the time and the money to learn this.
[01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:18.740]   Now if you don't do a lot of masking don't worry about it.
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:22.580]   But if you're always putting Oprah's head on Anne Margaret's body this is for you.
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:25.140]   And when you look at the hundred fifty dollars it's really for people who you have to do this
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.140]   all the time.
[01:19:26.140 --> 01:19:27.140]   Right.
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:28.140]   You have to pay you a lot of time.
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:31.460]   There's a lot of ways of doing this kind of work in Photoshop without adding anything but
[01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:33.300]   if you're doing a lot of it it's not worth it.
[01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:35.460]   You want to get a specialized tool that does it well.
[01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:39.020]   And we'll add the Mophie Juice Pack Air to your recommendations as well Scott.
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:43.460]   Yeah well I can't say that it really works because I've just all I've got is the Juice
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.460]   Pack.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:45.460]   Right.
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:46.460]   I don't have the phone yet.
[01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.460]   Right.
[01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.460]   From the back people think you have an iPhone.
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:50.460]   Yeah that's true.
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:51.460]   Just hold it up.
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:52.460]   Ooh.
[01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:53.460]   Is that the new one?
[01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:56.740]   The one thing I will say is the other one I have which I cannot remember the name of did
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:58.740]   have that little light in the corner.
[01:19:58.740 --> 01:19:59.740]   Right.
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:02.100]   Because that one I can't remember the name of it either but it's bigger.
[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.180]   It's not written in number one it's not written anywhere on the device.
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.420]   I forget it every time.
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:11.060]   And I know in fact the chat room let me go look at the chat room they're probably saying
[01:20:11.060 --> 01:20:12.540]   the name of it.
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:13.540]   Yeah.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:18.840]   But I was impressed by the now that I hear promises of doubling my iPhone's battery life
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.060]   I certainly will never have to worry about it.
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:23.060]   Fast Mac.
[01:20:23.060 --> 01:20:24.620]   Fast Mac that's it.
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:26.620]   Thank you Sparky.
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:28.500]   Sparky in Corona got that one.
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.540]   That was the first in line.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:34.380]   So mine you know I recommend and you don't you guys don't use it but I recommend it use
[01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   it all the time.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:39.380]   Merlin Man and I used to love Quicksilver by Nicholas Jikoff Alcor.
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:43.140]   Alcor went to work for Google kind of let Quicksilver go out into the community on its
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.940]   own and it's not really been moving along very fast.
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:54.540]   Well the first result of Alcor's collaboration within Google has emerged is called the Google
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:55.540]   Quick Search box.
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:58.180]   Did you know that Google has a Mac blog?
[01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.180]   This is worth reading by the way Mac users.
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:04.380]   This is all the Mac stuff that Google's doing and this is where I found out about the quick
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:06.460]   search box.
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:10.460]   It is much like Quicksilver but I think with some nice features first of all it searches
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:16.340]   the web as well as your Macintosh so it's a desktop web search.
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:18.740]   It has some additional preferences.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:23.540]   Now I have it in addition to Quicksilver so I've got it set so that when I press the
[01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:27.620]   both command keys it launches on my screen.
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:31.580]   Kind of looks like Quicksilver a little bit except it says the word Google and then you
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.580]   can type something.
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:36.620]   Now I've got to do this carefully because if I type a name it's going to show some phone
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:41.580]   numbers so I'm not going to type my name.
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.300]   Well if I type word let's see if it works.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:48.780]   So it finds everything with the word word in it but it also finds internet sites.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:51.100]   It also finds contacts.
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.100]   There's three contacts.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:57.540]   27 songs so you can narrow it down to your music to your contacts.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:02.300]   It's a really really nice I think update to Quicksilver doesn't have some of the features
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:07.460]   that many of you have come to love with Quicksilver you know the all those advanced triggers
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:10.420]   and so forth but it's very basic but it gets the job done.
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:15.420]   I have to say for free this is they say it's a developers preview but I have yet to find
[01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:18.300]   any reason not to download it seems to be very stable to me.
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:23.060]   After all Alcor wrote Quicksilver so presumably he has some pretty good background in writing
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.820]   these kinds of applications.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:26.740]   This is available for free.
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:31.220]   If you go to googlemac.blogspot.com you can read the entry about it and the warning that
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:35.740]   it is you know a developers preview and it sounds like they're going to be adding a
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:39.460]   lot of features to this so this might be something to find out about right now.
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:44.660]   It's kind of like the quick search box on the iPhone except you can't talk to it.
[01:22:44.660 --> 01:22:47.140]   That's unfortunately maybe that's something coming along.
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:54.140]   I pick the free pick the Google quick search box just out from our friend Alcor and Google.
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:23:00.180]   Well dudes we we've come to the end of this fabulous episode I thank you so much for don't
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:04.460]   cry Alex it's going to be alright you can just come back tomorrow if you really want
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:05.460]   to.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:12.340]   Every time we say goodbye I die.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:15.740]   Are you bringing the ukulele on the trip to China by the way?
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:16.740]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:21.540]   Because you can sing that little disc doll.
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:27.220]   I just had a witty rejoinder to make it said no that's going to get me.
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.060]   Don't bring your ukulele.
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:33.220]   I will say that I might bring it depending on how much I'm packing.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:35.740]   No this is Mac related.
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:42.260]   I think all of us attended a very very popular and very very excellent Macintosh themed trade
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:48.660]   show within the past ten months and I was given a speaker bag as a gift for thank you
[01:23:48.660 --> 01:23:52.420]   that was from last year and I checked it through for WWDC to kind of fell apart.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:56.980]   So I actually have now I have to buy a new like roll away roller piece of luggage for
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:59.860]   the trip to China and I haven't bought luggage in like a year and a half.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.180]   I was using the bag from the free bag because I've still gotten around to replacing the roller
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:05.500]   bag about ten years ago.
[01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:08.420]   I have some extra bags I should I should bring a bag for you.
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:13.180]   You know I get great bags from this company called Tom bin they're up your way Scott and
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:15.660]   they just sent me for this trip.
[01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:25.260]   They have a new bag that is a kind of a carry on bag slash backpack and it's really really
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.260]   awesome.
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:32.340]   In fact I was able to get I was able to pack a week's worth of clothes and my laptop into
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:33.420]   this one bag.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.340]   So I need a new bag.
[01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:39.700]   Yeah it's called the Tristar I would I would take a look at it they really do.
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:44.860]   It's a little pricey it's 240 bucks which is a lot but it's a it's a laptop bag plus
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:45.860]   a carry on bag.
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:50.660]   I wish I'd had this for my trips to Canada because literally I got a week's worth of
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.820]   stuff in there.
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:55.020]   You can carry it or you can wear it as a backpack.
[01:24:55.020 --> 01:24:59.660]   Yeah it's really I really like this it's got the clip for the brain cell so you can put
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:04.940]   your laptop in the middle there and then they sell these packing cubes which I used to get
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:06.900]   more into the smaller space.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:10.420]   These packing cubes are really really clever anyway.
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:13.300]   Some of them aren't going to China but we still need to try.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:17.540]   You might yeah yeah I would you know you're in the area you go to the Tom Bin store in
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:19.780]   Seattle I would I think it'd be a lot of fun.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:23.420]   I have a lot anyway Andy I have a few time being bags extra they send me almost all their
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:25.620]   stuff so I'll maybe I'll let.
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:29.220]   So what I'm looking for is now this is why it's taken me a year to replace the bag that
[01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:31.220]   started falling apart like a year and a half ago.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:33.820]   I need a 24 inch like checkable roller bag.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:34.820]   You want a roller bag.
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:35.820]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:38.980]   I'm like well I have I have lots of little like overnighter and three night bags.
[01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:42.580]   What I'm looking for is the kind that I can put every all my clothes on my toiletries
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:46.020]   all my cables and stuff that I'm not going to do is carry on in one bag.
[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:50.820]   Zip it up not have to carry anything in my backpack on board that I would I would rather
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:54.980]   have packed but it's like every time I start to look at these things I think am I about
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:58.340]   to spend a hundred and eighty dollars for something that's going to break like the third
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:25:59.580]   time it goes through back.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:00.580]   Right.
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:04.020]   Oh I'm with you on some of these things are so cheesy.
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:05.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:09.820]   I almost want to buy one of those pelican like big like pelican cases that they use when
[01:26:09.820 --> 01:26:14.820]   you're like trade show to trade show to put the entire booth in because hard plastic resin
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:19.900]   composites tabs like locking down tabs nine hundred dollars but yes it will check it will
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:20.900]   work.
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:26.540]   You know I have a large we were shooting in Chicago and the end of last week for a day
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:31.420]   and I had to take a big one of those big cases and one thing I learned is that a lot of times
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:38.380]   if you've been odd quote unquote an odd sized bag you you don't stand in line because they
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:41.060]   send you to a different line they say oh go to that line and there's nobody there so
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:43.620]   now I'm starting to think that that's the way to go.
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:48.520]   I'll show you what I use for this the toughest ever it's from red ox ever here of them R
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:51.340]   E D O X X dot com.
[01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:55.020]   I don't know if they make roller bags but these things you cannot bust them.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:59.260]   I have a red ox bag and this is the toughest stuff in the world you just can't bust them
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:01.300]   but I don't know if they make a roller.
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:02.740]   I think most of it's like for carry on.
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:03.940]   I really need rollers.
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:05.140]   Yeah I like rollers.
[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:09.580]   I want to have a roller and I'm going to carry the try star on that's going to be my carry
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:12.700]   on but that's going to have that can have a week's worth of clothes in it just but I
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:15.060]   won't fill it that fall and then I'm going to do a roller.
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:16.620]   Anyway enough of that.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:18.940]   Enough of that friends let's wrap this sucker up.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:19.940]   This weekend luggage.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:23.180]   It's not about luggage I don't know why I just love bags.
[01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:27.260]   When you try anyone comes out with a lot.
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:31.020]   You said in an airport you can have a lot hour long conversations about odd little things
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.100]   about how to make it faster.
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:33.940]   I think that's how I found out about the red ox.
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:34.940]   Yeah.
