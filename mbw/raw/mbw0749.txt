[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.280]   Wedding bells are ringing. Well, for one of our panelists, we'll talk about that.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.840]   We'll also talk about the crazy rumors. There's three different sets of rumors
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.720]   from Mark Gurman, including a photable iPhone and a little bitty Mac Pro. It's all coming up next on

[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.600]   We've got Renee Richie in his position there in Montreal. Renee Richie is on YouTube at youtube.com/Renee
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.560]   Richie and he is on Team Valor.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.600]   I am on Team Valor. I am also not technically from Apple or of Apple in a handmade tail
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.000]   sort of a sense. I am just generally chatty about Apple. Chatty about Apple.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.120]   Lisa was so excited. I think it was great because you guys were in a thing together.
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.360]   What do you call those? A raid together. A raid.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.880]   Lisa was totally raid boss. She said Renee is in there. I said say hi to him. She said I can't.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.240]   It's the weirdest thing. We are talking about Pokemon Go.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.320]   And Andy and I was going...
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.080]   There are kids getting trolled if they chat.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.840]   Yeah, no chatting allowed. You can only beat up the bosses. That's it.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.520]   Also Andy and I go from WGBH in Boston. Hello Andrew.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.400]   Thank you. I am a Ronan. Masterless Samurai. Walk in the Warriors path in
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   Hido, Eira, Japan. I know. I love that. The idea of a Ronan is such a great thing.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.880]   Except for the fact that they tended to chop people's heads off kind of at a certain time.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.320]   He is also about Tussai. Himara... What is that? About Tussai. Himara...
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.520]   What's about Tussai from the... Yeah. From the Tokugawa Shogannet.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.080]   Oh. Is that mean a man without a... Without a show... Without a...
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.720]   There was a famous Japanese movie series and TV series called "Rorini Kenshin" about
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.560]   a masterless warrior Ronan during the time of the Tokugawa Shogannet.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.280]   Love that stuff.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.320]   I love that kind of... That's a good reference. I think that that reference is also referencing
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.800]   what I was referencing that was referencing, which is Usagi Miyojimbo, Stancikai,
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.480]   comic book about a rabbit Ronan samurai. All of which is based on the original
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.920]   Akira Kurosawa movie, right? Or no.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.960]   The Dolphin Cub.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.040]   Is it the other way around? I don't think Kurosawa did comic book movies.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.600]   I think the comic book did... Baby Yoda is Long Wolf and Cub.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.000]   I don't know. Well, if you believe the white academic researchers about literature,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.040]   there are only like eight stories that everything's copying.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.640]   That's true. My eighth grade English teacher said that. He said,
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.840]   "You got to read Homer. You got to read the Bible because then you got it all."
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.200]   There's nothing more.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.800]   That other famous Hollywood thing.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.840]   That's all the white guys are good.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.440]   They said there's only Snow White and Cinderella and they will always buy Snow White and never buy Cinderella.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.160]   They're only by Cinderella and never buy Sleeping Beauty. That was it.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.240]   Hey, before we go into the Apple news, congratulations to one of our former cohort members.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.640]   As you know, Laurie Gill went on, has gone on to greater things at Apple Computer.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.200]   She's there writing scripts for their YouTube channel, but she also got married.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.720]   Yes.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.960]   On the 17th. I know she didn't invite any of us, but it wasn't Instagram wedding,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.080]   so I guess we were all invited.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.440]   I heard people are doing that now, so they don't have to invite their families.
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.640]   They're all doing COVID weddings.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.440]   It's the perfect excuse.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.320]   Such a great idea. Congratulations to Laurie and her spouse, Donohoo.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.440]   Craig?
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.120]   Craig.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.320]   She never introduced us, but it's great. If you go to her tweet about it,
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.320]   she's Apple-holic-A-P-P-A-H-O-L-I-K. You'll see pretty much everybody we know.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:39.680]   Congratulating her. You feel like you're in the wedding party. It's all the Apple royalty
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.040]   in the Apple press.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.040]   It's like eloping with infrastructure.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.280]   It's a full Mandalorian wedding, I understand.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.840]   Exactly.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.120]   Yes. We're really happy for you, Laurie. Congratulations to you and Craig.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.680]   COVID wedding hashtag COVID. They look so cute together.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.520]   You might be watching, so congratulations, Laurie.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.640]   Yeah. That's nice. I'm sure if she's not, people will let her know. We'll tweet at her.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:13.200]   There is some Apple news. Last week, we're talking about Tim Cook's appearance on CBS this
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.080]   morning in the speculation about the big initiative Apple was going to launch and David
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.520]   Polk said, "Oh, maybe they're going to start doing vaxx--" Actually, it wasn't David Polk's idea.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.960]   Somebody else, Neil Seibert, I think, said it.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.600]   Neil Seibert.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.400]   Said, "The only thing they're going to do vaccination is the Apple Store." No.
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.800]   It's a major new racial equality and justice initiative, R-E-J-I.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.960]   Is the abbreviation.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.880]   Something Apple announced, what, almost a year ago? A while ago that they were going to put
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.480]   $100 million towards it. They are now talking about the specifics of it, including
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.720]   first of its kind educational hub for historically black colleges and universities.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.240]   And I love this. An Apple Developer Academy in Detroit, which is really cool.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.920]   Here's a picture of the Propel Center that they're going to build.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.680]   Wow. That's an innovation hub for the entire HBCU community.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.720]   Curriculum internships, mentorship opportunities.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.440]   This is Apple stepping up and doing what they said they were going to do, which is fantastic.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.520]   They announced it in June following the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.440]   and many others in the Black Lives Matter protests.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.000]   So this is interesting. It is a little bit in contrast to the way Steve Jobs worked.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.880]   There were no public charitable initiatives from Apple during his tenure, but Tim Cook has
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.160]   been very aggressive about pursuing this.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.040]   Yeah. It's a really great package, particularly their ongoing work with Ed Farm,
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.720]   which is the Ed Farm designed this beautiful Atlanta campus, the Propel Center.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:02.400]   Yeah. I mean, they're also like, they're basically, it's an education initiative and an
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   education program that's based in Alabama. And you get the sense that they're making the right
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.680]   moves here because all throughout the announcements and all throughout the news that's been done
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.000]   after that, isn't about Apple, a big company saying, congratulations, we're here to instill
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.240]   our benevolence on over. It's more like we are working with companies and organizations
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.760]   and grassroots organizations that have made it their mission, their mission not to manufacture
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.920]   technology and also save the world, but to specifically focus on this one problem.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.640]   So it's not enough to dump a pile of money on a problem. It needs to be put in the right directions
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.040]   and used effectively. And this doesn't look like, Oh, well, we wrote a check. And now we get to have
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.880]   a, we get to have a photo op, we're holding a giant check off to someone and that'll look good
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:08:00.080]   in the company report. It is a good example of focus contribution, focused, giving back, focused,
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.560]   making people a little less upset that tech companies have so much power over our industry
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.560]   and over our country. With Apple, you know that this is kind of this was a sincere effort
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:18.080]   as opposed to a way of diverting PR into the good column, aside from into the bad column.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.360]   But they put their money where their mouth is, is how I would put it. And that's a good thing.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.920]   And Steve, like you said, Steve was really big on not pimping your karma. You believe that
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.920]   that sort of tainted it that if you did it for recognition, or if you got recognition,
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.240]   it took away from the sheer goodness of the act where Tim Cook seems to very much feel that
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.480]   you can lead by example, that you can inspire others and that Apple has such a position that
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.520]   they can use it to, you know, and famously, I think one of the few times that Tim Cook has ever
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.920]   been riled up in public is when people complained about Apple doing in the environment and doing
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.400]   accessibility and doing things like this. And, and he said, I don't give a, I don't care about the
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.920]   bloody ROI because he believes that it's Apple's job to make a better, a better world. And you
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.640]   could say cynically that the more people that get into Apple system and Apple sites and Apple's
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.200]   economy will eventually be Apple customers. But I think they really do. I think he really is like
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.120]   a Bobby Kennedy, Malcolm Luther King type who wants to, you know, lay those golden bricks and
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.440]   make the world a better place. I think, you know, they're both both tenable positions.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.080]   Don't put your karma or on the other hand, lead by example, I think they're both tenable positions.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:32.640]   Do we know it was Steve Jobs very active in charity? I mean, he didn't publicize privately,
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.960]   apparently. Yeah, his wife certainly is now.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:43.840]   Lorraine is doing a lot of things with the money she inherited and some of it, which
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:50.400]   courses her own. Anyway, just thought I'd tell you what it was.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:56.160]   Yeah, absolutely. It does set aside. It does set my apart from other initiatives like
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.280]   Facebook and Google have been making big ways about, hey, we're addressing the housing problem
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:08.480]   in the Bay Area and for lower middle income people. But parenthetically, this is a problem that we
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:13.280]   actually kind of helped to create by moving so many people into a concentrated area and driving
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:19.680]   housing and rinse up so high. So yeah, if there's any one who's kind of seriously trying to
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.640]   criticize this, go soak your head. There's no, you're kind of too cynical about what.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.520]   Oh, so cute.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.160]   And if you're calling it political, please look up what that word actually means and stop using
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.320]   as a weapon. Thank you. In fact, not political.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.760]   I actually saw a couple commentators saying, oh, well, of course, now that the tide has turned
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.960]   and the election has gone, now that now that Tim Cook's friend from Trump is no longer going
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.560]   to be in office, they have to. Yeah, well, this was in the works for like months and months and
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:53.360]   months in this relationship with these organizations have been going going far, far beyond the current
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.400]   political, the current election cycle. So again, go soak your head.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.000]   Yeah. And no one in government likes big tech. They just dislike it differently.
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:07.040]   Yeah. Apple, some big rumors. Again, I don't like to do rumors, but this time of year,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.480]   we ain't got much else. So, so we'll do.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.720]   Our German was on fire. Let us have this.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:20.240]   A german was absolutely on fire this weekend. Two new Mac Pro high end desktops. One,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:26.320]   perhaps based on Intel, much like the existing Mac Pro, another half the size.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:32.080]   I want the cute one, the little one. And that'll be, of course, based on Apple Silicon.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.840]   That's it. I think I love that rumor. I don't know how, you know,
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:42.480]   I think the first part is not actually a rumor. I think the first part is so before Apple replaced,
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:48.320]   Apple said it was going to be a two year transition going from Intel to Apple Silicon Max. And last
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.880]   time the Mac Pro and the belated X server, the last ones, and I think it's safe to assume the
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:57.040]   Mac Pro will be the last one this time. And whether they get it done in a year or two years, that's
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.960]   a long time. And what Apple did with every other Mac is release a final Intel version
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:07.520]   before they went to the Apple Silicon version, so that for people who work in jobs where they're
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.440]   not sure about the software compatibility, or they just don't want Apple Silicon until it's
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.800]   like a couple of years mature, they can get the best version possible of Intel. And my guess is,
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.640]   that's all that's what that other Mac Pro is. It's that last Intel version that any studio can
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.760]   buy a bunch of if they're at all worried and sort of get three or five years out of them if they have
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.520]   to. Yeah, I had a guy on the radio show who does music production. He said, well,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:37.040]   Pro Tools, not only does Pro Tools not run on the M1, it doesn't run on Big Sur.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:45.600]   So, but that's the way it is in these businesses in verticals, particularly, not necessarily
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.960]   creatives, but in verticals, there is a lag time. And so it would make sense.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.520]   Germin didn't say outright they will make an Intel Mac Pro, but it does make a lot of sense,
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.920]   doesn't it? Yeah, on top of everything else, you have to remember that a lot of these
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.800]   organizations, they have to deal with certifications where they're not so they don't even allow people
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.840]   to buy or put in purchase orders for hardware that it's not on the list of hardware that has
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.920]   been determined by a different apartment to be suitable for purpose. And so that's why there's
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.120]   going to be a lag. And also we get really excited about the about the new hardware. We get excited
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.560]   also because we see we recognize this as a turning point for Apple. Some of us get excited because
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.880]   we haven't bought new Macs in eight years and we've for super overdue for a new one. But you've
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.240]   realized that this is going to be a case of for most people, whenever their current Mac is no longer
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:38.880]   suitable for purpose in the next one, two or three years, then they're going to replace it with what's
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.600]   going to be an Apple Silicon Mac. So they've so Apple certainly has time to roll things out.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:49.360]   Someone actually was a direct messaging me last night because they are asking for advice. Well,
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:58.640]   I I I I'm tempted to replace my Intel my 2018 Intel Mac mini and my and my Macbook error like with
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:04.800]   a new Macbook M1. And I'm saying that, well, look, you know, you don't have to do it right now. This is
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.160]   the it's it's a really good first outing. But the next outings are going to be much more suitable
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:18.080]   for people like you who are trying to combine one make one $1, $2,500 $3,000 purchase to to combine
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.480]   all your harasses into one. We still have a limit of of the memory. We still have a limit regarding
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:28.240]   the IO. Those are both going to be problems for anybody who is not trying to replace essentially
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.880]   a Macbook air. If you're looking to replace a Macbook air, go ahead, you're going to be very happy with
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.600]   it. But if this is going to be your 4k editing deck for the next three, four, five years,
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:44.560]   and your current editing deck is perfectly fine. Maybe you will be much, much benefited by waiting
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:50.960]   a year to I can't wait for the for if there is a mini Mac pro coming. That is what I'm putting my
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.200]   checkles towards that is that that is matter of fact that rumor or that concept or the correct the
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:00.320]   correctness of that that idea is what kind of spurred me on to say you know what this was.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.760]   I was kind of on the fence about buying a somewhat underpowered again based on IO
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.760]   Macbook Pro. But given that this will be my portable Mac and I will be buying for two or three thousand
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   dollars the really, really big powerful desktop for all the stuff that's going to be heavy duty
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.200]   homebound sort of stuff. Yes, in two or three years I will have the three thousand dollars
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:24.640]   and I will get that more than enough use out of the M1 Macbook out of that.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:32.320]   So I'm you probably aren't following entails road map anymore. Are you?
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.840]   Yes. Well, I mean I'm following it sort of how somebody follows the train going off the tracks.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.840]   It's sad. They get a new CEO and
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:49.120]   Gelsinger replaces Swan Gelsinger in for Swan who was in for crazanich.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:56.960]   And they said, well, we're going to defer the decision about our future until Gelsinger gets
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.720]   here next month. You know, some people are saying dump the fabs. There's a big money losers.
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.880]   But the real question is if you make a Mac Pro and tell base Mac Pro and it would be later this
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:13.520]   year, right? It would probably be the fall. Yeah. Will there be an Intel Xeon that somehow better
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:20.720]   than what they are using today? So only because the Zions were so slow and upbeat. Like I believe
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.120]   they were on Scott and these are the Xeon I forget what they call them. Xeon X. These aren't the big
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.200]   iron Zions. These are the more commercial grade Zions and they have special name for them.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:34.880]   Xeon Y or Xeon X or something. And I think those were still on Skylake. So it's probably at least
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.720]   one generation. They could go to those. They could go to there. Maybe an 11th,
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.560]   January 10th or 11th generation. Yeah.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.760]   Zeon. My sphere there here is that I with with like Andy, the and like everybody, all of our
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.120]   wish lists are mythical, magical Mac for the last decade has been this X Mac, this mini tower
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:56.400]   that we all just wanted. That would be the perfect machine for hobbyists that Apple just never made.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.640]   Like the Excel sheet just never pivoted in a direction that made that cash positive.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.840]   And I would love this so much. Even if it's just we yank out those Xeon ships, we yank out those
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:12.240]   giant AMD cards. There's so much less space. We can shrink it down. But if they could, if they
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:19.200]   would do that, if they would give us a modular Mac based on a ginormous multi core M series processor,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.960]   I don't know what I do. I take a bubble bath and call it that call it.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:30.080]   Okay. I feel like it's sexy time now on the Mac break weekly as I do a dramatic reading of rumor.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:39.920]   The second version, however, will use Apple's own processes and be less than half the size
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:47.040]   of the current Mac Pro. The design will feature mostly Aluminium exterior
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:59.920]   and couldn't evoke nostalgia for the power Mac, G4, Cube, a short-lived, smaller version of the power
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:05.600]   Mac. Total nerd porn. It's like nerd porn. It's the worst. I don't know if that was a sexy voice,
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:16.320]   but it's not. I mean, people laugh when we call things sexy, but it's, but I even if this is
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.480]   the same price as the existing Mac Pro, I could just see myself with my nose.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.400]   You know, Craig is looking at it. He's looking at it like he wasn't that event. He's just, he's
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.880]   looking at it with the red lights and he's just, he has it right now. Oh, baby. Oh, man.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.920]   Yeah, that would be a dream machine. I don't think it was like the MacBooks will still be the
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.160]   biggest sellers. The Mac would still be the biggest seller, but for for nerd culture,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.400]   it's been waiting so long, right? This would be the ultimate Mac. Well, let's fantasize.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.800]   If you're going to make that, it would be an M series chip that would be
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:57.200]   like generations down the road. Yeah, it would have. What would you do? How many tours? What would you
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.920]   do? I'm confused by his article because he said next generation. And the one thing about Bloomberg
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.600]   is for all their copy editors, they are incredibly imprecise. Like they kept saying
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.360]   magnetically charging iPhones. They connect magnetically. They charge inductively.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.320]   Yeah, take their English and face value. So he says next generation chipset. And I don't know if
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:20.160]   that means literally next generation as in an M two that would be based on a 15 silicon IP,
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.920]   which is an advancement on the architecture, or just like M one X has more cars and then M one
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.560]   T has more cores after that. And that's still interesting, but a very different proposition.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:36.160]   Yeah. Yeah. Also that we need to understand that you can't really translate more cores equals more
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.480]   power. It's kind of like in the old days, we say, Oh, this has got more megahertz. So this is
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.760]   obviously a much better, much stronger computer. And for a lot of tasks, it's going to be if you
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.760]   have the if you had the choice between more course, but less RAM or more RAM and fewer cores,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:56.240]   you would take the more RAM and fewer cores, because you're dealing with the kind of operations where
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.360]   I need to be able to keep as much data actually in physical active memory as possible. And that's
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:10.080]   the speed bottleneck. So yeah, I mean, you know, it could just be 64 gigs of RAM or 128 or 1.2
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:18.560]   terabytes. It could just be 18 Thunderbolt four channels. I think one thing that they're going to
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:26.400]   want to look at is GPU, whether they use external GPUs, they support AMD or more likely they do their
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:34.240]   own, whether it's on die or off die GPUs. That's that's got to be an area where there's room to
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.720]   a lot of room to grow. But I feel like that's an implement. Like whether it's on board, off board,
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.440]   discrete or integrated, that's an implementation detail that I care about only so much and what
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:49.760]   they can deliver. Like if they can deliver on board and in an SOC, something that's competitive with
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:57.920]   Nvidia and Intel, sorry not Intel, Nvidia and AMD. I still don't know because I would like the
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.720]   ability to swap graphics cards. I'd like the ability to swap CPUs too. This is a whole new
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.480]   world Leo. I don't know if they can make an SOC where every year if you want to, if you work
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:14.400]   at Pixar ILM, Oh, M two time socket swap, M three time socket swap, that to me would be ideal. And
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.120]   how the implemented, I think is more their problem.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:23.200]   By the way, I thank you to the chat room who mentioned that Intel did in fact announce new
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:30.720]   CPUs at CES New Zions. In fact, this is the third generation until Z on scalable processors.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:38.000]   They're ice lake, they're 10 nanometer, and they're going to be ramping up the volume first quarter
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.320]   of this year. So certainly by the fall, they would have enough to make Mac pros with those. So
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.760]   there is a part and that kind of makes sense that they would do that.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:56.320]   Fair there. Their bread and butter is still server cores. It's still going to be a commodity
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:04.160]   cores and still going to be again, the people who need to do a dynamic model of airflow through a
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:09.760]   manifold. And again, that's that's that's you know who you are fighter. Yeah, you know who you are.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.160]   And I wouldn't buy one. But if you need one, you will you will have you probably will have
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.240]   something like that. Yeah, I'm much more interested in the mini Mac.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:24.160]   It's going to be cute as hell. You know that especially if they just take whatever the Mac
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:29.520]   Pro is and just like scale it down. Talking all the way down to like so that if I have like an
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.480]   action figure, if I got like my Avengers action figures, Tony Stark can have like this this
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.440]   crate type seating and the wheels are only $500 each. That kind of thing. Exactly. Yeah, that
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:46.160]   they actually are apparently according again, german rumor, working on a lower priced,
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.760]   not cheap, lower priced external monitor to sell alongside the pro display XDR,
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.480]   which is $5,000 before you buy the stand. According to german, the cheaper monitor would
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.800]   feature a screen geared more for consumer than professional use wouldn't have the brightness
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.720]   and contrast ratio of the top tier offering. That's the one, you know, the top tier offering is a
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.880]   reference monitor. It's just you basically just have to wrap the iMac panel. Whatever you make
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.440]   for the next iMac, just wrap that up and give it to me as a display. I'll be fine. So I have an
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:26.000]   iMac Pro at which I mentioned before I've really turned on now. Will there be an Intel iMac Pro
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.840]   do you think or is that not there's no market for that? No, I don't. Yeah, I would be surprised
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:37.280]   at this point. So they are and this is the other part of the german rumor meal this week.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:46.880]   Redesign of the iMac. Again, sexy music, please. The new models of a sound. I need a sexy voice.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:53.680]   What is a sexy voice? Oh, baby, the new models will slim down the thick black borders around the
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:24:02.480]   screen. Do away with a sizable metal chair area. We're talking about shafts in favor of a design
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:12.960]   similar to apples pro is the play. It's the money. Yeah, these iMacs will have a flat back. Oh, yeah,
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:20.400]   baby. Moving away from the curved rear. I do like a curved rear, but there's nothing like a flat
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:27.440]   back Mac. Apple's plenty. I can't do it. And actually I just realized I think I've been doing the
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:34.480]   match game. That should be your tick tock. Michael should just cut that off and make that
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:42.320]   your first tick tock. We have Twit Tuck. We have a tick tock. Is is Mike and do we do Twit Tuck?
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:46.640]   I don't know if we are doing it, but that would be a good tWit Tuck. I can give you a cool,
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:54.080]   a clean read for that. Apple's playing a launch, two versions, code named J45 J456. So,
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.240]   originally I wanted to do a TikTok channel where I slow jammed Apple news and Georgia told me no.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:03.360]   And no, you will not. I was just gonna slow jam the Apple news. Well, what would it be? What would
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.760]   slow jam Apple news be like? Exactly what you just did? Oh, okay, that's it. That's a slow jam.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:14.960]   Yeah, four or five six. It's hard for tenors to slow jam. I'm saying you you
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.120]   you achieved the impossible before Renee, but it's I would be jenny's
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:27.120]   time or you want the lush, rich baritone of a the people said asking not to be identified.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:33.680]   That's right. Like the match music.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:45.360]   What good one. That was. Every time she reverts that slow jam, that's
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.360]   too jam. Okay, the upcoming products are part of Apple's radical overhaul of its personal computer
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.920]   lineup. Yeah, which is, you know, Apple silicon. And we had hoped that there would be new designs.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:01.360]   Will there be new the iMac redesign? Yeah, would they be new? Yes, we think they're going to be new
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.080]   laptop redesigns as well, right? He did another article on he did three articles. He did that
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.880]   one. He did the MacBook Pro article and he did the flip iPhone article. So this is the one that says
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:16.400]   magnetic charging. Do you think it will be? Yeah, I think he's saying MagSafe, right? It'll have a
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.040]   break away. Yes. Yeah, it's just again, like not charging magnetic charging cable.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:28.560]   So that's a very interesting rumor because it does on the on the MacBook Pro because you always
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:34.880]   see when Apple has an idea that they know everybody loves you. They will keep that thing on it until
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:41.520]   it stops working. When something never really worked to begin with, like if there was a touch bar
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:47.040]   that people were like, okay, if there's a keyboard, the people were like, eh, okay. If there was a
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.800]   charging connector, the people were like, eh, okay. But the people who didn't like the change
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.120]   were never, never stopping vocal about it. The next generation of hardware, if none of those
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.880]   things appear, you know that this is there saying not me a cobbler, but okay, okay. We don't, we don't
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:07.360]   have to beat ourselves up about it. But it turns out that we made a lot of unsafe bets three or four
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.080]   years ago. Andy, you were right on that right on that also right on that. Let's just move on.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:19.120]   They do does say that the new laptops will have a new chip. It won't be the M1. It'll be the next
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.880]   generation versions of Apple's and house Mac processors upgraded with more cores and enhanced
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.880]   graphics. The person said asking not to be named.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:37.920]   These devices will mark Apple's first high end laptop. High end is the important part here to
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:43.360]   move away from Intel because these these these M1 MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs are really,
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:48.320]   as you've said a number of times, Renee, just kind of a refresh of the low end, the lowest end
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:55.200]   Apple laptops. I have to say, I don't feel like I'm using a low end machine. I feel the M1 is so
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:01.840]   fast that you feel like I'm in the pro line, which makes me very excited about what the pro line is
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:08.240]   going to offer. Yeah. When they decide that they want to have them, they want to hold the mantle of
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:16.720]   unarguably the fastest desktop workstation you can buy on a retail setting, boy, we're going to
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.480]   see some big clouds of dust when they decide that they want that title because the ceiling for
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.040]   this is pretty damn high with their hardware. A major change to the new computers will be how
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:33.360]   they charge, right, smart german over the past five years, USB-C. The company's now bringing back
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:39.840]   MagSafe. Would it be a USB-C MagSafe? Yes, right? It'd have to be or no.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:46.400]   Well, so this is the thing like the USB-C defines the plug and it's USB 3. And they just renamed
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:51.840]   everything like two weeks ago. They renamed everything as USB 3.2, making it even worse to try to differentiate
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:29:02.640]   them. Like 3.03.1 and 3.2 are all 3.2 of some variety now. It's appalling. I like having the USB 3.2
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:10.080]   nay siege things to be can be charging or for data. Yes. But now it sounds like they're going to have
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.800]   a charging port that's distinct. Yes, which will be on the wrong side every time I want to use it.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:18.800]   Yeah. Like it used to be. I don't know if I think that's the right way to go.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:25.200]   Could they do a breakaway USB 3.2 type C thing, right? They could just have a breakaway.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.440]   I think there's third party things like that. Or maybe make a puck and let me attach it
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.720]   magnetically to any part of the Mac. That's an interesting one. Now inductive charging is not
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:39.840]   fast enough for a 100 watt device. No. Well, I mean, there are some phone companies that go
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.440]   really ludicrously fast. But what they do is they separate the battery out independently and then
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.000]   charge each part of the separate battery thereby reducing the total health and the total volume
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.600]   of the battery. But they can advertise a real fast charging. Right. I don't think that's what
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:59.200]   I mean. Yeah. Apple's also planning says Goemon. Redesign MacBook Air. But that's not expected to
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:05.360]   be released until long after the next MacBook Pros. Also, the touch bar.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:12.000]   Apple's tested versions that remove the touch bar from its laptop keyboards.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.040]   Testing. I think she quotes that it's going away. Well, sorry, Guomingche said that it's going away
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.680]   completely. He thinks they're getting rid of it. My thing is that regardless of how you feel,
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.080]   whether you love it or hate it, Apple announced it in 2016 and has promptly done nothing with it.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:29.600]   They've not advanced it, not iterated it. It hasn't gone to any more computers,
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:34.480]   not available on desktops. They haven't added haptics to it at all. It's just stuck there.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.600]   And that does not seem like a technology Apple's engaged with. It felt like it was maybe a stealth
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:45.760]   way to get the ARM chips into the Intel Max. The T1 and later T2 chips into the Intel Max.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:51.280]   And now they don't need it anymore. So my understanding started off because they wanted to put touch
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.600]   ID and they had to put what was essentially an S2 chip at the time. And they were concerned
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.960]   about security. So they wanted a discrete display for the price so nobody could try to hack the
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:06.400]   price that you're agreeing to. And then it's sort of escalated from there until we got a whole bar.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:15.760]   It's time is gone. It's done. It's over. Third article, Apple preps next Mac chips with AIM
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:22.320]   to outclass top end PCs. I should point out, Mark almost certainly does not write his own
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:32.560]   headlines. Somebody at Bloomberg does that. Faster performing than Intel's best. I do love hearing
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:37.840]   stuff like that. They kind of are already though. I mean, it was only the very latest Ryzen 3 that
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:44.320]   were like single core performance competitive with the M1. Yeah. So it's not it's not a high bar.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:51.680]   There are things like there are certain tasks that the Intel chips like some people still prefer
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.600]   Intel to AMD for gaming for very specific reasons. But in general, Apple's doing really,
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:04.240]   really good architecture. Yeah. Actually, that wasn't the third. That was that was an older
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.920]   iPhone flip. The iPhone flip. Oh, tell me about that. What's the iPhone flip?
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.760]   So he and John Prosser both put out stories this week. Originally, Apple and for years,
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:21.600]   they were working on a two screen foldable version. And now they're both talking about Apple working on
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:28.560]   using Samsung style foldable, foldable display technology to either make something like the
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:34.240]   Galaxy Fold or in John and Mark's more recent articles, something like the flip that would open
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:42.480]   up into a iPhone 12 Pro Max style device. And the reason I like this so much is well beyond the
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:47.760]   fact that we're human, we fold everything. We fold wallets, we fold pizza, we fold sandwiches,
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:54.080]   we fold clothes, only animals fold pizza, I want to say. Yes. No, the other way around, only animals
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:58.000]   don't fold pizza. All right, I'm confused. You're in New York. But the thing that's nice about this
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.720]   is that Apple has built this infrastructure for their software. Excuse me. Like one of the biggest
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.880]   problems with the foldables on the Android side is that Google is having to work hand in hand
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.600]   with every manufacturer to fit every different screen size and model and transition and the app
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:17.440]   developers haven't done a lot. And there's really a posity of tablet apps where Apple from the Apple
[00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:24.400]   Watch interface and App Store to iPadOS and that huge catalog of iPad apps, they really can use
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:30.320]   size classes and auto layout to propel you through different size of app experiences.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.840]   So if it's like an Apple pocket watch where it looks like the little Apple Watch interface on
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.320]   the outside and then you open it up and you have the iPhone interface or an iPhone where you open
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:42.560]   it up and suddenly you have the iPad version of every app except for Instagram because they still
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.960]   haven't made it, that to me is like would be a really, really good software experience. They could
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   just focus on the hardware from there. According to German, they're not yet testing phones,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.520]   they're really still at the screen stage. And I have to say, you know, I have this is the Galaxy
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:02.080]   Fold, although the flip, I have to say the flip to me does, and I've talked to people who said,
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.120]   that's that's really the form factor you want. This gives you a tablet sized, almost a tablet
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:12.480]   sized. People want that though. But the issue, and I've seen a number of people complaining about
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:22.000]   broken screens. The issue at this point is, can you make this fold, reliable, durable, invisible
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.560]   enough? I mean, I see it. Mark says they're going to use the Apple's new Shatter technology.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.600]   They're ceramic, what they call a shield. They're ceramic shield technology for that.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.840]   And that's flexible. Because Apple does get the OLED process from Samsung,
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.840]   but they don't use Samsung panels. They sometimes ask for their own materials. They do all of their
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.720]   own display work after they get those. So Samsung, I forget who makes theirs. It's a different company
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.880]   than Corning, but Apple and Corning are apparently working on a new kind of ceramic shield for it.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:55.360]   I like the Z Flip. I think that's a that would actually kind of make sense. Part of the problem
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.200]   Apple has is it just there's nothing new in the iPhone. So they need to do something
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:05.520]   to do something at least that's a little different, whether it's
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.320]   Kirk Enterprise. Yeah, whether it's necessary, maybe secondary to the idea that we just need to
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:17.440]   have to we just got to do something that's not a slab of glass. I like the the idea. I haven't
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:23.200]   maybe I should trade in this fold for the flip and see if I you can get more money back. I saw
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.600]   people ordering Amazon renewed versions of iPhones and other things to trade into Samsung,
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:32.640]   getting more money than they paid for it to get like the latest S21 and the Galaxy Fold for
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.840]   almost no money. Samsung's really trying to push this market and this is a good time to try
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.520]   get into it. I ordered the flip when it first came out, but it took so long I cancelled. Maybe
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:50.720]   I should. It might be interesting. It really is a great form factor because I love the idea of
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:56.080]   a device that adapt to whatever your immediate situation is. As you say, not just having something
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:36:00.480]   that's more pocketable that turns into something that's more like a tablet or a standard size
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:07.680]   iPhone Pro, but also imagine the idea of the screen folding backwards like 300 degrees and being
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.480]   something like a desk clock that will give you notifications, give you messages, give you that
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:20.080]   really cool complication based interface for for Apple Watch sort of clock designs, but also give
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:25.440]   you interactivity or even give you an extra control surface that the touch bar on your Mac
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:32.000]   doesn't really sort of deliver. Given that most of the problems that Samsung has been having
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.680]   have been real bread and butter nuts and bolts engineering problems like how do you design a hinge
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:45.680]   that remains a barrier against dust and it's a really complicated like watchmaker type of mechanism
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:50.560]   in order to make that work. That's the sort of stuff that's really up Apple's alley to design
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.200]   solutions like that. And I also agree with the idea that as soon as as soon as there is a
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.400]   foldable glass solution as opposed to a foldable plastic solution, that's when Apple really gets
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:04.720]   interested in this. Yeah. Yeah. That's the problem. It really feels a little plasticy.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:12.800]   Yeah. It's a weird experience or almost even a little rubbery. It's kind of sticky.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:18.400]   Yeah. It's I think that's non-negotiable for so many reasons. Yeah. And it's on the horizon.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:24.240]   It's not going to be a cheap phone, but it's possible to get foldable glass in quantities where
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.880]   in experimental quantities right now, as opposed to enough quantities that people who want expensive
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:34.400]   iPhones can all get one, maybe not. It's supposed to be pen durable this time, right? Like it's
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:38.480]   supposed to be at least durable enough for the pen. And then it's balancing out the durability
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.840]   versus the fragility versus the radius that you can fold it because apparently the stronger panels
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:50.960]   don't fold quite as nicely as the weaker panels. I love Mark Kerman's rumors. I must say,
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:56.480]   yeah. At least we're all agreed that just like there are people who agree that folding pizza is
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.560]   okay. There are people who don't see it. I think we all agree that folding the pizza so that the
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:05.280]   sauce and the toppings are on the outside is absolutely the wrong idea. That's right. I think
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.160]   we all seem to have agreed that having the display on the outside is yeah, it was a great demo three
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:14.240]   or four years ago. Definitely not what we actually wanted. Well, but that's one problem with the
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:20.320]   Microsoft Duo is there is there it's a blank face when it's closed and it is nice. And this
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:27.360]   this is the display on the on the fold too is big enough that I mean, it's a little weird, but it's
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.600]   at least big enough to see what's going on. You can you can use it. You could use it as a phone
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:36.080]   this way. So you do need something. I don't know. It's it's tricks. It's difficult.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:41.840]   Pullables. That's yes. You're you're breaking up. You're breaking up. You're
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.160]   breaking up. Do it again. Say it again. Whatever you just said.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:50.480]   You see the TLC rollables at CES where they go out and there's like a giant scroll. You can
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:57.440]   cast your spells. So TCL had a phone that weirdly grew. It just was weird looking.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:03.120]   And then LG actually is going to make one. TCL's was a concept and then the scroll looked like an
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.760]   Egyptian scroll that you nobody is announced. They're making that yet, but it's it is interesting
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.320]   to see like how are we're at kill and watch the watch the earth burn in front of you. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:18.320]   That but that is a ridiculous concept. If it's the idea that because you can't just simply pull
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.960]   it out. It's motor motor has to push it out and you have to simply wait while it goes.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:33.280]   And suddenly your phone is just a little bit wider. It's like a weird okay. And and and the
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.120]   fact they didn't actually have anything showing off. They just had a prop that they
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:42.400]   projected. They they inserted some video from the from their keynote presentation on to. And
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.560]   Oh, well afterwards for saying yes, we're absolutely going to manufacture and ship this.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.720]   Was their name? Not really. Is there a ship? We're going to call it the right call it the
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:56.400]   grower not a show or phone. LG did ship the wing though. So they'll do it. LG is just crazy enough
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   to do it. Yeah, the wing is weird. Jason howl reviewed it. I don't I don't get it. So the idea is
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.000]   you know, your iPhone Pro Max side. This is great. A german Pro Max side screen folded in half. So
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.680]   it's a little pop though. Small. I kind of like that. If you can make the screen reliable and
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:20.880]   exactly as you said, Andy feels like glass. The hinge is not weird looking. Yeah, I can go for that.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:27.200]   And I guess there've been enough of these out now that that's probably the case that these
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.760]   are the for Samsung. A lot of the early groundwork has definitely been done. Also, Apple's in a
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:37.120]   really good position to do this because Apple's market is full of not just early adopters, but
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:41.840]   what I call I keep calling early believers. People that if they know they know that if Apple's
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:48.400]   putting it out, it's not it's it may not be completely fully baked, but it's not half baked. It's usable
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.920]   with for people who accept that they're on the first generation of something that's going to get
[00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:57.360]   better as time goes by and people who have deep pockets who really would not flinch at the idea
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:04.960]   of spending iPad Pro money on a iPhone Pro that folds. So this is they could really push things
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:10.560]   forward and not just in terms of pushing the technology forward, but also the more people see
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:17.200]   people like out the on an airplane at a terminal in an office with a folding phone, the more they
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.560]   think, Oh, that actually works. That isn't just stupid like that CES demo that I saw in 2021.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:28.880]   So let's take a little break. Andy and I co Renee Richie Leo Laporte, it's Mac break weekly,
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:37.840]   our weekly dive into Apple and Mark Gurman and and Goming G our show today brought to you by IT
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:45.040]   Pro TV New Year. Amazing opportunities, right? I'll tell you one thing. If you're looking for work,
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:51.920]   one area that is growing constantly, even during quarantine, especially during quarantine,
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:58.000]   is IT. IT means a lot of things though. It could be desktop support. It could be security. It could
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.920]   be sys admin. It could be network administration. If you want to get into IT, one of the things
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:10.480]   you're going to have to do is decide, well, what area of IT? Can I recommend IT Pro TV? They've got
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:16.960]   exactly what you need to get started on the right foot in your IT education journey. Professional,
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.760]   entertaining. I don't mean goofy. I mean, engaging. I think engaging might be a better word than
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:27.840]   entertaining. These guys are IT pros, of course, but they also know how to make it interesting,
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:32.800]   engaging, and you don't have to leave your house. You can watch it on your computer. You can watch
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.360]   it on your phone. You could watch it on your big screen TV. They have Roku and Apple TV and Fire TV
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:44.400]   apps on every platform. This is a great month to get started in IT. It's getting started in IT
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:48.720]   month to IT Pro TV. If you're going to start a new career in the IT industry,
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:54.400]   you could catch two webinars for budding IT pros. There's a free training weekend with
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:43:00.160]   five courses available at no charge, tons of videos free on their YouTube channel as well,
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:05.440]   all about starting a new career. Give you a great idea of what options there are, what areas
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.680]   you should look at. Now, if you're a business and you've got an IT team, IT Pro TV is great for
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:16.240]   keeping them up to date on the latest technologies. Training them in new areas, it's a plan your
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:21.280]   team will actually use. There's a personal plan that'll help you accelerate your IT career.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.480]   Really, IT Pro TV is a one-stop shop for IT education. Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Linux.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:30.240]   They're the official video training part for CompTIA. They've got all these top
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.760]   CompTIA courses. This is for many people, those are the first certs you get, the ones you get
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:42.320]   to put a get your foot in the door in an IT department, A+ or security plus or network plus.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:49.520]   That's just part of the incredible library at IT Pro TV. One of the reasons they do so much stuff
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:56.720]   is the stuff changes constantly. New versions of software come out, the tests change, the
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:03.600]   concepts change. They're always keeping it up to date. More than 5800 hours now of up to date, IT
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:09.040]   training. Nobody's got that. One of their learning coaches can help you if you want to
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:13.760]   figure out what your future is. They can guide you on your career path. And of course,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:18.880]   they have great job resources too to help you get that IT job. One more thing I want to give
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.960]   them a big plug for Technato. That's Don Pazette. He's one of the founders, Don and Tim.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:28.640]   Don Pazette has a podcast called Technato. Great way to keep up on IT. There's industry guests,
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:33.120]   IT news recaps. Everybody should be subscribing to that. That's absolutely free.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:39.920]   Let's look forward to a successful new year. What do you say with a new career in IT and the best
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:45.040]   IT education around? We know these guys so well. We've been with them since the very beginning.

[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:47.760]   Moving on from the rumor mill into the real world. Actually, maybe it's a little bit of a
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.880]   lot of luck in the real world of the past year. Let's stay in fantasy land. The information says
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:46:00.080]   Apple is planning a podcasting subscription service looking at what Spotify is doing. But
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.520]   they also caution that Apple looks at a lot of things. It doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:07.840]   Every thousand knows for every yes. What do you think?
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:12.720]   Are we auditioning Leo? Should I sit up straight? You know, Lisa said, we should call them. I said
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:17.840]   Apple's never. They don't want what we do. That's not the kind of thing they'll do. In fact,
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:24.240]   I wonder if they'd even do technology podcasting. The hot topic now in podcasting anyway is these
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:30.560]   true crime and fiction show, suspense shows. That's almost like Joe Rogan podcasts.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:38.720]   As Jake Paul said, Logan Paul. That is part of the problem. You have to hook up your
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:44.400]   wagon to people who are getting huge audiences oftentimes because they're dealing with very,
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:52.720]   very fiery content, let's say. I have to think Spotify is saying, geez, that Joe Rogan deal.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.680]   Was that a good deal? Should we have gone there? And Joe Rogan might be saying that.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.160]   Yeah. Well, he got $100 million. I don't think he's going to.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.000]   I don't think he's got any thought how it's doing money. He's fine.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:09.360]   That's a lot of watches. But no, you're right. And Apple is very, very cautious about their
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:15.120]   reputation as much so as Disney. So that is a challenge.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:21.200]   Yeah, it would be interesting if they decided to produce their own podcast, though.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.080]   Like, what if they decided to do their own newscast, to do their own arts channel,
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:31.600]   to as a compliment to all the other stuff that they're doing with content creation,
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.760]   now that they have a studio for doing TV and movies, they could have they could
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:39.360]   set up a radio studio and simply say, we have an idea for a 12 part radio documentary,
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:45.680]   or we have an idea for a season. We're going to buy the rights to Neil Gaiman's next book
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.600]   and turn that into a fully produced 22 episode audio series.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.760]   That's much more likely. The Apple TV Plus model exhibits audio.
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:58.560]   I think that's exactly what they only worry. My only concern is that they'll do not that.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.920]   They'll buy Neil Gaiman's book, they'll make that into a TV Plus series,
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:06.720]   and then pay Neil Gaiman to host a podcast about it. Like the podcast that they were doing for HBO
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:12.560]   does a lot of those. They had a watch podcast and they had a was the Chernobyl podcast with
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:17.760]   Craig Maysen and they have so much content or they don't bother to podcast really well.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:22.880]   Like they have so many music centric interviews and things that they're only starting to sort of
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:27.600]   get up to speed with podcasts. But I think they will look at it as well.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:31.120]   I guess it depends on who they get to run it. But my guess is it'll stay with eddy cues,
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:36.800]   media division, and they will do it very much like other entertainment brands have done it.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:41.840]   That makes sense. It won't be like the podcast nerds inside Apple who get to run it, sadly.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:49.440]   Apple has tried to set aside the half billion dollar Vernet X
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:49:00.640]   judgment and failed. They now given you add interest in royalties, the total payout to lawsuits
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:09.520]   could be over a billion dollars on Friday, a judge in Tyler Texas, the home of so many of these
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:14.160]   lawsuits, rejected Apple's request for a new trial and several other claims.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:25.280]   Apple said that Vernet X's award should not exceed 113.7 million. Don't know where they got that from
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:30.240]   and that jurors should have been told that the US Patent and Trademark Office had deemed
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:36.160]   Vernet X's claims unpattened a bowl. Yeah, that might have helped them in their decision.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:45.280]   So anyway, but this is this is exactly what happens in these cases in in the in the East Texas.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.080]   I think it's yeah, the rocket dock at Eastern District of Texas.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:54.160]   So, you know, it's not like Apple can't afford it, but it's kind of annoying.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:50:00.240]   It's annoying. You can't negotiate. You have to make sure that anybody comes after you.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.680]   They're going to have to actually take this to court. They're actually going to have to do.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.120]   They're not going to get a quick payoff or else. I think that in the long run,
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.280]   this is even if they have to occasionally write a check, it's going to be better from the long
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:18.160]   run. Just in terms of, yeah, Apple is being also sued by a group who said, hey,
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.120]   you cut off parlor. You should curb telegram too.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:28.400]   Okay. Well, this is very different apps like parlor's problem was the lack of like,
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:34.400]   again, Apple, like people are, I don't know lying is the wrong word, but Apple said you need
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:38.640]   content moderation and Twitter and Facebook have shown that you don't even need good content
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.200]   moderation. You just have to show them that you have a plan. They couldn't do that.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.640]   Telegram is not a public forum. Like you can't just go online and go to Telegram and see a bunch
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:53.120]   of posts. It's a messaging service. It's completely different and kind. You can argue it's got
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.960]   malicious content, but it is nothing like, like, I think I keep seeing parlay because I live in
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.760]   Montreal, but it's nothing like parlor. But that's the problem. That's the door you open when you
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:07.120]   start when you start doing this, the lawsuit was filed by the coalition for a safer web,
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:12.000]   a nonpartisan group that advocates for technologies and policies to remove extremist content from
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.360]   social media. The president, Mark Ginsburg, is a former US ambassador to Morocco.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:22.320]   They complained about telegram's role in hosting white supremacist neo-nancy and other hateful
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.640]   content. And that's kind of the nature of telegram. You can create groups, groups,
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:31.120]   the internet, like they're finding these people in like, like, what is it? High school sports
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:35.600]   forums. They're just going everywhere they can to try to, to try to hide and get around this.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:39.760]   And the other issue with, I'm going to say parlay again, parlor, like they had zero
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.480]   offset. They had zero security. You could get every post deleted or otherwise just by incrementing
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   the post count by one. And now I believe they're being hosted on Russian servers. So like,
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.400]   there were issues with it beyond like, there were so many issues with it. In fact, Ben Thompson
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:56.640]   made an excellent point. He said, this is, this is not, this is just the market saying,
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:02.960]   as the market can and often does, we don't want to do business with these guys. So, you know,
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:06.160]   you go somewhere else. That's the, that's called a free market.
[00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:12.320]   But it, I think that the, I think that Apple doesn't have the same sort of situation with
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:18.320]   telegram visited with parlor. As, as Renee said, the biggest problem wasn't so much that there
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:23.760]   was radical content being put on that site, but that they were being warned and approached by Apple
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.480]   and other providers saying, Hey, look, this is a problem. Take this down or take it,
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:35.040]   clean up after your, after your dogs here and getting absolutely ghosted by them. And they really
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:40.160]   had nothing else to do. Nothing else to think of possibly do. However, this is going to open up
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:45.280]   a new conversation in 2021 and beyond about what responsibility does an app store have,
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:52.400]   does Amazon Web Services and other cloud, cloud software providers have to make sure that the
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:58.480]   make sure that they're not enabling just to note one example, a huge command and control
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:05.520]   infrastructure for a radical terrorist, domestic terrorist group. At what point is our congressional
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:10.240]   regulators going to say, it is part of your responsibility to, I know that I know that you are the privacy
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.720]   company, but this is this is there. This could be their way of saying, this is why we are arguing
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:18.160]   that you should not have end to end encryption, because you yourselves are going to be made
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:24.000]   responsible for any damages to body or property that happen as a result of private communications
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   upon your network. If that's what you want to happen, then great, hold on to your end to end
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.720]   encryption. Otherwise, give us a backdoor and let us police it for you. So this is it's it's a
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:38.320]   long conversation that is probably going to be had. I hope it doesn't result in bad decisions and bad
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:44.000]   laws being made. But this is part of a very long decision. This is like Vatican II almost,
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.160]   a long, long process of evaluating. Here's how we've decided to regulate technology for the past
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:56.720]   20 or 30 years. How should we continue to operate to allow technology to operate in the next 20 or
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.520]   30 years? Are there some things are the things that were great ideas in the mid 90s that are now
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:06.080]   proven to be not the in the best interests of our society? Or are there some things that are
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.600]   like the First Amendment, they are just sacrosanct. We're just going to have to work with them. So
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:14.160]   these are conversations that we're just going to have. It's also they're also protected by section 230.
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:21.520]   And yeah, as we've mentioned so many times, section 230 is a very important part of the
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:30.400]   Communications Decency Act that gives us, I should say, you know, we're protected by 230 as well.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:35.760]   Immunity from lawsuits over content posted by other people on our chat room and in
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:42.560]   comment sections on our forums. Apple has kind of that protection as well. They're not responsible
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:46.320]   for the stuff that's on Telegram anymore than the phone company's responsible. So does Parlor.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:53.120]   Yeah, but what Apple does say, and it's interesting, Apple does have a rule, you know, in their app
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:58.880]   store that there has to be, well, I'll read, I'll read what the Washington Post said.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:06.800]   Apple has to have a method for filtering inappropriate content out. It has to have a way for users to
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.240]   report it. They also have to provide contact information and have the ability to block abusive
[00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.680]   users from the service. Telegram meets all those standards. Parlor never could, never did.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:24.800]   So in this, in this, go ahead. It's also worth pointing out that these are uniquely American
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:30.800]   things, both of both section 230 and freedom of like the freedom of speech, the way the government
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:35.840]   cannot impose censorship are uniquely American. And we're seeing now internationally, especially
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:41.280]   in the EU, Poland recently, especially Poland recently, are getting incredibly angry about that
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.080]   situation. Like the US has become a safe haven for social networks because of these unique
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:50.320]   protection that they're providing. And the EU is on the verge of, they've already, I think,
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:54.000]   passed it there in the verge of implementing rules that are going to make the world almost split in
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.240]   half between between those two states. There's a great conversation on our Twitch forums,
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:07.120]   WWW that Twitter community, as part of the conversation after last Sunday's Twitter about,
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:13.840]   because I had said the First Amendment is relatively unique. But other countries do have
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:21.920]   some kind of laws like that. Jamsi said, the UK has the Human Rights Act, quote, "Everyone
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.520]   has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:29.520]   and receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:36.640]   regardless of frontiers." So there is, there are some First Amendment-like rules in other
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:42.480]   countries. But we often also have hate speech laws, which would not be allowed under the US
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:46.960]   constitution. That, in fact, is exactly what the Human Rights Act says. The exercise of these
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:52.400]   freedoms that carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities,
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:57.040]   conditions, restrictions, or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:00.640]   democratic society. And that's exactly- Whereas, as Congress shall make no law,
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.320]   right? That's how you're starting to think. Exactly. And that's the exact difference.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:10.080]   And Angela Merkel in Germany and Emmanuel Macron in France, many others have said,
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:16.000]   "Why don't they have a law?" Excuse me, there ought to be a law. Why don't you guys have a law?
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.320]   That's the First Amendment protects against that. Sorry about that.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:26.800]   Yeah. No, they, some people misunderstood when they said they didn't think that Twitter should
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:29.760]   be in the habit of banning politicians or should have the ability to ban politicians,
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:33.440]   because they believe the government should have done that long ago. And that's a completely
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.680]   different kettle of bees that they're opening there. In Germany,
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:44.640]   Big D, who's a Brit living in Germany, also a regular on our community forums, says,
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.680]   "In Germany, it doesn't stop you from saying what you want in private."
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:53.600]   Enough. That would be hard to do. But you can't promote hatred or violence in public,
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.640]   including racism, racial hatred, incitement of violence and murder. And I think that the
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:05.840]   First Amendment does not prevent laws against those things. There are laws against hate speech.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:11.600]   Well, there's libel laws, there's slander laws. In Germany, I believe you still can't
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.000]   display Nazi paraphernalia in the equivalent in the US of not being allowed to show Confederate
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.640]   paraphernalia, for example, would not, I don't think that's workable under the US law.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:28.480]   It's an interesting, this is a conversation that's been going on nationwide in the US.
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:35.360]   Since the capital insurrection. Can I be frankly, it's so confusing people outside the US, because
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:39.200]   it seems like in the US, all this stuff is so flexible. It's like, we believe in freedom of
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:41.680]   speech. And if you don't give it to us, we're going to nationalize your company.
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:47.840]   That's a really hard mental model to forget. You know what, even we can't figure it out.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:55.040]   Where's the puzzle? Does anybody? Hey, here's some good news. Smart watches may be able to detect,
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:59:01.840]   I should actually get, I wish there were an app for this COVID-19 days before symptoms appear.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:11.440]   This is a study from Mount Sinai. They found the Apple Watch. It's actually the heart rate variability
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:18.240]   thing. The Apple Watch can detect subtle changes in an individual's heartbeat, which can signal the
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:26.800]   individual has coronavirus up to seven days before they feel sick, or even infection is detected
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:36.720]   through testing. It's heart rate variability is apparently can be a marker for infection.
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:44.640]   So it's not that it's an elevated heart rate. The heart rate variability is merely the time between
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:52.960]   heart beats, which should vary quite a bit, right? And it can be used as a measure, not only if you're
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:58.880]   overall fitness or some of these apps call it readiness, but it's also a measure of how well
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:07.680]   your immune system is working. Yeah, that's a big set of opportunities. I think in December,
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:12.480]   maybe it might have been even earlier that there was an academic paper released about how there's
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.600]   an about building an AI model that can detect the difference between a regular cough and a COVID
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:22.880]   cough. And the idea of I need that right now, actually, can we get that? Yeah, well,
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:28.080]   again, wouldn't that be interesting given that there's so much people who are doing
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.080]   conversation that are having conversations through a digital medium to begin with? What if there
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:37.280]   were a plugin in Skype, a plugin through all these different apps? That sounds like COVID. Yeah.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:45.120]   Just a direct message to you. Here's where you can get tested. This has not been peer reviewed,
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:50.400]   but this thing is perhaps, yeah. So there's a lot of research on this, the way the math
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.200]   signage that they did not do with the help of Apple, they just had a few hundred of their
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:03.520]   employees where Apple watches and analyze the data. This has been one of the goals and dreams of
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:09.520]   all these devices collecting so much data and that data being able to be anonymized and
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:15.760]   opt into artificial intelligence machine learning research studies to try to see if there is
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.480]   if there is a correlation that the correlation and causation sort of thing. If we can find with
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:25.120]   a large enough sample thing, people of whom this sort of an aberration has been detected,
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.040]   most of them have been later on diagnosed with this sort of disease. That's a very,
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:36.480]   very dangerous road to go down, but that's always been the dream that not that my disease has
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.280]   been detected because I'm close to death. My symptoms are now so bad that it is unquestionable
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.960]   with the diagnosis, but that there is a indication that you are going to develop this disease in the
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.840]   next year or two or that you're at the first, the starting line of this disease and early treatment
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:57.120]   can possibly prolong or even save your life. If there's one thing that will get people to
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:03.600]   hand over personal data to a faceless mega tech corporation, it's the idea of you see this watch,
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.600]   it will prevent you from dying at 53 just like your aunts and uncles tend to do.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:13.760]   Unfortunately, there isn't yet an app to do this on any device. Stanford used Fitbits,
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:20.000]   Apple watches and others, Garmin watches, found that 81% of coronavirus positive participants
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.360]   experience change in their resting heart rates up to nine and a half days prior to the onset of
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:31.840]   symptoms. An extremely elevated heart rate was indicative of symptom onset. So basically,
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.040]   these are symptoms that we don't, you know, that we're not normally monitoring. So these are early
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:42.800]   symptoms. Go ahead. I'm sorry. No, not at all. I'm sorry, I got my timing is a little bit off with
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.280]   this guy. But it makes sense when you look at Tim Cook's statement about through the long arc of
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.200]   history, Apple will be best remembered for their contribution to health care because
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.360]   once all this stuff is in place and we've handled like all of the pesky interpersonal
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.000]   communications and video game needs, we can start really focusing on how those sensors can be better
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.080]   more personally and closer deployed and not to be negative about it. But as we're surpassing,
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.360]   like, I think we're close to half of built, what is it half a million deaths in North America now
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.280]   or what some ridiculous number? That sort of stuff will be critically important because
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:20.000]   a hundred years is even short between pandemics. But there are a lot of things that are going to
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   be going on in our ability, like Andy said, to detect those things, even if they're not lethal,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.560]   but even if they're just slightly, if they make you live uncomfortably for 30 years,
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.560]   if we can fix that sort of stuff, like if the Apple Watch or the PIP that can say,
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.960]   the way you're walking right now is going to lead to hip problems when you're in your 60s,
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:40.160]   and it's really easy to fix now. We're going to have you on a walking program.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.080]   That sort of stuff will really changed a lot of lives.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:51.360]   Yeah, and it should be part of a comprehensive health management system inside the entire country.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:56.960]   If we had the ability that everybody had, everybody who needed access to an inexpensive form of
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.520]   healthcare, not invasive surgery, but hey, this looks kind of odd. I would like to get this checked
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:06.320]   out. If that were an easy hundred bucks or easy 50 bucks for anybody in this country,
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.320]   and we were having, we had enough medical infrastructure to support it, that would save lots of lives.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:17.040]   Without this comprehensive sort of idea, we can't have wealthy people who can afford
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.920]   three or $400 watches every time that they've got a ping on their watch saying,
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:26.880]   hey, here's, here is an alert that, gosh, maybe you want to get your lungs checked for something,
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:33.280]   and it's based on not necessarily voodoo science, but stuff that it has by no means been proven as,
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:40.000]   this is an important enough signal that yes, we need you to, yes, you should put some demands
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:46.160]   upon the limited medical resources of your community to get this checked out. We can't have
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:51.040]   thousands and thousands of people coming in on the off chance that this indicator is an indicator of
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.440]   something that this, that a check from a doctor can actually get something done. We're already,
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:05:01.280]   we've seen what happens when we, we, a lot of us never really thought about the idea of
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:06.880]   our medical infrastructure being stretched, stretched past the limit. And we're seeing this
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:11.840]   even one, almost a full calendar year after the declaration of a pandemic, there are still
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:17.840]   ER room, there are still mass general hospital, a doctor there just tweeted last week and really
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.360]   just went right into my heart saying that we don't have any, we don't have any beds in ICU,
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.880]   we don't have any beds in the rich general hospital, we don't have any beds in emergency,
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:32.160]   we have no place to deal with anybody right now and think because our patients just keep coming in
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:37.200]   and coming in. So this is, this is part of the conversation that it's wonderful to have this,
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.080]   this demonstration of, and because of this irregularity detected in a heartbeat, we were able to detect
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:47.680]   this person's possibility of having a stroke the next year. We can't have thousands and tens of
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:53.760]   thousand people who are functionally very, very healthy coming in for expensive and really,
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:00.080]   really pro corrected tests that makes it more difficult for someone who is having legitimate
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.760]   breathing problems from getting to see a doctor and getting the attention that he or she needs.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:11.520]   Andy and I co WGBH Boston, Renee Richie from YouTube fame of YouTube fame.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:20.320]   Pretty pictures are next. Let's see here's the, it came out today, the new shot on iPhone 12
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:29.040]   portraits, cityscapes, the night sky and more. Oh, these are beautiful shots. So I always feel
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:35.040]   bad when I see these because I can't get these quality shots. So here's one thing, we talked
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:41.840]   about this during the Apple event last September, is are people allowed to use external lighting
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:46.640]   with these shots? Are they doing big elaborate lighting setups with these shots or?
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.360]   For the Apple events, they're straight from camera. They do that deliberately because they never,
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.200]   a couple of vendors got caught severely faking that kind of stuff and nobody ever wants to be in
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:59.520]   that sort of a situation. So they make really sure that it's straight from camera. This stuff,
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.720]   though, I think, they had to be captured with the iPhone. These are not Apple artists. These
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.200]   are people who posted these images publicly. But what we don't know is if the, in this picture,
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:15.680]   which is beautiful from Kuwait guy, shepherds, I guess, sitting at a fire, this beautiful night
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:19.920]   sky. Well, you don't know if there might be another light in that fire or a light off.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:23.440]   Also, one thing I found out because people complained that I had to look into it is that
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:27.120]   these photos don't say where they're from. They say where the photographer lives.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.000]   That's not Kuwait. That's not Kuwait either.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.400]   So that's where Abdullah Shaji, who took the picture lives. We don't know where the picture is.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:44.560]   Here is one from Neil Kumar, who is in the United States. I don't know where this is.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:50.640]   Looks like it might be Philadelphia, I'm not sure. But that's a pretty picture of a puddle
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:56.800]   in some row houses. You know, these are, I guess the point is these are as good as professional
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:05.120]   pictures taken with $5,000 DSLRs. There's no way to look at this and say, oh, no, this is one from
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.640]   the iPhone Mini, which is kind of cool. Yeah.
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:13.360]   It's important to keep it in context. The one that you were just showing about the kid who's
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:18.480]   silhouetted against the red, that is on a technical level that is an amazing demonstration of how
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:24.480]   it was able to pull shadow detail from the flowers in that basket and also contain details in a
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:31.120]   very, very super saturated red. That said, we're dealing with people that these are photographers
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.440]   who know how light works and know what makes a good picture. I had on Instagram somebody,
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:41.360]   I did a selfie on 4th of July. They came out really, really nice. And I just, as usual,
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:46.000]   I just mentioned, oh, taken with my Pixel version one, like a four or five-year-old camera,
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.040]   like, oh my God, that was taken with a Pixel one. And my only, my only response was there is,
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.720]   there is a, an adequate, a merely adequate, quick camera, a picture taken with a merely
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:02.000]   adequate camera, one half hour, 45 minutes before sunset, is we'll be, we'll outperform
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.920]   any, almost any other camera under any other condition. So it's, it's, it's important to make
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:13.200]   sure that you see the information that's being conveyed in the shot. Like again, a big, big,
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:17.840]   bright fire on the bottom of the picture. And yet it's getting, it's reading stars from the top
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.480]   of the picture, but not thinking that the next time you just take random shots at your kid's birthday
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.840]   party, the next time you take a picture, uh, at, you take a picture of a, of your, of your partner
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:33.520]   in front of the Eiffel Tower with the sun behind them and they're, and on a cloudy over, on, on a
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.880]   sunny day, it's not going to magically turn this into a magically wonderful picture. But that's why
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:43.120]   it's important to analyze these pictures and really show what they're actually being demonstrating.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.240]   And I apologize if you're, you know, the, the pictures you're seeing, if you're watching the
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.720]   video are so highly compressed that you're not seeing, go to apple.com/newsroom and you can see
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.080]   the actual pictures. The other thing I would point out, this is clearly, well, maybe not, but
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:03.600]   this is a picture from, uh, Italy. It looks very much like it was post-processed with a high dynamic
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.920]   range. Oh, I'm sure. Well, even, even not, they could have just gone into like, you know, the,
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.240]   the photos app and press the couple buttons. Yeah. Vibrant filter, apply. Right. Right.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:18.800]   That's the other thing you, you, any, almost any picture taken with like, and just do 15 seconds
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:24.240]   of pushing sliders around and wherever the standard app is to make it exactly to your liking because no,
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.200]   no, no cyber eye is going to be as good as a human eye and figuring out that, oh, I actually want,
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.720]   this, this actually should be a little bit warmer. I wish there were more detail here. I was, it was
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:37.840]   so funny. I want to give, I want to use this as an excuse to praise, uh, uh, Bernay and his picks
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:42.800]   last week. I did, I did buy the little pocket light that he recommended last week and it arrived and
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:49.120]   I had to like a takeout salad. And so I was pla, and the salad was like getting warm as I was just like,
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.680]   as I'm waiting, I was like using different like video settings on this light to get the lighting
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:57.600]   rate, but it wasn't just like the lighting that you got that was correct. It was also the idea that
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.720]   I went into light, removal right on my phone and decided that, okay, I really want this to be more
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.600]   detail here. I want there to be the, the art just to be darker than the center, all this sort of stuff.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.880]   This is, this is the reasons why I get, I get so frustrated that I've got like, sometimes I travel
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:18.480]   with $4,000 with a camera equipment. And yet when things landed, my, my Google photos and my Apple
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:23.680]   photos account, I can't really tell which photos were taken with a cheap, with a $350 phone.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.320]   Okay. And which I'll be doing now. Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:31.440]   If you bought a Belkin portable wireless charger and stand special edition,
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.120]   Wiz 003, Belkin wants it back. They'll give you a full refund.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:43.760]   Apparently no one has been hurt. There's been no property damage, but a manufacturing defect
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:49.760]   of the power supply can cause a charger to malfunction and overheat. That would be bad.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:55.040]   So yeah, say folks, yeah, little, little public service announcement. You might want to return that.
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:12:01.440]   You could just do a search for Belkin portable wireless charger and recall and you'll probably
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:09.120]   find everything you need. Epic has taken the Fortnite battle with Apple to the UK.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:19.280]   According to Bloomberg, the company is now has committed a complaint. The UK's anti-trust
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:25.120]   tribunal. What a surprise. What you use in the American complaint and refiled it.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:32.800]   Yeah, what a surprise. And iOS 14.4, which is not out yet, but is in its beta,
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:40.960]   has an interesting bit of code that will warn you if your camera was repaired or replaced with
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:47.440]   aftermarket components instead of genuine Apple components. Is this Renee? They've done this before,
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:52.080]   but is that because of security issues or reliability issues?
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:59.840]   My guess is that it's because of corporate liability issues. My preference would be that they don't
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.080]   prevent the stuff from working, but they do tell you so that if you think you're buying a new
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.520]   phone, you can go in and look and it'll say, so you're not a new, but if you think you're buying a
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   phone from somebody that has all the original parts, you can go in and see, oh, this was swapped,
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:16.080]   that was swapped. And if the battery or something is not Apple original, you can go in and see that.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.960]   I think information is always good, but the bottom line is if anything goes wrong, Apple is the one
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:27.440]   that gets sued. So I think they see where their most painful litigation is coming from and then
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:32.800]   try to solve for that. With the battery warning, it operates in everything. They just say, hey,
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:37.440]   we're not, can't be held liable here. It's unclear whether this camera warning will
[01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:44.640]   disable the camera or not, probably not, I would guess. It really is consumer-forward,
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:51.280]   especially because it's possible to reprogram a battery to lie about what its capacity is,
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:55.680]   lie about what its usage history has been. There are counterfeit components that are flooding the
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.080]   markets because, as do it yourself, excuse me, as independent prepare shops are becoming more
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.800]   prevalent, it's probably getting, it's probably case of getting ahead of a problem. I would be
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.040]   complaining if Apple were saying I refuse to, the camera app will not launch because it detects
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:13.840]   non-Apple parts or non-certified repairs to your camera subsystem, where I refuse to charge because
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.320]   I detect a non-Apple repair has been under the battery. If all they're doing is informing the
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:22.880]   user that this is what we suspect and this is why we suspect it, then that's the definition of a
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:29.760]   pro-consumer sort of action. I've been seeing a lot of chatter over new Mac OS beta code that
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:38.960]   suggests that side-loaning iOS apps will no longer be allowed. Right now, you can use iMazing or
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:46.160]   some other app to get the app itself, the app file itself, so that you can install it on the Mac,
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.600]   even if it's blocked in the app store, but you have to do it manually. There's some evidence that
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:59.440]   iOS 14.4 beta versions and Mac OS Big Sur 11.2 will implement a system that will actually block
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.640]   those apps from running on the Mac. There's some developers who are super angry about that because
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.000]   either they sell a Mac version, they believe this is a form of piracy or they don't want their
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.200]   thing running on Mac because it's not an app that they're without a Mac. It's not a good experience.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.920]   Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, or it's a big gaming company that just doesn't want you to do that.
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:21.760]   Yeah, a lot of people, for instance, Netflix is an example, a lot of people,
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:27.680]   Instagram, Facebook. They want you on the website so they can cookie you. I mean, that's big for them.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:34.000]   Yeah, so you can sideload it using iMazing or something like that, get the IPA file,
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.560]   but that's going to probably stop in the next version of iOS and Big Sur.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.960]   It was a big deal for them bringing iOS apps to the Mac because it is a touchy subject with a
[01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:49.360]   lot of developers. I think the bargain they struck was if you're in secure mode, like the default
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.120]   mode, you could run those apps because then they're still wrapped in fair play and the developer
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:57.040]   gets to consent to them being run. But if you go and turn that off and you go back to like
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:03.120]   hobbyist, Mac-ity Mac mode, then you don't get to just run unfettered apps anymore because a lot of
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.760]   those, it's the same as ROMs and emulators and things that get really touchy. So it's like just
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:18.800]   balancing consumer desire with developer demands. Although there's an interesting tweet from Chance
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:25.280]   Miller saying, I don't know what this means, interestingly, Apple has reverted the server side
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:30.960]   change that block users from sideloading. So for now, you can keep doing it, but don't expect it to last.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.320]   So it's my understanding too. I don't know what's going on.
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:39.200]   Developers should be trying to free once you. Yeah, yeah, that's the thing.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.640]   That you honor the developers' request for whatever reason.
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:48.080]   Yeah, I totally agree with the developers argument that, hey, we didn't design this to work on the
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.840]   on the Mac. We're embarrassed by how bad it looks on the Mac or they don't even have to have a reason
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:57.440]   for it. I've been trying to figure out exactly why Apple thought it was so important. Why
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:04.080]   having iOS app compatibility across two platforms was an important enough thing to actually make
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:10.800]   it into a formal feature. I don't think it's a bad idea. It's just that when you make it voluntary
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:16.080]   like that, I think most people, most developers are simply going to opt out and save themselves
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:21.920]   a whole bunch of problems. Once you make something optional, that's the reason why Apple, the first
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:25.760]   Mac, didn't have function keys on the keyboard because you don't want to make the Mac support
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:31.520]   of the Mac mouse optional for any developer whatsoever. I'm going to be curious. I'm going to be keen
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:36.480]   to find out in a year from now how many people are actually using iOS apps on the Mac desktop.
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:43.040]   It's not a great experience. No, I was looking forward to it. Again, it's not terrible. It's
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:48.160]   better than in many cases, it's better than nothing. But in most cases, the app that is available on
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:55.280]   the Mac, excuse me, the app that's available in iOS is also available in some sort of way, shape,
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:02.160]   or form through either a desktop app or more likely a web browser app, sometimes a browser app that
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:11.040]   can actually take its data with you. I haven't found it to be as much of a mind-blower as I
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.880]   hope that it was going to be. I wonder if they thought there would be more pushback from the loss
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:22.160]   of bootcamp and that this would in some way be the big bootcamp-like story. We went to Intel and
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.840]   that's how you can run Windows apps. We went to Apple Silicon and now you can run iOS apps and
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:34.880]   just nobody really cared that much. Or I could just as easily see, because of the way that Apple's
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:42.080]   been very, very well managing its architectures and its roadmaps, if some couple of engineers
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:47.600]   figured out that, hey, look, we built this special version of Xcode where if you just click this
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:53.600]   one button, you can churn out a Mac compatible version of this iOS app. Now we've got iOS apps
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:58.240]   running on the Mac. It seems to work. We just did it for fun, also because there's something more
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.880]   important that we actually didn't want to do, like solving some MagSafe problems. And then it's
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:07.280]   just got enough traction that people said, you know what, it costs us nothing to include this.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:12.000]   We'll just have to deal with some public relations with their development community,
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.480]   but that would be a really cool thing to put into the announcement. If we're explaining why we're
[01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:23.680]   ditching the most famous and most popular processing platform in the world for something that we'd
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.880]   whipped up ourselves and our back in our back bunker, that would be another little feather in our cap.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.960]   I forgot to mention on Windows Weekly last week, I forgot to mention on this show,
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:41.680]   you can now run sort of Windows on your M1 Macintosh using the pre-release of parallel. I'm
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:48.640]   running it right now, on parallels. And then you have to use the Windows 10 Pro Insider Build 4
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:57.360]   Windows on ARM. Some things work great. Office runs just fine. I'm not sure if it's a PWA version
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:04.720]   of Microsoft Word, but it runs quickly and so forth. And it's completely doable. And then some
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:12.720]   things don't like calculator. Paul Throt says that's because it's a 32-bit version of calculator,
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.840]   and so it's just not going to run. But it works. And so for people who are, you can't run the
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:24.000]   Microsoft story either oddly enough, again 32-bit, I think. But Edge. I feel like they're clouding
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.360]   everything. It's just so close to Windows being a web service that they're not really that intent
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:34.160]   on doing any of this anymore. Yeah. I think that's completely right. That's Microsoft you're
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:40.000]   saying. And I think that's completely right. But you can do it. And so we were promised this back
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:46.640]   in June at WWDC and parallels. It's a pre-release version of parallels, and it's a pre-release version
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:51.200]   of Windows 10 on ARM. I don't think I would surprise anyone. If like next WWC they announced,
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:56.960]   Microsoft recently announced Windows for Azure and it runs great on M2 Mac.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:03.840]   Right. Yeah. It's kind of fun to run it. There's a coherence mode as well, which means you can
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:11.120]   run some Windows apps like Word as a window on the Macintosh so you have access to both.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:17.040]   If you've been hoping as many of us had that Apple at some point would make messages available
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:24.320]   on Android or Windows, maybe there's some good news. Apple last actually 2019 began hiring
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.520]   engineers to quote, "Build the next generation of media apps for Windows." And now they've delivered
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:37.120]   Apple as working on music and podcast apps to appear on the Microsoft Store.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.600]   Sources told 9 to 5 Mac that Apple's been testing these in a private beta.
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:49.520]   That's all we know. That's Eddie's org. I mean, I believe the message, all that stuff is very
[01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:54.800]   appily, and Eddie's org has their entire own software development team that does iWork and music
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:00.480]   and podcasts and all of those apps. And I think once they got music on Android, they just had to,
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.480]   it was just like, "Are we going to do it or not?" And they use all very similar frameworks and
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:08.480]   design and implementation and everything. So another thing is ever non-trivial, but I think
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:13.840]   those are the nearest next neighbor apps for Apple to move over, especially as their services.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.160]   Like, I wouldn't be surprised to see the TV app move over as well. It's on TV. It's just so much.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:21.840]   It's so much. So much audience for that, yeah. And they make money on it.
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:27.120]   They can't, if they really want to gain traction, especially with the content that they're creating,
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:33.040]   they're not going to do it by being world famous in Western Massachusetts. They have to reach out
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:37.280]   to the entire world. And that means that they're going to have to support Android in some fashion.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.680]   They're going to have to support Windows in some fashion. Or else they're just sort of admitting
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:47.040]   that we don't know how to write code if we can't control absolutely everything from top to bottom,
[01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:51.040]   which is that we just, Pat Lee, not true. I said they make money on Apple TV plus, but not yet.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:57.840]   They have now. No, not yet. Soon, someday. Definitely. Definitely not yet.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:03.520]   Those of us who have free subscriptions are now extended through July of this year.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:08.400]   It makes sense. They haven't been able to make or launch almost any new content,
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.760]   and it doesn't look like that has changed significantly for them.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:17.600]   So if you bought an Apple iPhone or an Apple Watch or an Apple TV in 2019,
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:24.640]   you were given a year that theoretically expired in November 2020. They extended that to February
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:30.640]   and now extended again. And I have to say, I'm watching Servant season two. Good.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:37.680]   I watched a lot of good shows. I watched the new Tom Hanks movie, News of the World. That was
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:43.280]   on Apple TV, was it? I think it was $20. But it's good. You know what? Last night,
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:48.240]   Lee Sin, I said, we're going to watch some uplifting stuff. We want to watch something happy.
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:53.520]   And so we watched that. It was very, it's a TV plus and iTunes rentals have become really
[01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.760]   conflated for me. Like when I spent 30 bucks on Wonder Woman, I don't think that's TV plus money.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:05.840]   I think that's still iTunes rental money. It's very, it's unclear. It's unclear. Yeah.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:12.320]   And News of the World is available for your basic $20 to get in everywhere.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:16.400]   Right. Yeah. Get it on YouTube. It's one of those movies that opened Christmas Day,
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:22.160]   made a few million dollars in theaters, but not enough to support it. And they've released it as a
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:31.120]   as an expensive rental on a lot of services. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. What else? AirPOD
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:38.480]   Max battery drain. Apparently, have you had any problems with the AirPOD Max battery?
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:43.760]   I did not, but I know several people who did and all of them managed to fix it by,
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.360]   I think all but one managed to fix it just by doing the reset, holding down the two buttons on
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.440]   it and repairing it and then it went away, which makes it sound like it was just bad bits to me,
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.360]   which sounds silly, but that's what happens. Yeah. Even when left in the special Apple
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:02.720]   Rezier, the headphones drain, the chaps drain from 100% to nothing overnight,
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:06.800]   which is not what's supposed to happen. But yeah, that's interesting. You know, I mentioned last
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:13.200]   week that my iPhone 12 Pro Max had stopped changing, charging on the MagSafe adapter and a couple
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:17.840]   of people wrote to me and Lisa reminded me, she said, Oh yeah, remember, we rebooted mine and it
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:24.960]   started it again. It is a known bug, apparently. And rebooting will fix it. I rebooted the iPhone
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:32.800]   and then springboard worked, but I couldn't, there was no, it was unresponsive once I was in any app.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:37.680]   So I rebooted again. And now everything works again. So there's still some video,
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:45.120]   video, reboot windows, la pot, the window. So still a few bugs in iOS. I don't know where I am,
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:50.240]   14 point is that my aunt two, I guess I'm on the latest, whatever that is. Is it three already?
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:56.800]   That might be one they want to fix sooner than later. I'm just saying, it's kind of a weird bug.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:02.960]   The biggest issue they have now and causes so much anger is that these things are so complicated
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.800]   that everybody gets different bugs based on their configuration, the software they're running,
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:11.840]   sorry, the processes they're running. And even 1% of people having those problems are hundreds
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:16.800]   of thousands of people, but like they'll fix Wi-Fi and it'll fix it for the 1% they were having
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:21.040]   problems, but introduce it for the 1% for 1% of the people who weren't having problems. And it's
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:26.400]   like whack-a-mole over a billion installs. Are you excited that now with that you they found out
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:33.760]   with a SIM SIM card adapter, you can remove the headband. So Renee has already spent thousands on
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:39.520]   Apple watch bands. Now we can customize his headband on his air parts. George just started
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.720]   swapping the cups and trying to steal them. She's like, I like this better. It's the cups off of
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:48.560]   my p-runs. But don't tell her she'll take the headband back. Yeah, apparently there's even some
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:57.280]   code in iOS 14.4. A headband type identifier. It makes sense because both the cups and the headband
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:02.640]   are the things that are going to like the everything else is really solid, but replacing the headband
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.520]   replacing the cups not only lets you customize them if you want, but also let's those things are
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.840]   going to need like from your hair or from wear and tear from your ears. They're going to get
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:15.120]   grudgy. They're going to get bad. And if you can replace that it's better than replacing the whole
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:22.400]   thing. Here is the best. Believe it or not during this past week CES happened. No one noticed.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:30.640]   The best Apple related accessories, according to Mac rumors at CES 2021 Pioneer introduced a car
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:40.080]   play head unit that with a 6.8 inch touch screen and a hideaway control unit coming this summer,
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:48.560]   no pricing yet. So this is yet another car play head you can install in your car. LG OLED ultra
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:57.680]   fine monitor 31.5 inches. Nice. 8 million pixels HDR individual pixel dimming. It's the first OLED
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:06.720]   from LG. That's why the rumors about Apple came back into a less expensive premium monitor kind of
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:11.280]   surprised me a little bit because historically they seem to only put things on the market when
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:19.040]   they don't think that the third parties are making something that's suitable for their hardware
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:23.360]   and that now that there's so many other companies that are making really, really good ultra HD
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:29.520]   displays with really, really great performance specs, it's surprised me a little bit that they
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.320]   want to continue to make super expensive monitors like that. Look at this. The only thing I'll add
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.160]   to that is like they've always just taken so far for the last few years they've taken those LG
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:42.960]   panels the exact LG panels they have in the iMac and just re-wrapped them but when they stop doing
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:48.320]   that and they let LG do it on their own you can say the design was pedestrian but it was also bad
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:52.720]   like the first generation would interfere with Wi-Fi routers because they didn't put tin foil on it.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:57.040]   The second generation just had all sorts like this just threads and threads of complaints
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:02.320]   about how poorly it works and I think and those what Apple was selling in the Apple Store because
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.600]   they had no nothing else to sell and I think they're just like yes LG you make very nice panels you
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.600]   do not make very nice displays you will give us back those panels and we will take care of the
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:20.480]   rest again thank you. I do as I think about my new Mac Pro Mini I am thinking about and I'm you
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:27.760]   know the problem is I have an iMac so but I really want one of those really wide displays and LG
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:35.840]   is showed off a 39.7 inch 5k 2k ultra wide monitor. Like wraparounds? Yeah I really want that with my new
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:42.400]   mission control. Yeah one of the nice things about many of these displays is they have built in KVM
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:47.840]   so you could or you could split the screen and have you know a Linux box or a Windows box and a
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:54.480]   Mac on the same screen. I really like that flexibility some very intriguing style. Yeah when to go back
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:30:02.720]   to like the sort of like military bunker sort of this kind of awful displays once you have the
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:08.320]   ability I'm down to only two screens because I'm on this station at least I've got the M1 that only
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:12.960]   supports one display I used to have two displays up here and then another display down there I
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:18.000]   kind of miss having that sort of like on deck circle for things I just kind of want to have
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.320]   visual access to so yeah that's I've got so close to buying a huge super huge curved display
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:30.320]   I've had that that thing get it out of my basket so many times on so many different stores because it
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:36.080]   really does change the way that you work. So I'm like Nick Fury where like how does he how does he
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:40.080]   turn his head like it's exhausting I can't do it I have one display right in front of me and that's
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:44.640]   all I can focus on and I try to I get too tired with the design side display so I'm going to go for
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:50.720]   the unit ask really that 32 inch display is going to be mine. You're no universe you know Marvel
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:31:00.080]   universe superhero I guess. I was playing Galaga they caught me. If you have five devices to charge
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:07.040]   Sateki has released a dock five multi-device charging station uses a Qi and up to five devices
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:16.080]   at a time as well as I see USB-C ports so I guess you put your AirPods on the Qi and then a couple
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:21.760]   of phones and a couple of iPads and just to help the house doesn't. It's a family charger. It's a
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:28.160]   family charger. Yeah I think school is actually probably logical. Kenzie Tin has a studio dock for
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:36.400]   the iPad Pro that has built in wireless charging that's kind of cool isn't it? Yeah yeah particularly
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:42.800]   with so many people who are using the iPad Pro essentially as a wireless Mac display with the
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:48.880]   with another Mac on their on their same wireless network that is such a nice tidy solution just
[01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:53.360]   to say nothing about how well it just simply works as a standalone thing if you have a dock
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:58.320]   for it that lets you interact with it with a keyboard and a mouse in a very very natural way
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.160]   and give you all the ports you're going to expect in a desktop. Yeah such a great way to get value
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:09.840]   out of this thousand dollar tablets you might have paid for. Three USB-A ports one USB-C port HDMI 2.0
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:15.520]   three and a half millimeter headphone jack and SD card reader and I gave a bit ethernet port.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:25.360]   Wow why is it a little bit more than my iPad has more i/o than my Mac Pro? That's pretty cool
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:31.440]   and it's kind of it makes the iPad Pro look like a little floating iMac a little mini iMac
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:38.880]   so that's kind of cool I like it. Here's another ultra wide Dell 40 inch ultra wide in their
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:48.000]   ultra sharp category built in USB 3 compatibility. $2,100 if I don't say a price or availability date
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:54.000]   like with the Kensington studio dock it's because one doesn't exist that Dell monitor is available
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:02.640]   now. JBL Dolby Atmos sound bar has AirPlay 2 built in that's nice here's another Belkin 2-in-1
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:11.040]   mag safe charger Belkin announced earbuds to Samsung announced Samsung tags this was an ad
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:21.600]   yes it was it was concurrent with CES. Samsung got a Samsung they beat Apple to it. The air tags
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:30.560]   still were waiting for the Apple air tags but Samsung has tags that work. Can I just add like
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:35.040]   their their event was much better way better than any of their previous events last year.
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:38.480]   You're getting there. But the part that I loved and I freely admit every company copies every
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.800]   company but they literally came up on stage and says nobody innovates like Samsung we are
[01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:49.120]   unparalleled in innovation. We're announcing the AirPads pros yeah that's why the AirPods
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:55.840]   pro and I just let come on read the script. Guys so the Samsung Galaxy Smart Tag and Smart Tag plus
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.280]   you may not want to many of the features require a Samsung device Samsung not even just Android
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:07.760]   but Samsung. There will be they don't have UWB yet but they say we're going to do a UWB version
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.040]   later this year so right now it's basically a tile tracker that only works with Samsung that's
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:23.360]   not so hot. And then yeah they have new Galaxy Bud Pro with noise cancellation $199 a little less
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:30.880]   than the AirPods Pro but again I have a feeling they work best with Samsung devices. They're doing
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:38.800]   the ecosystem play like Apple. I feel so bad for the pocketcast folks remember public media bottom
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:45.120]   now they're selling them. One less than a year after they bought pocketcast
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:52.000]   pocketcast owners which include NPR New York Public Radio Chicago Public Media and BBC Studios
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:35:01.520]   America. Maybe that's the problem agreed last month to sell pocketcasts. John Gibbons did not
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:09.920]   respond to current's questions calling the situation a fluid event so I guess we don't know
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:19.360]   who bought them or for how much this is still in my mind and I have to say public radio did not
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:23.280]   destroy pocketcast but it's still in my mind my favorite podcast catcher.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:34.640]   Yeah. Russell Ivanovic is a you used to do the Google podcast together and he actually
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:42.560]   came back to the yeah and it's it's just such a beautiful app. It's it's it's it's often that you
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:47.840]   come across an app where it was developed by people who wanted to use this as their primary
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:52.800]   podcast podcast catcher and every time something annoyed them or every time they found themselves
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:57.840]   wasting time they implemented a feature or just as easily as soon as more than three and a half
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.600]   people asked for a feature they would take a look at it and say yeah that's a great idea let's do
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.840]   that. So I hope that this I hope the pocketcast continues to endure it was eminently worth three
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:12.160]   dollars and ninety nine cents when it was actually being charged for and so I'm it's too popular
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:16.160]   in app to ever go away. Yeah and of course that was part of the problem as public radio did not
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:22.400]   charge for it they made it free which means they lost a lot of money. In fact NPR which is just
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:27.520]   a part owner I think a one third owner of it said that they lost eight hundred thousand
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:33.840]   dollars on pocketcast so in one year so I can see why public broadcasting which is kind of you know
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:38.400]   always running on a shoestring said yeah maybe we shouldn't be owning a podcast app.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:48.160]   And don't go to an Apple store this week in Washington DC because there's big fences
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.040]   everywhere and you can't get in because they're closing those stores ahead of the
[01:36:53.040 --> 01:36:59.760]   inauguration tomorrow. All right I think unless there's anything I missed I miss any stories
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.840]   that you guys wanted to talk about I think we covered everything I had on my list.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.880]   Nope all right so we talked about the tear down we talked to everything. Yep let's get ready for
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:18.480]   our picks of the week always my favorite part of the show. Pick of the week starting today with Renee
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:25.040]   Richie. So my pick of the week is an app called Clubhouse which actually isn't that new it came
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:30.480]   out about a year ago but it was invitation only it's still iOS only and I think the only people
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:34.640]   who were using it a year ago with Matthew was Matthew Panzareno of TechCrunch and all the venture
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.560]   capitalists. So it kind of fell off my radar and I kept hearing intermittent things about you know
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:47.280]   like maybe the venture capitalists were a little bit how should we say not encompassing not diverse
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:52.800]   and we're expressing worrisome amounts of those sorts of things so I kind of totally discounted
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:57.280]   and discredited it but then I started going wide again around two weeks ago and I started seeing
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:04.160]   more and more people use it so I went on to check it out and I have I have been enjoying it and maybe
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:08.480]   a little bit too much. So if you're not familiar with the club else it's an app. Before you go on
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:15.520]   I just need on Sunday except me and invite so I'm in there and I'm baffled I don't understand what
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:22.240]   to do I'm getting notifications. I'll explain it to you. What is this thing it's a drop in audio
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:28.080]   chat app so you go into Clubhouse and you'll see a bunch of rooms and the key thing is to follow
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:33.280]   people that you know and trust it'll try to get you to give you to give it topics of interest for
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:39.360]   you but those are like gambling you're gambling with your sanity. There's a room right now with 19
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:45.680]   people in it. What's the best letter of the alphabet? So I don't see any of that stuff I have it set to
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:50.160]   only show me people that I follow so I'll go in there and I'll see like Luria Petrucci teaching
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:56.320]   live streaming or I'll go in there and what I've my problem with it is that I go in there and I see
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:01.760]   like some of the best YouTubers and podcasters in the business talking about their business and
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:06.160]   because it's still new because it's like the early days of Twitter when there was one timeline
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:10.240]   and if you were on Twitter you suddenly knew everybody they're just all willing to tell you
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:16.400]   everything like all the biggest producers the biggest managers the biggest hosts all of them
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:24.240]   just freely discussing everything they do for growth for for deals for financing for management
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:28.480]   they had the people who run space station which is Peter McKinnon's agency on there
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:32.320]   they have the people who do like Mr. Beast and Logan Paul and all of those
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.760]   sorts of endeavors just on there talking about how they approach content but they'll talk into
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:42.560]   like four in the morning and you can't record it you can't replay it it is against terms of service
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:48.080]   to is everybody talking at once what is going on? I don't know so you have a moderator and the
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.920]   moderator can the moderator starts the room and then there's two people just audio yes it's like
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:59.760]   an audio chat room and absolutely and then the people the moderator follow so you have a speaker
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.400]   stage which are people who can unmute their mic and talk and then the next tier is people who are
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.280]   followed by the speakers and then the tier after that is the general audience and you can if you're
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.760]   a moderator you can bring people up on stage and push them back down off the stage it's just like
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:20.320]   Alex you can make these other moderators kind of with audio only yes yeah it's very it's very
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:25.440]   some of that it's very small features one thing that's interesting is because Justine invited you
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:30.560]   Justine's picture will always be on your profile as a person who vouched for you on plug palace
[01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:34.400]   so that's why you want to be nice so it's not real accountability but it's social accountability
[01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.880]   right yeah because they'll blame her if you do anything Leo got it totally go after her but like
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:44.800]   for example we started Viper who's another tech youtuber myself and a guy called a guy named Jeff
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:50.480]   Lefey who does audio review started a tech youtuber lounge every Saturday night and we were in there
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:56.400]   this week and Justine and Jenna showed up and Brian Tong and Justine discussed how they were
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:01.760]   hosting CES and what that whole experience was like and then you had like and a bunch of like
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:06.640]   super saff was explaining how he does brand deals and how he negotiates contracts which
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:12.080]   people who are just beginning you to have no idea how any of that stuff works so it's very good for
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.840]   accelerating your learning into whatever industry that you're part of and it's free but you have
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.600]   to get somebody to invite you right now yes and it's iOS only right now as well like they do
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:26.000]   require real phone number two and they do say they have a real name policy it is poorly enforced
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.880]   I see a lot of people with not real names there but they want that sort of level accountability
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:34.240]   so you need to give someone your phone number in order for them to invite you which means you have
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:40.400]   to trust them enough with your phone number so like a lot of social networks right now it's dominated
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:45.360]   by a certain group of people sounds like youtubers startup people marketing people
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:51.120]   but it's going to end up being chat roulette in about five minutes so enjoy it now it's already
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.920]   that and so there there is horrible stuff like there is anything like there's fascist anti-covit
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:02.160]   racist anti-semitics all sorts of those things but because I don't I only I'm only notified and I
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:07.280]   only see rooms that people I know and trust are in I never see that part of it they have to they
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.880]   have to work on that part and they have new buttons now like you can insta ban a troll and you can
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:16.160]   insta report an account for violations of terms of service which is like the simple stuff that
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:19.920]   parley got kicked off for not doing right but if you stick to people like if I go in there and I
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:25.120]   see leola port is hosting you know leo and andian alex are hosting a room on how to be a successful
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:30.640]   podcaster I will join that and I will never see any of the of the sort of garbage stuff that goes on
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:36.640]   and every social network when when I first signed up it gave me a tag cloud of interests which I
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:43.840]   tapped and I gather that's why I'm seeing what I'm seeing now so how do I turn all that off turn
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:49.120]   all that okay so is that in settings where is that I think so yeah I actually didn't set it to
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.600]   begin with so I'm not sure if you can turn on so here's interests and you and I could get rid of
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.480]   my I could wish just uncheck everything and I won't see anything yeah all right and then follow people
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:02.000]   you can follow people when you see them in the room so if people are really smart and sharing
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.840]   good stuff you can follow them and then you'll see them in more rooms I'm I have 57 followers and
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:14.960]   I'm following 87 people Mike a sergeant Christina Warren Shira Lazar Kevin Rose Baratunde Thurston
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:20.320]   Ryan Hoover so I'm following good people and so I will get a notification when those people
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:27.520]   start a room and if you don't like a room you can leave like I mr beast again he's a youtuber who
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:32.720]   just got to 50 million subscribers and he he was running his room like he runs his channel with like
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:37.360]   extreme dedication to retention if someone asked a question that he thought wasn't interesting to
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:42.080]   the entire room or if he saw people dropping off he would immediately change subjects to try to
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:45.920]   keep with many people engaged and interested as possible it seems that I have remarkable that
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:52.640]   there is some flaws in this because I I know I specifically did not follow Jared Leto I did not
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.440]   but apparently I am now following him and I see a lot of other people I follow him so there's people
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:03.040]   that care is medic he's he's just on a there's a lot of people I know I didn't follow Gary Vayner
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:08.000]   check I because it's bizarre though too like on Saturday the district attorney of San Francisco
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:12.480]   was in there with a bunch of like tech I forget his name the person who left tech crunch recently
[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.880]   become a venture capitalist um was hosting and they were talking about how they treat the homeless
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:21.840]   in city of San Francisco and not since the early days of Twitter the pre Ashton Kutcher days of
[01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:26.720]   Twitter by the way that kind of direct I'm also apparently following Ashton Kutcher I know I didn't
[01:44:26.720 --> 01:44:32.080]   follow him so I'm gonna unfollow sorry Ashton I don't want to break your heart dude but you had
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:36.800]   you had your chance yeah yeah there I don't know why I'm following there must be some auto follow
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:42.480]   going on so it's new or it's not new it's been around for a year but it's it's still invite only
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:48.960]   it's a little odd oh I know maybe it's looking these people up in my address book maybe that's it
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:52.400]   it could be or that could be it could be suggesting people to you also based on the people that you
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:58.400]   follow yeah it's added a lot of people that I did not add so I don't know what's going on mine is
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.240]   still under my control I go through wouldn't look at it I've lost come completely lost control
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:10.000]   but I have to say a lot of people I love and know are in here so that makes it worthwhile yeah I
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:16.320]   don't know somehow I'm following 80 people which seems like more than I had intended club house so
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:22.800]   how do people get an invite so you have so there's a couple ways one is you can go to clubhouse's
[01:45:22.800 --> 01:45:27.600]   website and sign up and then what it does is alert anybody in clubhouse who might know you
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:32.880]   and I think they're connected to Instagram Twitter and you can also connect to your contacts
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:38.000]   so if one of those things like I saw several people pop up and it said like do you like I think
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.280]   it was oh my god Chad popped up and I said do you know him you can let him in without an invite and
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:46.080]   like yes okay you know you you press that button and it works otherwise you can invite someone but it
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:50.640]   only works over SMS so you have to you have to first be willing to vouch for them because your
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:54.800]   profile pick will be on their profile forever and you have to they have to be willing to give
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:59.040]   you their phone number so you start off with like one invitation and the more you participate the
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:06.320]   more you get by the way mica says you it's during the initial setup process it sets you up with a
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:10.800]   bunch of accounts he says you have to uncheck those as you're going that might be new I didn't
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:16.240]   get those yeah I'm following 80 people I know I didn't follow 80 people and by the way my favorite
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:21.440]   letter in the alphabet is R because without R you can't have talked like a pirate day
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:28.400]   Andy and I co your pick of the week actually I was going to glom on to yours because I had the
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:34.640]   same the same app bookmark there's a new like writing yeah do it writing app I have other other
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:40.480]   ones I can do because I have a okay I have a traffic jam of apps so go ahead yeah it's now demo
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:46.080]   it though while you talk about it please please do yeah this is there this is part of a class of
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:52.320]   writing apps where it understands that writing is not all about I'm going to open my I'm going to
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.920]   open a pages document or a word document I'm going to write the document I'm going to save it to a
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:02.320]   folder and then move on you're often dealing with projects where there's content from all kinds
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:06.080]   of different sources where there are parts to it that you want to do there there are parts of it
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:10.320]   that are just notes on what you want to do there's the finished product and then you need to be able
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:14.720]   to export it in whatever format is going to be useful whether you're putting it online or putting
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:21.920]   it into a doc or something like that so people have heard me recommend Scrivener which I still
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:29.440]   use and it's still wonderful wonderful it really is it really is like the the the I don't know how
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:37.040]   to put it it is the space shuttle of these kinds of apps it is the most complicated powerful useful
[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:41.040]   flexible tool for this sort of thing I've got a research project for what I hope will be a book
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:45.680]   that's been going on for five six seven years and Scrivener is the only app that can manage all the
[01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:51.120]   research that I'm doing all the images I'm dealing with all the PDFs I'm dealing with this is designed
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:57.520]   spaces is different in that I think it has a happy medium between a simple plain text markdown editor
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:05.280]   and the features of Scrivener that I really really like it's it's more meaty than the
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:09.120]   stripped-down editors that don't let you do flexible formatting because once again it's not
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:14.000]   always that you're just doing a bashing out plain text that has to go someplace else you're often
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.320]   really trying to deliver a finished document with media with with formatting with all kinds of
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:26.000]   text and it's also just as good I found as writing a three thousand four thousand word piece as it is
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.920]   for a simple oh someone's about to give me some information over the phone I quickly need to
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:35.280]   make a note and make sure it's attached to this project that I'm working on quick stuff like that
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:40.080]   it allows tags it allows filters it allows writing templates that's another big thing for me
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:46.800]   the one of the limitations of a lot of these different focused writing apps is that they will
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:52.160]   make a design choice on how they think that I want my window to look that will drive me
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:56.880]   baddie after the first 800 words and that I'm done I don't care how good it is under the hood I
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:00.720]   just don't like the fact that there isn't enough white space between the side of the window and
[01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:05.360]   the start of the text you can customize it however you want it comes with templates that are that
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:10.800]   are starts with I'll all I can say is that I've been using it for only about about a week and a half
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.040]   but one of the first things I do at the start of the year is that for each of the different sort of
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:22.240]   like ongoing projects I have I create a new document for that year so that everything that
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:27.600]   I'm writing for NPR goes into one bulk document so I can always have all this research and stuff
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:32.560]   together and instead of creating a scrivener document for that other stuff again that sort
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:38.160]   of catch all stuff I started using spaces for it and I haven't found a reason to switch to
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:43.120]   scrivener for it yet as a matter of fact the only thing that I always didn't that I didn't like
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:48.240]   about scrivener for simple things is that sometimes it really is too big as too difficult to switch
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:54.800]   between a mobile app and a desktop app for for that kind of stuff where space has both iOS and
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.520]   Mac desktop apps they're beautiful they're very very functional I'm again the fact that
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:04.080]   I've been writing thousands of words in it and having found a reason to go back to an app that
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:09.120]   I've used for about 10 years is is endorsement enough again I want to say that I don't think
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:14.160]   that it's a replacement for scrivener but if scrivener now has its rightful place as this is for someone
[01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:18.880]   who is legitimately doing something that's going to take years to build has all kinds of moving
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:23.760]   parts from all kinds of different people it really is the only app that is really really good at
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:28.400]   organizing random data that you have to turn into something that makes common sense space is I think
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:34.960]   is for everything else yeah 1499 a year if you want to get the premium plan it has a lot of neat
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:38.640]   features one of the ones one of the features I really like I mean I don't know if I could show
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:46.640]   you this is it has it supports the the touchpad so as you're writing it will show in the touch
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:51.200]   bar rather it'll show us one of the few apps that really uses a touch bar I'll show you your word
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:57.920]   count it has some quick things so I can quickly add check marks to it and this is all in the
[01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:03.520]   touch bar so I you know there's some really cool features in this it's very well thought out
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:13.520]   it syncs using iCloud so you when you pay for it you get all three iPhone iOS iPad OS and
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:20.400]   Mac OS versions and they all sync together which is kind of cool it reminds me a little bit of bear
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:25.440]   it has an import by the way for bear they say you know we were inspired by bear but we also
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:30.560]   has an import for Ulysses as well we also had some ideas that were a little different
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.680]   it's very clean I agree with you and it's a it's a good deal right now there I think they've
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:39.840]   they've got a deal on it right now so they've got a life you can it's normally 15 bucks a year
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:44.480]   that you can still buy it for just one year or use the free version now but they are offering 35
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:49.600]   bucks lifetime and they've extended they've extended that to the middle of February so you can still
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:53.360]   download it today we use it for a few weeks and I just you know what I decided to give them the
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:58.160]   money because the experience I've had for the past few weeks I mean just just the idea of
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:03.360]   integrating an outliner into it that really works well has it's the difference between
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:10.400]   someone who wanted to create a more multi-document version of BB Edit a more writer focused version
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:16.320]   of BB Edit versus someone who decided to make a more BB Edit version of Microsoft Word this is
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:21.440]   like this has the tools you need to actually focus on a task and actually produce finished
[01:52:21.440 --> 01:52:27.760]   polished results so I just want to if can I say that it just sort of fit into my I want to put
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:32.160]   money into a box and mail it to these people because it's such a beautiful app and so yeah and
[01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:36.720]   fortunately they they thought of that they gave me an option of not even having to put money in a
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:40.320]   box of actually paying the money yeah I end up getting the lifetime as well because it's on sale
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:44.480]   right now and I thought yeah you know I could use this for quite some time and it's not a monthly
[01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:50.080]   yearly subscription they have a lot of themes a lot of different dark and light themes
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:56.240]   as well and it supports markdown which is a huge one for me markdown is kind of
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:03.200]   a table stakes for a writing app for me so I'm yeah very nice nicely done spaces so that was
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:08.320]   going to be my pick but I had another one ready to go for next week so let's talk about
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:20.320]   clear shot or clean shot this is a new screen shot and screen recording tool that I really like
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:28.000]   also not free but it has a lot of really nice features including the ability to have no wallpaper
[01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:34.240]   to eliminate icons on the desktop as you do your capture when you do a capture and let me just do
[01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:39.920]   a capture real quick oops I have to give it permission to do screen recording oh this always
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:45.600]   slows me down I'm not going to worry about this or should I let me do it so I can show you
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:52.400]   because one of the things it does it has its own cloud storage for your screen captures so
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:58.080]   when you use it it gives you a lot of options you can drag and drop automatically share
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:03.840]   there's some really I think really good tools built into this this is a this is a
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:09.920]   I've talked before Zappier also has a new screen shot program this one's not free so
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:17.120]   it might be worth you know checking it out before you you know pay for it but I think
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:24.320]   given all the features it is it is a pretty nice job this is from a company called Make the Web
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:31.680]   and it's called clean shot and it is a one-to-one replacement for the max built-in screen
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:40.240]   capture but it does a whole lot more really very powerful tools to take a look at it at clean shot
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:48.800]   dot com and I get you get free clean shot cloud access they don't use iCloud they use their own
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:54.640]   cloud so I think it's worth it let's just check let me get the pricing for you um
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:59.360]   twenty nine dollars for a single seat they have multi-seat licenses as well and those are that's
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:08.240]   perpetual so I think a good deal clean shot x that is it for this fabulous Mac break weekly
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:13.040]   next week two weeks from now Alex Lindsey joins us next week we get Doc Rock or somebody to come
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:19.920]   by but it's kind of fun just hanging out with my two buddies here Renee Richie is at youtube.com/Renee
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:25.760]   Richie he's also doing a brand new podcast Apple Talk with Georgia Dow how's that going?
[01:55:25.760 --> 01:55:30.960]   It's great I just mentioned something about technology and she tells me how it interfaces
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:34.960]   with our brain and how it makes us react to and treat the world around us and I just set it shut
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:40.160]   up and listen nice oh and Georgia's channel is live she put it live on Monday she's got videos
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:47.520]   going up oh nice and she got her name youtube.com/georgeadow even nicer yeah a little plug for Georgia
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:52.960]   you're taking her up your plug to say nice things about Georgia Dow aren't you a sweetie you know at
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:56.400]   the end of the day I talk about people playing with their phones and she's trying to fix our
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:00.320]   brains and I think it's just so much more important and necessary right now we need both of you that's
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:07.520]   all I can say yeah thank you Renee anything else you want to mention? No just I'm working my way
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:13.200]   through analysis of January's like the slow month in technology tell me even when you're covering CES
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:17.040]   I saw everybody complaining like everybody's numbers are down and it's like that every year
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:23.840]   CES coverage is like negative 10% and it's it always just happens so I just work on like I try to
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.560]   explain everything I try to cover everything I just want people who are planning their purchases for
[01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:32.240]   2021 to have as much information as they can so that's what I'm doing right now.
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:36.720]   Yeah if you want to dive deep on a lot of the things we talked about today including the shot
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:44.320]   on iPhone 12 the iPhone flip the new leaks about the iMac Pro Renee's got videos on all those subjects
