[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly Episode 41 from May 23, 2007.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Ray Danger.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Hi, this is Leo Laporte and welcome to Mac Break Weekly Number 41.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Our thanks to our great host, Scott Born, at the Padango for allowing us to do this show in the Padango Studios.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   That's why it sounds so darn good. In front of a live audience of one, my son, Henry.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   It was Take Your Son to Work Day.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   On the panel, Scott Born, of course, of his brand new show, by the way.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   He's got so many, but the new one is Apple Phone Show at applephoneshow.com.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Already, top 10.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Top 10, when my saying top five on iTunes technology podcast, applephoneshow.com.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Also, Merlin Mann is here from 43folders.com.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   And Craig Severson.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Craig is the media grunt.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   You can find out more about him at mediagrunt.com.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   He's got at least two great podcasts, pod grunt and video grunt.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And now venture cast to, and you hear him regularly on this week in media.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We began with the biggest story of the week, of course, the Apple Engadget iPhone rumor.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Big story, I guess the big story, if you're an Apple shareholder, and we should get Ryan Block on.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   We can't reach him right now because we haven't made Skype credits.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Because Scott Born as soon as the price tanked, he sold.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   I did not sell.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Ryan is offered to talk about this, but he is the Engadget Editor who got an email.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It was actually from Apple.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It was an internal Apple email.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   They call it a news.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So he claims.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   So he claims, and I believe him, that, and nobody's denied this.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Apparently, somebody hacked an Apple's email system, but they have a news bulletin service on Apple.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   When all Apple employees, and of course, some Apple employee immediately sent it to Ryan, who published the story,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   that the iPhone was going to be delayed till October.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It was a hoax.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And Apple within an hour retracts it, but it's already up on Engadget.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   The timeline is actually great.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We did this on a twit, but the memo goes out around 9 in the morning.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   The phony news bulletin goes out around 9 in the morning.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Ryan's got it up within 45 minutes on Engadget's site.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   With another hour, Apple has lost $4 billion in market value.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And Scott Born several million of those billion.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Did you freak out?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Did you wear what you're watching this?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Listen, there's an entire computer in my office that does nothing but watch stops.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So the alarms go off?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Yes, little red lights and bells went off, and I went to a 10-400.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   But which is worse?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Which is worse from your point of view?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Losing all that money or the iPhone being delayed till October.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Actually, it was the iPhone being delayed.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   That was the thing that really bothered me the most.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I didn't actually lose any money because I didn't sell, and of course, it rebounded.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   That was the time to buy because if you bought then, not only did the stock rebound once Engadget
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   shortly after that, another hour or so went by Engadget said, "Whoops, wrong."
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I did.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I did.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I did.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I came back almost all the way that same day.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And then the next day, Apple announces FCC approval.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Right.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And it's up six bucks.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So you bought.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I didn't buy because I was afraid of all the things that were happening around that,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   attracting some SEC attention to anybody that did a big play either way.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   So I just sat tight in my position and I'm glad I did.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Overall, it's okay.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   But those of us who had Apple stock probably want to have a conversation with Ryan about
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   how to do this next time.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Which is absolutely positively wait until you hear from somebody at Apple because realize
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   that your decision could impact millions of people in a way that's very financially important to them.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   We talked about this on Twitter.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I think we agreed that it could have been handled better.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   The way Ryan did it, he said, "We have it on authoritative source."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Didn't even say it was from an Apple that this is the case.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   He did retract it immediately.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Probably what he should have.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   But you understand, there's a lot of pressure to get this stuff out.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   In the blog world, yeah.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It's on the brave new world.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   But it's my constitutionally protected opinion that Ryan was anxious A to bash Apple because
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   he has a history of that.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   B, anxious to bash the iPhone because everyone knows it's easier to burn a barn down than
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   to build one.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And C, anxious to scoop his buddies at Gizmodo.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Those three priorities overrode any of his journalistic integrity there that might be there.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So he can say what he wants.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Maybe he's a great guy.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I don't know him.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   But I'm not happy with the decision making.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Tell you what.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   We'll get him on next week.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Give him a chance to read about this.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And of course, there is going to be more than likely a Securities and Exchange Commission
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   investigation where Ryan will face some unfriendly men in suits.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I don't think Ryan has a problem at all.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   I think Ryan is acting as a journalist.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Does that --
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   SCC care about the problem?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   But who they're going to investigate is whoever it was.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   They're going to talk to him to verify that timeline and to verify those facts.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And then, yeah, they're going to try to get to whoever it was.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   If it was an Apple employee that was disgruntled or a hoaxster.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I mean, but they got to start with Ryan because he was the guy that let it out.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   But they're not going after him.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   No, I'm not saying they're going after him.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   But --
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Right.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   But --
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And really, the real culprit isn't even the person who forwarded it to Ryan.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It's the person who put that email bulletin on the apples.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Actually, to tell you the truth, my lawyer would probably tell you they all have potential liability.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Really?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   All I know is that you can bet he's going to get a phone call.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Who probably already has?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And, you know, there are a lot of Apple shareholders.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I'm one of them that demanded an SCC investigation.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   I want to know exactly what happened.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I want to know the timeline, the old fashioned, what did you know and when did you know it?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Questions?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I want those answered under oath.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   I want people to be held accountable because there are people that lost real money here.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I mean, we fool around a lot of them.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You lost money if you panicked.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   That's right.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And I didn't.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   But there are people who panicked and they lost money.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   So, I mean, that's -- if you're one of those people, trust me.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   You are P.O.D. right now.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Aren't you supposed to buy on the rumor and sell on the news?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Just because your things are supposed to do is, I mean, that's what you're going to do, Leo.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I mean, people made mistakes.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   There's no doubt that they should have been smart enough to look at this rumor and say to themselves,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   "You know, this sounds pretty fishy.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   There's no way Apple could afford this kind of delay.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   This is going to bring the company down.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   They can't have this."
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I mean, I said those things to myself and just, you know, I figured it -- I treated it like
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   any of the rumors I see on the rumor sites.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I didn't treat it as news.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   But I'll tell you what, you know, I know some very angry people over this.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Did you just say the rumors that the stuff you read on rumor sites, you don't read it as news?
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I just want to make sure these -- I'm not sure these are done breaking in.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I'm sorry I didn't vet my words more.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   That makes sense.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   What is wrong with that?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Just historically, it seems like you very heavily enjoy sides like this when they talk about
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   iPhone stuff that you find favorable.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   You seem to be all -- I simply use them as corroborative evidence on the side.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   That your fantasy is actually moving in the trajectory that you're --
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   It would appear that my fantasy has moved in that direction.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Okay.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Well, you'll be happy to know that even though the iPhone is not available yet, it's already
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   one of design award.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Yeah!
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Which one?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   They're giving out like vaporware design awards now.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It's kind of hard to believe, but the Cooper Heward has a given --
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Okay.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's a National Design Award.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And Craig Sieberson would know because he's worked for a design award.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Yeah, it's the 8th Annual National Design Award.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   For the iPhone or for Apple?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Let's see.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Or for Jonathan Eve.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Let me see here.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Is that how you say it?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Is it Eve or I?
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   It's probably I've --
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Do you like really -- I'm not sure that you're out yourself at parties.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I'd say that's the idea.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   It could be.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I was actually having an interesting conversation with Fred and Jonathan Evey.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That's good of genius, if you ask me.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I'd give him all the awards.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I think they do award designers at the Cooper Heward.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Well, I'm digging too deep, but according to Wired, it was -- there's going to be a
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   People's Design Award that you can vote on.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Wow, I just love this microphone.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And then really --
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   To the FX 230 will be joined by --
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's not a PR40 though, though.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   The Quiet Store.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Cooper Heward, National Design Museum, part of the Smithsonian lists iPhone among the recipients
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   of its eighth annual National Design Awards.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Wow.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Is that big when it's a product over a company?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Well, if it's an unreleased product.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Yeah, that would be big.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   We think product that does not exist here.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Judging on the one we saw under plexiglass, this is going to be looking.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I've seen some schematics that are pretty well designed.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Exactly.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I know.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So before -- before tooling, I'm kind of surprised.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I just got to say.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Hey, by the way, it was 40 years ago today.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   The Sergeant Pepper taught the band to play.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Was it today?
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It wasn't today.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It was Saturday.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Yeah, really.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   40 years?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Hey, what's the latest Merlin on the Beatles iPod?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Oh, actually, yeah.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   We've got some news on that.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Late breaking news, there's now going to be a fifth-beat-o version that's going to take a drink.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It's going to look like Billy Preston.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Oh, so --
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's going to work at a little gap where the click wheel would be.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I pre-ordered my Yoko Ono version.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   It's coming soon.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   They've got to have the iPhone.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   They were going to put out a Brian Epstein version, but it disappeared into a men's room somewhere.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Oh, and it will fix that in post.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Wow.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   So what do you have to say for yourself?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   iPhone receives FCC approval.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   You know, well, Merlin doesn't seem to think that the iPhone will ever materialize.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   It'll be the worst phone in history.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I'm not working on Merlin again.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I'm going to defend my friend.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   That's hard to say.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Merlin may.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   What?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Hard to say friend than Merlin may.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It's hard to say.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   No one defends me and no one calls me friend.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   It's just too hard.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   He's not saying the iPhone will be bad or not.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   I know.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   He just likes to pick on me because I like it.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I'm saying the iPhone will be bad.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Okay.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Well, all right.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   No, I have to say, I am more and more skeptical as we get farther and farther from the reality of the distortion field, that this is going to be the significant product everybody's talking.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And it's going to sell millions of copies anyway.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I'm curious why you said that, Leo.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Well, tell me again what it is that makes the iPhone.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   We don't know yet.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   That's my problem.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   That's certain magic.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Are you familiar with Scott?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Are you familiar with the term magical thinking?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Exactly.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It's from Apple.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   It's got to be good.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I think it's going to work.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It's going to work like once we've been through this.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Why do we like Max?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Because they have a certain thing that works all the time.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Just looking at the feature stuff that we know about.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I don't see anything spectacular.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   No, it's not about theater.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   It's not about theater.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Well, then it's about--
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   It's about feel and flow.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's about feel and flow.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And we have no idea.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   All we saw was Steve Jobs feel it.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   We only had the history.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Right.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   They haven't really--
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   You mean the mix except for mice.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Where's my Newton?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Right.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Oh, God.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Where's my humans?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   You're going to have to talk to a lot of dorks to find a bigger Max-Wiggy drum.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Where's my Max-Wiggy drum?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   But I mean, at a certain point, this gets asinine.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   When we keep talking about this world, we made the iPod.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Well, I mean--
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   We've had two hits.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Three hits.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I mean, I love apples.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   My God, it's what I use.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I don't use anything else other than Apple computers.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And I don't own mobile audio players except for iPods.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   But come on.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Anyway, we're going to know soon.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   It's less than a month now, right?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It's weeks.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   We're down to weeks.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I heard a rumor.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I read this earlier about October.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   That's what your record isn't going to be out till January.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   That's what stop's going to buy yours.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Do we take it as read that email to every audience?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   To every appearance definitely appeared to have come from inside Apple.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Only if you believe in gadget.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   So it's just Ryan saying that--
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   And I believe Ryan.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I don't think it's any reason why he would lie about that.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Scott, that doesn't change your feeling at all.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I've been in terms of his culpability in this.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Well, I'm not setting aside your fantasies about what the SEC does to people.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Do you personally feel like he's still, even if he got what to every intelligent appearance,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   would be an email from the Apple system?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Do you think he's still to blame?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Because it seems to me like people do this all the time.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   And Scott's stockholders are hurt all the time.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   They don't happen to be Apple people or us.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   People are hurt by this stuff all the time.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Are you saying there should be a whole new way of how we should litigate?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   He retracted it very quickly.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   I have to commend him for that.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   He even showed the bullet news email.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   I think he's lost trust with people.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Maybe not with you.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Not with me.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   No.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   But he has with me.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   This happens every day.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   This happens every day on hundreds of websites.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   You know, and people get run over by cars every day.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I mean, I don't know what that has to do with it.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   We should all be credulous if what you read is according to an authority.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   I'm just saying, if it looks like it's somebody, I don't know one way or another.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   But if they had 100% spoofed an Apple email, does that doesn't change?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Merlin, I get emails every day from people who want to get stuff because they know I'm covering the iPhone.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   They want to get stuff out.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And I do the simplest things.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I do the most basic rudimentary journalism 101 things to find out if it's true.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I ask for a second source.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   He says he called Apple and quote, "didn't feel like waiting for their response because he hadn't heard back for him and was afraid he was going to get scooped so he went with it."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   If he'd have simply waited another hour, none of this would have happened.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   So that's where he's got egg on his face because journalist, he claims to be a journalist.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I'll put myself in his shoes.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   He claims to be a journalist.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   He claims to be a journalist.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   I've been to his shoes. I might well have run with it as long as you run with it with appropriate caveats, which he did, which he's, you know, according to an authority.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   He didn't even say it came from within Apple. He said according to an authoritative source.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   I would have used authoritative.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I would have used an unsubstantiated source.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   He might have been more, yeah, he might have used a different word.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   I would have been a lot.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   You know what I might have said?
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   We've seen an internal Apple email.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   What appears to be an answer?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Somebody sent us an email and this is what it says.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Would have been accurate.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Well, let's assume Henry's throwing in his comment.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Oh, by the way, I should say Henry Laporte is here.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   He is actually quite an astute commentator on Apple and SEC News.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   He's been coming throughout this section in his own personal quick language.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   There could be a lot of data in that click.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I just want to say, I don't have anything against the gadget.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   I subscribe to their blog. I like their blog.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   I think that he's probably a good guy on the basis of you guys saying he's a good guy.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   I think he didn't want to say he received an internal Apple email because that might have given away his source.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   I think that...
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Let's assume that you could look at, and you can, if you look at the headers, you can verify whether this was forged to a certain degree of reasonability.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   He says this is not in question that it came from Apple.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   In fact, Apple did in fact release a subsequent email, which they admit to saying no to other email was a phony email.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   How do I know that was real?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Psyche.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   The high-key.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Thank you.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So Apple retracted it. The email came out at 909 AM. Apple retracted it at 1047, sometime between 909 and 1047.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Actually, no, this is interesting.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Okay, here's the actual timeline.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   At 1047, Apple retracts it, but Ryan apparently doesn't get the retraction because he goes with the story at 1149.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   So there's another mistake.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Wow.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   So he did wait two hours.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   At the end of the day, he's responsible for what he puts out as truth.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Now, I'd have run with it.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I totally would have. I have no particular affection for rumor-based sites, personally.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   If it's not the Macallope.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Well, the Macallope is a destroyer of rumors more actually than not.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   What does the Macallope say about it?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   If you actually read the Macallope.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I have been reading the Macallope.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   And it's a hell of a sight.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   He's a good writer.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   He's a good writer.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   He has a macallope fan.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   He's a macallope fan.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Really?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   He's jumping in.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   He's got antlers.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   He's going to back it up.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Yeah, anyway.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Does the Macallope even mention this story?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   The Macallope covers all kinds of news.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   The Macallope is a Holly Mather.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   The Macallope says iTunes is doomed.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Okay.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Is the iPhone half full or half M-T-E?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   It's all right, guys.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   I flop.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   I don't think Scott's reading this site.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Well, you know, here's the thing.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   I will gladly read all those sites once the phone's shipping.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And if somebody can point out to me deficiencies in the phone,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   once it ships, I'll be the first guy to say, "This sucks."
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   This is so the last time I'm going to say this, Scott.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   But I swear to God.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   If you have one person who's talking about all these positive aspects
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   of something that doesn't exist,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   I don't mean to get into epistemology and ontology here,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   but if you get one person who's making a lot of claims about something that doesn't exist,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   another person's saying it's kind of BS to make a lot of claims.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   That person kind of has a little bit more weight than just speculating about what you haven't seen yet.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   You think everybody's in this like huge mob.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   You mean like speculating about battery life, which is something you couldn't possibly know
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   since nobody has the shipping phone in their hand,
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   or speculating about how bright the screen is,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   which is once again something nobody could possibly know because they can't see the screen yet.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Well, everything we say about the iPhone is speculating.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   All I'm saying is I want to get it on the record, Merlin.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   You'll appreciate this.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   If there's anything dramatically wrong with the phone, I will be screaming about it.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I will be saying, "Apple fixed this."
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I'm not going to be a fan of something that sucks.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   I simply want to point out...
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Well, you're a fan of something that doesn't even exist yet.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   That's right. I'm a fan of an idea.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   I'm a believer, Merlin. I'm a positive man.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And I want to point out that if it sucks, I'm going to become an unpositive man.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   I'm going to say Apple fixed this because I threw my trio in the San Francisco Bay,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   hoping you were going to get this right.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But I also want to point out that the John C. de Vorex of the world
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   have figured out that it's great link bait to attack Apple on the iPhone.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   It gets a lot of hits. It's very popular.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   It's easy to get a lot of attraction around a burning building.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   And that's what's going on here.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   You don't think there's anything to attack?
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I don't think we know yet.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   Is there anything to attack about Apple?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Sure. Sure. Absolutely. We do that all the time on this show.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   We had an entire segment of Mack Weins, remember?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I mean, all I'm saying is that I just want to see how someone can know what the battery life is going to be
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   when they don't have the phone.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Well, we can't. We don't know.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   But I've seen...
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   I've seen...
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   He's got a chocolate...
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I've seen a chocolate...
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   He's got a chocolate...
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   ...for a kid. He's dying for an iPhone.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   I've seen detailed explanations by people of why the battery life is going to suck.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And I'm like, "How could you know that?"
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   I'm not about engineering.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And it's this science where you can take a certain amount of...
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Henry, how many of your school chums, including yourself, one on iPhone?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Do you want an iPhone?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   I seem to remember hearing that you and your sibling...
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   They're fighting over the one iPhone that we're going to get.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And so...
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   You want an iPhone?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   There is the news.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   Uncle Scott's by you.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   But like at school. Do most people want them?
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Do they even know that there's an iPhone?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   It's some.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Some do.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Like the girls.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   The girls know about it.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   The girls' chicks dig design. That's number one.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Yeah, it is a chick fun.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Do you worry at all? Do you worry at all? Like do you...
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Do I am a lot?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   He texts a lot.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   He texts a lot.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   But do you worry at all about the keyboard?
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   But he texts with something that's got a number pad.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   So you do T9?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   T9.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   He does it the old school way.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Well it's T9.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   You press the button three times for a V.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Really?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Wow.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   You just type all the letters out by typing T-U-V.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Like that.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   T9, they don't know from T9.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   I got one.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   T9 is where it autocompletes the word based on what you start typing.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   That's for us.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Come on.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   That's for older folks.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   What is T9?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   It types the word for you.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   So instead of typing all the letters you just type the first...
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   I guess is what you're going to say.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   That...
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   What?
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   You turn that off.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Oh, come on.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Don't play dumb.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   You've totally seen this.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   No, it's much faster than type of it.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Oh, for old men.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   It's for old men who use complete words for one.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I could see that.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I could see that.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   I could get the rhythm of that and get really fast.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I just got one of those up...
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   You should see it.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Upstages from Sprint.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   The ones that flip.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   Talked a little bit about this before.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I don't see that.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Is this a sandwich?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I'll just say one thing here.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   It's a flip phone and it's really frustrating and I want to throw it out the window.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   The idea is that you get this phone and when I say flip phone, it's basically like a big iPod or like a big Nano.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And I have no idea who came up with this.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   It's definitely not Jonathan Yvei.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:14.500]   You get it and the front of it has a big screen on it and then a nine way, like an eight way
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.000]   best card with a phone.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   Yeah, well, yeah, it looks cool.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   And then you can flip it and then on the other side you've got basically the size of a color ID screen.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Okay, but look at that now.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Look at the big screen.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   You see the big screen?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   For those of you at home looking at Leo's computer.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Okay, so you look at that big screen.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Now, let's say, what are you going to use that screen for?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   You're going to use that screen for, let's say, surfing the web or surfing menus.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Does it occur to you at all that you can't use the numbers to select from a go for like,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   whap like screen?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   You'd have to flip it in order to do that.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   You've got to use just the touchpad to get around.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   You can't type.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   So the point is that the keypad is on the opposite side of the screen.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And the side that has the screen on it.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Yeah, well, it's got a little thing.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   You know, you have to manually hit a button to flip it.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   But here's what I was going to get at.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Is that view that's got the big screen on it?
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   There's no response from hitting the pad.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   You know, there's no like, no visual feedback.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Or no, no, and no, you know, you don't feel it.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   No good kids.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   You're right.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   It sucks.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   So I'm just curious.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   I mean, so do you think, is there going to be any kind of feedback on the iPhone doing
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   now when you're typing?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   On the typing.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Typing letters.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   There might have been a visual.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   There's an audio feedback.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   There's an audio feedback.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And also want to point out that when you're surfing the web on the iPhone, you're not going to be surfing some phony want to be.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Yeah, that's so far.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Look, I got a big deal.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   We all have an opera or whatever.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   But essentially, the first time I had experienced that, and it was a little bit frustrating.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   You know, saying it's a safari in there doesn't is not what wows me.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   But it does well me.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Does what?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   The us trio users that does who use that?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Listen, I don't have a 90 cell phone.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   Download opera.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   I mean, every phone in the existence can run opera.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   So you can get a decent browser on any phone.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And all the Nokia phones actually have a phone that does exactly what Safari does with the thumbnail.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And the Nokia phone may be a great phone.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Maybe the way to go.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   But I want an iPhone because I'm an Apple user.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   These are the kinds of things that are going to knock -- well, this syncs perfectly well with this, by the way.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   But here's the thing.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   This is your new one.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   This is that new in '95.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Let me see that.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Here's the thing.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   This is the one with the 45 minute bad life.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   This is the kind of thing -- no, actually it's fine.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   I get it because it's okay.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   This is pretty sweet.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   But you're right.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   It's not great.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   This is the thing that -- the kind of thing that wows app Mac users is because Steve Jobs says it works.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Oh, and if you kind of missed the key, it guesses what key you were going to hit.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Right.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   I got to see that.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   I mean, they also said that the Newton would recognize your handwriting.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   I mean, those are the kinds of things that --
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Yeah, we got to see how well they execute.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   If it does that, that's great.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Historically, this stuff doesn't work.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I think the promise of the iPhone is what have people excited.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And if they execute on the promises, if they are able to execute, they will do well.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   If they are not, they'll get their butt beat.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   We're all in Stockholm syndrome with our phones.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And so there's this huge frustration to get the actual UI working.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Now, doesn't Stockholm syndrome infer that you have some affection for your phone?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Exactly.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   I never had any affection for my phone.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   So my phone --
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   You're held hostage by it.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   What I'm saying is that --
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   I hate my phone.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   When the Apple phone releases the inverse, it's the inverse.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   So Henry, you're saying nobody uses T9 at all.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   He doesn't even know where the hell is T9?
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   No, I'm sure.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   It's only for middle-aged guys.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Those are the mic never.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Yeah, I've never heard that.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Wow.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   It's totally for middle-aged guys.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   It's to make them feel more comfortable.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I think it's great.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I am absolutely a middle-aged man, but I stopped using T9 because it was just too much of a pain.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Oh, there you go.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   No, that --
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   I used T9.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   And they're not using full words.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   They're using --
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   They're on their own lingo.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   But it learns from you.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   It's got a --
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   NBD.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   No, I actually used T9 on here.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   I don't even --
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   What is it?
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   That's the predictive text.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   What is the N95 cost, Leo?
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   $750.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   So the answer to the question, will people pay $500 for an iPhone?
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.560]   Because, yeah, they want to save $250 over the N95.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.000]   Maybe unless this is a better phone.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   It's got a check.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   And what is the battery life?
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I'm very interested.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   How can you possibly tell the battery life of --
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Well, that's right.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   It's already --
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   He's got it in his hand.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I charge it every night.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   And you'll probably charge the iPhone every night.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   I mean, you know, remember, in the original old days, phones would last a week.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Right.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And you could talk two or three days without it between charges.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   I think the --
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   The upstage just has not been --
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   My biggest concern about the iPhone, frankly, is the battery because it's not replaceable.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   Right.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   That is my biggest concern.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   That is an odd choice because these things do not --
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   So far.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   Now, in the ones we've seen.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   And the ones -- and I don't think there's going to be a change there.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I do think what they'll do is some sort of thing like the iPod program where you can replace
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   the batteries.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   I'll tell you who has Stockholm syndrome.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   Mac users have Stockholm syndrome.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   We have come to love it because we have no choice.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   Boy.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   But it is -- But it is -- but it is the jobs way or the highway.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   And so this is a perfect example.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Steve Jobs says, "Thou shalt not remove thy battery."
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And you don't.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing for consumers, it doesn't matter.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Why would they have done that?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   That's because you don't do it on an iPod either.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   It's a consumer device.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   I see.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   I see.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   A consumer device.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   I think it's a bad idea.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I agree with that.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I think I've said this once before on here.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   But a long time ago, I think I want to say in the late '80s, there was a big article in
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   one of the papers about how about comparing Macs to Catholicism and PCs to being a Protestant.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   And I think a lot of that is still true.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.500]   Where you've got this intermediating layer, this kind of middleware between you and your
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.500]   God.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.000]   And I think that's a lot of what makes --
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   It's better for worse.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   It used to be though, because now you have terminal --
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Well, there's a source.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   You have a source.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   You have another star.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.840]   And so I think -- and in some ways, Apple has lost its way.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.280]   You could say Apple's lost its way.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.480]   It's become more like a PC, where there's more ways to do the same thing, which was one
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.080]   of the advantages Apple had.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.680]   It was what they called monotonous.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.040]   That was an intentional user interface feature.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.280]   Was there's one way to do it?
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280]   And of course, a PC.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.280]   One of the people followed the human interface.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   Exactly.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.200]   And in the PC was always -- there's 15 different ways.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.800]   Many of them completely obscured it or something.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.200]   And PC people liked that, because they learned those ways.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.040]   But I think Apple's more like a PC now than it ever was.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:02.680]   Well, in the book of Joblonian's, verse one, there is an internal investigation of course.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.360]   Yeah, there shall trust in my decisions for it.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.560]   If I were to wish that the battery would be replaced, it would be thusly so.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.560]   It would not be one, no four, no six batteries.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   It would be one.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.600]   And please put a quarter in the money by a thunder.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   Exactly.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.760]   And Gadget posted their sequence of events.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.760]   This is coming from MacRumors.com.
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.760]   We're back.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:21.760]   Would you involve the fake email?
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.760]   Well, I don't think we have another story.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   So that might work.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:24.760]   That would work.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.760]   That would work.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:26.760]   That's going to be a question.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.240]   This is going to find a -- we're going to find high quality audio books.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.400]   Yeah, I'm glad you asked that question actually.
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.360]   I've been needing some high quality audio books.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.680]   You know what I think is going to happen?
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.160]   I was going to write a book about this entire episode and we'll be able to get it from
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.160]   this incredible company.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.280]   You know what I'm listening to on Audible?
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.080]   The King of Comedy.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   Really?
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.800]   Audible is bringing you this podcast and we want to thank them for their support.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:55.480]   35,000 titles to choose from.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:56.640]   You can talk if you want.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   I just wanted to hear it.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.640]   I just wanted to hear you doing it.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   You want to hear me do it?
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:01.440]   I want to hear the glory of Leo doing it.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.920]   35,000 titles to choose from.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   I've been an Audible subscriber since practically they started.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.920]   I love it.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.720]   I get two books every month.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.960]   There's lots of different ways to subscribe.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:14.760]   If you've used iTunes, you've seen the recorded books on Audible.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.320]   We're going to give you a free Audible download when you sign up today.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.600]   You go to Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.480]   We've got our own.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   We've got our own code.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   Well, we don't want to be confused with Twi.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.480]   No.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   Thank you.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.480]   Totally different show.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.480]   Totally different show.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   Totally different people.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.480]   Audible.com.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.480]   Well, except for all of us.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   Okay.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.480]   Audible.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   Henry's never been on Twi.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   You're right.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.480]   Whew.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   We're safe.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   Make sure you give it Henry's URL.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   Henry Laporte.com.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.480]   I think one of the big...
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.920]   That's going to be your catchphrase, I think.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   What?
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.760]   One of the big misconceptions about Audible Leo is that people act like it's some foreign
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.760]   thing.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.760]   It's right there on iTunes.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:53.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.760]   It's really easy to do.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   It's right there on iTunes.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.760]   I get...
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.760]   Oh, I've just listened to so many good books.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.760]   In fact, one of the things...
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   We did this on Twi.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.160]   We went on a little bit long, but we couldn't stop talking about our favorite audiobooks.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.160]   It's just great.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   Mine's Gorilla marketing.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.160]   I'm sitting here searching at...
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   J. Conrad Lemons.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.160]   J. Conrad Lemons.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.160]   Oh, classic.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.160]   Does he read it or does he read it?
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   He reads it.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.160]   One of the things I like about Audible...
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   And by the way, he shouldn't have.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.160]   Well, and that's right.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   And a lot of the publisher printed audiobooks have the author reading.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160]   That's a big mistake.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:23.520]   One of the things I like about Audible is they've moved away from that considerably, and they
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.520]   use professional...
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.400]   And for most of the books now, professional reviews, a lot of unabridged stuff, which
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   is great.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:29.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   If you can imagine...
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.280]   Here's how you can imagine what his voice sounds like.
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.960]   Remember when the singular guy went up and did his thing with the no cards?
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.600]   Imagine that turned into sound.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.760]   You know, you wouldn't think that was the way this guy said it.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.760]   I guess the way I intended Gorilla marketing would be...
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.760]   Hi, my name's Henry Rabinton.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.760]   Oh!
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.760]   Even I want you to do.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:47.120]   So, okay, maybe don't get that one.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.120]   What are you listening to?
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   Stranger and a strange land.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   Highline.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   And a great reading from Audible.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   Oh, I forget who wrote it.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   That's right.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   But Robert Heinlein.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.120]   They've got grace.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.120]   No, that's great sci-fi, though.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.120]   I'm saying he read it.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   He's long gone.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.120]   He's long gone.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.120]   No, I was stuttering.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.120]   It's not your fault.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:09.760]   It's like the end of Spinal Tap where Nigel Tofnell is talking about how he's listening
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:16.040]   to books on tape of authors being read by actors with the same last name.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.560]   Treasure Island by Robert Lewis Stevenson.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.360]   Read by McLean Stevenson.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.560]   It's a great idea.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.680]   Oh, I would note that, boy, big surprise here.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.520]   One of my favorite books on tape is Getting Things Done by David Allen, which is a very
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.520]   good reason himself.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.520]   Yeah, I heard that.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.720]   He has a really nice, direct, very kind of clipped and fast delivery.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.720]   It's not a replacement for reading the book, but if you want to do a quick bone up, it's
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.720]   good.
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:43.360]   If you've rented a car, it's good to pop it in and listen to it.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.920]   I listen to both fiction and non-fiction.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:50.720]   I have to say, for instance, David Adambura's biography of...
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.680]   It was not Truman, which is great.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.880]   I've also read, but he's most recent one.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   He is.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.880]   And it's escaping me.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.560]   Because "Atonbura" is the greatest reader.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.560]   Yes.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.560]   I'm David Adambura.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.280]   Anyway, highly recommended.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.600]   One of the nice things I like about Audible is once you bought it, you can download it
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.960]   anytime from Audible.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.120]   So I have hundreds of books.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.360]   And if I want to go back and reread a book, I can still download it from Audible.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360]   It's still on there.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   Isn't that nice?
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   That is nice.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   iTunes doesn't do that.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.360]   What was that coupon code?
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:21.160]   couponcode audible.com/magbreak a free book with your first free book.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   A free book.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.160]   Well, yeah, I signed up today, though.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.160]   You have to sign up.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.440]   I got a break because I got you beat on the Audible thing only because I was working at
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.520]   IDEO when they were a client.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.880]   We designed, they were just a startup and we designed the Audible player.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.880]   Oh, really?
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.880]   Because they originally had a little one.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.880]   They had their own player.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.880]   That black player.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   Yes.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   I never owned one of those.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   I first get this.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.480]   My first Audible device was a diamond Rio.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.480]   Me too.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.480]   A little silver one.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.480]   Yeah, a little silver one.
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   That's the best MP3 player I ever had.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.480]   I still have mine.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   You can have it.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480]   Awesome.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.480]   64 megs and you can pop in or not extra card.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.480]   But that's anything.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:54.480]   64 megs is like 10 books.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   More than that too.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.480]   They're like a mega two each.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.480]   That was awesome.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   No, no, that's not right.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.480]   They're bigger than that.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.480]   I used that until I bought my first iPod.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.480]   I used that.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.480]   I had that in a creative jukebox.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.480]   Do you know that that thing is in the Smithsonian?
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.480]   The Rio?
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   The first.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   The first player.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   The first player.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.480]   The other player.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   That's in the Smithsonian is the first player.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   And I can top that.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   Yes, sir.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.480]   Because I shared the office space with Mitch Ratcliffe.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:20.240]   I don't remember Thomas saying it's a debut at the Old City Hall.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.240]   Who's Mitch Ratcliffe?
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.880]   Mitch Ratcliffe is the guy that was like one of the big first founders of the Audible.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:25.880]   Oh, gosh.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   They really shouldn't have to pay us for this.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.280]   And it must be noted I've been sitting here surfing the site while you guys are reminiscing
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.480]   about your golden years in the 90s.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   The areas of my--
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.480]   Back when you were 12.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   The areas of my expertise by Mr. John Hodgman, the greatest audiobook of all time.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.680]   Oh, I'm downloading it right now.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.280]   I've got it to be that one.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.480]   He is so funny.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:48.880]   And the book is baffling, but the audiobook with Jonathan Colton accompanying him on guitar
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   and drowning it right now.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.800]   Now does he read his own book?
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.680]   To wonderful effect.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.680]   Okay.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.400]   To tip the various people that work in a hotel, including the Starling Boy, how to get the
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.600]   Starlings out of your room.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   You will learn.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   Starling Boy.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.600]   You will learn.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.600]   Starling Boy.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.720]   It is an entire book of all knowledge in one book.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.040]   They do have like my next lesson, which is like the Netflix queue.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:15.400]   But they should have a-- what Netflix has that friends feature where you could-- friends
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.000]   could suggest.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.800]   We should start that because I think that's really cool.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.680]   Maybe we could start the Mac Break weekly book club.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:21.680]   It's like a book group.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   You know when a--
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680]   Who cares about Oprah's book club?
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   Right.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:25.680]   This is--
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.680]   It would be the Mac Break weekly.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.680]   Well, I'll tell you a great one.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.680]   If you're into technology is Jeff Hawkins, a guy who started--
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.680]   Jeff Hawkins's pilot.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.760]   And his book on intelligence is fantastic.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.760]   His whole brain thing.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.760]   And that's unaudible on a bridge.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.760]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   Red by a guy who sounds amazingly like Leonard Nimoy.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.760]   Ooh.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   But is--
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   But is it?
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760]   No, it's not.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.760]   That's the funniest thing.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.760]   He sounds just like Leonard Nimoy.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   I thought he was.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.760]   I can't do Leonard.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.760]   I am not supposed to.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   No, they got the new audiobook.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.760]   They got the assault on reason, which should be arriving in my house tomorrow.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   You could have bought it online and got it.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.760]   That's the other thing you downloaded immediately.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.760]   It's on there.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.760]   He has 330-inch.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.760]   Oh, stop on.
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   That's an empty.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.760]   We got to talk about this later.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   He has 330-inch.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   All right.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.760]   And the messiest office I've ever seen.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.360]   Let's talk about it, but first I just want to say one more time, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.200]   We thank them for their support.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.200]   Thanks, guys.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   Thank you, Audible.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   Thank you.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   Awesome.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   Thank you.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   Thank you, Henry.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   And it was Henry's thank you that mattered the most.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.240]   Because Henry knows he's getting a skate ramp if Audible pays up.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.720]   So how do you know what Al Gore's office looks like?
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.720]   We've seen the photo.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:24.800]   Was that in time?
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.040]   It was one of those photos that got pasted everywhere.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.400]   Never trust a guy with a clean office.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.640]   I say that as somebody with a pigsty office.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:36.520]   Well, let me say that in this case, you don't have to worry.
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.920]   He's definitely living the dream.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.160]   Clean office dirty mind as well.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.040]   He does have 330-inch, cinnamonous places.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.880]   Are you sure there's a photo?
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.880]   He's definitely a pilot.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.880]   He's got piles of it.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:46.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.520]   Let's get a diagnosis from them.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   And he's got a 40-inch.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.520]   He's got a 40-inch.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   He's got a 40-inch.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.280]   42-inch plasma on the wall.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.240]   OK, I see a couple things happening in this picture.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.320]   Now this is by Millen Mann.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.320]   Well, so it's interesting.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.800]   First of all, tell us where it is.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.960]   This is at, if you go to MBW Ideas, you'll see it.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.360]   It's a Time Magazine in partnership with CNN.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.960]   And this is a photo essay on him.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:10.440]   So you see him sitting in what looks like an air-on chair.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.840]   He's got those 30-inch displays.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.840]   Three 30-inch displays.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:17.680]   He has three 30-inch displays running next to each other.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.480]   So there's not going to be any more girl girls coming out of a tip or any time.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.480]   Soon.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   He's got a very--
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   Oh, you're cool.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.480]   That's a lot of radiation.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   Am I wrong?
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.480]   No, you're right.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.480]   And he's got a--
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   He explains my problem.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   He's got--
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.480]   That doesn't begin to explain this.
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   Just the--
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.920]   He's got a big colorful rainforest looking frog on the wall.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.040]   Now he's-- and I see that he-- I see a couple things.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.120]   First of all, he has a lot less straight-up memorabilia than a lot of famous guys, which
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   I think is interesting.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.480]   No, it's just a big ceramic frog on the wall, which can't possibly be memorabilia.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   Yeah, I mean, he's got some--
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   He's got some--
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.120]   I have to question why that's there.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.400]   But this looks to me like a guy who works for a living.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.400]   Look at this.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   Three displays.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   I think we said that already.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   But I mean--
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   Yeah, wait until you see it.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   It's kind of mind-boggling.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.400]   No, he's got like-- what would that be like, oh, like six feet wide.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.960]   Well, you know he has to do that because he can't actually use his desk.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.280]   Look at the crap on the desk.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:16.120]   He has a lot of post-it notes on each of those besides so he really can maximize both
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.120]   vertical and horizontal surfaces for hoarding.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.000]   But I'll bet you he had one of those guys though.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   I mean, he's a very bright guy.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.240]   Does that look like my office?
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.760]   If you ask him, I bet he can find anything in that office in a second.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.760]   Do you think?
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.760]   I don't think so.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   Is that the way you--
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.760]   A lot of parlors are very, very--
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.760]   I'm a parlor.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.760]   Weirdly organized.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.760]   Can you find stuff when you need it now?
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.560]   Well, is it a visual reference?
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.200]   Like did they have a visual map in the box?
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.640]   Because once there was a day when some of our people read books.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   So wait a minute.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.200]   Is that-- so he's got a TV also.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   There's a sharp outpost.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   He's probably playing current.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   Probably playing current TV.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:48.000]   He's like it's a 42 inch plasma or something.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   LCD is exactly the same.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.640]   I recognize the Aqua's form factor.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   What?
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.640]   Huh?
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.640]   What?
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.640]   Tewa?
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   Who?
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   He's got a presidential plate.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.280]   I'm thinking it's not a George W. Bush presidential plate.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.280]   No, it's the ice.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.280]   Yeah, it should have been--
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   It's the Iron Venture.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.280]   I should have been president.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.280]   I should have been president.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.560]   You know, I wonder if he has an Al Gore presidential plate.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.560]   Probably does.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.120]   And then there's a box with an Apple logo on it.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.120]   What do you think that is?
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:12.120]   That's the board of directors.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.680]   For those of you who are-- Leo is doing the old man look at the history from about two
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.680]   inches there.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.680]   There's the control.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.680]   Why do they make it so small?
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.680]   What is that down there?
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.200]   Why are they printing things so tiny?
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.360]   He's got his monocle out now ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:31.440]   No, it is funny though because a lot of guys who are as powerful as somebody like this
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.120]   guy, you go in there and they got the kind of like the show office.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.120]   You know where everything's all perfectly tested.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.120]   Well, that's what I got over here.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   I got the show office.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   This is the guy who works for a living.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.120]   Remember, Bill, yeah.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.080]   Well, he looks like somebody who's spending a lot of time in keynote.
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.080]   Yes, he is.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080]   He's a keynote guy.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   Well, I would not mind having that set up a bit.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.960]   But he needs an exercise ball to sit on I think.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.960]   You know what happened to my eyes?
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   You know what happened to my eyes?
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:51.960]   He sits on one of us.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:52.960]   I surprised your walk.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.960]   Mine exploded.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:54.960]   On air.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.960]   And he was sitting on it.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   It was funny.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.960]   During the recording of Twitter.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.600]   You've got to listen to it.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.160]   Sometimes God sends us little signals.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.360]   Maybe we're eating--
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:09.760]   Leo, you can buy my bicycle at the Mike's Bikes for about 450 if you want to go to work
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.760]   out.
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:16.200]   But it's funny because we were just talking about this last week in Vancouver.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   How much you loved your--
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.200]   I loved it.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:20.600]   And as a son of a chiropractor, I was very proud of you for doing it.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.600]   Now I was worried.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   I heard you.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.600]   I said, man, how's your spine?
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.600]   Son of a chiropractor.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.600]   Well, I landed on-- you know, I landed fine.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.520]   I landed on something soft.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   That's good.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   My head.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.840]   But I over have ordered another one.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:37.000]   Because I hear when you fall off, you've got to get right back on.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.320]   This is a little bit of a rat hole.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:44.880]   I'll tell you, I got an email from someone who said, Leo's exercise ball seat exploded.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.840]   And then this is the part that really tripped Trippie out.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:49.560]   He goes, now, Scott is a podcasting expert.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.400]   I have a technical question for you.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.320]   Which would be a better Mike to record that?
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.440]   A PR-40 or a Lavalier.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.960]   I swear to God, I got that.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.520]   Well, listen, because I think you think the PR-40 picked up every--
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520]   It was a great sound.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.360]   I think I can smell Alex making a new podcast right now.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.000]   He asked, he wanted to know.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.840]   Would it be better to record that?
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.840]   And as if he was hoping to duplicate it.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.080]   47 minutes and 42 seconds into Twit number 98.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.640]   You'll hear this.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.280]   Well, what happens is I'm talking along.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.320]   You hear a-- it's kind of muffled up.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.720]   No, it's a big sound.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.480]   Bigger than I thought.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.440]   I was like, holy well.
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:26.920]   And then I'm off Mike.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.160]   Laughing when I-- laughing when I'm off Mike.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.160]   Because I just plummeted three feet.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.040]   The rest of the guys are like, oh, OK.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.680]   Well, keep going on the story.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.840]   Then you pop right back like the pro that you want.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.000]   Well, I had my assistant there, and he immediately came up with me.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.400]   I mean, that's to me.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.400]   Which assistant was that?
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.080]   This was Dane, and he rolled a chair in.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:47.760]   He's very good.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.000]   He got the bigger of the two assistants to help.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.640]   Yeah, Katie would not have helped, right?
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:57.040]   All right, now, top 100 products of 2007, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.640]   I have in my hands.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.120]   All?
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.520]   From PC World, every-- the best.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.440]   What are you laughing at?
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:03.960]   He's a pro.
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.460]   He's a pro.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.860]   It's always funny.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:09.260]   Yeah, because we really appreciate what PC Mag has to say about Mac.
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:10.060]   Actually, I'm doing it.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:10.560]   Go ahead.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.180]   This was kept on funk and Wagnell's porch in the Hermetically
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.300]   sealed Manet's jar.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.940]   You are right, sir.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.400]   Number one.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.140]   Continue, sir.
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:23.620]   And actually, I don't see any Apple products in the first eight.
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:25.580]   Now, there's a shocker from PC Mag.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.140]   Now, what was PC--
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.220]   No, they see World last year, Apple products
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.740]   were all over the top 100.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.340]   Well, I mean, that's where I go from my Mac news.
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.660]   Me too.
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.180]   See?
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.980]   What magazines do you read, Henry?
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.580]   Well, Transworld.
[00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:39.180]   What's that about?
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.180]   Transworlds.
[00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:40.680]   Transworlds.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:42.180]   I don't know that we want to know this answer.
[00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:42.900]   Enterable skateboarding.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:43.900]   Oh.
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:44.900]   Oh.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.900]   Oh.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:46.740]   Oh.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:47.300]   I like that.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.580]   Yeah, we get it now.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:50.540]   By the way, do you recognize my name, Henry?
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.700]   Scott Born.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.060]   No.
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:52.980]   Doesn't mean anything to you.
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.380]   Have you even banned from my space or something?
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.580]   No, because Scott Born--
[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.140]   He's one of those predators.
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.580]   Here's a thing.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.700]   Scott Born is the world champion skateboarder from Australia.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:02.420]   Not this one.
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:03.580]   Do you know that Scott Born?
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.980]   He's looking at you and trying to put it together.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.220]   Yeah, I've heard of T9.
[00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:11.020]   It's a way of using your phone.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.020]   You're a T9.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.820]   I actually get email occasionally for this guy.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.620]   And do people tell you you're radical and--
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.180]   Yeah, they all--
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.220]   They all say all kinds of things,
[00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.100]   which I don't understand.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.060]   But my favorite was a guy sent me an email going,
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.740]   why are you pretending to be a podcaster?
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.780]   You're a world famous skateboarder.
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.900]   Why do you have to be--
[00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:28.860]   I like the pretending part.
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.020]   I'm like, well, I guess I'm thinking these aren't real--
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.900]   I'll get a pretend to be something.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:33.980]   I'm a pretend to be a podcaster.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.940]   No, no, no, no.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.940]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:36.940]   You got the tiger.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.260]   The number nine is tiger.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.540]   He got Apple TV and 11.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.220]   Just to give you some perspective here--
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.880]   number one Google Apps, which I would not have put number one.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.260]   That's bizarre.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.660]   That's bizarre.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.500]   Intel Core-- In my hands.
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.700]   I had.
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.140]   Intel Core 2 Duo.
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:54.500]   Intel Core 2 Duo.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.980]   OK, I put that in there.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.020]   Those going max.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.300]   Not the PlayStation 3.
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.660]   Not the Xbox 360, the Nintendo Wii.
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.380]   You know it.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.300]   Shh, too bad.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.740]   Hey, do you have Zelda on the Wii?
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:04.740]   That looks good.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.700]   I played Zelda, and all I could do
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.460]   was make a horse gallop in a circle for 30 minutes.
[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.860]   Madeline kept going, go back to the meadow.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.020]   I can't make the horse leave.
[00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.660]   Wait, I think I'm going to go.
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:19.380]   Let's not skip over this.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.660]   I want to see what Henry thinks.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.260]   When it comes to tennis.
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.460]   Verizon Fios.
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:23.980]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:24.940]   I want to know Henry.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.420]   What's Henry?
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.260]   Which console?
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.220]   Which console?
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.980]   Xbox, PlayStation 3, or what?
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.380]   We just stuck with what dad got.
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:30.980]   Which is--
[00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.940]   Xbox 360.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.540]   OK, is that the one you prefer?
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:34.980]   He loves it.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.500]   Yeah, he loves it.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.740]   You haven't obviously played the PlayStation 3.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.460]   He's actually--
[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.100]   I don't know what Henry Tages has the Wii.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:42.900]   His other friend.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:43.380]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.260]   They're both named Henry.
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.820]   Imagine the confusion that ensues.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.500]   No doubt.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.140]   I'm Hank.
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.420]   I don't know why you call me Henry.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:50.100]   OK.
[00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.020]   Is it worth getting the Xbox 360 elite?
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:52.820]   Let's start over.
[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:53.820]   Now let me ask you a question.
[00:41:53.820 --> 00:41:55.500]   Hank, report.
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:56.020]   OK.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:57.740]   I don't know why you call me Henry, man.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.500]   Who is this Henry you're talking about?
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.420]   You're not here.
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.140]   You're not here.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:06.540]   Hank, Verizon Fast Rim Blackberry 8800.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:06.900]   Which--
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:09.180]   As long as the Blackberry service continues, you'll be fine.
[00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.540]   Parallels Desktop?
[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.380]   That's a Mac product.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.460]   Oh, my god.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:13.500]   Number eight.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.220]   You can also use that for the--
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.460]   I did that for the Linux.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.540]   I got the Linux running with the Linux.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:17.940]   You know what?
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.220]   You're going to like this guy.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.860]   Number seven, Pioneer Elite 1080p.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:22.900]   Nothing wrong with that choice.
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.580]   And the pro.
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:23.940]   The pro.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.580]   The one with the guy.
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.980]   Hey, my raid drive is number eight.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:27.660]   That's mine, too.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:28.380]   You have it in front?
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:28.900]   Yeah.
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:29.220]   Me, too.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:29.900]   The one point--
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   Love it.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:31.580]   The terabyte.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.140]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.340]   You know what I like?
[00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:33.700]   I like the one.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:34.700]   What did you name yours, Craig?
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.980]   I like mine's name Hank.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.540]   So--
[00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.420]   I call this one, seven of nine.
[00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:44.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.260]   I love the Hank's catchphrase once again.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.020]   That's the catchphrase.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:48.540]   What?
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.180]   What?
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.900]   I like the web interface for that.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:52.500]   I've got to tell you.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.180]   Oh, it's awesome.
[00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.420]   And your back's up in the background.
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.900]   Automatically works with Mac and Windows.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:56.900]   It's just great.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:58.300]   This is a network of touch stores.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.180]   I like these products.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.180]   These are good products.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.700]   Apple Tiger?
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.700]   Is that the best Apple product to put on that list?
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.220]   Heck no.
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.220]   This is for the year?
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.220]   For 2007?
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.220]   2007.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.020]   That's kind of weird.
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.500]   Apple TV does make it in there afterward.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.340]   Well, why not put the 65 Mustang in there?
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.140]   I mean, it hasn't had a Tiger been out for a couple years.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.340]   You think you do have a Mustang?
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:16.900]   You know what I like?
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:17.500]   I like that.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.660]   With the hexagon grill.
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:19.660]   Yeah.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.980]   That's nice unit.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.020]   360 is on here, but down to number 18.
[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.100]   I'm looking for other Mac stuff.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:25.460]   You know, right?
[00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.260]   There's a lot of that stuff.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.380]   Apple TV.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.380]   Oh, fire fire.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.380]   It's one of the skype to get I-5.
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:30.900]   Site speed.
[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.820]   That works on the Mac, right?
[00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:32.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:33.820]   Uh-huh.
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.820]   80-get-guy-pot.
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.820]   You know, that's number 26.
[00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:37.820]   That's a repeat.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.340]   Dig.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.340]   Dig is number 58.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.140]   Yeah, that's why dig is high.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.700]   iTunes 61.
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.180]   YouTube, Firefox, Picasa, D80, Skype.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.900]   So we're like, I would have ranked Skype higher than Google Apps.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:49.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.060]   Let's Google Apps.
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.660]   It's Google's got a spreadsheet and a calendar.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:54.660]   It's just on Google.
[00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:55.660]   What's a spreadsheet?
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.660]   Never mind.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:57.660]   Okay.
[00:43:57.660 --> 00:44:01.540]   So, the backpack that was made from a Mac Plus, that's number 12.
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:03.500]   What was that?
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.500]   It's a wow-aw.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.140]   It was made from-- I don't know if you guys have even seen--
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.220]   Microsoft Office of 2007.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:10.500]   Why would that even be on the list?
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.660]   Because they bought a big ad right next to it.
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660]   Oh, my God.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.660]   Macbook Pro at 82.
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:15.660]   All right, 82.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:17.660]   Now, I think it would be much higher.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:20.300]   Now, Macbook Pro should be the highest rated app.
[00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.500]   What was Macbook Pro?
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:22.500]   I agree.
[00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.500]   That's Henry enough.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:24.500]   It's his name's Hank.
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.500]   This one.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.500]   Who is Henry?
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.100]   Well, XPS410 comes in ahead of the MacBook Pro.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.100]   That's insane.
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.100]   That's wrong.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.100]   That's just so wrong.
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.100]   I don't think so.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.100]   Okay.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.100]   What's next?
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.100]   Dogs and cats living together?
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.100]   Exactly.
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.100]   So, you know what?
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.940]   This should be at the top.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:43.540]   We did this list last year.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.020]   Not on this show because we weren't around once.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.020]   You put on Twitch.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.020]   And there was a lot more Mac stuff on this.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.020]   I'm going to hold this up.
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.020]   Why don't we make our own list?
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.020]   I'll do the Devorak thing for lists.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.020]   Well, you know, they get these guys out.
[00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:52.020]   Oh, they're so gross.
[00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:53.020]   They're so gross.
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:54.020]   These things are meaningless.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.820]   Have you worked at ours like Devorak?
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.300]   So, John Foster sends us a list.
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.500]   The link from John Foster lost.
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.580]   Is it now a video game?
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:02.580]   A video game.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.580]   Really?
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:04.580]   Have you played it?
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.580]   I have not.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.580]   I'm going to download it tonight.
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:07.580]   It's for the iPod though.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.300]   You could play it on your iPod, Henry.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.340]   Lost like the TV show was in the office.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:12.340]   Like the TV show.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.580]   But what kind of game would it be?
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.580]   Well, it's an adventure game.
[00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.580]   Well, you spend a lot of time being old.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:18.380]   I bet it's very absorbing first.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.780]   And then over time makes less and less sense.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:21.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:24.580]   Each part of the game gets longer and longer.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:26.020]   You roll around the click wheel.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:27.020]   You roll around the thud.
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.020]   That's too big.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.020]   Here it is.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.020]   Look, I know it doesn't.
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.020]   They haven't figured out the ending of the game yet.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.020]   So, we have to keep downloading.
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.020]   Oh, cool.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:34.020]   That way it looks good.
[00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.540]   It went from that stupid to oh cool.
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:38.020]   Well, I said that because it looks cool.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:39.460]   It looks cool in the picture.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.460]   Oh, a girl.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:41.460]   Who do you like?
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.100]   Sarah Glasgow.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.100]   Which one is she?
[00:45:44.100 --> 00:45:45.940]   I have no idea.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.180]   Is that your girlfriend?
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.180]   Yep.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.180]   That's not somebody in the TV show.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.180]   What?
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.180]   He gets points for...
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.180]   I've never seen loss.
[00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.180]   I've seen a lot of that.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.980]   He gets points for mentioning his girlfriend.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.980]   Oh!
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.980]   The smooth smooth smooth.
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.980]   He gets formerly Henry.
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:00.980]   Very smart.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.500]   Here, look at the game and tell us what you think of it.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.500]   Because there it is on iTunes.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.500]   Oh, can I play it?
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.500]   No, we don't have it here yet.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.500]   You have to download it.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.220]   We'll download it tonight on that.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.220]   It's only five bucks.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.220]   It's really fun.
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.220]   Yeah, it's a cheap deal.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.700]   I still think that the games on the iPods are for five bucks.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.700]   I think it's a good deal.
[00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:17.700]   If the game's any good.
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.060]   The only one I've played is Bejeweled.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.140]   I mean, I love the game Bejeweled, but the interface is...
[00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:23.140]   The interface is...
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:24.140]   I tried it.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.140]   I don't get it.
[00:46:25.140 --> 00:46:29.180]   I mean, considering that you've got to spend like 60 bucks for one of these other games.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.180]   I bought...
[00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.820]   I think it was like Sudoku.
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:34.580]   And it was like pulling teeth.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:35.580]   Yeah, that's shocking.
[00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:36.580]   So something like the Pac-Man.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:37.580]   The poker game is good.
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:38.580]   The poker game is good.
[00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.580]   My Zhang is good.
[00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.580]   I've got both of those.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.580]   I like them both.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.220]   I don't think the click wheel is good enough for skill games.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.220]   No, probably not.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   It's not enough for us to lose.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   There might be a right for loss.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.220]   There might be a right for track and field.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.220]   Because all you're doing is wandering around, right?
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.220]   Aiming left, right, up and down.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:54.540]   It'd be interesting to see how they adopt the interface when those games port over to
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.940]   the iPhone.
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:57.940]   Because you won't have the click wheel.
[00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:58.940]   You think so?
[00:46:58.940 --> 00:46:59.940]   Do you think they'll put them on the iPhone?
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:00.940]   I'm thinking they will.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:01.940]   They'll update them.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:02.940]   I'm thinking they will.
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:03.940]   I mean, they'll throw your finger across.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:04.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:05.940]   Now, maybe not originally.
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:08.940]   Maybe not when the phone ships, but I mean, I think they're going to move everything.
[00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:09.940]   All right.
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:13.100]   You've got to assume one feature of the iPhone that you think really is...
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.780]   Well, see, I'm a pretty basic userly.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.420]   So I don't have that high of expectations.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:18.420]   I think it's the pinch.
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.380]   The pinch thing is a big deal, I can tell you.
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.580]   The pinch thing is good.
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.380]   The accelerometer base.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.380]   I'll tell you.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.380]   This is a very simple feature.
[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.380]   This phone does that.
[00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:29.980]   Here's a very simple feature that I think is really going to save me time.
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.220]   And this is all about time.
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:35.780]   You can get a list of your voicemail and you can skip down to the person you want to
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:36.780]   do that, though.
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:38.420]   All it takes, this phone could do it.
[00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:42.860]   Any phone could do it as long as you have the carrier implemented.
[00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:43.860]   That's a carrier feature.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:44.860]   That's not a phone.
[00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.860]   So do we have any other carriers that are doing that?
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:47.860]   It depends.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.940]   I'm thinking because nobody's announced it, singular must have patented it.
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.060]   So the point being is that I don't care if everybody else can do it.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.660]   I'm talking about the guy that is going to do it.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.420]   Singular could put it on any of their phones, though.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.420]   Maybe.
[00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:59.420]   I'm sure they struck a deal.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.620]   But the point being is that there is an Apple stick with Singulars.
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.900]   That's the newest rumor, five years with Singulars.
[00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.900]   It is five years.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.500]   I get a lot of voicemail and I have to listen to mindless voicemail.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.500]   I agree.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.500]   If I can just--
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.500]   If I can just--
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.780]   There's somebody I really want to talk to, I'll go to that one.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:19.740]   Secondly, I actually believe that it will sink, which I know you all got that figured out,
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:20.740]   but I haven't been able to do that.
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:21.740]   This sucks, great.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:27.220]   Third, I actually may be able to use the SMS text messaging features here because I've
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.380]   not been able to do that on my previous phones.
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:33.780]   So I know that you all are much more adept at this than I am.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.580]   And I'm going to my space.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.580]   It's getting off of there.
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:38.580]   Scott's not there anymore.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.380]   I'm not there anymore.
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:41.860]   I think those are kind of the big things.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:43.860]   Uncle Scott's not there anymore.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:44.860]   Don't change my stuff.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.860]   Scater boy 92.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:46.860]   That's weird.
[00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.860]   And I do think the pinch thing is really cool.
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:52.460]   If you use it a couple of times, you're pretty impressed by how it works.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:56.700]   And I actually think my prediction is we will see it on the iMac soon.
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.700]   Interesting.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.940]   I think we'll get the whole minority report.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:02.740]   Interesting, unless you've listened to any of the last 20 Mac, I've been able to listen
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.740]   to them all.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:07.580]   But have you heard the patch stuff about the interface on the back?
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.580]   On the back?
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:09.580]   On the back.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.580]   What's on the back?
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:15.220]   Apple did some filing about some interface on the back of devices.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:16.940]   Oh, yeah, yeah, that pad.
[00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:18.540]   You know, I see these things.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.540]   Simple but...
[00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   Fun but...
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.740]   No, it's actually going to try to do what they did with your Samsung.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:28.300]   No, I think the problem is you can't read patents and then say that's a product.
[00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:29.300]   Of course.
[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:32.500]   That's just Apple patenting everything in the world in case, right?
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.500]   Right.
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:37.460]   And look at these Microsoft saying, well, Linux says 235 patents of ours.
[00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:39.260]   It's just why you do that, it makes some money on it.
[00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.740]   I think patents are going to be less relevant going forward into the next decade than they
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:43.740]   were last decade.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:44.740]   I think less.
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.740]   I agree.
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.740]   Less.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:50.140]   I think it would be less relevant than they were in the past decade.
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.540]   Do you think going forward the patents are going to be more or less relevant?
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.540]   Less.
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.420]   Would you compare and contrast the president of the future?
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.380]   Well, thanks to the Supreme Court, we know that's true.
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.380]   Yeah, the eBay case started that trend.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.020]   And you know what's first to go and I'm glad for it?
[00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:05.020]   Process patents.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.020]   Yes.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.020]   I hate the process patents.
[00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.020]   Jeff Bezos started that.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.020]   Well, the one click.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.020]   And that drives me nuts.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.020]   That's patenting.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:16.260]   Instead of patenting something that you invented, it's patenting the steps you came to do.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.740]   I heard you can patent accounting.
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:21.500]   You can patent accounting methods.
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:22.500]   Methods.
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:23.500]   Wow.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:24.500]   That's ridiculous.
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.500]   And that's the problem.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.900]   With a copyright, you actually have to put code in there.
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:31.100]   You have to say, you know, here's this, you know, this is my copyrighted code.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.020]   We'll see the difference between a copyright and a patent.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.340]   You cannot copyright an idea.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.780]   You can copyright the expression expression idea.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.260]   Which is the way a patent should be.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:40.260]   That's exactly right.
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.260]   I think.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.260]   That's exactly right.
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:43.260]   We're all in agreement.
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.260]   And the Supreme Court contacts us for our opinion.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.580]   We'll give them set strain.
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:51.060]   So unfortunately, now if I were at home, instead of in this fancy studio, I could actually
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.900]   play this South Park Get a Mac ad.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:56.260]   But instead, no, I have to hold it up to the microphone.
[00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.060]   Oh, just like Bill Monroe.
[00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:59.460]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:01.580]   If you were to have her on the stage of the rhyme and give--
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.580]   I turned the sound off.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.580]   Oh, you turned the sound off.
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:05.740]   If you were to give me some advance, notice Leo.
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:06.740]   We get to the comedy.
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:07.740]   No, I know.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:08.740]   In the fancy studio, we have all sorts of--
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:09.740]   We have a lot of use this year.
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.500]   You have a thing I could plug into this?
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:15.380]   I think people would be surprised how modest things are in here, Scott.
[00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.220]   I'm actually seated in a rocket chair.
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:18.220]   I'm going to run for you.
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:19.220]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.620]   How many studios do you go to that have a pickle barrel, though?
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.620]   Come on.
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.620]   It's be honest.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:24.620]   You know, this is just so unfair.
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:27.100]   And there's that buck tooth boy with the banjo outside.
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:28.100]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.100]   Oh, you mean your twin brother?
[00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:31.100]   Did he mean you?
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.100]   Yeah, my twin brother.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:34.100]   Pickle-bear girl Joe.
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:35.100]   Pickle-bear-old Joe?
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.100]   All right.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.780]   Anything else, any other stories we want to mention here before we let Craig Severson go
[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:44.220]   to his daughter's tea ball game or whatever it is he's got to do?
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:45.220]   Her play?
[00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.220]   Her play?
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:47.220]   In Shakespeare.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:48.220]   Oh, really?
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.220]   As we like it.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.220]   Oh, I do that.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.220]   Oh, that's fantastic.
[00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.220]   I was Orlando Dubois.
[00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:53.220]   You were?
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.220]   Is she Rosalind the fair Rosalind?
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.060]   No, she's-- what's the other one?
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.060]   The other female.
[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:58.060]   Ah, so--
[00:51:58.060 --> 00:51:59.060]   Can't remember.
[00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.060]   I forgot all that.
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:01.060]   I was in love with Rosalind, so I didn't pay any attention to that.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.060]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.540]   As I remember Adam, it was upon it.
[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:06.620]   As I actually can remember some of the fruit, the one that's missing.
[00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.700]   Best part was I got to wrestle somebody for a girl's hand.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   Yes.
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:11.700]   Long time ago, dude.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:12.700]   Long time ago.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.340]   That's going to work out really well.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.980]   I think it's a catchphrase because it's--
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.980]   Yeah, that's going to be the-- that's totally going to be huge.
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:20.100]   I think you should register what.com.
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:25.420]   Is that a new thing that the five-year deal-- that's just recently become evident.
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.420]   And--
[00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.980]   Does that mean no one else can sell this?
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.980]   You know, Verizon can't sell an iPhone?
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.980]   It means--
[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:31.980]   Not the United States.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.540]   Obviously, Rogers will get it in the Canada--
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:37.260]   It looks like Rogers in Canada, and it looks like T-Mobile in Europe.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:38.260]   That's what we're getting.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.820]   But T-Mobile in the US?
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.820]   Mine.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:41.820]   Negative.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:42.820]   Mine.
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:46.940]   And I'll tell you what, a five-year deal, that is a long deal for Apple to make.
[00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.180]   I mean, they don't like to do the deals like that.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:53.260]   What leverage did singular-- or I'm sorry, AT&T have that they could--
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.580]   Well, I think the deal was there like-- we're going to have to-- for instance, I'll tell
[00:52:56.580 --> 00:53:03.500]   you something that happened on May 20th at midnight, 1,800 stores simultaneously.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:07.860]   In one fell swoop, all the employees came in and changed all the branding in 1,800 singular
[00:53:07.860 --> 00:53:08.860]   stores.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:09.860]   They're going to get to AT&T.
[00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.500]   So by the 21st, when everybody came to work--
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:12.500]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:15.460]   They walked by their place of business thinking, where's my store?
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.460]   Right.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:17.460]   Because it looked differently.
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:20.180]   I mean, that kind of coordination obviously cost them some bucks, and they're like going
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:23.100]   to jobs, hey, man, if you want us to do all this stuff, you've got to have-- we've got
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:27.980]   to be assured that we're going to have some skin in the game for a long time.
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:30.500]   And then of course, at the end of five years, who knows?
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:31.500]   But--
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:37.300]   Did you see this article in the unofficial Apple Web log on using a Newton?
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:38.300]   I did see that.
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.860]   For yourself planning.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.820]   Which was proof that our Newton discussion the other day was relevant.
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:43.820]   It's not-- exactly.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.820]   It's not obsolete.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.580]   I might have to try this.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:48.220]   I was hoping you were going to bring the Newton down.
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.220]   I was going to bring it.
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.220]   I had mine next time.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.220]   The employees are ready to go.
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:53.220]   Can we do the show here again?
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:54.660]   Yes, we can do as often as you like.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:58.740]   I want that Andy Anotko computer, that $10 MIT computer.
[00:53:58.740 --> 00:53:59.740]   You know?
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.740]   That sounded pretty foxy.
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:06.180]   I'm going to tell you guys, a friend of mine, Liana Lehue.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.180]   Showed me how--
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:08.180]   Say that again.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.180]   I love it.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:10.180]   That's great.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.180]   She's Hawaiian.
[00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:12.180]   I want to know her.
[00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:13.180]   And she works for Damon Way and--
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.180]   It's all liquids.
[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:21.900]   And she has this NEC, little NEC 10-year-old laptop thing that costs like $1,100, 10 years
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:23.900]   ago, which you can buy for $30.
[00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:25.500]   Is it really what Andy Anotko was talking about?
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.500]   And it comes with word and all kinds of stuff.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.460]   Sounds like what he's got.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.620]   And she showed this thing to me.
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.420]   She tricked it out with Linux.
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:33.420]   Wow.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.420]   And it's amazing.
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.420]   She's got her on the show.
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.140]   We're going to have her on the show.
[00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:40.140]   She's a complete, straight up, total geek.
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.140]   Wow.
[00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:42.140]   And she went to GMT.
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.140]   That's where I met, right?
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.460]   That's one place I would like to see Linux more ways.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.900]   I mean, like to me, you know, so I got parallels going and put Linux on my Mac.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.700]   But it was sort of like, well, you know--
[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:51.700]   Nokia 800.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:52.700]   Linux.
[00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:55.940]   She's managed to figure out how you can do Wi-Fi on it.
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:57.700]   You can write to a compact flash car.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.180]   Our pioneer HDTV.
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:00.180]   Linux.
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:01.180]   Yeah, did you know that?
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.180]   Wow.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:04.940]   So anyway, these little devices are coming back and vogue.
[00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:05.940]   This was $1,100, 10 years ago.
[00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:06.940]   I'm telling you.
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.380]   So if you could find a Scion 3A, I missed that sucker.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:11.580]   You put a color screen on that thing.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.180]   It would be better than anything out there right now.
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:18.700]   Let's do our software picks of the week and then wrap this thing up.
[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.060]   Merlin, man, I'm going to make you start because I usually make you end this.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.700]   Yeah, no problem.
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.460]   I just came across this today.
[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.100]   I've been a little bit off the grid lately.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:34.460]   But Matt Jones, who's a really terrific writer and technology guy and English person, just
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:38.540]   released something the other day that should be of interest to people who use text mate.
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:41.540]   There's a million different things out there for doing wikis.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:43.140]   Obviously, there's stuff like media wiki.
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:45.860]   It's hard to be media wiki for having a full-on wiki.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:52.020]   Voodoo pad is fantastic if you want to very tricked out wiki on your Mac desktop.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:56.820]   But he was frustrated with the idea that all this stuff was in varying degrees in some
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.100]   kind of specialized format or a proprietary format.
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:05.580]   So he put together this really modest little bundle for text mate that basically lets you
[00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:11.060]   have a text only wiki inside of text mate that runs off of a Mac folder and a bunch
[00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.060]   of text files.
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:13.060]   I'm liking this.
[00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:14.060]   So he made a bundle.
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:15.060]   Great idea.
[00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:16.060]   Literally text mate bundle.
[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.060]   It literally takes like 60 seconds to set this up.
[00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:22.460]   You go and you, so basically, you know how in text mate, you can drag a folder on a text
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.060]   mate and it turns into a project.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:26.220]   You basically create a file and start typing.
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:30.420]   And when you get camel case, you put the cursor on the camel case and hit enter and it generates
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.340]   a new text file.
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:33.820]   So you can, it's a great idea.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:34.900]   It's a really great idea.
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.860]   If you are, if you just want to full on super easy, like, you know, kind of stripped down,
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:42.580]   but you know, text rich way to do this is really cool.
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.700]   And then I would just note that anything you can do with Quicksilver in text, you can
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:47.700]   do with this.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:50.660]   So you can generate new files, you can append and pre-pen all that.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:51.660]   You know, it's text.
[00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:52.660]   Did you say pre-penned?
[00:56:52.660 --> 00:56:53.660]   You did.
[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.660]   I heard it.
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:55.660]   So you just wanted to double check.
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:56.660]   It's the front of the file.
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:57.660]   It's terrific.
[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:02.140]   So I just wrote this up this afternoon at 43folders.com.
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:05.260]   It's easier than sending it to you to his earl, which is longer.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.380]   But I really, if you use text mate and like it, I'd recommend checking it out.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:15.420]   I don't know if I'll have a direct use for this like today, but it seems pretty neat
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:16.420]   in terms of flexibility.
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:20.460]   If you're one of those folks who likes to live on a stick or in your iPod, it's a great
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:22.980]   way to do stuff for ever since you turn me on to Kota.
[00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:24.340]   I haven't used text mate much.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.900]   So I need a new use for text mate.
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:26.900]   For real.
[00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:27.900]   I'm editing in Kota.
[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:29.300]   Kota's great.
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:32.500]   I want Kota to add in just a little bit more IDE magic.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.340]   I've already done three updates.
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.060]   I mean, I think it's very close.
[00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.140]   They clearly are in having the direct direct.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:39.140]   They have snippets in Kota.
[00:57:39.140 --> 00:57:40.140]   They don't have snippets in it.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:41.140]   No, see, that's the thing.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.620]   There's some of these functions out of the bundles and snippets capability of text makes
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:44.620]   are remarkable.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.620]   Text mate's amazing because I mean--
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.620]   You can use text mate with Kota.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.620]   I mean, in the later phase two.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.380]   I think one of the things that made text mates, so I mean, you've been able to do this in
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:51.860]   BBN with a little bit of hacking.
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.620]   But the fact that it's so plugged into the terminal from the time that you turn it on,
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.300]   it just gives you so much power.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:58.300]   But anyway, yeah.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.300]   So anyway, it's at interconnected.org.
[00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.100]   Interconnected.org.
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:07.300]   Just look for his plain text wiki article where you can see him at 43 folders.
[00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.300]   Yeah, from 43 folders.
[00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:09.300]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:10.300]   Yeah.
[00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.300]   So that's my pick.
[00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:12.300]   Awesome.
[00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:13.300]   Craig Seversen, did you bring us a pick?
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:14.300]   I did bring you a pick.
[00:58:14.300 --> 00:58:16.300]   I'm not sure if his is an historic MacBook.
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.300]   Mac week.
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:18.300]   Weekly break show.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.740]   The show is called Mac Break Week.
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.900]   For those of you who are not here, Craig is having a stroke.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:23.900]   Thank you.
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.540]   And I don't know how to say that, isn't it?
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:28.460]   I'm sure a circus elephant peanut sky.
[00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:29.460]   Mark.
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:30.460]   Definitely dreads.
[00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:31.460]   Definitely dreads.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:32.460]   Oh, boy.
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:36.900]   But you see, my MacBook Pro went dark and then I started MacBook Week Pro.
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.380]   No, but see my picks on there.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.380]   But I remember it.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:43.580]   And what I'm saying is you guys might have talked about this before, but it's I stat pro.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:44.580]   I love it.
[00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:46.980]   And we have, I think, done it for a bit, though.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:47.980]   We like it, do it again.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:48.980]   You can do it again.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:49.980]   There's been updated.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:50.980]   It's been updated.
[00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:51.980]   Voygen 4.
[00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.980]   Voygen 4, which is a...
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:53.980]   That would be the one after 3.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:55.260]   That he comes right after 3 there.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:56.260]   Definitely 3.
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:57.260]   Definitely 3.
[00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.260]   And why before 5?
[00:58:58.260 --> 00:58:59.260]   Oh, boy.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.260]   But you know, I really, I really kind of like it.
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:01.260]   We can totally do a zoom.
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:03.020]   Because 10 minutes to walk.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:04.020]   Well, because...
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.020]   I told you that guy called me about it.
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.020]   He wanted us to do it.
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.020]   We want your job.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:11.460]   Because I can monitor things that are going on.
[00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:14.060]   You know, we need a hot chick just to laugh.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.420]   I'm like, "God, Leo, you're so crazy."
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:18.420]   That's what we need.
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.420]   Henry, you want to do that?
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:22.420]   And then...
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:23.420]   But it actually has utility.
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:25.180]   You know, I'm geeking up.
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:26.180]   Yes.
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.180]   But I'm fine.
[00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:29.660]   I would be prepared to just tell the nice people what I stat does.
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:31.740]   Thank you for reminding me of the basic functionality.
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:32.980]   That's a small thing.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.140]   We're trying to get to the story.
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:38.460]   I stat gives you kind of a dashboard look at all the kind of major functions that are
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:40.380]   going on with the guts of your machine.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:45.220]   The CPU use, the memory use, hard drives, network, etc.
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:48.380]   You can bring in, you can add different panels and take them away.
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.380]   So it gives...
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.380]   But the one thing I like about it is beautifully designed.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.820]   And I'm always a big fan of that.
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:53.620]   It's a beautiful UI.
[00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:58.980]   It gives me at a glance a way to tell, "Am I overworking the CPU or is my memory being
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.620]   a little funky because if I launch Photoshop and then quit it, it doesn't always go away?"
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:08.460]   So I've actually found I've had much more utility in figuring out exactly how to make
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.620]   stuff work better.
[01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:11.620]   So it comes as a widget.
[01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.620]   I don't know what's...
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:13.620]   Why is everyone looking at it?
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.620]   Yeah, there's also an app.
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:15.620]   There's an app and a widget.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:16.620]   He's still in the game.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:18.020]   I'm getting ready for my thing.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.020]   Ah, okay.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.020]   It's all Merlin.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.020]   No, I'm listening.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.020]   Yeah, I appreciate that.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.420]   No, it comes with a widget.
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.420]   They're playing Robotron.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.620]   I don't know what they're doing.
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:28.540]   But the developers have said product.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:33.020]   Islayer gave me instructions on how to make that widget always live on the desktop.
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.220]   I'm sure you know this is some sort of terminal little bucket of money.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.220]   Yeah, there's a way to do that.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.220]   Craig, that's very interesting.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.220]   But I'd rather hear about wheels.
[01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.220]   No.
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:40.220]   Oh, geez.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.220]   Hey, what's the trick for that?
[01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:44.420]   Isn't there also a way you can do that in the GUI where you bring up dashboard and
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:46.420]   then you select a certain thing when you close everything else?
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:47.420]   That's what they gave it.
[01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:48.420]   They gave you that trick.
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:49.420]   Yeah, there's a way to do that.
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:50.420]   Online in the terminal.
[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.620]   The terminal will do it, but there's also a way to do it.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.820]   It's a developer thing.
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.820]   It's a good thing.
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:58.980]   Didn't the I-STAT the new one I'm trying to help you here because you're doing great
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:00:59.980]   things really big.
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:02.620]   Didn't they also have the ask stuff up in the menu bar?
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:03.620]   They did.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.620]   It's in beta.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.420]   Whose pick is this?
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.420]   No, I think it's a good pick.
[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.420]   It's a good thing.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.420]   Thank you.
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.420]   And there is an application version as well.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:12.420]   And I use it.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.420]   No, it's on here.
[01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.420]   But the absolutely.
[01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.820]   And I'm the one asking for Adderall.
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.820]   Look at I-STAT Pro.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.820]   You're right.
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:18.820]   Let's write bikes.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:19.820]   See right there.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.820]   See, yeah.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:21.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:22.820]   Let's look them on.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:23.820]   Definitely, I straight.
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:24.820]   Oh boy.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:25.820]   You know what I like it for is temperature monitoring.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.820]   Yes.
[01:01:26.820 --> 01:01:27.820]   I gotta tell you.
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:29.820]   And the other thing that's really cool.
[01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:30.820]   I know I can throw it in the back of this thing.
[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.820]   The other thing that's really cool is you can tell how many times your battery's been
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:34.820]   cycled.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.820]   That's what I use it for.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:36.820]   I like the battery thing.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:37.820]   It's a good pick, Greg.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.820]   Oh, shit.
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.820]   I love it.
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:40.820]   I love it.
[01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:43.140]   Let's get the wheels picked.
[01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:44.140]   You want to do your first?
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.140]   I'll do my pick.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:46.860]   My pick is a surprising pick.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:47.860]   It surprises me anyway.
[01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:48.780]   What?
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:49.780]   I want it for Windows.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.140]   No, no, no, no.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:54.220]   My pick is a cost exactly one Alex.
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.220]   Oh.
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:57.220]   700 bucks over there abouts.
[01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:59.820]   And it's something I really didn't think I was going to recommend because it's something
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:02.940]   I really didn't think I was going to use or like, but I bought it and I like it in its
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:03.940]   Photoshop CS3.
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.940]   Really?
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.940]   And here's why.
[01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.700]   I'll tell you why.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.900]   Mostly because of bridge.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.900]   Bridge.
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:10.900]   The new bridge.
[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:11.900]   The new bridge.
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.900]   Take it to the bridge.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.900]   Bridge uses an aperture.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:14.900]   We'll see now.
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:15.900]   Here's the thing.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:16.900]   It's very aperture like.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:17.900]   They've stolen.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.900]   They should say that.
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.900]   They've borrowed.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:24.900]   Oh, they've been inspired by several things in aperture and the ability particularly to
[01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.740]   do metadata is amazingly improved.
[01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.820]   The speed with which you can use bridge.
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:33.740]   It used to be really clunky and slow.
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:34.980]   And you can organize your files.
[01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:38.580]   You have multiple views like you do in aperture.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:42.060]   And I have to tell you when you combine it with, here's where it gets powerful.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:47.700]   When you combine it with Adobe's new camera raw converter.
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:51.740]   It's stunning because the new camera raw converter is so good you rarely will actually need to
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.700]   go into Photoshop to adjust your photos.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:57.700]   If you're any kind of competent photographer, if you're getting close to the camera.
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.700]   I use Canon.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.700]   I use Canon.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:06.980]   And the camera raw conversions through that into bridge provide quite a seamless and
[01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:13.220]   quick workflow that has me once again for the first time in a year and a half using Photoshop.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.940]   And what's even more shocking for the first time since 1994.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.940]   I bought this thing.
[01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.940]   Wow.
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:20.940]   I didn't get a beta.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:21.940]   Mr. Eppacher.
[01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:22.940]   I'm still using the beta.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.940]   I'm on.
[01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.940]   It sounds like it's worth upgrading.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.940]   I think so.
[01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:27.940]   But not the whole suite.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:28.940]   Just the Photoshop.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:29.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:30.940]   Just the photo.
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.700]   I didn't get all the other stuff because I don't care about that because I don't want
[01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:38.540]   to spend 45 minutes waiting for something and it's PDF to open in an Adobe product versus
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.540]   a preview.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:44.700]   But I've got to tell you on the bridge and ACR side the photographic capabilities of
[01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:46.020]   CS3 made it worth it to me.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.780]   It's the matchbook cover version of bridge because people talk about the slot and I don't
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.780]   exactly understand it.
[01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:51.780]   What is it?
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.780]   What is bridge?
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:57.780]   Bridge is basically a photo organizer or any kind of media asset.
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.220]   It's a media asset.
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:00.820]   It will actually organize any media.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:01.820]   Like I view media.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:06.980]   It's similar to I view multimedia pro and it allows you to quite a bit of key wording
[01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:09.500]   and you can sort things.
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:11.380]   You can do slideshows from it.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.380]   You can change.
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.580]   Just something like you who takes a metric ass load of pictures every year.
[01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.180]   It's actually a double metric ass load.
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:20.260]   You're not using, what do you manage all that in?
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:24.620]   I've been managing things in aperture for a year and a half.
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:28.940]   I used to think bridge sucked in fact so much so they went around deleting it from people's
[01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.300]   computers without their knowledge.
[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.380]   I just didn't want them to even have it on their computer.
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.380]   It was so bad.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:37.620]   Uncle Scott's a really self-fulial software activist.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:40.700]   I would say quick.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.740]   Look there's Paris Hilton nude on a bicycle when they turned around.
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.740]   I would delete it.
[01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.740]   What is this?
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:46.740]   It's just deleted.
[01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:48.740]   They would say Scott my computer's not working right.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:50.380]   Oh it's this nasty bridge.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.580]   But now I have to tell you my apologies to Adobe.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:54.580]   It is wonderful.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:58.820]   That's actually great news because this is something everybody gets free with Photoshop
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.100]   and if it's useful.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.740]   It's extremely useful and I paid for it.
[01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.340]   What did it get for Photoshop?
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.540]   It was like 700 bucks.
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.820]   But you didn't do it.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.660]   I didn't upgrade because I had to buy a clean copy because my last copy was a couple
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.220]   of versions of Go Beta.
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:17.380]   I have a CS2 but I've upgraded from CS1 to CS2.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.380]   You can still upgrade.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.700]   Now you may have to phone in to do the upgrade.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:24.900]   By the way if you have trouble with the upgrade this is something Adobe doesn't tell you.
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.260]   All you have to do is call in and they'll go ahead and tell you, seriously this is like
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.260]   a video game.
[01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:34.140]   They'll say click on the secret place on the Adobe logo and they'll tell you to enter
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.260]   a code and that'll get you to go.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:37.260]   Oh that's awesome.
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.260]   Nice.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.260]   They're usually pretty nice about it.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:42.940]   However before warned don't buy it and expect to install it on a weekend because they're
[01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:43.940]   not there.
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.700]   All right trivia question for you.
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:47.700]   Name the movie.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.700]   Okay.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.180]   Can we get to the question?
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:54.180]   Kids game isn't it?
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.380]   He's not any kind of program sock.
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:57.860]   He's a user.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:58.860]   It's a Disney movie.
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:05:59.860]   Yes.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:00.860]   It's an animated movie.
[01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:01.860]   Well no, it's any.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:06.100]   It was the first movie that combined live action.
[01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.100]   It involved.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:08.100]   It involved.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.100]   Tron.
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:10.100]   Tron.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.100]   I didn't get to get to my third clue.
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.100]   Our game.
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.100]   This is a free program.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.100]   Oh I just got to go.
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.660]   Oh, but you know what?
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:18.660]   It's a light cycle game.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:20.660]   It's a light cycle game.
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:23.380]   But I do have, I tell you the soundtrack wasn't bad.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:24.380]   Now I see what they were doing.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.380]   I don't remember.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.380]   Is it Angelus?
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.380]   Something like that.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.380]   It was good.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.380]   It was a good soundtrack.
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.380]   You're right.
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.380]   I wish you all bridges in a light suit though.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:33.980]   I wish you all could see this because it is fantastic.
[01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:34.980]   That was pretty cool.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.460]   This is a really great game.
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:37.460]   Where do you get this?
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.460]   It's our Megatron.
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:39.460]   It's free.
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.460]   No way.
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.460]   I like that.
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.180]   Well not just for Mac but for, it's multiplayer.
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:48.260]   If we all put it on our Macs right now, we could play against each other.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:51.860]   Or against other people on Linux and Windows, which I like kind of, you know, not leaving
[01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:52.860]   out those Windows.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:53.860]   Who?
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:54.860]   And Linux.
[01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:55.860]   Oh yeah.
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:56.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:57.860]   It's A-R-M-A-R-Magatron.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:06:58.860]   A-R-M-A-G-E-T-R-O-M.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.860]   So they got the word Tron in there.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:03.860]   Tron says it's a ticket at the end.
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:05.740]   Our major Tron or our Megatron.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.940]   It's a community, you know, kind of an open source community development.
[01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:11.460]   And very impressive.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.460]   Very, very impressive.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.940]   That's one of the coolest looking games I've seen on a Mac.
[01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:16.620]   Tron Clon in 3D runs very, very well.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:19.620]   But now I'm told, because I'm not great at these games.
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.620]   I don't have the Twitch.
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:24.380]   But I'm told for advanced people there's a lot of neat, really good advanced features.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:25.860]   You're like a pro.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.100]   I thank you very much, son.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.100]   Is it good?
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.100]   That skate rate is coming your way.
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:33.500]   You're gonna say, "What Leah, why are you handing your child a dollar?"
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:37.100]   Hank, what do you call people who play a lot of World of Warcraft?
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.100]   Nerds.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.100]   Why do you play that game?
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:42.100]   I don't know if you can hear me.
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:43.100]   He's so embarrassed.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.100]   Really?
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.100]   It's not cool anymore.
[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.100]   Do you face trouble at school?
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.100]   People in your dad plays that?
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:50.100]   Some of my friends do.
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:52.100]   They caught me playing.
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:57.100]   Oh man, nothing's worse for a kid than seeing his dad get caught at a...
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.100]   I had to pull my pants on real quick.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:01.100]   You saw people at that one company would like you more if you played with them.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.100]   You were like, "Yeah, I just played with them."
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.100]   That wouldn't be awesome.
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.100]   That would be awesome.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.100]   I'm gonna go get bored.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:12.100]   Did they like me more, Henry?
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.100]   No, they didn't.
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.100]   I don't know.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.100]   We'll fix it in post.
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:19.100]   I want to point out that Leo had the choice to pot up or pot down the mic.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.100]   He's been good.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:25.100]   He's only added to the show.
[01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.100]   Anyway, I know that you're downloading it right now.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.100]   I'm a real man.
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.100]   Our Megatron.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:34.100]   We want to thank you for bringing the wooden box, Craig Seavers.
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.100]   I'm really disappointed.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.100]   What is that, Will Gox?
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:40.220]   Well, this show is usually you get to Mac news like two hours into the show if you get into
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:41.220]   Mac news at all.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:42.220]   So I was prepared.
[01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:44.220]   Did you bring a rat hole?
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.220]   Whoa, my God.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.220]   [laughter]
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.100]   Now I have to describe this.
[01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.100]   It's a beautiful wooden box.
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:52.100]   Oh, that is cool.
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.100]   It's a funky old box.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.100]   It's a beautiful wooden box.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.100]   It has a iPod nano strapped to the lid.
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:01.100]   And a set of speakers, he opened it up and it just plays rat hole.
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.100]   [music]
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.100]   And it sounds fantastic.
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.100]   It sounds fantastic.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.100]   It sounds fantastic.
[01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:08.100]   Everybody's whipping out their cameras here.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.100]   This old petonk box.
[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.100]   Petonk.
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:13.100]   Yeah, it's like I took out the petonk's feature.
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.100]   That's that game where you roll the balls.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:17.100]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.100]   Rat hole.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.100]   Rat hole?
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.100]   Oh, it's just a little something.
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.100]   It's what the show usually is.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.100]   But you know what?
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.100]   You guys were very good this time.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.100]   Do you know what?
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.100]   I think we should actually petition the court to each of us change our middle name to pitiful.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:29.100]   I mean, this is the only thing I can think of.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.100]   They were so excited about this.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:33.100]   That's really cool.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:35.100]   Then I didn't get to use it.
[01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.100]   It was like a matter of things designed by Jonathan Eve.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.100]   No.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.100]   That's the sense of fit and finish.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.100]   It's signed by Mr. Eve himself.
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.100]   Is that an audio product there?
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:48.100]   You worked at IDO at one point, right, Chris?
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.100]   Yeah, for about ten years.
[01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.100]   Oh, not just one point, many points.
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.100]   Yes.
[01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.100]   And is that the kind of thing they would have sanctioned?
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.100]   No, no, no.
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.100]   This is more of the found art in junk art collection.
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.100]   I mean, you know, the iPod is busted.
[01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.100]   This is what you said.
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.100]   You're agit props.
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:02.100]   Exactly.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:03.100]   You had to do with the white tape.
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.100]   I wanted to make a look at it.
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.100]   You were carrying that everywhere you go.
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.100]   And, you know, he was so coy.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.100]   I mean, we knew he had this all through the show.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.100]   Hey, he set this thing down on my beautiful recording table.
[01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.100]   I'm like, what's this funky box?
[01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.100]   Oh, I like it.
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.100]   It's a nap-a-tongue box.
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.100]   I thought maybe we were going to be like, "Pit-a-tongue."
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:18.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:24.100]   What you really should do, Craig, is next time you're making a presentation for like some high-end design thing you should say, "Well, I've been working on this a long time."
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:25.100]   And here's my prototype.
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.100]   Sit down, start with that.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:28.100]   Right, right, right.
[01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.100]   They're all going to go, "What is it playing music?"
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.100]   Yeah, it has a matter of it.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.100]   Yeah, it has a place where you think it would work.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.100]   Do you think it's in my life that I'm truly proud of?
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:36.100]   Today I'm going to show you one of the-
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:43.100]   See, if Steve Jobs would have only thought to build his boom box that well, they might have actually sold a few of them.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:44.100]   That's pretty silly.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:46.100]   Actually, it has the feel of Aboriginal apple.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.100]   It's got that wooden original apple.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.100]   Yeah, it does.
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.100]   It could be an apple.
[01:10:50.100 --> 01:10:51.100]   Apple won.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:52.100]   Glue that in there.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:53.100]   No, that's just a piece of white tape.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.100]   Do you guys-
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.100]   Do you wish he was your father?
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.100]   [laughter]
[01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.100]   Damn you, Craig, Severson.
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.100]   You're never going to get a skate ramp from me.
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:02.100]   What do they call it?
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.100]   Alienation of affection?
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:04.100]   That's it.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:05.100]   Scott, do I have a case?
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:06.100]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:07.100]   I think so.
[01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.100]   It is interesting.
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:13.100]   I just got to think, and I would probably rather have that than the official apple boom box.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.100]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.100]   What did the iPod high-five?
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:17.100]   Yeah, it just happened to that as well.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:19.100]   It really kind of came and went, didn't it?
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:23.100]   It did reinforce for me the possibility that Apple could screw up the idea.
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:24.100]   You know what's-
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:25.100]   It's a perfect example.
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.100]   In fact, remember, Steve Jobs said, "I'm getting rid of my stereo."
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:29.100]   Oh, my God.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:33.100]   Here's what's funny about it, because look at what came up in the breach.
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:35.100]   That's this whole separate market now.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:38.100]   There's all these people doing all this, like the ML audio stuff.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.100]   Sure.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.100]   People-
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.100]   It's extraordinary, though.
[01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.100]   All along, and that was what was odd, was that here's this massive market already.
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:44.100]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:45.100]   Well, Apple says, "Wait a minute.
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:46.100]   We've got something-
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:53.100]   Yeah, I have to say the $139 little JBL thing that they gave in our speaker bags at Macworld
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.100]   sounds better.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.100]   Wow.
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.100]   And it only takes up about six inches on your desk.
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:00.100]   In fact, we have one sitting right here behind me, which we use.
[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.100]   But you've heard of the Bango Studio.
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.100]   You've heard Alex's M station.
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.100]   Now, that's the one you want.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.100]   Yeah, and that's like a monster, though.
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:10.100]   You know what I like to do with my M station, my ML audio?
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.100]   I enjoy listening to audio books.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:15.100]   How can I have some books on tape?
[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.100]   John Hodgman, there is my expertise.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.100]   Yeah, that one.
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:21.100]   Is there a special coupon code you use when you do that, Marilyn?
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.100]   Yes, there is.
[01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:23.100]   That's right, Scott.
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:27.100]   There's Mac break.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.100]   But if you're right now, wait right there.
[01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:31.100]   The operator is standing by.
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.100]   You're also going to get the Juliann Fry, Nick.
[01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:35.100]   Iphonech.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:36.100]   Applephonechow.com.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:39.100]   Well, you can understand my confusion.
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.100]   Yeah, that Merlin planted that seed.
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.100]   No, it's Podphone-Castrix.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:45.100]   Podphone-Castrix.
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:46.100]   Podphone-Castrix.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:50.100]   And if you can't remember, I just want you to go to 44folders.
[01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:52.100]   Oh, that's got to hurt.
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:53.100]   That does--
[01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.100]   I own them all.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:55.100]   Do you have 44?
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.100]   No.
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:57.100]   42, 41, 43.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.100]   I don't care about--
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:02.100]   43 and a third folder is going to be my new blog.
[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:07.100]   People know, people know where to come for the best in time-wasting productivity.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.100]   That's the Merlin Show.com.
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:12.100]   It's infrequently updated, but the tips are very poor.
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:14.100]   43folders.com.
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:19.100]   Craig Severson is, of course, the grunt of video grunt and pod grunt at gruntmedia.com.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.100]   Yes.
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.100]   And great podcast.
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:21.100]   Highly recommend.
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.100]   Thank you.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:29.100]   Someday, you've got to do a keynote podcast on how to do the best keynote master ever.
[01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:30.100]   Love keynote camera.
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:31.100]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:34.100]   Can we do some keynote on the TV show, The Lab, and it was fantastic.
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:35.100]   Thank you.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.100]   And by the way, I'm told that Merlin says, "I might be able to get a passport next year.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:40.100]   You've got to come up and visit us."
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:45.100]   I am literally next week walking down to the park side station for the office to have my
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:46.100]   future taken.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:47.100]   I did the whole thing.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:48.100]   I'm going to come to Canadian.
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:49.100]   Please come to Canadian.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.100]   I still got 50 bucks for that fake-picked money.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.100]   I got this weird stuff.
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:54.100]   How do you know what to do with it?
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:56.100]   And Merlin, I want you to know those old warrants.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.100]   We're going to help you get rid of those.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.100]   Really?
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:00.100]   Has it got paper on me?
[01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.100]   That's what they always say on the wire.
[01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:02.100]   And HenryLaport.com.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:04.100]   He owns the site, but he's...
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.100]   No, I don't.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.100]   Yeah, I bought it for you, kid.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:07.100]   What?
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:08.100]   HenryLaport.com.
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.100]   Oh.
[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.100]   Did you know that?
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.100]   But we have it...
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.100]   Now I got to get Hank Leopold.
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.100]   That's right.
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:14.100]   He's not live.
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:15.100]   We're not live.
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.100]   We're going to go and close.
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.100]   And Mar-Mangatron.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:21.100]   Yes, HankLeoport.com is the website for nothing.
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.100]   Nothing's up there.
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:23.100]   What's your Myspace?
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.100]   What?
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.100]   Is your Myspace public or private?
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:29.100]   I don't know.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.100]   The URL's...
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.100]   Myspace.com/HankIs...
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.100]   No.
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:38.100]   Amalia's is Hank's freaking coke.
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:40.100]   That's how the kids talk to me.
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:41.100]   These kids...
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.100]   I absolutely know what he just said.
[01:14:43.100 --> 01:14:44.100]   What's your...
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:45.100]   What's your...
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.100]   What's happening?
[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.100]   Oh, I forgot.
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:48.100]   You don't even know you're Myspace?
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:49.100]   No, I forgot.
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:50.100]   One sec.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:51.100]   Jeez, Louise.
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.100]   I think all the kids...
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.100]   All the kids are off the Myspace now.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.100]   It's all about...
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.100]   Do you do Facebook?
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:56.100]   Are you on the Facebook?
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.100]   What's Facebook?
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:58.100]   What's called?
[01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.100]   What's T9?
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.100]   What's...
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.100]   What the hell?
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:03.100]   You know, Hank, I think you're some kind of kid robot.
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:04.100]   They brought in.
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:05.100]   No, he's a rebellion.
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:06.100]   He's in rebellion.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:07.100]   No, he's in rebellion.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:10.100]   You know, I think Facebook is pretty 1990s.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.100]   I'm developing Elbow book.
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.100]   No, I dead.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.100]   The kids love verb.
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:14.100]   What's verb?
[01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:15.100]   I love verb.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.100]   I tried to get him out of my space.
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.100]   And I've got a new one called now.
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:21.100]   Verb is like my space, but it doesn't suck.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.100]   Vy, come, swap over.
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.100]   You can do a lot of...
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:24.100]   You know what the problem is?
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:27.100]   If your friends aren't on it, nobody cares.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:28.100]   Nobody cares.
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.100]   Yeah, no one has a verb.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:33.100]   You know, I just found out that you posted a picture of my bike at your tumbler, Leo.
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:34.100]   Yeah, all these people start emailing me.
[01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.100]   Is this really your bike?
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:36.100]   Yes, it's my bike.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.100]   It's my bike.
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.100]   Ow.
[01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.100]   Ow.
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.100]   Myspace.com/
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:42.100]   Ow.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:43.100]   Ow.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:44.100]   No, what?
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:45.100]   What?
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:46.100]   Did you delete your account?
[01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.100]   No.
[01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:48.100]   Well, no.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.100]   That was done by the...
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.100]   Oh, that was done by Myspace?
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:52.100]   That was done by Myspace during this show.
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:55.100]   No, if you search my name, it's not going to...
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:57.100]   My name is Ray Danger on...
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:58.100]   Shh.
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.100]   We have to edit that out.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:02.100]   Keep that a secret, son.
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:03.100]   Why?
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:06.100]   Because we don't want anybody knowing who you are on Myspace.
[01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:09.100]   Oh, if you search Ray Danger, my Myspace will come up.
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.100]   You know, there's millions of people listening right now.
[01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.100]   I don't care.
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.100]   Hey.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:17.100]   All right, we're going to wrap this up.
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:19.100]   Thank you for joining us, another Mac Break.
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:20.100]   Bye.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.100]   It's broke.
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:33.100]   [Music]
