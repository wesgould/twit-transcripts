[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.280]   But this shows a good example of we have fun. We chat we talk we speculate
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.120]   But it's some of the most informed people in
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.040]   The Mac world and the Apple world and that starts of course with Annie in not go the Chicago Sun times has been covering Apple for how long?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.120]   Oh, God 25 years. I started I started my first paid column when I was still in school
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.240]   So I just realized only recently I realized oh my god. I've been doing this for quarter century. It's amazing
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.400]   Mr. Renee Richie from i'm more. He's the youngster in the pack. You've only been doing this how long
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.080]   Since the iPhone days. Yeah, I'm new Apple boy. You really are
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.800]   How amazing amazing they still wet behind the years and yet he is absolutely I'm more absolutely is one of the best the best places
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.640]   To go if you want to get more and the best analysis and of course from Pittsburgh PA where he is snowed in
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.840]   He's in front of a field of snow. We're looking at this window right now a clear window
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.440]   You may look like a wall, but it's actually clear window and just stacked up with snow Alex Lindsey of the pixel core creator of Mac break
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.280]   When did we when did you create the first Mac break? I think that the first Mac break
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.600]   I believe was 2006 is that I believe that that's that I have to go. I had to backtrack backtrack
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.760]   2005 or 2006
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.440]   450 to
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.760]   442 of Mac break weekly which means that's eight years there
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.080]   so
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.880]   right and so the
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.640]   But the Mac break the show was at least a year or two before that I think it was 2008 because the
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.680]   2006 because 2005 I think you were doing Twitter. I was kind of doing yeah
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.000]   We started to it in 2000 the reason I want the reason I asked is we here's Mac break weekly number number one
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.900]   August 12th 2006. Yeah, so I think it was 2006. It was the it was the I can't remember whether weekly became before
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.300]   Mac break came before Mac break weekly. Yeah. Yeah, so so Mac break the first
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.340]   episode of Mac break was
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.300]   The January of that year that was 2006. Oh, cuz it was that it was Mac break Mac wrote the expo of course
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.300]   Yeah, and then we did that with
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.900]   with
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.900]   Emery Wells and
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:34.140]   Just do you and not no we didn't just he came 2007 so she was the she came the next year
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.780]   the the funny thing is Alex has spent a significant amount of money on a very fancy
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820]   Cine alt Sony Cine Alta
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.540]   That was fancy because it was a 1080p video camera. Well, it was four four four
[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.180]   It was it was four four four and press so you could it's a to pull green screen
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.140]   It was you know, it was built for visual effects and I had and
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.420]   $82,000
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.380]   What say that again? I bought it on sale for $82,000
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.980]   The entire every kid that's more than we paid for every camera all 40 cameras in the studio. I paid it back in a year
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.620]   I will say I'm impressed. Well, you got your money's worth. Yeah, no, I got but it was so hard to edit
[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.020]   1080p that it took weeks to get the first episode out and then no one could watch it
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.820]   I think the second episode was actually the second episode was called the road to 1080p
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.220]   Which was this which is the most viewed?
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:33.500]   Mac break except for the high-fi for whatever reason remember the high-fi yeah except for that one
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.660]   It was the most most viewed Mac break the most viewed Mac break was the Apple high-fi
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.980]   Yeah, yeah, it was the Apple the special the only one that was more than that was when I did that little phone
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.420]   It wasn't really a Mac break
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:52.100]   But it was the I did a little camera rig for the the 3GS that had video and I built this goofy camera thing and wired picked it up
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.100]   And it had millions of views and so the
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.500]   but the
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.940]   But yeah, so the road at 1080p was the second
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.780]   second most viewed
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.780]   behind those two and
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.900]   And but it was literally I couldn't get the show out
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.580]   So the road to 1080p was me putting
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.380]   segments out talking about it while I'm trying to figure out how to get a show
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:21.100]   Out the door so to keep it all from being really upset with me. That's true amazing. So there it is April 13th, 2006
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.400]   That's the number two. Yeah, it's number two. I'm not finding a number one
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.100]   Melissa's - nobody could watch it because I'm three to watch it on a high-powered
[00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.900]   Mac Pro and it would drop every other frame
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.540]   Right. Yeah, and that was yeah
[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:41.980]   Yes, so by the way now even your phone will play back 1080p video. I mean anything see yeah
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.900]   Everyone everyone finally caught up. I was just yeah, you know, I'm over it though now. I'm moving to 4k
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.460]   Oh 4k sold hat. Why not just go 8k
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.420]   Well, we'll take a look. Maybe at any people will start thinking about production 8k, but 4k
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.900]   I think 4k pipeline will be this year's project
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:03.540]   So I think we should start with the Apple car
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.300]   Zoom suddenly and by the way somebody said well, why you call it Mac break weekly? Well at the time Macs were pretty important
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.700]   This was before the iPhone iPad
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.540]   Pretty much only the only thing the Apple made was Macs, right?
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.620]   So that's why
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.100]   But it covers everything now in fact like a good idea the time seem like a good idea the time
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.180]   Jean-Louis Gasey, yes Jose and his Monday note poo poo's the idea of an Apple car
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.780]   He he said this is the you know, basically all stems from this one Wall Street Journal
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.740]   article in which they called it project Titan and
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:50.140]   They said that with journals said a hundred people working on an Apple car in Cupertino
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:57.220]   Jean-Louis who is a former Apple president for Apple and your national and has I think done a good
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.220]   job covering Apple in his Monday note at Monday note calm says
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.380]   At first I didn't pay much attention to the Apple car rumors
[00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:10.900]   I saw them as just another wave of clickbait along the lines of the wiped out Apple TV set which I
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.220]   Too I had that same
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.260]   Reaction all the same well, but that's the funny thing they did come out with a watch
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.940]   He says
[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.960]   The company has the money hundred seventy eight billion in the bank it could easily afford to build a car factory in fact
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   They're cheaper than fabs
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.180]   Microprocessor fabs only a couple of only a couple of billion dollars
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:39.380]   But he points out and you know, I have to say this is the same thing that I and others said when we heard rumors
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.380]   Apple is gonna get in the phone business and
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:48.580]   The TV business that it was a business that you wouldn't want to get into Ford, which is the most successful US car company
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:55.940]   Had 34 billion in sales last quarter, but only made eight hundred thirty five million Apple made 18 billion
[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.180]   It's a big difference. Why would Apple want to get into the car?
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.740]   business
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.020]   We'll start with you Renee is Apple getting into the car business
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:14.100]   Let me just preface it by saying that what surprised me most about this is the very same people who were ardent that Apple would never make a watch
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.820]   Would never make a phone or were absolutely certain that they would are using that same
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:25.700]   Absolutism to talk about the car. I would think that you would learn after all these apples never gonna make a watch never learn anything
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.980]   Just hedge a little but they didn't do a TV
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.620]   They chose not to mean they they prototype the TV they have several TV prototypes
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:39.320]   So the interesting thing about this is I think what the stories we're seeing now are conflating several things Apple's working on batteries
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.900]   Apple's working on the second generation of car play maybe in the third generation of car play right now
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:49.620]   They there's a lot of things going on Apple has to make something next eventually whether it's you know two years from now
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.820]   Five years from now ten years from now there'll be something next there's pen rumors floating around
[00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.220]   There's still the television in the back. There's still the cars
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.180]   And it's a very short list of things that are interesting for Apple to approach next and a car
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:08.580]   You know Apple would be literally negligent if the car wasn't sitting on a list somewhere in Cupertino with somebody going
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.460]   Well, let's take a look at this. No, it's not the right time. No for all these reasons
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.860]   We shouldn't do it or hey, this is interesting. Let's put a couple guys on to it or hey
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:19.220]   Let's explore this well, how does a hundred how to where does that fall in this spectrum?
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:21.460]   It's there are a hundred people working on it again
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:26.700]   That's what depends how do you define the car because what Apple's working on now for car play could easily fit into more extended car project
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.140]   The stuff that Apple's building for extensibility fit right into the watch project
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.260]   So it's hard to the way Apple works is those numbers are hard for me to parse
[00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:34.820]   I think again
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:39.460]   It's like a bunch of people in a black room with an elephant touching different parts of it and calling it different things
[00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.500]   Okay, but there is absolutely there's smoke. There's definitely smoke
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.220]   But we don't know what kind of fire well
[00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.860]   It just it's exactly like the television
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:52.380]   They will take it to a certain point and then they'll decide whether that's going to be their next product Apple does one thing at a time
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.020]   They don't do a ton of new products
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:00.140]   So at some point they'll need and some people are saying this is a rumor to get Wall Street to think that there's even more growth potential for Apple
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:05.300]   Because Wall Street's not certain what comes after the watch and all of these things play apart and why these stories spread
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.300]   But oh, there's also the mapping thing going on is a people are conflating the trucks that are doing the mapping with the Apple car
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.340]   Is that what those Dodge vans we've seen two of them now is that what they're doing is mapping?
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:19.740]   Yeah, I mean Street feels been around for a long time Apple Apple's not a dumb company
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.420]   I like I keep going back to this thing that if we can sit here on this show and say it would be interesting if Apple did this
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.740]   There's almost certainly been someone at Apple who's gone
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.780]   It'd be interesting if we did this and then did a really good job looking at the numbers based on it
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:32.780]   You you agree with Renee and Ika
[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:40.500]   I wish to abstain from conversation about the Apple car project. He was briefed on it. That means he was briefed on it
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:44.900]   He knows something. Oh, that's that's not the reason why I can talk about the reason
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.180]   Why but that would derail the conversation, okay? We can be talking you don't want to have anything to say about it. I
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:57.260]   Don't want to talk about the Apple car. Okay. Alex. I just want to abstain. Let's understand and I'll ask you about it later and
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:02.820]   What do you think I think there's I think it makes a lot of sense?
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:08.180]   I mean so there there may be smoke and there's definitely probably kindling around so it seems like those things are make a lot of sense
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:14.420]   I the I think for Apple when when you look at where Apple can go from a consumer company as it keeps on getting bigger and bigger
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:20.900]   It's where our consumers spending a lot of time that is fundamentally broken and with that with only a few exceptions the car
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.840]   I'm industry is pretty broken and so you know it just we're you know we get kind of this goulash
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.740]   It's kind of where where the phone industry was now
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:33.460]   I think Tesla is probably making the most head roads and there's some rumors that Apple may just give up and buy Tesla
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.380]   Which they could do you know with pocket change?
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.060]   so
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.580]   So you know that might be a possibility. I think Elon Musk and I don't know if Elon would sell it though
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.580]   I mean doesn't he have some say and maybe not?
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.140]   Yeah, I think it would depend you know, I think it could make a lot of sense. I mean I think it's a hostile takeover
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:53.460]   Well, I think Tesla has had with a hundred engineers working on this and possibly more
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.620]   You know that if Apple keeps on building towards it Tesla looks at two different things one is
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:01.540]   Is that there are they going to go after the same market that Tesla's going after?
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:07.940]   Aggressively from the size of Apple so you know the question is do you want to sell to them or do you want to compete with them?
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.380]   And that you know competing with them doesn't work for most companies very well
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.820]   so
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:17.300]   So that might be the thought process that the Tesla needs to think through I think that it makes a lot of sense
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.300]   I look at you know
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.020]   Cars is definitely a thing. I think that I but I think Apple can move into a lot of places like banking
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.180]   You know, I think that apple pay is the beginning of
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.780]   You know testing the waters and seeing how how far they can go down that path
[00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.940]   I mean once you break people away from their credit card
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.380]   You know, there's no reason to step in the middle. So
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:41.220]   You know, so the I think there's a lot of places that apple can go that are a lot bigger than the the markets that they're already in
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.900]   I think the car industry could be one even though ford is doing really well. I think that
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:47.860]   Apple could get a much larger sum
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:53.460]   Larger percentage of the market if if they did it right. I do think that they probably do, you know
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:56.340]   one car
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:02.020]   That only turns left, you know because you shouldn't really turn right ever or only turns right because you really shouldn't turn left
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.100]   I joked on sunday that apple wouldn't have a
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.740]   Accelerator or a gas pedal that would just have
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.260]   At first, I thought one pedal they push forward to go forward, push back to break.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.580]   But then I thought, "Why have a pedal at all?"
[00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:14.540]   Just go like that.
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.260]   We'll have a nod of the thing at the end.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.260]   The digital nod.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.260]   or a nod.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.980]   One of the things I'll be really interested to see is if they go into autonomous driving,
[00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.540]   because I think that a lot of times right now I see that a lot of the discussion is all
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:26.560]   or nothing.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.180]   You know that we want the car, Google doesn't want to give you a steering wheel.
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:32.340]   You know, and other people say, "Well, you'll never get a car."
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.140]   In the self-driving car they don't.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.900]   Yeah, and I think that it makes way more sense is that it will work on the highway.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.140]   You know, so you drive until you get to the highway and then you let go.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.140]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:44.140]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:45.140]   I would do that.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.860]   As a user, I'd much prefer to do that last 10 miles.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:53.140]   And then the time that really burns you is the highway.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.140]   It's the traffic jams.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.140]   It's that kind of thing.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.540]   And the car could manage that very effectively.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.220]   It's worth noting that at least a couple of times Steve Jobs said that he wished that he'd
[00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.180]   had enough time and energy to make a car.
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.380]   So it's obviously, it's again, it's one of those things that is of interest to the kind
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.660]   of people who work at Apple and make the kind of things that Apple ships.
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.420]   So whether it's immediate interest or not, Apple licenses stuff like the license airplay,
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.780]   the license car play, the license home kit.
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.860]   They're not making thermometers.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.220]   They're not making thermostats.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.020]   They're not making light bulbs, but they're making frameworks for that.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.820]   Right now they're making software for cards.
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.940]   Apple sometimes likes to make their own hardware, but with things like Apple Play, they're
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.860]   sorry, AirPlay, they're letting television companies still make televisions.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.900]   So I think it's one of those places where I wouldn't be shocked if Apple did it, but
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.180]   I don't expect to see it later this year.
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.700]   Okay, Andy, derail the conversation.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.540]   Okay.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:46.100]   I've been thinking about this all weekend.
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.060]   I had an immediate reaction to this on Friday.
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:54.980]   My immediate reaction was that this is going to, this is probably the, there had been some
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.900]   murmurs in the press in the past two or three or four weeks about Apple working on a car.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.620]   This is probably the first one that had substantive details.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:09.300]   I just want the time, on Friday, I found the timing very, very weird.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.900]   You have this huge story that you know is going to get a lot of views.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.140]   Not only that, but it's going to start a whole bunch of conversations.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:21.140]   As a matter of fact, it was a trending topic on Twitter within about an hour or two hours.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:25.100]   When do you decide to post this story?
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:30.780]   Wall Street Journal chose to post it after the close of trading on a Friday, on a three-day
[00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:35.700]   weekend when the markets were also going to be closed on Monday, which happened to be
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:40.780]   the weekend before the New Yorker was going to post a really, really great 17,000-word
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.300]   article that was very, very useful and informative.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.300]   I'll talk about that.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.300]   Yes, we are going to talk about that.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.300]   That's the nice topic.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:54.420]   At a time, two months before Apple is launching Apple Watch and wants to start getting information
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.500]   out about that.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.260]   You think it's going to sabotage Apple a little bit?
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.900]   No, no, no.
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.060]   Quite the opposite.
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:10.100]   I don't know that this was a controlled leak.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.540]   The timing, I think, is very, very odd.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:19.700]   It hooks and I spent the weekend trying to shake down more details, including simple things
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.620]   like, for instance, last night at 9 p.m., the Wall Street Journal posted an article about
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.620]   CrossFit training.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.580]   It's not as though they're on the regular schedule where they're trying to say, "Make
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.540]   sure it was post things at 11 a.m. or 1 p.m."
[00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.820]   I might be totally off base here.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.820]   Okay, I'm going to read between the lines.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:45.300]   What I'm saying here is that we have often had these stories, quote, leak to the Wall
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.540]   Street Journal, to the New York Times.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.860]   It is always a story about how Apple is working on something incredible and wonderful.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.060]   My God, aren't we all excited about this upcoming project?
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.900]   We also got a story that we're going to be talking about later on, I'm sure, about how
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.300]   there were problems in the middle of the development of the Apple Watch.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.060]   You notice that there was no leak about the fact, excuse me, about the story that Apple
[00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.420]   is trying to make a watch, but they're failing, failing, failing because every time they try
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:14.020]   to put a sensor in that reads health data, it doesn't work properly.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.540]   We don't get leaks of that nature.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:22.580]   You will often, at times like this, get stories that find their way out about how, oh, look
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.300]   how this wonderful project Apple's working on.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.060]   Oh, you know, it's possible that the new iPhone is going to have a really massive screen
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:31.060]   this year.
[00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:35.780]   You get the feeling that there is not a huge internal investigation at Apple trying to find
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:38.540]   out just who the hell spilled the beans on this top secret project.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.260]   It did save many of that, though, Andy.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:46.220]   Yeah, I mean, I'll wind this up because this could turn into a two-hour long rant that's
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.620]   unfocused and makes people shout, "Hey, grandpa, shut up."
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.540]   But I'll refer people to...
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:53.980]   I'll just go ahead.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.980]   I just feel...
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.740]   And I'm winding it up here.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:02.620]   I just feel as though there is a...
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:05.380]   This is not a story about an announced Apple product.
[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:09.340]   This is a story about a product that Apple may or may not make sometime in the next year
[00:19:09.340 --> 00:19:11.460]   or 30 years or never.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.740]   And given the possibility that this is...
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:22.780]   Given the sketchiness of the origin of this story, I feel as though I don't want to me
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:29.380]   give my time to this story because, you know, I have been doing this for 25 years.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.300]   I hope to do this for 25 years more.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.500]   We lost David Carr last week, phenomenally talented columnist.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.420]   I didn't know him, but my God, I was such a fan of his writing.
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.020]   I lost Roger Ebert a few years ago.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:45.580]   He was 70 years old and he was a columnist for 50 years.
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.660]   And he still inspires me every single day that I want his track record.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.220]   I want to have 50 years worth of work behind me so that when I finally stop writing for
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.620]   whatever reason, someone might look at what I did and say that, "Well, here is this guy's
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.780]   point of view and here's what he thinks about the world and here's things that he thought
[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:04.780]   was important.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.340]   I don't want there to be a risk that someone will say, "My God, Andy Nanko, he was a very
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.940]   useful tool for very large multi-billion dollar."
[00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:15.700]   There's just a stink around this that makes me say, "You know what?
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.220]   I'm not going to talk about the Apple."
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.100]   One that was really curious was the business insider when they said someone, an Apple
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.980]   employee, emailed them saying that, "Don't go to Tesla.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.780]   We have a lot of interesting car stuff going on here."
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.460]   Just an unusual source for us.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:33.180]   There's a possibility that there was enough people talking in the past month that Apple
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.260]   decided, "Well, let's at least put some real facts out there even if we don't have to stand
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.300]   behind this project just to get ahead of this."
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:44.900]   Again, I'm not saying that I know that Apple planted this story.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.820]   I know that Apple was trying to get all kinds of great publicity and get journalists to talk
[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.820]   about this.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.820]   I don't know that for sure.
[00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.900]   All I'm saying is that I fortunately am not like a four article a day news site.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.940]   I don't have the responsibility of talking about everything that comes out there.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.180]   I feel as though this would not be part of my mission to be talking about this under these
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.180]   circumstances.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:09.620]   Deal. I will point people to the August column, which we mentioned at the time by Mark German,
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:15.740]   seeing through the illusion, understanding Apple's mastery of the media for the details.
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.460]   That article has a lot of problems too.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.780]   It's a starting point.
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:30.140]   On the other hand, I don't endorse the central premise of that.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.140]   On the other hand, it is the case Apple has a lot of cash.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.340]   It's so much cash, Lee.
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.340]   All the cash.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.260]   The rumor now is very strong.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.060]   Probably mostly echoes of this original Wall Street Journal story.
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.860]   By the way, we do know very well that the Wall Street Journal is the go-to place when
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:50.980]   Apple wants to raise a false flag.
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:56.060]   As a result, a lot of chatter, Jason Callicannis wrote an article on Friday saying Apple will
[00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:59.700]   buy Tesla for $85 billion.
[00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.300]   That's a lot of money to spend.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.780]   Went there, but MNA talk rumors a couple years ago.
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.740]   There were a couple years ago.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.180]   If you search for Apple Tesla, you can go back, I'm sorry, $75 billion.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:17.660]   You can go back in time and see articles about Apple meeting with Tesla a year ago.
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.660]   It'd be interesting to compare Wall Street Journal articles about Apple making a car with
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:25.020]   articles about making televisions and watches and see how many of them actually came out.
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:30.620]   If there were many of them that didn't ship, just to see how accurate those stories end
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.620]   up being.
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.620]   Let's take a break.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.460]   When we come back, I'm going to honor Andy.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:36.860]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.180]   I'm going to honor your inclinations on this one.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.500]   We'll move on to the Johnny Ives story in The New Yorker, which is fascinating.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.700]   I do want to talk about the story about the Apple Watch sensors that couldn't be put in,
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.260]   not just because they couldn't be made to work or they used too much battery life.
[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:55.820]   I think the other story is that the FDA would have required approval for some of these.
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:01.140]   You do remember, it wasn't so long ago that Apple met with the FDA with an announced agenda
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:05.300]   and I have a feeling it was something like, "Do you really want to regulate this stuff
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.180]   because we would love to put it in a watch?"
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:08.180]   We'll talk about that.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.180]   The hairy arm bias, Leo.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.180]   The bias against hairy arms.
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.180]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.180]   Dang it.
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:13.180]   Those of us built for winter warfare.
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.180]   The prejudice must end.
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:19.540]   No more hairy arms.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:25.060]   I actually am falling prey to all of this stuff.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.540]   I can't wait to get an Apple Watch.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.780]   I for one, embrace our new overlords.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.020]   Our show today brought to you by SmartThings.
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.220]   This would be another great thing to tie into your Apple Watch.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:42.020]   You already can tie it into your iPhone, your Android device, SmartThings.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:45.380]   In SmartThings, your house, starting with the SmartThings hub.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.220]   This was a Kickstarter project, really kind of inspired.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.340]   The folks at SmartThings, the young guys who created SmartThings said, "You know, it would
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.340]   be really great.
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:59.220]   It would be so much easier to make a smart home if everything would talk to everything
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.260]   else, but they don't.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.860]   Your Sonos doesn't talk to your Hue, which doesn't talk to your Schlage lock, which doesn't
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.600]   talk to your X10 controller, which doesn't talk to your Zigbee controller, but the SmartThings
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:16.060]   hub unifies it all and then talks to your smartphone and you can use your smartphone
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:19.020]   to tell your house what to do."
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.980]   Seen its highest rated Smart Home System, it's SmartThings.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:29.380]   They were awarded CES's 2015 Editors Choice Award from Time magazine.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:33.420]   It lets you monitor control and automate your home anywhere using your smartphone, your
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   lights, your locks, your thermostats, your home security, all connected through a single
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   app.
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.220]   And intuitive controls allow you to set the rules on your Smart Home.
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:44.420]   They have Windows Phone apps too.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:48.300]   I want to give them credit kudos for that.
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.980]   With SmartThings, you can customize the way your Smart devices talk to one another.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.100]   So now, for instance, tap Goodnight on your phone.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.100]   The lights will turn off.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.300]   The thermostat will turn down.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.300]   Yes, it works with the Nest.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.020]   It works with all the Smart Thermostats.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:02.020]   Your doors will lock.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.980]   Set your lamps to brighten each morning at sunrise or when you want to wake up.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.140]   Even keep your home protected with SmartThings.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.020]   Home security, motion detection, water detection.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.020]   See all the modules?
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.020]   I've got a ton of them here.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.660]   A ton of them and more come in all the time from SmartThings.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.580]   This is everything you need.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.180]   Enable your speakers to broadcast barking dogs.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.100]   Your sonos suddenly goes, "Rof!"
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.740]   If there's motion outside the house.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.500]   Or just a, "Welcome back."
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.140]   Your dreams were your ticket out.
[00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.140]   Welcome back.
[00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.620]   Welcome home.
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:36.180]   You can actually put one of these doohickeys in your kids, these little things in your kids,
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.380]   these presence detectors in your kids' backpacks.
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.820]   And it'll know when the kids come home.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.820]   Isn't that cool?
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:42.820]   Turn on the microwave.
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.460]   Stick a hot dog in there.
[00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:46.460]   SmartThings.
[00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.460]   Here's the deal.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:52.140]   If you go to smartthings.com/twit right now, take a look at the home security and the solution
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.140]   kits.

[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:14.300]   Money is the way to go.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.780]   A minivan like vehicle.
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.780]   Yes, that's the one that's the one that stopped me cold in my tracks.
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.780]   It's a minivan right there.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.780]   I'm buying the minivan.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.780]   I don't want the minivan.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.780]   I don't want the minivan.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.100]   Well, you have trucks.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   You have cars.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.940]   You have mini apple mom jeans.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.940]   Mom jeans.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:31.660]   Wasn't that the funniest thing on Saturday night live?
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.860]   I loved the mom jeans.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.860]   I think that Apple might just, if they did it, of course, they would define an entirely
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.460]   new species of car.
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.460]   Yes.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:47.580]   I don't know what that would be, but it wouldn't be a definable inside of compact or full size.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.900]   It's got a trunk.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.900]   It's got a hood.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:50.900]   It's got a door.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.900]   Are you getting it yet?
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.900]   A trunk.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.900]   Hood.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.900]   Door.
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:55.900]   Door.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:02.340]   New Yorker magazine published what I would now consider the definitive profile absent some
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:07.100]   great book coming out on Johnny Ive this week.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.100]   That was a book.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.100]   It was.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.100]   Well, it's a New Yorker article.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.100]   I know, Bella.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.500]   Oh my goodness.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   You recommend it?
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.100]   Well, worth reading, right?
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.100]   Yep.
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.100]   Absolutely.
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.500]   Johnny Ive in the future of Apple, the shape of things to come.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:27.700]   We learned such things as Johnny and Mark Newsom, his design buddy, hate the way American cars
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.700]   look.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.740]   That's why they drive.
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.580]   Johnny drives a Bentley.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.100]   He said, what am I fighting it for?
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.780]   Of course, we should point out the Bentley zone by Volkswagen, but that's okay.
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.980]   What am I fighting this for?
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.980]   What is it?
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.060]   I forgot Mark Newsom drives a Rolls.
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.740]   I can't remember now.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.220]   They all drive all the British cars, Leo.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:49.500]   They all drive all the British cars.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:56.460]   I was interested to see that Lorraine Powell Jobs, Steve Zwiddo was at, for instance, the
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.020]   Apple Watch announcement.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:05.060]   Very much still involved as was their son Reed, who's 23 now.
[00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:09.220]   One morning in September, I was talking with a few friends, including, oh, I don't know,
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:13.860]   Chris Martin of Coldplay and Stephen Fry, the British actor and writer in a courtyard beside
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.140]   a community college hall, a few miles from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino.
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:22.180]   This of course is the Flint Center announcement of the iPhone 6.
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:28.980]   Apparently Johnny Ive, there was a playmobile figure made of him by his design colleagues,
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.740]   and he has that on his lock screen of his phone.
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.180]   We're learning much about Johnny Ive.
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.060]   We never knew before.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:40.860]   He owns the 20 seat Gulfstream G5 that Steve Jobs used to own.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:48.060]   Lorraine sold it to Johnny in 2011 after Jobs' death.
[00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:53.740]   He calls Puff Daddy Snoop Shawnee Shawn.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.380]   For reasons no one really understands.
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:00.300]   That's how inside he is.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:05.020]   He has access to Puff Daddy's next name before anybody else has.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.700]   Shawn Coombs, the rapper.
[00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.140]   What did we learn about Steve Jobs?
[00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.420]   Why don't you send my story?
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.420]   Johnny Ives.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.420]   Why don't you guys just summarize it?
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.700]   Andy, why don't you kick things off?
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.180]   What did you find interesting in this article?
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.500]   It's quite a long article.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:23.060]   I found it interesting that apparently JJ Abrams consulted with him on the design of
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.700]   the new lightsabers for the new Star Wars movies.
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.700]   Over drinks.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:28.700]   They're buddies.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:33.900]   That to me is like 10 times cooler than designing a watch or designing a car.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:39.340]   It's like no, if you get to have it say in anything, any key prop in the Star Wars universe,
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:46.460]   okay, you get five free passes and two of them can include murders if you want.
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.460]   How about you?
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.420]   What's a salient tidbit from this Renee Richie?
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.420]   I liked a lot of it.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.420]   I liked a lot of the little details.
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.100]   I had to read it two or three times to pick them up.
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:00.700]   But it was amazing the level of detail they went into, including things like the iPhone
[00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.900]   4 prototype that was larger that they've never really talked about before.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.060]   Because Apple did test larger phones, but they didn't like them as products.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.380]   They didn't go ahead with them.
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.380]   He talks about that a little bit.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.340]   He talked about they name a lot of names, which is unusual for them.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:16.900]   They talk about the process that goes on inside Infinite Loop 2, which they haven't
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.740]   really talked about before.
[00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:25.340]   They play what their office manager calls Euro douche pop during design sessions in the
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.340]   design center, apparently.
[00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:27.340]   Yes.
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.340]   The rapture.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.340]   What do they want?
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:32.300]   The guy has people machine for him, these little geometric patterns, and he either uses
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.860]   them for a coffee coaster or for a new speaker design.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.660]   I mean, it's a healthy workout.
[00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.060]   It must be kind of Oz in there, I tell you.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.900]   Did you read the article Alex yet?
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.900]   I did.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:42.900]   I did.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.420]   I think all I was left was I really want to work in that design facility.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.020]   You know, it's 3,000 square feet of fun.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:51.700]   You know, it's like CNC mills and figuring out like it.
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:56.740]   And it sounds like it's a pretty, I mean, what I was left with is the designers that
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.540]   are there are high pressure only because they're really worried about what they do.
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:04.500]   They're full of internal designer angst.
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.500]   But there's a lot of things that they're just fiddling with and trying to figure out
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:12.220]   and willing to do a thousand iterations of stuff.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.340]   And they have all the tools.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:22.100]   It's just an interesting position to be in to be the design group for this company, you
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.700]   know, that is based on design.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.380]   And you think that they even have, I guess I felt like it would be bigger a factory.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.380]   Yeah, 3,000 square feet is not that big, is it?
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.020]   Especially considering it's filled with milling machines.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.020]   I've said, hey, we make things.
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:37.260]   That's what we do.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.260]   And we want the machine.
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.100]   We don't want to have to send it out to the shop.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.340]   We want to make them right here.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:47.020]   And so they said to the degree that the noise and the pollution would allow, they've included
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.020]   them.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.580]   Isn't it amazing how much Johnny I was involved in?
[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:53.140]   Like he was involved with the direction of the commercial with the Apple Store remake
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.260]   with the watch with the rebuilding of the campus.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:01.020]   It's list after list of major, ginormous projects at Apple and he was there for every
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.020]   one of them.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.740]   Yeah, it became pretty clear that he's been Apple's number two guy for many, many years
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.900]   since Steve came back, really.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.140]   On top of everything else, you would think that it's the company of Apple size and the
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.740]   importance of the stuff they're doing, that they would have more of a design department,
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.740]   a design building.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.020]   But it really just seems like here's a group of people that communicate with each other
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:22.020]   very, very well.
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.660]   There is a very much a group brain sort of thing.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.940]   And although Johnny I was certainly the spearhead of that department, you get the impression
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:34.580]   that every idea is the residue of multiple points of view, people who just talk very,
[00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.980]   very open in a very clubby environment.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.260]   At least I see an impression that you get from this profile.
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.060]   They talk about the work tables which inspire the Apple Store tables, although they're a
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.020]   little bit higher than that.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:51.540]   Apparently, I've spent a lot of time thinking about the height and a lot of studies.
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:57.460]   Each tables has one product category, one product on it or a product part or product
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.180]   concept.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:06.380]   They quote a designer there, former Lamborghini designer, that's saying a table can get crowded
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.700]   with a lot of different ideas, maybe problem solving for one particular feature.
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.340]   Then one day, all the clutter is gone and the winner is left.
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.580]   Much like ourselves.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.580]   Just like this.
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.140]   You almost feel scared for the other products on that table.
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.660]   Is there be like a Pixar movie about like the objects on that table?
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:26.660]   What they do at night?
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.180]   What they do about, I don't know, he was looking at me with that kind of, he had that look
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.500]   on his face.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:38.060]   The author of the "The Profile in Parker" actually was invited into the, got a rare
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:42.340]   invitation into the product design studio before the watch was announced.
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:47.660]   There were some tables covered with sheets of gray silk and Parker writes, "I knew only
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:51.220]   that the future would be no taller than an electric kettle."
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.060]   We now know it was under those sheets.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.460]   He said, "The cloth covering the table nears the door was curiously flat."
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.900]   "This is actually complicated," I've said, "feeling through the material.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:03.580]   This will make sense later.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:11.620]   I'm not messing with you at all, I promise."
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:16.700]   It's really a great read and I think that everyone I know who's read it agrees.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:23.260]   It's accurate and accurately reflects their understanding and knowledge of how Johnny
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.260]   and Mark work.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.700]   Do you get the feeling that Mark's there?
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:32.540]   I don't know if you could equate it to Jimmy Ivin being Eddie Q's or where you have other
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.620]   experts now maybe helping them take some of the load off or helping assure them up so
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:40.380]   that they don't become a single point of explosion at some point?
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:46.220]   One of the other things that I think is interesting is you really have seen how Apple, and I think
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:50.380]   this is one of their secrets, has been able to turn design first engineering.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:59.340]   It's been, I think, a very slow process of the comments that they just skinned the iPod
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:03.580]   to a point where the designers are really coming up with what it's going to do and then they're
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.820]   having engineering figure out how to do that.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.940]   I think that that's a reversal from, I think, most companies.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:16.100]   Yeah, Parker writes that I've linked the studio's work to NASA, like the Apollo program,
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:21.460]   the creation of Apple products required "invention after invention" that you would never be
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.060]   conscious of but that was necessary to do something that was new.
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.140]   This is not skinning.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.980]   This is- They make the machines that make the machines.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.220]   A lot of their time has spent designing equipment to make the stuff that they want to make,
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.220]   which is sound.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.340]   Yeah, I think they said someone in the article where the estimate was, oh, I mean, no one
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:39.580]   knows exactly what it was, but let's start building all of these unibody, so we'll get
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.860]   60,000 CNC mills.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.060]   Unino and sort it out.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:49.700]   Again, when people talk about why does Apple not give money back to investors, it allows
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:54.260]   Apple to do big things like that without really feeling like it's going to be even a
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.260]   scratch.
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.860]   We'll spend a billion dollars or two billion dollars and that gives them a lot of competitive
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.620]   advantage when they can just make those decisions without worrying about the bottom line and
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.860]   knowing that it'll turn out in the long term but not worry about the short term.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:14.460]   There is this kind of a meta-text or subtext to this, as Andy kind of pointed out, that
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:22.220]   they were given unprecedented access in, talked to two designers, Jody Akana, whose specialty
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:28.380]   is color and Bart Andre, who has the most design patents of any Apple employee and says,
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.460]   neither had ever previously spoken to a journalist.
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:39.460]   So, I think, Andy, your point is there is some timing to all of this, that this is part
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:45.460]   of a drumbeat that is Apple is orchestrating.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:48.940]   Apple has to prove this access and there was a reason why all of a sudden this article
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.660]   appears at this time.
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.020]   Let me just make the difference that this is a valuable...
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.820]   This is not BS.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.820]   This is not...
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.380]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.580]   I don't want to contaminate things by saying that things are BS or not.
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.740]   I'm just saying that this is a different thing.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:03.740]   It's not a plan.
[00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:09.020]   Well, yeah, it's open and Apple's on the record.
[00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:13.420]   We hired people from PETA with experience at infiltrating businesses with cameras on
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.420]   their heads.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:15.580]   We pulled out this report.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:20.900]   This is definitely an approved piece, but it's giving value to everyone.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.660]   It's not just the details that come out.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:23.740]   I mean, I'm joking about...
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:28.860]   I was genuinely surprised and pleased by the lightsaber information.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.940]   But it's kind of like Renee said, it's not just the details, it's the larger context
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.100]   of here is how Apple seems to work and here are the relationships between people.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.100]   And here's...
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.900]   It is an insight, I think, a little bit into how they think.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:47.020]   I've toured the design centers of a bunch of different companies.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.180]   It's not as though it's unusual for a company to design a studio to have really impressive
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.580]   fab equipment right in the studio with them.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:02.820]   But it does seem unusual, the level of playfulness for lack of a better word that is shown in
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:04.820]   this article.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:10.700]   The article points out that Bono wrote that the people who work in the design lab genuinely
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:16.380]   love working there and genuinely love Johnny Ive.
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:22.060]   Only two people in 15 years have left the studio.
[00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:28.060]   And Johnny says, "You can't get people this good to work just for money, which is true.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.300]   They have to really be invested in what they're doing."
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:36.340]   Well, I think that one of the things, these design studios, I mean, I've been to a couple
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:40.140]   of different ones, not the Apple one, but a couple of different ones where you're like
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:44.060]   kind of the design center for a variety of different companies.
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:47.980]   And almost all of them are pretty low pressure to some degree.
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:53.140]   I mean, they're all producing something, but they all are a pretty tight knit group of
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:56.260]   people who like to work with each other because it's just really hard to be creative without
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.260]   that.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:59.620]   It's just really hard to think up what the next thing's going to be.
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.780]   And I think that the companies that don't do that well, that are a grinder don't come
[00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.020]   up with the kind of stuff that the companies that give their designers a little bit more
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.020]   space.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:13.580]   Well, and there's also, at least in the current Apple, and I think even to the Steve Jobs era,
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:18.940]   this reverence for design, the article talks about how when the designer enters the room
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:23.140]   in a meeting, it's like the high priest has entered.
[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:28.860]   That is the highest authority at Apple as a designer from Ian Parker's article, Team
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.860]   and New Yorker.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.900]   Team members work 12 hours a day and can't discuss work with friends.
[00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:38.100]   Each product has a lead designer project, has a lead designer, but almost everyone contributes
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.900]   to every project and shares the credit.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.100]   I've described his role as lying between the two extremes of design leadership.
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.880]   He's not the source of all creativity, but nor does he merely assess the proposals of
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.880]   colleagues.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:53.340]   The big ideas are often his and he has an opinion about every detail.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.700]   Team meetings are held in the kitchen two or three times a week and I've encouraged his
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:01.780]   candor and they even joke back and forth about how everybody, including I've has does bad
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.220]   designs.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:08.020]   One of the designers says, I had one last week, which one I've asked the packaging thing,
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.020]   she said.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.020]   That's true.
[00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:12.060]   That was so bad.
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:17.740]   Apparently, she had proposed an ultra suede cloth inside the box for the gold version
[00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.200]   of the Apple watch and he said, and she's the color one.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:26.340]   It should be orangey brown and apparently that that's not the color.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:31.380]   That's how she came to be missing the tip of her left finger.
[00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:36.260]   I've had had objected to that color with comic hyperbole comparing it to the carpeting
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.340]   in a dismal student apartment in the same immune spirit.
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:47.820]   Akana had then said, so you don't like it.
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.420]   They also talk about jobs a little bit.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.860]   Jobs reputation for merciless criticism was notorious.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:58.220]   I've recalled that years ago after seeing colleagues crushed, he protested.
[00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:04.060]   I've protested the jobs jobs replied, well, why would you be vague arguing that ambiguity
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:05.260]   was a form of selfishness?
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.260]   You don't care about how they feel.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.260]   You're being vain.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.260]   You want them to like you.
[00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:14.140]   We've heard this story before, by the way.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.140]   Good article.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.140]   Any other points?
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.260]   I'm just scanning through it to see if there's any other.
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:20.260]   I mean, it's a conscious.
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.140]   It was interesting with the Larry and Paul Jobs when they were talking about just the
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.940]   burden that Johnny I feels about having all these people in the company depend on him,
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:30.020]   but also all the products that he made and how that's not usually an artist's burden
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.020]   to bear.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:32.020]   That's right.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.020]   She said that.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.940]   It's typical for an artist to be in that position.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.900]   Johnny bears it, but apparently it's difficult.
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.980]   I'm sure the Bentley helps.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:48.180]   Do you notice that there's some, I won't name names, but there's already some discussion,
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:50.380]   but oh, look, Mr. Fancy Pets.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.700]   He rides it a Bentley, not just a Bentley, but a chauffeur Bentley.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:55.900]   I'm like, really?
[00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:59.820]   This is what you took away from this article, that somebody who A has the money to have
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:04.340]   a car that he likes to spend time in and also like his time is valuable enough that he'd
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.500]   rather spend his commute time in the backseat thinking and working that in the front seat
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.500]   driving.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.140]   He addressed that directly in the article.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.340]   This is what you're attacking.
[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.900]   Johnny Johnny I have an apple for.
[00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.460]   He says he resisted and resisted buying a Bentley because of other connotations.
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:22.780]   He just, he's always loved the big old school square Bentley's.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.700]   The reasons he says are entirely design based.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:26.980]   I resisted and resisted.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:31.100]   And then I thought this is the most bizarre vanity because I'm concerned that people perceive
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.980]   me to be this way and I'm not that way.
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.620]   So I'm going to.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.900]   And then Jeff Williams drives an old Camry.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.540]   Jives verdict according to Williams is, oh God.
[00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.620]   Senior vice president of operations.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:50.020]   Oh, God.
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.500]   They really dis American car designs.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.140]   It's funny though, you hear about what Ives drives with, you know, Phil Schiller is famous
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.140]   for his out.
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:58.140]   He's in his porches.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.940]   Eddie Q for he's on the Ferrari board.
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:01.140]   Steve Jobs with the Mercedes Benz.
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.500]   You don't hear about the operations guys like Bob's man.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.540]   What Bob man fielder Tim Cook or Jeff Williams is it is fun.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:09.500]   Bob's man feels having like a pickup truck.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.500]   They all have enough.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.900]   Yeah, you think of him as having a pickup truck for sure.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:13.900]   He does.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.900]   But he does.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.340]   I mean, maybe he does.
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.340]   I don't know.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.740]   But they have enough money to get a Bentley if they want big deal, right?
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.500]   Yeah, it means for God's sake.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.820]   It's like those people were complaining about Tim Cook salary before the last quarterly
[00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:27.820]   results came in.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.620]   Yeah, he earned it.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:33.220]   Yeah, 18 billion of profit here and it.
[00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:37.100]   I just people could be so petty about like what they're going to choose to complain about.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:42.500]   It's like, well, whatever they're paying anybody at Apple double it.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.500]   They've got the money.
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:44.500]   They probably earned it.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.820]   Hey, he commutes from San Francisco to Cupertino.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.980]   I think he should have a driver in a Bentley.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:51.700]   I would say there's a people.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.700]   Sorry.
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.700]   I would say this job, I would commute in a camper.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.700]   Okay.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:56.700]   I was just basically.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.100]   So you can take a bath on the way in the back.
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.220]   I would spend an hour.
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.220]   I take another nap.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.780]   Get bread on bus.
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.780]   Your own bus.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.780]   Exactly.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.540]   Yeah, it's interesting to like the designers.
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.700]   A lot of designers seem to live with those with those commutes and don't mind them and
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.660]   a lot of the engineers and a lot of other people seem to really want to live close because
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.660]   they don't want to commute.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.700]   It's interesting how all these personalities balance out.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:22.860]   By the way, it's not clear from the article, but it sounds like Johnny I've might have
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.900]   been the one that said lightsabers should also come out the side.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:31.180]   I think he said somewhere in the article though that he didn't design it that way.
[00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:32.180]   Okay.
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:36.940]   Jive says it was just a conversation and then explained that although he'd said nothing
[00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:40.140]   about crosscards, he had made a case for unevenness.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:44.660]   I thought it would be interesting if it were less precise and it just a bit more more
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.660]   spitty.
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:49.740]   Well, and I'm wondering what that specifically, what I thought he was referring to in that
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:54.460]   part of the article was the if you look at the energy that's growing up the lightsaber,
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:45:00.700]   it's much grittier than the then the it's almost like a fire more than a than a clean
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:01.700]   there.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.220]   Yeah, there's there's there's there's much more grit to it.
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.220]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:08.220]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:09.220]   Then you've seen it before.
[00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.220]   It's like a message.
[00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.220]   I still think the cross.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:16.380]   Interesting that Lorien Powell jobs, Steve Jobs widow, consults Johnny when she's trying
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:19.060]   to decide what kind of glasses to buy or flatware.
[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:24.260]   Don't you wouldn't you wouldn't everyone though like like you could call Johnny and
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.620]   ask him what kind of glasses.
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:27.620]   He's so good on proportion and dimension.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.780]   She said really if you ever need buttons for things designed for doors or lights, you should
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.180]   just stay in touch with him.
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.180]   He's got a CNC machine.
[00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:36.180]   He doesn't have to pick up on it.
[00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.180]   I know.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.180]   I'll just put you on.
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:44.060]   I know definitely definitely ask his opinion, but don't like hire him as a subcontractor.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:49.980]   Oh, no, Johnny, how come this teakettle has no handle the handle upsets the aesthetics?
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:52.660]   Well, now I have to wear oven mist to pick it up.
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.020]   Why would you take it off the stove?
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.420]   But it's so pretty sitting there.
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.420]   Okay.
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:03.700]   It's such an exciting article to read to because it is he is an artist and he does and he and
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:13.100]   the the guy has a like jobs did a very clear, strong vision and doesn't let stuff get in
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.100]   the way.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.660]   I just think it's a really, really great article in the history.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:20.100]   The thing about that article is that you can clearly see that Apple previously had Steve
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.940]   Jobs collaborating with Tim Cook on manufacturing and with Johnny Ivan design.
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:24.940]   Right.
[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:25.940]   And now Steve Jobs isn't there anymore.
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:29.740]   So Johnny I have has had to assume more of the design mantle and Tim Cook's had to assume
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.820]   he had all the operational mantle, but he's got to do all the inner like the CEO sort
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:33.820]   of jobs too.
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:37.180]   So now you have instead of like three people sitting on top, you've had them had to divide
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:39.420]   those tasks amongst the two of them.
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:40.420]   Yeah.
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.940]   Because he people.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:45.700]   Well, I can't wait to see that car.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.900]   I can't wait to buy it.
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:53.300]   It's in the New York magazine for this week for the February 23rd issue.
[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:58.620]   But thank you, New Yorker, for putting the entire article available for free online.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:03.220]   If the car comes out, we all have to bet, I think, on a year.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:07.820]   It could be never or it could be a certain day.
[00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.060]   I'm sure I certain year.
[00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.820]   I'll go for 2019.
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:16.820]   I go for 2018.
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:17.820]   I've got a dollar.
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:20.700]   I'll go for never and Andy recuses himself.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.700]   I abstain.
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.700]   I abstain.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:24.500]   Okay, that's right.
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.900]   Stains not recuses different different implications.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:27.900]   Curiously.
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.060]   In absentia, Andy and I go say.
[00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.780]   A little joke for your musical theater fans out there.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.820]   None of them on the panel today, apparently.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:38.820]   Okay.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.140]   She made a Spider-Man joke.
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.060]   I'd get it, Andy.
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.060]   Okay.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.060]   Let's see.
[00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.060]   Apple Watch.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:49.260]   Apple Watch comes great responsibility, even as a journalist.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:54.420]   Apple Watch will not have as many health sensors as Apple had hoped.
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:48:00.060]   This is another one of those Apple approved articles.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.540]   How about that?
[00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.300]   I don't know if it's an Apple approved article.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.300]   I don't know if Apple's going to put out a story saying they're going to have less than
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.300]   what they want.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.300]   Maybe.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:08.300]   Although it might be a good time for them to...
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.300]   What is this?
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.300]   This is...
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.300]   Lower expectations?
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.300]   Oh, that's a cool watch.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.220]   Here's the new Apple Watch.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:18.300]   We've just got the prototype of this beautiful watch.
[00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:19.300]   Where that on the wrist.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.260]   There you go.
[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:23.260]   But the best part is when you flip the...
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:25.300]   You can let your cigarettes right from the watch.
[00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:26.300]   Is that the Urbain Leo?
[00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:28.740]   Is that the brand you Urbain?
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.820]   I found it on Watchville.
[00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:31.820]   So just...
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.740]   I'm figuring that's a daily giz was...
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.140]   That would have been really tempting.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.340]   That would have been really tempting when I was lighting my pilots, except that it would
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:41.900]   have required to put my hand into a gas stove.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.860]   I don't know if that would have been a smart idea.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.700]   Let me just light my cigarette with my lunch.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:50.980]   I would use that to stay warm right now.
[00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:55.140]   It's just as important the features you say no to as the features you say.
[00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:56.140]   Yes.
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.700]   Well, that's one of the things I think it doesn't get discussed enough is that if Apple says
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:02.700]   a thousand no's for every yes, that means there's got to be a bunch of stuff that they
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:05.380]   just experiment with and don't, you know, and don't put it out.
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:07.140]   And eventually that's a full leak as well.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:11.300]   Yeah, I've had friends at Apple that have talked about the number of things that are
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:15.940]   just insanely cool that Apple developed that never made it out the door.
[00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:17.420]   And they can't talk about them, of course.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:18.420]   Oh, I can't say anything right.
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.420]   I think it was amazing.
[00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.780]   You could not believe what they, what I just saw there.
[00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.980]   Andy's point about timing is well, well taken because there were a bunch of Apple leaks
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:30.620]   in the Wall Street Journal, which I think we we pretty clearly know is where app is the
[00:49:30.620 --> 00:49:36.220]   go to place, even without Marksburg for Apple to leak stuff.
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:42.500]   For instance, this article, Apple orders more than five million watches for the initial
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.500]   run.
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:44.500]   This came out today.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:48.900]   See, you can tell that's not a leak because the analysts went after the buyers.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:54.420]   They were like, they were all trying to guess based on whether it's this run, whether it's
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:56.380]   a run for the two quarters.
[00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.220]   And I was watching Ben Beherin and the author discussed it on Twitter and they were just,
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.380]   it really is hard to tell.
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.100]   And they're all just guessing based on the information they can glean from supply chains.
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.740]   Do you think it's a ballpark accurate figure?
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:10.460]   It's again, it's hard to tell me because that could be one that he could have heard
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.460]   from one factory, but maybe there's more than one factory.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.500]   Maybe that's an order for two quarters in order for one quarter or the article said
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:20.580]   "Quanta Computer is the sole assembler of the Apple Watch."
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:24.780]   And they started mass production earlier this year, which must be last month because this
[00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:30.100]   is February, to get ready for the April, March, thousands of Chinese workers will continue
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:33.900]   to work around the clock during the Chinese New Year's holidays at Quanta's factory in
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.100]   Changshu, China.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.140]   Of course, Apple is not commenting, but if they do five and a half million, where does
[00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:42.300]   that sit in the scale of things?
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:46.540]   Is that a bold, aggressive number to make?
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:53.140]   I think that's conservative because another interesting statistic, I think it might have
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:58.580]   even been Bajaren who pointed this out last week, on the Android apps, I don't think Android
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:02.620]   has ever announced how many Android Wear devices have been sold, but you can tell you
[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:07.220]   need to have the companion app and you have to download it from the Google Play Store
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:09.980]   and that has had fewer than a million downloads so far.
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:10.980]   I think it just...
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:11.980]   I don't know just 3,000.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:17.780]   Yeah, which doesn't mean that this product is a failure, but it means that it's certainly
[00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.700]   of finding limited appeal.
[00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:25.660]   I really do think that if I would be shocked if the Apple Watch didn't sell six times what
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:30.660]   the Android Wear would sell in any given circumstance.
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:34.620]   The other thing that's on my mind is that the more I wear these Android Wear devices,
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.700]   the more I realize that they're actually pretty cool just as wrist watches.
[00:51:37.700 --> 00:51:41.580]   So I feel more optimistic now than I might have been a few months ago trying to guess
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:44.140]   who's going to buy these in the first round.
[00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:47.940]   I think people are going to buy them just because it's not in a hugely expensive, cool
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:51.380]   wrist watch, but it is definitely a cool wrist watch to put on your wrist with all these
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.940]   different designs out there.
[00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.660]   So yeah, I don't think that's...
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.620]   I don't know if that number that they've quoted is accurate, but that doesn't seem out
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.020]   of line to me at all.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:05.420]   How important is the band to this fashion thing?
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:09.700]   And the fact that I can get a beautiful band on it, to me makes it more desirable.
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.900]   And change it, makes it more desirable, right?
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.780]   Yeah, I think it fundamentally allows people to really customize it in a way that you don't
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:19.060]   want to customize the head because it's too hard to manufacture, but the bands are easy
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:21.620]   to manufacture and easy to customize.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.020]   I think people are going to have a lot of fun with them.
[00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:28.500]   I think we're going to see everything from the tread that we saw from Leatherman to Canvas
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:32.020]   to very, very high quality metals.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:35.620]   So I think it'll be... people really have a different kind of watch because of that.
[00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.820]   Yeah, I think it's also a really big one.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.820]   I think it's also a really big one.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:39.820]   Sorry.
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:40.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:45.380]   I also think it's a really big point that on this watch, the band attaches like any other
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.380]   wristwatch.
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:49.300]   So you really need a special tool or take it to a jeweler to have it done.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:53.540]   With this one, you can just spontaneously come home from work, change from your sports
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:56.180]   band to a dressy band, and then go back out again.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.540]   So I really think that's a big point.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.740]   One of the major questions we've all been asking is that are people going to be satisfied
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:06.940]   with a very square rounded high-tech looking watch?
[00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.260]   Are they going to be satisfied with it as a fashion accessory?
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.980]   But if they have the ability to add a whim, switch this out for leather bands, switch it
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:17.860]   out for serpentine bands, switch it out for anything that they want, that certainly addresses
[00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:18.860]   that problem.
[00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.260]   It was interesting that in that same Johnny I've article, I said that the shape of something
[00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:26.260]   that came along very quickly to them and big surprise around a rectangle from Apple,
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.620]   but they wanted to make it fashionable and they went in the direction of the bands.
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:34.020]   And you can imagine that maybe one day there'll be a gold band that costs more than most
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.020]   of the other watches cost.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:37.660]   But it'll give people a lot of options.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:43.860]   There are people who literally buy 10, 20, 20, $35,000 watches annually.
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:48.540]   So the high-end watch market is there's free-field limits.
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:49.540]   That's not going to make this a hit.
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:53.220]   They can't make a hit off of 250,000 millionaires buying watches.
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.060]   They've got to make a hit off.
[00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.540]   They're still buying a brand new iPhone when their contract is up and then in the skip
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:04.340]   year in which they're still under contract, this is the year that, well, I've got $350.
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.020]   I'm going to buy a new Apple watch.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.580]   And then the next year, they're the contract.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.940]   It's up so they buy a new phone.
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.020]   And then after a year after that, well, my watch is starting to look a little bit ratty.
[00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.140]   I think I'll buy a new Apple watch.
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.700]   We got to get a chatroom or anybody.
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:22.940]   We got to get a watch expert, like somebody who's really up on the watch business on
[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:30.300]   to talk about this, I think, because, for instance, I don't know what a high-end $6,000
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.260]   watch, how many units do they sell of those?
[00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:37.940]   Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands.
[00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.020]   This isn't a tech market.
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.100]   This is a very different market.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:43.900]   Well, I think the Wall Street Journal split out the numbers too.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:46.900]   And they said roughly half of those are going to be the sport model, a third of those are
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:52.420]   going to be the stainless steel model and a sixth of those are going to be the gold model.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.420]   Gold rose gold model.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:57.060]   So these Apple if there's a sixth doesn't add up.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:01.460]   What we have doing the math one is a half a third and then whatever the remainder is.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.460]   Another third.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.460]   No, a sixth.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:04.460]   Whatever it is.
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:05.460]   Okay.
[00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.460]   Maybe it does add up.
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:09.460]   Yeah.
[00:55:09.460 --> 00:55:11.020]   Well, I'll call Kevin Rose.
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:12.740]   He's become a watch guy.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.660]   I'll ask him who he would recommend.
[00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.940]   There are watch blogs, really a lot of them.
[00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:22.500]   So, Kevin has an app called Watchville which I subscribe to.
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.180]   But the real point, I think we've talked about this before, is that a watch is not
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.300]   a necessary item to the user of your smartphone.
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:30.300]   It's an adjunct.
[00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:31.300]   It's an add on.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.020]   It's very much optional.
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:37.140]   So if we look ahead the future though, there's certain point in the past of mobile phone
[00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:40.380]   wasn't necessary and then eventually they became more capable and more important and
[00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:44.740]   now for a lot of people they're primary computing devices and the watch might never be anything
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:48.780]   but it could also be something that eventually becomes capable enough that we leave our phone
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:52.660]   at home and we have a little earpiece and we have the watch on our wrist and that becomes
[00:55:52.660 --> 00:55:56.580]   what we use as our primary computing device because it can project into our car and onto
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:59.260]   our fridge and into our TV and it's small enough.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.260]   It's powerful.
[00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:01.260]   It's just small.
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:04.180]   So, I think Apple's well, it's good that these companies are positioning themselves
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:05.820]   for that kind of technology.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:09.540]   I think it's a little bit different in that once you have a smart watch on your wrist that's
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:13.500]   designed really well, you appreciate that this doesn't have to be a smaller version of a
[00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.500]   phone.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:16.900]   This really can be its own classic computer device.
[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:23.500]   That's why I'm very interested in the software that iOS developers come up with to use this
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.380]   as an adjunct to these phones.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:30.860]   It really does look as though the more I look at the developer resources for the Apple Watch,
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:36.540]   the more I see that there's a much bigger canvas even now in its limited state than Android
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.620]   Wear is where it's a big fan of Android Wear.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:44.740]   I recommend them to people who already have Android phones, but it seems as though there
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.580]   was a very deliberate choice that look, this is not going to be a device that's going to
[00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:49.300]   be your primary computing device.
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:53.180]   Even in the two hours that you leave your phone at home, this is designed to be a way
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:57.500]   to enhance the phone experience.
[00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:01.180]   It's going to be really interesting to see the class of devices that come out from this.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.140]   It's not going to be people who are going to be convinced that I need a watch.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:08.900]   It's going to be someone who has a spouse or a kid or a co-worker who has one of these
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:09.900]   watches.
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:12.980]   Then they suddenly realized, "Hey, why did you just have to walk up to your car and open
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:13.980]   it?"
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.980]   "Well, because my watch does that."
[00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.900]   "Oh, how come you didn't have to take out the whole because my watch does that for me?"
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:21.900]   That's when you start thinking, "Well, I've got $350 and I'm going to make another $350
[00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:22.900]   pretty soon.
[00:57:22.900 --> 00:57:26.180]   Why don't I just spend $350 on a watch?"
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.020]   All right.
[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:29.020]   We'll see.
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:38.660]   We'll find out soon if 5.5 million is enough to avoid lines or if there's a prediction strain
[00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:39.660]   constraint.
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:40.660]   Constrained?
[00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:41.660]   Is it constrained?
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:42.660]   Constrained?
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:43.660]   It's constrained?
[00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:44.980]   All three of you agree.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:45.980]   Constrained.
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:49.700]   I think they want to make sure that they got watches for people who want to come in and
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:54.980]   buy watches because they need to have that huge number in the first weekend that they
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.620]   put into a press release.
[00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:59.100]   But then they're trying to find that sweet spot between.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:05.860]   At some point, we need somebody to start a website telling them where there's a watch
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:10.060]   available for purchase somewhere because that definitely enhances what they're trying
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.460]   to comment with that watch.
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:19.140]   If you look at, I think the rate last year was $720,000, Android wearables.
[00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.140]   Since launch?
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.140]   That was $720,000.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.140]   Yes, since launch.
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:25.140]   Since launch.
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:31.340]   If Apple, let's just say Apple comes out of the gate at $500,000 or a million in the
[00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:35.300]   first week, it's going to be a crushing blow to a lot of people who have been trying to
[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.660]   get ahead of them.
[00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:40.820]   I think that's the thing that, and I think they have a pretty good chance of doing that.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:45.060]   See, the thing is that Apple has the biggest advantage above everything else that Apple
[00:58:45.060 --> 00:58:52.540]   has over Android wear is that almost every phone that's in hands right now is capable.
[00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:57.380]   So many phones that are iPhones are in hands right now are going to be able to use an Apple
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.380]   watch.
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:03.460]   Whereas Android has never been, everybody gets the latest operating system at the same
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:04.460]   time.
[00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:06.980]   You need a modern version of Android in order to make it work.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:11.140]   And a lot of people are still happy and content to have older phones or they're stuck with
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:13.860]   these phones that have not been updated by their carriers yet.
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:19.100]   So I don't know to what extent that that's that that that interferes with our ability
[00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:21.980]   to sense how big a success or failure Android wear is.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.900]   But it definitely says this is just another example of Apple putting together an entire
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:30.620]   system of hardware so that whenever they want to execute something, they can just do
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:35.860]   that instantaneously because everybody's work running on common reference platform
[00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:36.860]   hardware.
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.980]   Everybody's running almost the exact same same operating system so they can just deploy
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:43.980]   and that will not be a barrier in any way, shape or form.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:44.980]   Here's something that actually helps you.
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:45.980]   There's no connection to Android wear.
[00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:47.980]   I mean, I hope it might.
[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:48.980]   It might.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.340]   Because people only works with iPhones.
[00:59:50.340 --> 00:59:53.060]   So if you don't have an iPhone and some of your friends getting watches, you're going
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.620]   to go, you might want to go buy a watch.
[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:58.580]   You know what's really interesting is that Android wear watches are all the same.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.380]   It's styling and design is the only difference in Android wear.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.540]   I know we're starting to see some interesting styling and design.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.540]   That's interesting point too.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.980]   What if what if you just look at the Apple watch you're saying just reminds you of the
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:14.540]   Casio that I stopped wearing in high school in nineteen nineteen eighty eight.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.900]   That's the only design that they have available.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.340]   Whereas every two or three months, there's another interesting Android wear design, whether
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.460]   it's square around or rounded corners or something like that.
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:27.980]   It's just an interesting broad topic with so many different facets to it.
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:32.740]   There are some numbers thanks to iPad 77703 in the chat room.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.900]   This is from watch seek.com.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:39.620]   Their forums, somebody's put together annual production numbers from twenty ten.
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.500]   The biggest is T so two million a year.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:45.740]   This puts five and a half million in some perspective.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:48.300]   Rolex sells a million a year.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.140]   Omega seven hundred thousand a year.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:51.940]   Togg Hoyer seven hundred thousand.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:58.420]   Gene five hundred thousand and then it goes down from their Cartier about a hundred thousand
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:01.140]   Piaget twenty thousand.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.700]   Glass Hoot less than ten thousand.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.260]   A long which I love those beautiful a long ass watches.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.780]   They only sell about two thousand of those a year course when they cost a hundred thousand
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:10.780]   dollars each.
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.780]   That's still a good piece of change.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.540]   You compare it with that or you compare it with iPod sales like this.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:16.540]   What was an iPod right?
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.540]   Right.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.540]   I'm selling.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:23.620]   One of you have a watch maker five and a half million for day one is a large number.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:24.620]   Yes.
[01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:28.620]   Also, Omega Omega will be doing very well if they were the only manufacturer of time pieces
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:29.620]   anywhere.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:30.620]   Right.
[01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.620]   And that's a lot more competition.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:32.620]   Right.
[01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:33.620]   Right.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.620]   Right.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.620]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.620]   If you add this all up, it's more than five and a half.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:37.620]   It also they don't include like Cassio.
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.620]   It doesn't.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.620]   They're also.
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:40.620]   These are the high end.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.420]   I watch people who just want to watch the ability to buy a swatch.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.620]   They have the ability to buy a Cassio.
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:46.700]   I don't it's interesting data point.
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:48.300]   I wasn't familiar with that.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.300]   Those kind of numbers.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:54.940]   But it's I think that it's hard for I think I think it's hard for us to imagine this not
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:02:00.700]   selling this selling in wristwatch numbers as opposed to apple device numbers and apple
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.700]   device numbers.
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:03.540]   Even the failures are staggering.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.100]   So I I think that's a good number.
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.100]   Five or six million.
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.620]   So the high end watches were if you do the math, it works out to eight hundred thousand
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.100]   of the gold watches, which is not that dissimilar from what the higher end watches are.
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.260]   The swatch group is publicly held.
[01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:19.580]   So we can in fact look at their results.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.700]   The results last year.
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:25.140]   Gross sales of nine point seven billion dollars.
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.020]   So I think that's more than a few hundred watches.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.900]   I know I'm trying to find the number of watches.
[01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.780]   I don't know if they've published that, but yeah, you're talking millions, millions and
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:39.900]   millions of watches easily because a swatch is like 30 bucks.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.780]   Actually swatches a bunch of brands, some of which are expensive.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:43.780]   Let's take a break.
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:44.780]   Come back with more.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:50.660]   We'll talk about apps and some great games with no in app purchases coming up as we continue
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.660]   with Mac break weekly.
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:56.700]   Andy and I go to the Chicago Sun times Renee Richie from i'm war.com Alex Lindsey from
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:00.660]   Pittsburgh in the snow.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:02.460]   All behind me, right?
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:03.460]   From the planet.
[01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:05.020]   I'm going to dig a tunnel to get out.
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:08.300]   Did you get as much snow in Pittsburgh as Andy gotten in Boston?
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.220]   No, no, we just got cold.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.220]   We got a little snow here and there.
[01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:15.260]   I mean, there's some slushy weather and so on and so forth or not slushy, but a lot, you
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:18.020]   know, two or three inches of snow, but nothing major.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.500]   It was mostly that it got down into the it stayed.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.620]   It got below zero Fahrenheit and stayed there for an extended period of time, which we're
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.020]   not kind of not used to down here.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:30.100]   I'm Renee looking at me like, yeah, whatever that was last week.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.860]   We haven't gotten any snow this weekend.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.780]   Andy took the big like he just like Kevin Costner in the bodyguard.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:35.780]   He jumped in front of it.
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:36.940]   They've got so much snow.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.940]   They're dumping it in the bay.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.180]   You're not really noise me that the I did or I they were.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.980]   They're having to change the route for lack of snow.
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:49.460]   OK, New England is a better dog sledding course than the Yukon is right now.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:53.020]   That's just that's just being a jerk about this weather force field.
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.380]   I don't know what happened.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.540]   We had dogs letting last weekend.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.140]   They brought the dogs over to the park and they were doing dogs letting it was just.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.180]   All I know is I'm about to play to get in a hotel room.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.980]   Someplace warm like Delaware.
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:07.180]   It's our show today brought to you.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.140]   Actually, this would be good for you, Andy, by Blue Apron.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:12.860]   You can why go shopping when you can have the food brought to you.
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:14.300]   You still get to cook it.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.300]   That guy.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.740]   Rist is live to deliver me a case of canned beans.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   Exactly.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.180]   That's our I don't need to have a bet.
[01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:24.140]   You're trying to make someone deliver.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.540]   Let me ask you this.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:30.340]   Let me ask you this does FedEx does us UPS do you still get deliveries?
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.860]   They are surprisingly really good about these deliveries.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.620]   I have to I have to I can't travel every single morning, but I have to keep everything out
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:40.300]   of courtesy. I have to keep everything nicely salted and said because.
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:44.580]   So tomorrow there could be a blue effect of let's send him a blue apron box so that
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:45.580]   you have it now.
[01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.340]   Now this is kind of super flaky.
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:48.340]   We need protein protein.
[01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.340]   Yeah, protein.
[01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.340]   No, we'll give you protein.
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:56.140]   This is just superfluous because these boxes are refrigerated, but I guess, you know, in
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:00.940]   this case, they'll be keeping the stuff from freezing.
[01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:01.780]   Really a great idea.
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:05.820]   If you love to cook or you'd like to learn to cook, but you don't have time or the inclination
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:07.980]   to shop blue apron does it for you.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:13.780]   They send you for less than $10 a meal, fresh ingredients, perfectly proportioned, even
[01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:18.720]   the salt and pepper you need step by step recipe instructions, including beautifully
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720]   printed pictures.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.540]   You know exactly what you're doing.
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.580]   It's like a cooking class in a box.
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:30.820]   You'll be making cooking, making and cooking healthy meals in half an hour in your home.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:35.220]   You'll love it without a single trip to the grocery store and no waste from unused ingredients.
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:36.220]   Pretty great for date night.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:39.700]   If you want to impress her for cooking with friends, they have family plans with kid friendly
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:40.700]   ingredients.
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.940]   So the whole family can eat well and have fun preparing meals together.
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.700]   Every balanced meal about five to 700 calories a serving.
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:51.500]   So it's so yummy you'd never know half an hour cooking shipping is free menus or new.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.260]   You'll never get the same meal twice.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:58.260]   And what meals Chinese five spice beef stir fry with noodles?
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:01.900]   Orange or barley, jambalaya jambalaya for its Mardi Gras.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:05.500]   That Tuesday today, we got a goal.
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:10.860]   Jambalaya go to blueapering.com/twit right now.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:13.540]   Find out what the what's on the menu this week.

[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:22.260]   Oh, look at those crispy chicken thighs.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:25.780]   Oh, this looks so good.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:27.500]   Delicious healthy meals.
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.060]   And you know, I have to say when you when you're doing it yourself, you may not make
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:31.060]   such a great dish.
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.060]   You might just make it.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.660]   I might just boil those chicken thighs in the oven.
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.660]   No, no, let's make it something special tonight.
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:38.660]   Blueapering.
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:43.340]   Blueapering.com/twit.
[01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:46.100]   We can talk about beats for a little bit more rumors here.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.460]   Well, this is this is a fact because he announced it.
[01:06:49.460 --> 01:06:58.780]   The very famous BBC radio one DJ, Zane Lowe is leaving his radio gig and going to Cupertino.
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.020]   His last show is March 5th.
[01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.780]   What will he be doing?
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.740]   Well, DJing a cafe max.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.380]   I think it's not.
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:10.300]   In fact, DJing a cafe max.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:16.100]   He probably I would think would be one of the curators of the new beats music, right?
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.700]   Any rumors about when we're going to see that?
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:22.940]   Is it going to be iOS 8 iOS 8.2 that we'll see beats 8.4?
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:23.940]   Four.
[01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:24.940]   Maybe.
[01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.740]   8.2 was the watch stuff.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.180]   8.3 is the iOS.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:30.180]   He stuff.
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.180]   8.4 is around.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.780]   They're taking their time, huh?
[01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:37.980]   Well, I mean, so they had a plan going with the iTunes radio.
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:41.500]   iTunes radio was going to go international and then it went to America and Australia
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:42.940]   and then it stopped.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:46.100]   And what happened, you know, it's hard to imagine that Apple bought beats and suddenly
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.340]   all the plans they had for iTunes had to change because now they have these different
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.340]   services.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.340]   So I think that's why last year we really didn't see much from beat from iTunes.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.620]   We didn't see any of the new TV or movie stuff.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.300]   We didn't see any continuity stuff for media.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.660]   We didn't really hear anything.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.500]   I don't know if I don't remember if Eddie Q took stage for anything other than I work
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.020]   last year.
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.180]   And you know, now they've had a year of working with all the beats people and they're starting
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:08.380]   to integrate it.
[01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:12.780]   And I mean, whether they get it done in time for now or WWDC or, you know, for the next
[01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.980]   iPhone release, it seems almost certain they're going to, they're going to put something
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.420]   out at this point.
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:21.540]   We talked last week about the Clive Davis Grammy party, right?
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:22.540]   We talk about that.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.700]   Oh, I don't think we did.
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:31.940]   Because it was a Grammys where a week ago Sunday, Clive Davis hosts a very famous pre-Grammy
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:32.940]   party.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:33.940]   Tim Cook was there.
[01:08:33.940 --> 01:08:35.140]   Eddie Q was there.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:42.060]   Jimmy Iovine was there sitting next to Al Gore, who was on the Apple board, I might add.
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:49.500]   Clive Davis record legend called Tim Cook, a special human.
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.540]   That's very Jerry Lewis.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:53.620]   This is a special, special man.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:59.400]   Music executives lined up single file for an audience with the Apple contingent, not
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:04.700]   to mention selfies and overshares about their first Mac, according to Billboard magazine.
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.580]   Cookies, Tim Cook selfies.
[01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.540]   Tim Cook selfies are called cookies.
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.540]   Yes, I like that.
[01:09:11.540 --> 01:09:14.940]   Well, because Timmy is taken at the Grammys.
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:20.020]   Eddie Q played the go between greeting music label executives and asking, have you already
[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:22.540]   met with Jimmy?
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:26.460]   So I think there's a little deal making going on here.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:31.140]   Clearly the labels are interested because the labels want to make more.
[01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:33.500]   Never mind the artists.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.700]   I'll show you the labels.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:35.700]   I'll show you the labels.
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:39.300]   And the great tradition of the music industry, screw the artists.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:44.740]   I think Iovine also, what he brings also is a little bit of insider grit to it that Apple
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:48.140]   may have a hard time from the outside, but he can say as someone who's already created
[01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:50.940]   a record company is that I can do that again.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:54.060]   Like you don't want me, what you want to do is you want to set up a deal with us with
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:55.060]   Pete's.
[01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:57.940]   You don't want Apple to decide that it has to go into the music industry because if we
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:00.820]   go into the music industry, none of you will be like, oh, I don't think he's threatening
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:01.820]   them.
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.220]   I bet you that I bet you it may not be that clear, but I bet you people are talking about
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.220]   it.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:11.980]   Billboard says I have been meaning face to face with senior execs from the major labels
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:24.340]   and indies about a quote, all you can eat music service with a modest subscription fee.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:27.900]   And quote, which is what they've all complained about.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.900]   I mean, that's what they're saying.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.900]   Wait, they're right.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:30.900]   No, go ahead, Andy.
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:32.900]   I feel like they're revamping music the same way they're going to they're playing to revamp
[01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:33.900]   photos, where it's not just we're going to come up with a new app.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:34.900]   No, we're going to have the new cloud services.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:38.420]   No, we're we are tearing everything down to bedrock and rebuilding it in a way that makes
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:40.340]   more sense for us in 2015.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:44.020]   And I bet that it looks like the sort of deal making is part of that too.
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:49.180]   Philip Elmer Dewitt who wrote this story for fortune and was on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.100]   This is his beep.
[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:53.340]   He said he's actually quoting Apple insiders Neil Hughes.
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:58.260]   He said that one of the things Apple's doing to make beats stand out, you know, really
[01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:02.420]   the problem beats had coming out of the box was it wasn't different, different enough
[01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:06.900]   from Spotify or RDO and all the other services that people were already subscribing to to
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:07.900]   get people to jump.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:12.900]   Only before Apple bottom had it, it's estimated around 110,000 subscribers.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:17.780]   But what they're focusing on now, according to Philip, is exclusivity.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:23.140]   A limited window of exclusivity for major new albums, let's say Taylor Swift's 1989,
[01:11:23.140 --> 01:11:25.660]   we'll have it on beats for the first month.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:28.180]   If you want to listen, you're going to have to have beats.
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:31.100]   That's the kind of thing I agree that they're going to have to do if they want to get people
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:33.260]   to subscribe to beats.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.300]   Even if it's a couple of bucks, even if it's seven bucks, I said it's ten bucks.
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.300]   I don't know if that's enough to get people to subscribe to beats.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:43.900]   Well, I think if there were big payoffs in those areas to do that, and Apple can afford
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:47.180]   to do that, you might see a Taylor Swift as a perfect example of someone who already
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:52.420]   pulled all of her stuff off of these networks, making a deal with Apple.
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:58.940]   That would be a big piece for Apple, is that for a limited amount of time or whatever,
[01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:03.460]   all of her stuff is going to be put on to that service.
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:07.980]   The danger for other networks is Apple has the money to do some pretty, get very aggressive
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:08.980]   about that.
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:13.540]   You don't need to pull very many headliners away before Spotify is not very valuable.
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:16.340]   Everyone talks about the long tail, but no one wants only the long tail.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.500]   That's what Billboard says.
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:22.020]   "Apple's goal is not to merely compete with Pandora, Spotify, an unnamed industry insider
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:26.260]   told Billboard, it is to be the music industry."
[01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:33.220]   They already have 75% with iTunes of music sales.
[01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.220]   Wow.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:38.740]   That's the subhead to all the news last week, before, about Apple having sent a profitable
[01:12:38.740 --> 01:12:44.100]   quarter and now being the first $3.25 trillion company.
[01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:49.540]   It's not just money that to fill up the money cribs that can drive in like Scrooge McDuck,
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:51.420]   it represents firepower.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.940]   It means that if they want a business, they can own it.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:58.940]   Instead of developing other companies have to cultivate something for five or six years,
[01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:02.340]   Apple is capable of saying, "Hey, great job cultivating this guy for five or six years.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:05.820]   We're going to quadruple his salary and give him the sexiest job in the world.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:10.220]   Good luck holding on to him at those rates."
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:18.140]   The only thing that gets me very curious about this sort of news is that I don't know if
[01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:22.980]   dealing with music this way is it's a great next two or three or five years solution.
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:27.380]   It's not a great next 10 years or 20 years solution because I'm very certain that the
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:34.940]   dream of the kid who has a garage band right now, 12, 13, 14 years old, mastering the same
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:38.940]   two and a half chords, is not to get a record deal with a major company.
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:44.180]   It's to develop their own fan base and have a lot of hits on YouTube and have a really
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:47.020]   good band camp presence.
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:51.460]   The question is, what are they doing to make sure that that kid is going to want to do
[01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:56.020]   business with Apple and make them the distributors of their music and connect them to their fans?
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:14:01.260]   Those kids are being invited to the Grammy, so they would still like to get assaulted
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:03.820]   with Tim Cook, but they're not going to invite them.
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:09.180]   One thing also, it'll be interesting to see how far they take the curation process.
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:11.660]   They've hired a very popular DJ.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:14.140]   They might probably bring out other folks to do it.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:18.940]   That's a top down approach, but I think that there's still a lot of opportunity for them
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:23.860]   to spread that out of it and make sure that tastemakers are actually making money as well.
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:28.060]   If they figured out a way to do that, that would energize that market a lot.
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:31.340]   People literally making money because lots of people are listening to their mixtapes,
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.340]   which people can download over.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:37.420]   That is, I don't, I maybe don't understand the music industry anymore, but certainly that
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.860]   was the role radio played.
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:45.100]   You had big name DJs, the Rodney Biggin-Himers of the world, who were tastemakers, but it
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:49.780]   seems like so much of a more of a fragmented business now.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.420]   Doesn't it seem like people listen to their friends?
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.420]   Certainly they don't listen to their radio.
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:56.020]   You're this is your area of expertise, Alex.
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.500]   You were a music director for years.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:03.740]   Yeah, well, I think that the issue is that they listen to their friends because they don't
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:05.940]   really listen to radio anymore.
[01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:09.820]   But I think that a lot of the time when you look at what Pandora hands you, it's generally
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:10.820]   crap.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:11.820]   I don't know.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:15.100]   I don't think Pandora is a good music discovery service.
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:19.020]   But I think that there are people who are innately good at seeing that.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.620]   And if you pick them and say, "I really want to follow what that person's doing," it may
[01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:24.700]   not be, I don't think necessarily needs to be a big name.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:29.100]   But I think that finding a way that you can have those kinds of people doing what they
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.500]   do best, which is pick music.
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.420]   And there was just, I had friends that did that.
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:35.660]   I mean, I was okay at it doing it for radio theatre.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:39.220]   Didn't Twitter try to capitalize on this with a hashtag music?
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:40.860]   Yeah, and it was a big failure.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:43.740]   Well, I think the problem is that no one's monetizing it.
[01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.220]   So the thing is that there's a lot of people that--
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:46.380]   There's no incentive to do it.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:47.660]   There's no incentive to do it.
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:54.540]   So the thing is that if people started making money on it, then they would--
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:15:58.580]   And they could start-- big stars would release more of their own playlists.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:01.060]   And those radio stars would.
[01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:02.820]   Ooh, silly at fees, yeah.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:03.820]   Yeah.
[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:04.820]   For anyone who buys songs off of them.
[01:16:04.820 --> 01:16:05.820]   Make a mix tape.
[01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:06.820]   Make a mix tape.
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:07.820]   They could do it.
[01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:08.820]   Absolutely.
[01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:13.220]   But that type of business model where the people who are making those mixes and building
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.780]   up followers because people like what they--
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:19.100]   I think some of us are old enough to remember Rockover, London.
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:22.380]   And we used to listen to that every-- I used to listen to it every Sunday.
[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:23.380]   To find out--
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:28.820]   There are podcasts right now that recommend music.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:29.820]   And those podcasts--
[01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:30.820]   Are those play the music?
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:31.820]   Right.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:36.220]   You know, so part of this is tying the technology together because you have this technology where
[01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.060]   everyone can listen to the music for free and then you have people who want to talk about
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:41.060]   it.
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.580]   And the key is how do I make, for instance, maybe a playlist where I can talk about some
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:46.900]   of the stuff in between or I can tell you what that is.
[01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:50.500]   And I'm making some money on the fact that you're listening to it through my playlist.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:51.500]   But I can also play the music.
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.780]   Right now, the podcasts that talk about music can't play the music because that would be,
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:56.420]   you know, against copyright and stupid.
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:59.380]   So a couple of data points here.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.580]   Nobody over 30 cares about music discovery.
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:04.780]   They already decided what they're going to listen to for the rest of their lives.
[01:17:04.780 --> 01:17:06.180]   I don't think so.
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:08.900]   I think that's the vast majority.
[01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:13.860]   Maybe there are few people like you guys who are always looking for new music.
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.780]   But I think the vast majority of people over 30 already know what they like.
[01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:17.780]   And that's it.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.660]   Well, maybe that's maybe that's an opportunity though.
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:23.620]   I don't think so much that we're not interested in new music.
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:26.260]   It's that we are no longer in social.
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:27.980]   We're no longer going to clubs.
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:29.100]   We're no longer listening to the radio.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:32.140]   We even even we still have the same desire for new things.
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:35.780]   But now it's just our normal outlets have been expired.
[01:17:35.780 --> 01:17:39.380]   But if you give us a new, but we have jobs and we have money.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:44.660]   And so if you give us a new way of exploring and discovering music, like I bought so many
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:49.460]   there's so many tracks that I buy off of the after the day after the the AMAs or the
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:53.300]   Grammy Awards, because this is the first time I've heard this song.
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:56.220]   It's for an audience that is easily 20 years younger than me.
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:00.820]   But man, I've not been able to get that song out of my head and boom, I buy it immediately.
[01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:01.820]   All right.
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:02.820]   All right.
[01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:06.540]   We'll say it's arguably I think it's still the vast majority of people over 30 don't
[01:18:06.540 --> 01:18:08.140]   aren't looking for music discovery.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:12.940]   But the people under 30 who are looking for music discovery, where do they go?
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:15.380]   They go to their friends, right?
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:19.100]   Well, I mean, I look at my son and he's sitting there with his friends.
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.820]   They get most of their music from YouTube of all places.
[01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:25.700]   And then they kind of what to listen to next.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:30.060]   I guess I would argue that's because the system by which we've we learn this stuff is so inefficient.
[01:18:30.060 --> 01:18:33.580]   That's the most efficient way to do it, which is not a very good way to do it necessarily.
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:36.340]   I mean, it's reasonable because you and you you'll learn from your friends.
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:38.980]   I mean, I learned a lot of the music that I listen to because I mean, I the only reason
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.540]   I knew XTC was because my cousin listened to it.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:42.540]   You know, and so.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:43.540]   So friends and family.
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.740]   I'll include friends and family, right?
[01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:49.620]   But I think that finding more efficient ways to do that and more efficient ways to find
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:52.580]   that music is something that people would do if they could do it well.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.580]   It's just that no one's doing it very well.
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:56.220]   I think that is the that's the real issue.
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.380]   We don't want to listen to radio.
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:58.620]   We don't want to listen to.
[01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:00.060]   I mean, Pandora is fine.
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.060]   I mean, my brother listens.
[01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:02.420]   I think it was Pandora all day.
[01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:06.340]   I mean, some people find that the discovery they're willing to sit through a lot of crap
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:09.100]   to get to the songs that are new and interesting.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:12.500]   But I think that there but there's a lot of ways that I think we can improve that.
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.900]   And part of that is having people making money who are the tastemakers.
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:19.900]   And I think that's across video, across audio across music.
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:24.580]   We're when we take radio out of this, when we take broadcast TV out of it on finding some
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:27.900]   of these things, but especially radio, you got right now there's a vacuum.
[01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:31.060]   There's no way to find that because we're not listening to radio anymore.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:37.180]   And so how do you, in filling that vacuum, eventually is going to cost money to do that.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:40.300]   And it may just be a shave of what people are already bringing back to the artist or
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:42.820]   the label or the company.
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.820]   But until we do that, we won't see a huge explosion in that area.
[01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:50.540]   So you all agree there's a green field for Apple here in music discovery.
[01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:51.540]   So many green fields.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.220]   That's a little time.
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:55.860]   That's my favorite song, "Green Sleeves."
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:58.660]   That was a great song.
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.500]   So easy to play on the recorder.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:02.620]   I have to admit though, and I'm just getting old.
[01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:05.660]   And by the way, there's about a thousand people in the chair and say, "No, Leo, you're
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:06.660]   wrong.
[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:09.540]   I'm over 50 and I'm still discovering new music."
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.540]   But I listen to the Grammys.
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:15.980]   Have you heard of this young book, the book, the song is called Bon Jovi.
[01:20:15.980 --> 01:20:16.980]   Bon Jovi.
[01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:17.980]   That can't pop me right?
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:18.980]   Bon Jovi.
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:19.980]   Isn't it Bon Jovi?
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:20.980]   He's got it.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:21.980]   Yeah.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.180]   And I listen to the music and I go, "What's wrong with you kids?"
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:25.180]   That's not music.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:26.180]   That's noise.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:27.180]   That's noise.
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:28.180]   Oh, to the hair, the music.
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:29.180]   Don't get me stoned.
[01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:33.220]   Short stories real quick before we get to our picks of the week.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:37.020]   Apple has banned bonded servitude at supplier factories worldwide.
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.020]   Good for you.
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.260]   Good for you, Apple.
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:42.620]   Isn't that special?
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:48.060]   It's actually hard for Apple to control the employment practices at supplier factories.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:56.860]   We saw that a horrific article about recruiters getting people from small villages and they
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:00.980]   owe so much money to the recruiters that they can't quit.
[01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:02.700]   It's just a nightmare.
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.060]   That's not usually at the factories making the iPhones.
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.700]   It's the factory making the parts for the iPhones.
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:09.540]   But Apple says no more.
[01:21:09.540 --> 01:21:14.460]   They made some rules about the company pays the recruitment bonus, not the people.
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:15.460]   So forth.
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:22.060]   Apple's building an $848 million solar farm in Monterey.
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:23.820]   This is actually, Google's doing the same thing.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:30.060]   All of these big companies now basically want to be carbon neutral.
[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:34.980]   Apple will get electricity from the farm at a fixed rate for 25 years.
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:37.940]   The power they're getting from the farm according to Tim Cook is enough to power Apple's new
[01:21:37.940 --> 01:21:39.140]   campus.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:43.860]   It's existing California offices and all of its California retail stores.
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:47.300]   Generally the way this stuff works is it's not the actual power from the farm.
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:49.820]   They get credits, which they then apply.
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.340]   But I don't know how this is going to work.
[01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:54.180]   You had a busy week, he was at Goldman Sachs and then he was at the White House Summit
[01:21:54.180 --> 01:21:55.620]   on Cybersecurity.
[01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:56.620]   We could talk about that too.
[01:21:56.620 --> 01:22:01.740]   So yeah, that statement on the solar thing was for Goldman Sachs.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:07.500]   Tim Cook challenges Obama with an impassioned stand on privacy.
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.460]   Just watch.
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:16.900]   People have entrusted us with their most personal and precious information.
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:25.980]   We owe them nothing less than the best protections that we can possibly provide.
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:32.780]   By harnessing the technology at our disposal and working together as businesses, governments
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:41.460]   and citizens, we believe we can bring about a future that fully embraces both privacy
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:44.740]   and security.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:49.820]   We must get this right.
[01:22:49.820 --> 01:22:59.900]   History has shown us that sacrificing our right to privacy can have dire consequences.
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:08.420]   We still live in a world where all people are not treated equally.
[01:23:08.420 --> 01:23:19.220]   Too many people do not feel free to practice their religion or express their opinion or
[01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:25.380]   love who they choose or love who they choose.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:27.260]   You can say that twice.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:35.940]   A world in which that information can make the difference between life and death.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:38.940]   I'm going to interrupt.
[01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.740]   Is that his cadence?
[01:23:40.740 --> 01:23:42.340]   It makes it feel like it was four minutes.
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.260]   It's his gravitas.
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:47.660]   There's another 45 seconds.
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:50.260]   I'm sure it's more of the same.
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:51.260]   It's interesting to hear him.
[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.060]   Nobody is saying this in the US government.
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:58.740]   Call for privacy and security for other people outside the United States.
[01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:03.500]   It's pretty much accepted that only people in America should have privacy and security
[01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:09.180]   and that the NSA could spy anybody who wants outside our shores.
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:14.180]   You say that as Canadian.
[01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:16.580]   It's just too bad that sort of stuff is necessary.
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:20.140]   It's not just altruism that's powering those out of statements.
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.980]   The government is really putting a lot of pressure on every device manufacturer and every
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:28.340]   software manufacturer to say that, look, if we need access to people we're interested
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:32.100]   in through a device that you made, you're going to give us access to that device.
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:38.060]   Some of these programs are way just incredibly aggressive about it.
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:39.540]   Not just simply will file paperwork.
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:44.020]   It's like, no, you have an absolute responsibility to be our conduit to people that we're interested
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.020]   in.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:49.780]   And there are even companies as big as Apple are finding themselves facing a possibility
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:51.580]   where they can't fight this sort of stuff.
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:56.620]   So they really have to make sure that they have the support of the public behind them.
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:59.180]   So you're going to give the support of the government.
[01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:05.500]   I got to say, I mean, Obama talking to a care swisher at recode reiterated his desire to
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:08.740]   have encryption and said, we should all have encryption.
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:12.140]   But that's speaking out of one side of his mouth because at the same time as the United
[01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:19.100]   States is paying lip service to privacy and encryption, they're pushing harder and harder
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:22.340]   for private companies to cooperate.
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:29.140]   As we just learned, they're doing black hat operations all over the world spying on everybody
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:33.140]   they can intercepting Cisco routers in the mail to corrupt them.
[01:25:33.140 --> 01:25:40.020]   It was a news item at the end of state developing new intercepting firmware for hard drive
[01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:46.500]   controllers so that they can write malware that actually lives inside the controller itself.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:47.500]   And that's incredible.
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:54.140]   Well, and that's the same time as the is the the the spokespeople for the US government,
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:58.500]   including the president, are paying lip service to privacy and security.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:02.700]   But Tim Cook is really saying is we got to do this and it ain't going to come from the
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:03.700]   US government.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.220]   They're not doing it.
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:06.740]   He said it was life and death.
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:10.580]   And he's saying it's life and death not just for US citizens but for the world.
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:15.020]   I think that there's a culture there's a clash here coming.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.500]   I respect what Tim saying.
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:17.500]   I think he's right.
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.140]   But do you think he's going to be able to do it?
[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.660]   Oh, I think that he doesn't have to go ahead.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:22.660]   Go ahead.
[01:26:22.660 --> 01:26:25.980]   I'm going to say I'm happy that the CEO of the most richest and one of the most powerful
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:28.100]   companies in the world is deciding to litigate this matter.
[01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:29.100]   I agree.
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:33.500]   Well, and I think that one of the things that's interesting is that he doesn't have to in
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:35.380]   some ways he doesn't have to win.
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:38.700]   What Apple's doing and what Google's doing and a lot of Microsoft's doing is they're
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:42.500]   basically rather than saying you can, you know, there's a backdoor that will give you
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:44.540]   they're cutting off all the cords.
[01:26:44.540 --> 01:26:47.500]   You know, they're saying we're cutting away our ability to go do that.
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:50.100]   It doesn't matter whether you give us a court order or not.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:52.100]   We have no access to those keys.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:56.300]   You know, so they're really jettisoning the ability to do it, not just so that they can't
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:57.580]   be compelled.
[01:26:57.580 --> 01:27:02.180]   What that leaves the government with is the the government has to now pass laws.
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:07.940]   They have to pass regulations that are going to compel apple to put those keys back in.
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:11.380]   And that is a much harder road for the government.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:15.460]   And so the government doesn't want apple to keep on cutting these because they know that,
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:18.620]   you know, if they looked at the soap of debate, if they look at these things that they're
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:23.500]   not going to get that past, you know, that's the issue is is that they're going to unless
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:26.740]   they will get it passed if there's a huge terrorist act in the United States.
[01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:32.900]   The barring another 9/11, they are not going to get even interest by the American public
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:36.220]   and they'll have enough people rise up against any kind of legislation.
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:40.140]   And so the what they're upset about is that is that they were able to quietly do this before
[01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:44.300]   apple and Google and Microsoft got smart and now are cutting all the cords so that they
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.500]   can't even get into the back end.
[01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:51.060]   And that that makes it a very, very uphill battle for the government to get back in.
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:55.060]   I maybe I'm a cynic.
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:28:00.740]   I just feel like apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook are going to say anything they can
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:04.900]   to reassure their customers that they're protecting their privacy.
[01:28:04.900 --> 01:28:10.620]   But the behind the scenes, they either can or won't do that that.
[01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.060]   I don't I don't agree with that.
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:19.100]   You think they're doing their aspect especially especially apple because apple has is they're
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:23.500]   not struggling in any way but they need to make sure that they can maintain their ability
[01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:27.380]   to do exactly what they want to do and maintain a difference between owning an iPhone and
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.860]   owning other devices.
[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:32.060]   And with a great deal of credibility, they say that look, we are the company that's not
[01:28:32.060 --> 01:28:33.260]   collecting data on you.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:36.540]   We don't care what you do with our phones as long as you pay us for them.
[01:28:36.540 --> 01:28:42.980]   And so if they lose the ability to control the destiny of their own hardware, they lose
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:45.020]   a big big advantage.
[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:50.020]   Not only in business terms but in their own desire to make the products they want to make.
[01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:53.540]   So I also I also believe that Google is sincere about that and I believe that Microsoft is
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:54.540]   sincere about that.
[01:28:54.540 --> 01:28:59.780]   But apple is the one company that I would not ever consider would say that sort of thing
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:03.580]   publicly and then behind the scenes saying, no, no, whatever you guys want to do.
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:06.980]   You want to find out who's if you want to get sexy pics of the card to add things off
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.140]   their phone, we're going to help you do that TMZ.
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:14.740]   Well, and apple has a they have a as Andy said, it's it's one of the things that differentiates
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:15.740]   them.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:19.380]   You know, Google makes money on and Facebook makes money on looking at what people are
[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:20.380]   doing.
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:22.540]   Apple doesn't make money on that right now.
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:26.780]   And and I think that the advantage there is they say, we don't have a dog in this, you
[01:29:26.780 --> 01:29:28.420]   know, in this show.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:33.740]   So we can push ultimate privacy if we want to.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:35.500]   And I think they have more of a reason to do that.
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:39.660]   And it's cleaner because Google and Facebook, of course, want to track certain things about
[01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:41.060]   you that the government wants.
[01:29:41.060 --> 01:29:43.900]   So the government wants the information that they're tracking for advertising.
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:47.340]   The government may want it for other things to figure things out where apple can say,
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.340]   well, we're not interested in that.
[01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:51.820]   And we'll, you know, we're willing to close that all off to protect you.
[01:29:51.820 --> 01:29:52.820]   And that's a differentiation.
[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:54.860]   There's certain population that wants that.
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:57.500]   I'm not sure I believe it.
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.180]   I know I know it's good for business.
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:00.180]   We need syndics, though, Leo.
[01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:01.700]   That's a new keep us honest.
[01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:08.740]   Yeah, I just I again, it's I don't know if it's because they don't they they won't or
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:11.780]   they can't resist the US government.
[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:15.820]   But I feel that in public, they're going to all of these companies are going to be very
[01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:16.820]   public.
[01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:20.620]   They're protestations that they are protecting our privacy and behind the scenes, they're
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:22.780]   going to just do whatever they have to do.
[01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:24.540]   I don't think they even have a choice.
[01:30:24.540 --> 01:30:29.300]   I think that well, we already seeing like canary clauses on websites and they're they're
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:32.720]   happening more and more often where they're not allowed to tell somebody that they're
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.880]   complying with the government.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:36.980]   But so long as they're not they can put a clause saying, Hey, we're not complying with
[01:30:36.980 --> 01:30:37.980]   the government.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:42.180]   And then like if four months later there is no this clause has been removed, they have
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:45.860]   been able to tell their users by the way, we are wired.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:49.740]   Don't be careful what you're talking about without having to announce that sort of stuff.
[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:52.020]   There really is a lot of pushback from companies.
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:53.820]   Excuse me, pushback from companies.
[01:30:53.820 --> 01:30:57.540]   So long as they're not telecommunications companies because AT&T and Verizon, all these
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:59.820]   companies are perfectly happy to help with it appears.
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:01.260]   That's the weakest point.
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:04.020]   Well, you know, there's there's two sides of this.
[01:31:04.020 --> 01:31:09.300]   On the one side, I think that customers would be very perturbed if they found out that Apple
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:13.140]   or Microsoft said, we're going to protect your privacy and didn't.
[01:31:13.140 --> 01:31:19.700]   On the other hand, the minute there's a terrorist attack on our shores and and and one company
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:21.260]   gets the blame for it.
[01:31:21.260 --> 01:31:26.780]   We would have known about this, but we couldn't decrypt the iMessage is that's bad.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:29.020]   They're already flying the pedophilia flag for that.
[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:31.020]   I mean, that's that go to for you.
[01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:32.020]   You're right.
[01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:33.020]   It's easier.
[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:36.260]   I yes, let's stay skeptical.
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:39.660]   But I, you know, I hope that's good verify.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.100]   I feel like Tim Cook's telling the truth.
[01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:42.100]   I don't feel like he's lying.
[01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:44.540]   I'm not saying that Andy, but I'm just saying I don't.
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:47.860]   I think that's what every company wants wants to be like.
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:51.020]   I don't know if there is that way.
[01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.940]   Apple has increased the maximum map size from two gigs to four gigs.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:56.860]   Good news for your massive texture maps.
[01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:57.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.860]   Is that a strong enough to run it?
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:32:01.860 --> 01:32:06.500]   Step authentication now is slowly creeping through the Apple world now FaceTime and iMessage
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:08.140]   is good news.
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:11.620]   Will if you've turned on two step, we'll require it.
[01:32:11.620 --> 01:32:13.100]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.820]   That's two step is not biometric yet.
[01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:15.820]   Is that correct?
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:21.860]   No, it's yet to token that gets sent to your phone either over find my iPhone or over text.
[01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:24.820]   I keep trying to turn it on.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:25.900]   How do you turn it on?
[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:28.140]   You go to your Apple ID page.
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:29.140]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:31.140]   I forgot dot apple.com.
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:33.900]   You can get there from that.
[01:32:33.900 --> 01:32:36.900]   Even if you didn't forget, you can get there.
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:37.980]   And then you can turn on two.
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:42.100]   I feel like I was like waiting for an email saying, okay, you did.
[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:45.020]   If you make other changes at the same time, they make you wait a couple days because that's
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:46.020]   what it was.
[01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:48.540]   I don't want somebody to hijack your account and then immediately go and walk you out of
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:49.540]   it.
[01:32:49.540 --> 01:32:50.540]   That's what happens.
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:53.580]   I couldn't do it then because I had just changed something.
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:54.580]   Okay.
[01:32:54.580 --> 01:33:00.900]   So, I probably could now go to my apple ID and manage it.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:04.820]   Change preferences as this would be it, right?
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:06.820]   Sign in, close your eyes.
[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:11.180]   Well, I sign into my iCloud account.
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:15.900]   And now where do we password insecurity?
[01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:19.900]   Then you have to ask some questions, answer some questions, which I don't remember the
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:20.900]   answers to.
[01:33:20.900 --> 01:33:21.900]   All right.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:25.020]   And a two-factor gets rid of those two steps.
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.020]   I know.
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:27.020]   I know.
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:28.020]   That's the problem.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:30.300]   Oh, you can reset it.
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:31.300]   I see here.
[01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:34.700]   Forgot your answers to send a reset security info email to your address.
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:35.700]   All right.
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:36.700]   So do that, folks.
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:37.700]   Turn it on.
[01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:40.740]   You could never have guessed when we were eight or nine years old that the name we chose
[01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:44.260]   for our dog was going to be so important late in life.
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:48.260]   We use the name of our first pet more often than we use geometry.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:51.220]   I just fill it with pseudo random gunk and sort in one password and then put it.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:52.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:54.620]   Your answers do not match your records.
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:55.620]   Try again.
[01:33:55.620 --> 01:34:03.220]   Appels app store says no to guns, but yes to weed.
[01:34:03.220 --> 01:34:05.540]   Thank you, TechCrunch, for that excellent headline.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:08.500]   Jim Daurungpull posted that he called them and spoke to them and they said they're not
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.340]   doing anything differently than they ever did before.
[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:11.340]   They've always done the same thing.
[01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:13.100]   They didn't know what that story was about.
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:18.540]   It's because it comes from a company called or a social networking app called Mass Roots
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:29.500]   that is an app for finding your nearby marijuana store and it is legal now they're using geolocation.
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:30.500]   It is in the app store.
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:33.620]   It's back, but they're using geolocation to make sure that you live in one of 23 states
[01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:39.980]   where you can buy marijuana with or without a medical marijuana card.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:44.740]   Apple has paired with Pinterest to create a new app discovery pin.
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:48.420]   You can pin your apps.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:52.940]   Apple is also promoting and I celebrate them for this.
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:55.660]   Great games with no in-app purchases.
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:58.540]   They call it pay once and play.
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:34:59.740]   That's a good idea.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:00.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   Long overdue.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:04.820]   I wonder if that's going to be part of parental controls too.
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:10.340]   I think only allow kids to download apps that are pay once, not without in-app purchases.
[01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:11.980]   Oh my God.
[01:35:11.980 --> 01:35:18.220]   I just Michael comes to us every day trying to buy $50 worth of gems.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:19.220]   That's great.
[01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:21.460]   It's getting parents and kids to talk.
[01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:22.460]   No.
[01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:26.860]   But then he says, "But I have a card I got for Christmas.
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:29.340]   I have my Apple iTunes gift card.
[01:35:29.340 --> 01:35:31.420]   What do you want me to spend it on?"
[01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:32.980]   Sia, chandelier.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:34.140]   Music discovery.
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.140]   Music discovery.
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:37.100]   All right.
[01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:38.100]   Let's take a break.
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:41.900]   When we come back, folks, gentlemen, your picks of the week.
[01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:47.100]   The first word from my pick for invoicing, freshbooks.com.
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:48.100]   Love fresh books.
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.700]   Save me a lot of time and money back.
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:52.540]   I was a freelancer.
[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.220]   Just doing it all by myself.
[01:35:54.220 --> 01:35:56.780]   I had to invoice my clients and I hated it.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:03.220]   Come at the end of the month, I would just say, "I'll do it next month."
[01:36:03.220 --> 01:36:04.220]   And then next month.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:05.220]   And then next month.
[01:36:05.220 --> 01:36:06.940]   I've told the story before.
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:13.500]   I invoiced Rogers for the Canadian TV show, five invoices at a time.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:15.940]   And they really did not like that.
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:19.020]   Then Amber told me about freshbooks and my life changed.
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:21.060]   It makes it so easy to send out those invoices.
[01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:22.700]   You create them.
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:23.860]   They look professional nice.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:27.580]   They come with a, they come an email, but you can also send paper invoices if you want.
[01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:32.300]   The nice thing about the email, your clients get a big pay button, which makes it very
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:36.500]   easy to get paid because it integrates with all the payment systems out there.
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:39.620]   And so your clients can even use credit cards to pay you.
[01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:45.420]   If they do forget to pay, you can avoid those awkward emails and phone calls with automated
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.820]   late payment reminders.
[01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:48.380]   That way you will get paid faster.
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:52.340]   In fact, on average of five days faster, according to freshbooks.
[01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:57.700]   And here's another stat, freshbooks customers double their revenue in the first two years.
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.780]   We did come to think of it.
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:04.980]   If you're still using Word, Excel or Google Docs to create invoices, if you're still printing
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:07.460]   them and mailing them, you want to take a look at freshbooks.
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:13.580]   And now with their apps too, Android or iOS, you can keep receipts, snap pictures.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:16.340]   You can automatically track time and hours.
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:19.340]   It's never been easier to build clients for your time.
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:21.700]   Freshbooks.com, try it free for 30 days.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.140]   Go to freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:26.020]   Freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:29.780]   And if you do me a favor when they ask, how did you hear about us if you just say, oh
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:31.740]   yeah, I heard about it on Macbreak Weekly.
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:34.260]   That would make it, make me very happy.
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:36.340]   Freshbooks.com/macbreak.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:40.220]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:43.340]   So my pick of the week is an app called Records.
[01:37:43.340 --> 01:37:47.420]   Now I have to press it by saying that I don't use this personally, but it came out today.
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:49.660]   I did download it to try it out.
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:52.300]   I say I don't use it because I don't use databases on my Mac.
[01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:57.180]   And this is a database on your Mac, but it is for people who were using bento previously.
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:38:01.500]   And ever since FileMaker wound down bento, we've been asked what's an alternative?
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.500]   What can we use instead of bento?
[01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.940]   And usually you'd say something complicated like FileMaker where you'd try a couple other
[01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:06.940]   things.
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:09.540]   But Records really seems to want to pick up where bento left off.
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:10.580]   It's all template based.
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:12.500]   It looks very easy to use.
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:14.260]   It's from pushpopcorn.com.
[01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:16.940]   They have a couple demos up there.
[01:38:16.940 --> 01:38:18.500]   But you really use set things up.
[01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.100]   It looks really easy to maintain.
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.940]   You can set up the way you want to organize your information.
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:27.860]   And just if you really liked bento and you've been holding on to it with your cold dead hands
[01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:30.860]   at this point now, I would absolutely give records a try.
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:32.220]   It looks really well done.
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.220]   Nice.
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:35.380]   Yeah, I miss bento.
[01:38:35.380 --> 01:38:36.980]   For a lot of things, it's great.
[01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:39.980]   I used to work in databases so I never want to see one again long as I live.
[01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:43.540]   But a lot of people really liked databases.
[01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:44.540]   There you go.
[01:38:44.540 --> 01:38:45.540]   No SQL.
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:46.540]   That's his motto.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:47.540]   Yeah.
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:48.540]   Records.
[01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:50.540]   And how much is it?
[01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:52.700]   I don't have the price in front of me, but I'll pull it up.
[01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:55.340]   Did you see that, Jason, when you look in the app store?
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:56.340]   Oh, well.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:57.340]   It is $49.99.
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:58.340]   Oh, okay.
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:00.660]   And it just changed to the Canadian price for me.
[01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:06.340]   It's amazing how our expectations for the cost of software have really been changed.
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:10.540]   Well, the thing is, it goes back to the same discussion about the free to play apps is
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:13.540]   that if there's no way to make money, if you don't pay developers, you're not going
[01:39:13.540 --> 01:39:15.740]   to get version two and you're not going to get the next great app.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:19.180]   So whenever there's someone who makes a great app, whether I use it a lot or not, and I
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:21.100]   like their talent, I consider it an investment.
[01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:24.980]   I want to give them the money that they can use, hopefully, to support that app and to
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:27.180]   make the next great app.
[01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:28.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:29.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:30.180]   50 bucks, though.
[01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:32.740]   Like everything should be a dollar now.
[01:39:32.740 --> 01:39:34.220]   You won't get this out for a dollar.
[01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:35.220]   No, you can't.
[01:39:35.220 --> 01:39:36.220]   The choice is not having an app.
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:37.220]   Yeah.
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:39.220]   Yeah.
[01:39:39.220 --> 01:39:40.220]   He put his $12 in that purchase.
[01:39:40.220 --> 01:39:41.540]   Yeah, that would be worse.
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:42.540]   You're right.
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:45.460]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:47.500]   So I have a pro a protest pick.
[01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:48.500]   Yes.
[01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:55.020]   I got a like get what the hell a surface pro.
[01:39:55.020 --> 01:39:57.060]   Are you insane?
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:59.380]   So I got the service pro.
[01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:00.380]   What do you think?
[01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:01.380]   And I like it.
[01:40:01.380 --> 01:40:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:03.380]   I like it a lot.
[01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.380 --> 01:40:07.140]   So, you know, I, you know, I, I felt like, you know, I'm just frustrated.
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:10.340]   I wanted to see like, can you actually do it well?
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:13.980]   Touching, you know, with a touchscreen and keyboard and everything else.
[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:14.980]   And I love it.
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:19.700]   You know, I'm hoping that Apple someday will move down that path, but until they do, I'm
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:20.700]   starting.
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:23.940]   I pretty much for the next couple of weeks, just as an experiment, I took my iPad out,
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.900]   put it somewhere else and put this in as a replacement.
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:29.820]   And so I'm going to use this for a while.
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:31.820]   It was more expensive than my iPad.
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:35.580]   So, you know, of course I got I seven and, you know, all that other stuff.
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:39.780]   So, so it's, but so far, you know, I put Photoshop on it, runs great.
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:44.300]   And, you know, I put some people really what I, the day to day stuff that I want to be
[01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:47.940]   able to do is just very quickly open something and draw on it and send it back to somebody
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:52.980]   and being able to do that and be able to making a Windows machine, your pick of the
[01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:53.980]   week.
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.980]   This is going to be out everywhere, Alex.
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:57.980]   I'm going to be blocked everywhere.
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:02.580]   Well, all I could say is that don't call, you know, just don't call me a fan boy.
[01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:03.580]   I'm out there.
[01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:04.580]   They're behind.
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:07.380]   I think Apple, I think the reason that I'm picking this is that I think Apple is grossly
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:12.940]   behind in touch screen on their on their laptops and someone who has a lot of them.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:13.940]   And I'm bitter.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:14.940]   I'm getting bitter about it.
[01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:17.980]   Windows 8 one does really celebrate touch.
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:25.620]   You know, similarly, this is the Dell XPS 13, which is a 13 inch Windows notebook in
[01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:31.780]   a laptop, two and a half pound laptop, the size of an 11 inch MacBook Air.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:36.140]   This is what I can't wait for it when Apple releases a MacBook Air in this with this form
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:40.500]   factor and a fifth generation Intel chip, that's going to be a product.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:41.500]   Yeah.
[01:41:41.500 --> 01:41:45.740]   And but you have to run the only issue with that in this is you have to run Windows.
[01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:47.700]   So, you know, it's a little funky.
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:49.300]   It has this kind of funky experience.
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:54.660]   I will say you're like, oh, like I was like, oh, when are we talking about prints in the
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:55.660]   new revolution funky?
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:57.860]   Or are we talking about Jim socks?
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:59.860]   You left your car from socks.
[01:41:59.860 --> 01:42:02.380]   Let's make sure it's really clear here.
[01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:06.220]   No, I'm just saying it just like that's a good kind of fun.
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.220]   There's windy.
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:11.020]   There's just there's there's things that Windows does that as a Mac user, you're just like,
[01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:12.020]   really?
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:16.460]   They also have to point out that when you do a touch screen laptop or tablet, you probably
[01:42:16.460 --> 01:42:21.260]   can't see it, but there's fingerprints all over my laptop screen, which I have kids
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:22.260]   like I've kids.
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:24.260]   They're all over everything.
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:25.260]   Yeah, it's like my iPad.
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:26.820]   I guess we're getting used to that, aren't we?
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:29.940]   When you put the pizza slice down and then just touch the screen immediately.
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:30.940]   Ooh, problem.
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:32.780]   But look at that bezel.
[01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:35.780]   I mean, the bezel is screen is amazing, right?
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:36.780]   Look at that.
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:37.780]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:41.100]   And they didn't and they didn't cheapen out and say, well, we'll make this a smaller sized
[01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:43.020]   keyboard because we want to hide the bezel.
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:45.260]   Yeah, it's it's I mean, I'm with Alex.
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:49.780]   I've I got to use a surface three for a few months while I was reviewing it.
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:54.340]   And it's not enough to make me switch from Mac to Windows, but it's enough to make me
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:59.300]   think that, oh, man, if if this run Mac OS, I wouldn't even consider buying an air.
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.300]   I agree.
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:01.300]   I would I wouldn't buy an iPad.
[01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:02.780]   I would buy this and this would do both jobs.
[01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:06.980]   And I I think about what it's like to be a Windows user and say, well, fine, keep your
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:07.980]   iPad.
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:09.380]   I have something that's a good desktop.
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:10.380]   It's a good notebook.
[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.380]   It's a good tablet.
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:12.380]   Excuse me.
[01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:14.380]   It's not a good tablet because the touch apps aren't there yet.
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:18.220]   But again, assuming that Microsoft delivers on Windows 10.
[01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:20.980]   Well, this is another one of those.
[01:43:20.980 --> 01:43:21.980]   I agree with you.
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:24.340]   And I think the service pro three actually really is very good hardware.
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:26.180]   Although, come on, that kickstand, that's dopey.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:30.820]   No, I was like, but it was I put here's the worst part is I'm so used to like Apple stuff
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:33.540]   that I I put the keyboard on and then I kept on falling over.
[01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:35.020]   I was like, what am I supposed to do here?
[01:43:35.020 --> 01:43:36.020]   I don't understand.
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:39.260]   And I was like, and then I was like, and then it took me like a second and then I was
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:40.260]   like, oh, there's a kickstand on the back.
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:41.620]   I actually like it.
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:44.700]   I kind of like the fact that it's built in and then it just disappears because because like
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:49.300]   the thickness doesn't bother me at all, you know, and the and I like that I don't have
[01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:53.420]   to get something else to get it to sit up, you know, so I'm on a flight.
[01:43:53.420 --> 01:43:57.660]   And with an iPad, I have to figure out what I'm going to like some stand that I'm going
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:58.660]   to use with this.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:02.300]   I just pop it open and keep on watching and and as I said, there's a handful of PC apps
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:06.620]   that I've been, you know, kind of popping over on the on the Mac to go use, you know, and
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.260]   it's a bit easier.
[01:44:08.260 --> 01:44:15.180]   So well, you missed out because you could have gotten a $59 Windows tablet.
[01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:16.180]   This is the windbook.
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.780]   I'm going to review this before you buy later.
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:20.180]   I just want you to review Photoshop on that.
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:22.980]   You wouldn't want to run Photoshop on it.
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:25.260]   It is only seven inches.
[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:31.220]   It's smaller than a mini, but it really is only for Adobe Premiere effects.
[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:32.220]   Right.
[01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:33.220]   Right.
[01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:38.220]   But if you're using Microsoft Word or just browsing a lot, I mean, $59 for a, you know,
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:39.220]   a Windows computer.
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.700]   You're watching videos.
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:41.700]   Awesome.
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:42.700]   Yeah.
[01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:43.700]   $59.
[01:44:43.700 --> 01:44:47.060]   That's like the tax on a MacBook Pro.
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:48.060]   Right.
[01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:49.580]   No, it's less than the test.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:50.580]   It's half the text.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:51.580]   Wherever you're getting taxed.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:52.580]   Yeah, really.
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:53.580]   That's okay.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.940]   Annie and I go your pick of the week.
[01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:56.940]   Is it a Windows device?
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:58.500]   If it is, you're in, we're just really good.
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:44:59.500]   This show.
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.500]   No, but it.
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:07.300]   No, but it does tie in nicely to that previous recommendation to the courtesy of Cramcan 3000,
[01:45:07.300 --> 01:45:09.140]   the future of video podcasting.
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:13.340]   It is yet another portable mobile keyboard.
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:17.940]   This is Zag's pocket keyboard that got showed off at this.
[01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:22.020]   I think if they showed off a CES a couple of months ago, just started pre-orders.
[01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:26.060]   It's very, it's a really, really cool design because okay, so here's, here's your keyboards
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:27.620]   as usual for a mobile keyboard.
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:31.860]   It's smaller than the normal size because it almost has to be like the no, no, no wider
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:33.060]   than an iPad.
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:34.940]   Even so, it's a little bit narrower than that.
[01:45:34.940 --> 01:45:36.100]   The keys themselves.
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:37.100]   They work great.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:42.340]   They're a little bit shallower throw than other even folding keyboards that I've used,
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:43.980]   but it's still quite comfortable to use.
[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:48.140]   The thing they got, they got really right is that you have a full with space bar that
[01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.500]   with no breaks in it.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:52.980]   So it's, you do have to type a little bit more slowly, but it's very, very typeable.
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:59.940]   But the big win is that yes, it does have a built in tablet stand, but it folds like
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:02.100]   this.
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:03.100]   And there it is.
[01:46:03.100 --> 01:46:04.100]   Wow.
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:10.780]   So now you have something that you can, it's, you could actually hide that in a body cavity.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:11.860]   I'd like to see that video.
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:13.860]   I'm trying to, I'm trying to, I'm trying to buy it.
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:14.860]   Okay.
[01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:15.860]   Maybe not.
[01:46:15.860 --> 01:46:18.860]   But the idea is that this will fit easily inside a jacket pocket.
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:22.940]   It doesn't disappear inside a pants pocket as well as some of the other folding keyboards.
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:28.140]   I've tried the kinds of fold this way, but that is a, but the big win of folding it this
[01:46:28.140 --> 01:46:33.540]   way is that you don't wind up with, and the other thing, it automatically turns on as soon
[01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:35.420]   as you unfold it, which is really good.
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:36.420]   So do I.
[01:46:36.420 --> 01:46:37.420]   That's good.
[01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:46:38.420 --> 01:46:44.260]   Hey, but yeah, but the, but the real big win of this is that there's no, you get continuous
[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:45.820]   keyboard from left to right.
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:49.100]   There's no break in the middle that you have to sort of deal with.
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:50.460]   It's not expensive either.
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:53.220]   It's about 69 bucks.
[01:46:53.220 --> 01:46:54.580]   And it's also a multi-platform.
[01:46:54.580 --> 01:46:56.220]   So you can use it on your iPad.
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:57.300]   You can use it on your iPhone.
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:59.780]   You can use it on Android devices.
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:03.460]   And people think that you're one of them really impressive people who either has a diamond
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:05.260]   bracelet or a slide rule.
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:07.780]   So that's the other advantage of going this way.
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:10.380]   So I've been using it for about a week now.
[01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:15.060]   It's definitely would be one of my two favorites because of this really interesting design.
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:16.300]   And so there it is.
[01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:20.340]   I keep buying the little doodads that Andy recommends every week.
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:26.180]   It's great because once once it's, it's both from, from readers and lists, readers and
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:31.100]   listeners and like PR people, once they realize that you have an interest in a certain product
[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:34.300]   category, these products tend to find you.
[01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:38.620]   So I still have like a couple of, I actually have a drawer in my filing cabinet full full
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:43.060]   of like folding mobile keyboard, some of which I decided, okay, nice, nice try.
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:45.460]   Thank you for the sample, but I don't think I need to cover this.
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:51.380]   And I'm just like, wow, I'm sorry that I spent $113 so far on two different keyboards last
[01:47:51.380 --> 01:47:53.780]   week before seeing this one.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:57.780]   I don't have a pick, but I want to make a quick mention that one of our regulars on
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:02.380]   this show, a guy we've known for a long, long time starting back on the call for help days
[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:08.140]   when he was part of the Mac world crew that did Mac tips on tech TV.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:12.260]   Chris Breen has left Mac world and shock of shocks.
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:14.540]   He's going to work for Apple.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:15.540]   Wow.
[01:48:15.540 --> 01:48:17.540]   Holy cow is right.
[01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:20.940]   His blog post time to do something else came out this morning.
[01:48:20.940 --> 01:48:26.980]   He does thank us and I appreciate that in the acknowledgments section.
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:34.500]   I also point you to Chris's last Mac 911 column, which is probably worth printing out and taping
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:38.340]   to your computer because he tells you how to fix every problem that will ever happen
[01:48:38.340 --> 01:48:41.620]   to you with your Macintosh or your iPhone.
[01:48:41.620 --> 01:48:42.860]   It is phenomenal.
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:47.540]   This is he didn't write this article when he first started Mac 911 or he would never
[01:48:47.540 --> 01:48:53.060]   have had to write any more posts, but he's decided since he's leaving Mac 911 at Mac world,
[01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:56.780]   he should pipe do the ultimate last post how to fix your Apple product.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:02.500]   You last word Chris, congratulations and good luck and I can't wait to find out what he's
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:03.500]   up to.
[01:49:03.500 --> 01:49:04.660]   Do you think it might be music discovery?
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:08.220]   He is a musician after all.
[01:49:08.220 --> 01:49:09.620]   Chris is a damn clever guy.
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:10.980]   He knows love about music.
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:16.380]   He knows I wouldn't be shocked if I've known that I'm as you might have gotten from my reaction.
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:17.380]   You know.
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.380 --> 01:49:20.220]   And he's a friend of mine.
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:24.340]   But he's also a really, really good educator.
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:29.580]   So I would not be terribly shocked if they brought him on to help to be part of that documentation
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:30.580]   education process.
[01:49:30.580 --> 01:49:32.660]   Yeah, he does a lot of classes on Linda that comment.
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:37.220]   I think he's a guy with a very deep cabinet of skills and he can be he's an asset to everybody.
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:40.500]   And I bet Renee is kicking himself for not giving a chance to top apples.
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:43.020]   I'm sure I'll offer to get Chris green on.
[01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:48.180]   Yeah, he already got somebody to call well, he cannot have any more people.
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:49.260]   No more.
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:54.100]   He does thank you Andy as well in the in the long list of acknowledgments.
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:59.380]   We love Chris Breen and the hair of Breen and we continue to look for great things from
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:00.380]   Chris.
[01:50:00.380 --> 01:50:01.980]   I'm just thinking the possibility of apple hair.
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:04.620]   You know, I mean, he could be just could be a whole nother category.
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:07.700]   You know, maybe maybe that's it.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:11.140]   Maybe the car that building is a convertible and they want to know what happens if men
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:12.140]   have a nice.
[01:50:12.140 --> 01:50:17.140]   Chris, you're going away.
[01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:18.140]   He does.
[01:50:18.140 --> 01:50:20.060]   He's very cagey about what he's going to be doing at Apple.
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:22.300]   In fact, he doesn't even really say the word apple.
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:25.740]   He says a cuprettano based technology company you may be familiar with.
[01:50:25.740 --> 01:50:27.180]   He says fit in perfectly.
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:28.180]   Yeah.
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:30.300]   Yeah, he's going to fit in perfectly exactly.
[01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:31.740]   So congratulations, Chris.
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:32.740]   That's great news.
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:34.460]   Hey, thanks to you guys for being here.
[01:50:34.460 --> 01:50:36.780]   Renee Richie, I'm more.com the place to go.
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:39.860]   Don't forget I'm more is really excellent debug podcast.
[01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:42.980]   That should be on your regular list.
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:44.620]   What are you doing this week?
[01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:47.500]   We have Andy Matruchik from Khan Academy, formerly from apples.
[01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.100]   We're a kit team now on Khan Academy.
[01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.100]   Yep, it's going to be good.
[01:50:50.100 --> 01:50:51.100]   That's great.
[01:50:51.100 --> 01:50:54.740]   That's a Morgan on iterate talking about the new version of audio hijack.
[01:50:54.740 --> 01:50:55.900]   Very good.
[01:50:55.900 --> 01:51:01.020]   As always, I'm more.com the place to go for the latest Mac news.
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:06.140]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times with his drawer of gadgets.
[01:51:06.140 --> 01:51:09.020]   Anything you want to give a plug to?
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:12.420]   Not particularly if everyone has a good idea for my Wednesday column, by all means let
[01:51:12.420 --> 01:51:14.660]   me know because I'm kind of just Tuesday.
[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:18.980]   Because I started Monday night and realized that no, that's not going to work out.
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:19.980]   So.
[01:51:19.980 --> 01:51:23.300]   I'm in the chat room said Mac brake meekly in the chat room, says Chris Breen is working
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:25.080]   on the I wig.
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:26.540]   So that would be also another interesting.
