[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.960]   There's lots of news from Apple and I assembled a massive panel today.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.880]   Because we're going to have a I'm hoping a massive discussion.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.240]   Andy Naco is here as usual from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.160]   It's a pleasure having you here Andy.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.040]   A pleasure to be here.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.720]   Looking very sharp today.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.320]   Yes, I've had lots of leftover Halloween candy.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.240]   That will sharpen.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.000]   Sharpen one for the peanut butter sandwich and eight mini Snickers bar.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.360]   So I'll be really excited for the first hour.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.440]   Then it'll be kind of a crash to run our queue.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.120]   So make the most of you while you can.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.560]   Also here Renee Richie from Montreal, you're back in town.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.600]   You flew back I guess.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.800]   Yes, I was supposed to fly out again, but I had some last minute plans change.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.840]   So I'm happy I could be here.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.240]   Oh good.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.280]   Where were you going this time?
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.920]   I was going to Ireland for all, but then I had a few last minute things I couldn't miss.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.080]   And so I had to rearrange the plans and I'm devastated.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.640]   I'm not there.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.760]   Are you going to miss all?
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.680]   I am unfortunately.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.320]   Oh, no.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.440]   Sadness.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.240]   A lot of Guinness.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.600]   You're talking about that the other day.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.400]   How the loss of Mac world Expo has actually spawned a wonderful bunch of eclectic Mac
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.040]   conferences like all like what's the one in Yosemite you go to Andy?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.800]   The Yosemite conference.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.080]   Coco.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.800]   Coco Conf you.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.280]   You're somebody.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.080]   Coco loves Singleton for a while.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.360]   There's Alex Alex.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.080]   Our season.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.120]   See for back in the day.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.400]   Yup.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.680]   Oh, hey, that's Adam Inksd.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.360]   He's a legend in the in the Mac business.

[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.560]   Absolutely.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.320]   Also with this and it's hello.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.600]   Howdy stranger time.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.680]   Alex Lindsey back in the fold.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.720]   You've had busy obviously.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.680]   Hello, Alex.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.680]   The election season is oftentimes a busy time for us.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.120]   So election season.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.760]   Why is that?
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.600]   You know, those people who want to stream things and talk about things.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.320]   And so.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.680]   Is your Canadian elections are over?
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   Sorry.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.400]   Trudeau won.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.040]   Didn't you hear?
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.560]   Yeah, the Canadian elections are over, Alex.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.720]   Do you get?
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.960]   I'm wondering, you know, with the advent of Facebook live and all these ways,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.120]   really, it's not so hard to do it yourself.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.200]   If that's, I bet that's actually good for your business because people do that and then they go,
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.360]   oh, how do we make this more pro?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.640]   The problem with all of these is that is the simple procedure,
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.360]   whether it's Facebook live or Hangouts or whatever,
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.240]   is a fairly, it's a simple procedure on the surface.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.320]   But once you want to start making it really work and scale it,
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.360]   it becomes more complicated.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.240]   You know, it's easy to have a barbecue with your friends and if people don't show up on time.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.200]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.760]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.840]   Now you probably have the inside story on that.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.600]   So we watched a couple of Sundays ago, Mark invited a few friends.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.680]   I don't know anything about that.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.920]   You don't.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.560]   And if you did, you couldn't say, I know.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.840]   You've invited a few friends over to his backyard and streamed it in 20 or 30 or 40,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.280]   then it was 50, 60,000 people simultaneously watching.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.800]   But you got the back end of Facebook.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.440]   So no challenge, really, probably.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.280]   Well, and even there, I think he had some issues in the first round of it.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.920]   It did.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.960]   It was a wildfire, whatever.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.800]   And those are the kind of things that, you know, what we get paid to do is solve that problem.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.000]   You know, is to make sure that, you know, it might be a simple Facebook Live,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.960]   but we might be using a cellular or a satellite or fiber backup or, you know, you know, all of those.
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   If you're running for Congress, it really doesn't reflect well on you.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.360]   If you do kind of a cheesy job, you need, it needs to be super pro.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.520]   Well, and again, for brands or for most of our brands,
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.960]   they're more fine than 50. And so, for a brand to go down,
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.480]   I mean, you look at what some of the challenges some brands have had with some of their streams.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.000]   And that failure is the most expensive thing.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.680]   So you start off with these things that seem like Facebook Live would be really fun,
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.720]   and you start doing it on your phone.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.920]   And I've done a bunch of fun little Facebook Live on my phone, but once you really get serious,
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.320]   you then start adding a lot of hardware.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.840]   You want to go, I want to start using multiple cameras, and I want to start getting feedback,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.480]   and I want to open, and I want to play a movie in the middle of it.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.520]   And I want to, you know, all the things that people start thinking about
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.280]   once they start doing any kind of video production.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.960]   And so those are the kind of things that we, and then I also want a primary
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.280]   in a backup and a backup to that and that type of thing.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.160]   Those are the things that we tend to solve.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.760]   So that's what's just busy on these things.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.400]   Well, Apple's event went off with that, a hitch.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.560]   They had a Thursday, Microsoft, same thing.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.760]   Both companies now have gotten very good at streaming their conferences.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.680]   And, you know, I don't know.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.440]   We had some actually relatively significant streaming problems here.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.120]   But that's local to you.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.640]   I don't think we had problems.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.720]   Could be. I mean, our Apple TV app blew out.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.200]   I mean, it was distinctly problems that were being reported to us.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.760]   Oh, OK.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.560]   So other people see problems because we were--
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.480]   Yeah, our Slack group, our, the Timbitrators and Slack also had, you know,
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.320]   were a number of people were saying, "Oh, I lost the stream.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.360]   Oh, you're a minute ahead of me."
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.000]   That kind of stuff.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.680]   I'm defensive over that because a lot of people blame us for that.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.720]   Right?
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.880]   Yeah, you never were off in the not.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.600]   It's the end user's situation that causes problems.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.920]   Oh, and that's-- I mean, and that happens all the time.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.520]   I mean, it takes two to tango.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.320]   You know, so you can't--
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.240]   Yeah, I always tell people is if nobody--
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.160]   if other people aren't reporting the problem, it's you.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.320]   Yeah, and also, you know, looking at--
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.240]   oftentimes we have to look at geographic regions.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.560]   So--
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.160]   It could be regional because of Akamai.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.040]   And there's a community in the area.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.080]   And ISP, you know, there could be a variety of things that are--
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.000]   so if we see only the Northwest region or only California,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.840]   that tends to not be a typically a CDN particular problem,
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.120]   but it might be somewhere on the edge.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.440]   I was in Gainesville, Florida watching on a 4G or LTE stream,
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.640]   and it was rock saw.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.840]   But Adam, you're in the--
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.800]   where are you, New England?
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.920]   Oh, upstate New York.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.040]   Upstate New York, that's right.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.760]   The-- I mean, I have about 30 megabits down from Time Warner,
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.240]   and usually it's pretty solid, but you never know.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.480]   And I mean, as just with all the denial of service
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.760]   that we've had recently, I've been using the down for everyone,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.040]   or just me side a lot.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.440]   Right.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.120]   Because you never know.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.040]   Well, I'm stalling because I know we're going to get into a kind
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.440]   of a conversation in a moment.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   I'm kind of-- I'm kind of putting it off.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.160]   But the-- let's-- so we'll get to it.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.840]   But I guess we-- otherwise, we're going
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.720]   to bury every other story underneath it.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.680]   The Apple-- on Tuesday, Apple did its earnings,
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.160]   and it was right after the show.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.200]   We had to let Renee run the file.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.320]   And you listen, I presume, Renee, to the analyst call.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:20.960]   Yes.
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.680]   The car is the new Apple-- is a new television.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.360]   Is that what he said?
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.860]   No.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.360]   I mean, that's what Munster is asking you about now,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.240]   so you got to figure.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.400]   Munster knows something.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.680]   Dead, dead, dead, dead.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.880]   Wasn't it Munster who said it was going to be TV?
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:35.240]   Yes.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.760]   That's what I mean.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.200]   Like, he's got something new in his jaw now.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.000]   And then now he says, oh, it's going to be cars.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.600]   Then he says, no, it's not going to be cars.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:47.000]   It was Apple's first annual revenue decline in 15 years.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   So that's not insignificant.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.800]   But it was still the second highest Q4 profit ever.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.480]   Interesting.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:09:00.360]   So revenue is the amount of money you make before you factor
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.640]   in the cost of everything.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.840]   It's the total cash coming in over the transom.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.440]   And profit, of course, is what you get to keep.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:07.940]   Right.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.640]   And more what I was pointing out is
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.920]   that the yes, 2016 was down from 2015,
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.680]   but it was up from 2014 and everything before then.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.200]   So it's still $9 freaking billion.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.520]   So it's not that-- so yeah.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.920]   And I should clarify.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   It sounds like when you read the headline, oh,
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.720]   it's revenue is the worst since 2001.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.760]   No.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.960]   It's just it's since 2001.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.400]   It's been going up every single year.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.480]   And so going down year over year from 2015 to 2016--
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.360]   and by the way, not by a whole lot less than 10%--
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.320]   And that's also the introduction of the iPod was 2001
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.520]   and the iPhone 2007.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.160]   And that's a heck of a revenue engine.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.160]   Right.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.280]   Is it down iPhone sales that was--
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.800]   remember that only a couple of weeks of iPhone 7
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.880]   says it's a factor in here.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.240]   And Apple, honestly, I don't quite
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.080]   know what's going on here because they said
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.640]   that they were shipping every iPhone they could make.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.560]   And I know a number of people who did not order right away.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.480]   They thought they'd think about it for a week or two.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.160]   And now they're waiting till December
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.800]   to get an iPhone 7 or 7 plus.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.600]   So Apple is shipping everything they can make.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.760]   And yet, I don't know what those initial sales were like
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.920]   because they said it didn't make a huge difference
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.840]   in the quarterly results.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.000]   They couldn't fulfill.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.280]   They were totally supply constrained.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.320]   And that was one of the big questions on the conversation
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   is that when Apple had new markets to enter,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.120]   when they could go to Verizon, when they could go
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.040]   international, when they could go to China mobile,
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.800]   they could sort of forecast demand for iPhone.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.400]   But since then, since they've filled all the carrier channels,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.960]   they didn't expect as many people would buy the iPhone SE
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.480]   as they did.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.840]   They thought more people would buy the iPhone 6 plus than did.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.720]   They didn't think as many people would want the iPhone 7
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.200]   plus it did and sort of put their modern demand
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.680]   forecasting into doubts.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.280]   Well, so saturated the market to some extent, right?
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.720]   There's a point beyond which you can't--
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.600]   That's why Elon's going to Mars, Leo.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.240]   We need Apple stars on Mars.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.480]   I don't think that--
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.760]   I think they calculated that Samsung would make a phone that
[00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.120]   was flammable.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.000]   But that you're going to see next quarter.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.080]   That's when you're going to see that is in the Q1 result.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.280]   It depends if you can ramp up.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.000]   I mean, that's an awful lot of phone voice to fill.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.680]   I think that's the same problem that Google Pixel had.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.040]   A lot of people would love to buy--
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.400]   Google probably love to make as many people as they're having
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.800]   that problem.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   They're actually giving people $50 credits now,
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.160]   because they are not able to get the pixel to people
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.360]   as promised and the date promised, which is something Apple
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.040]   hasn't happened to Apple yet.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.000]   They always, at least, stand by their delivery date.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.560]   It's hard to add millions of units to your manufacturing
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.080]   schedule.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.000]   I saw a lot of estimate that half of Note 7 users who
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.600]   were turning their Note 7 ended up buying an iPhone 7 instead.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.360]   So it clearly is going to benefit them.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.400]   But I don't think those numbers will show up.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.480]   And I think the hard thing for Samsung
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.440]   is that once someone goes down into the ecosystem,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.560]   it's not going to be hard to back out again.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.200]   And it's not something they're going to lose.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.800]   They might have had some certain loss
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.200]   that they're going to realize over this quarter,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.240]   but they're going to lose a lot more over the next two
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.800]   or three years.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.240]   And it's also a series of unusual events
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.720]   that gave it continued revenue growth.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.080]   And you can't do that ever, ever, ever, ever.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.120]   Large numbers.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.920]   So any other hand, you just have to release something
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.720]   you magical every year.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.680]   Well, not every year.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.920]   I think that every three, four, five years,
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.520]   you have to have something that is truly different
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.440]   that or you're going to disrupt another market.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.680]   And I think Apple could disrupt some of these other markets.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.440]   I think that they haven't.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.800]   I mean, I think cars are ripe to be disrupted, so are TVs.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.960]   So are many other things.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.040]   And Apple just has to decide where they're going to go with that.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.240]   One of the things that's been changing in Apple's--
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.240]   go ahead, Andy.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:41.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.200]   Well, it's also to be determined whether Apple's capable
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.760]   of disrupting other markets.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.160]   They've been doing a lot of safe things recently,
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.200]   things that they're very much play to their strengths.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.720]   The fact that Apple would be--
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.760]   if Apple had been getting into the TV market,
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.960]   if they've been getting into the car market,
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.240]   and they have to start marketing towards people who
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.520]   don't necessarily already love Apple,
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.800]   could they make a TV for people who can't be convinced that $4,000
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.680]   is an unreasonable amount of money to spend on a 28-inch 1080P TV?
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.760]   I don't know if they need to market to be more general like Apple.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.600]   I mean, they have a lot of it.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.640]   They have very, very--
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.080]   People who do like it.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.080]   I think they have enough--
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.640]   They have enough install base that people just--
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.880]   Just selling into that ecosystem would probably
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.440]   be enough to keep growing the company.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.440]   Well, you know--
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   Look at the block.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.000]   Actually, where are you going to--
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.240]   And actually, let me ask Renee this,
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.440]   because you looked at the numbers, I'm sure, in detail.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.080]   One of the things that's going to be a growth generator
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.200]   for Apple is services.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   They've said that.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:37.720]   Yes.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.040]   And do we see that in the quarterly results?
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.000]   Yeah, so services across the border up App Store
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.240]   keeps putting up record profits.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.480]   Apple Music keeps growing.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.160]   The challenge for Apple, when you look at something
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.880]   like a television, when you look at something like a car--
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.160]   And this is where you get those thousand
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.800]   notes for every yes-- is they could be interesting products,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.520]   but would they be great businesses?
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.360]   iPhone was the ideal, because Apple
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.040]   knows how to make those devices.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.200]   Almost everybody wants a phone, and they figure out
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.240]   a way to get a premium price on all those phones.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.160]   So they're making hundreds of millions of phones
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.800]   and making 30% margin on every one of those phones.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.560]   It's incredibly unclear if you could make a television set.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.320]   I'm talking about the panel display, not a service,
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.080]   but the television set that they could make hundreds of millions
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.080]   of and sell at 30% margin, because it's a rager than margin.
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.680]   And most people don't turn over television sets that quickly.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.600]   Cars are worse, because to make cars at scale,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.160]   you still need gas engines.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.080]   Tesla's not a car made at scale yet.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.920]   And it's unclear how many they can manufacture,
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.880]   because they may not even make their own internal sales
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.520]   goals for the Model 3.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.840]   So making hundreds of millions of electric cars
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.560]   in the next five years, probably not doable,
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.400]   making gas car probably not interesting.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.920]   What margin can you sell a car?
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.280]   33% margin.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.160]   So a lot of these businesses might sound good,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.880]   but they might also not be good businesses for Apple.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.440]   Also keep in mind that cars--
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.240]   I actually researched this recently-- cars
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.360]   stay on the road in the US for an average of 11 years.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.640]   People do not turn over cars quickly.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.480]   And so televisions, I have no idea what the number is,
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.240]   but I agree with Renee.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:14:59.440]   I mean--
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.000]   It's four or five years anyway.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.640]   I mean, I suck at this.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.920]   I bought like three televisions in my life.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   So you--
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.480]   That goes to her.
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.320]   --they just work.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.320]   They really wear out.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   That's right.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.520]   So it's just ridiculous.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.880]   But it was going to say, we should also look.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   I mean, Apple did try to disrupt a market
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.720]   and with the Apple Watch.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.920]   And look where that's gone.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.680]   What are the numbers?
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.840]   They don't give out numbers on Apple Watch.
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.640]   They don't give out numbers on the Apple Watch.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.000]   But the IDC just came out with some numbers
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.680]   saying that the smartwatch market, except for Garmin,
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.160]   was tanking.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.640]   You know, that they just--
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.720]   That's a limited, very limited market.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.440]   And I think Apple-- it's clear that Apple in the direction
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.480]   it's taking now with the Apple Watch recognizes
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.360]   that the market really is sport.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.720]   It's all-- and it's not even sport.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.400]   It's fitness.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400]   It's fitness.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.280]   Which is really a different level.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.400]   And partly why you see Garmin doing so well
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.640]   is they've got the full range from the simple trackers
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.320]   all the way up to the very high end sports watches
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.320]   that athletes are using for different sports.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.240]   Well, I think that part of it is that it's--
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.840]   I know with my watch.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.640]   Again, I get very frustrated with it.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.200]   The fact that when I travel specifically
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.080]   is just really hard to keep it charged.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.080]   And--
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.200]   New one's pretty good, though.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   I've been very happy.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.560]   Yeah, the UN lasted me two days and four workouts last year.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.440]   The new one's been much, much better.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.240]   I don't know if you're--
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.080]   Is it the new one or watch OS 3?
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.680]   Because I have to gather, I think.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.920]   Because the new battery on the series--
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.840]   the battery on the series, too, I put mine on two days
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.120]   ago, did four workouts, walked 30,000, whatever, steps.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.240]   And it only died around 11 PM last night.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.720]   Yeah, it's much better than it used to be.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.040]   Yeah, the question is--
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.040]   I'm sorry I'm going to hit it.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.680]   Even with all of that, you know,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.880]   I still couldn't go back to the watch.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.920]   I mean, the updates and timers and all kinds of other stuff
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:46.600]   that I--
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   there's a lot of stuff I would like to see.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.520]   But there's--
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.560]   I use it enough.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.440]   I think this is the issue.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.560]   I use it enough that I couldn't go back to a watch that
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:54.920]   wasn't connected.
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.400]   I absolutely--
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.520]   And of course, it's easiest to do it.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.560]   I need my Apple Watch to tell my son to come down
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.840]   to dinner every night via Siri and texting.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.160]   So--
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:02.660]   Really?
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.600]   You use your watch to do that?
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:06.960]   A Siri, text just, and it's time for dinner.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.400]   Every night.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.560]   Now he's going to come and have dinner.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.000]   We don't have to yell.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.040]   You have to yell at travel.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.960]   Actually, that is nice.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.560]   That is just--
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.960]   Well, when I was a kid, my mom got a little bell.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.680]   And you just took a tardy yelling at the stairs.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:23.320]   Then I'm on the--
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.520]   You still are yelling upstairs, except you're
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.360]   the communications wavelength is on a different frequency.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.000]   Yes, it's true.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.680]   It's still longer than the Audible Spectrum.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.160]   Yes, it's RF now.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.160]   The thing about the Apple Watch too is like the Apple TV,
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.560]   where they're not Starship products.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:37.640]   They're shuttlecraft products.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.000]   The iPhone installed the Starship,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.400]   the iPad installed the Starship.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.160]   And those are the big revenue generating products.
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.000]   And these are small $300 products that Apple sells
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.480]   because it increases the overall value of their Starship
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.160]   products.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.880]   And until they're independent products,
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   it's hard to see whether--
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.960]   Does Apple care if the Apple Watch is disruptive?
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.560]   No, it adds value to the iPhone.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.200]   It adds $300 to the bill.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.160]   And they'll tell you it has as much brand
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.360]   if anything but a Rolex.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.960]   So to them, it's still a net win.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.320]   It's not meant to disrupt an industry.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.840]   It's meant to make the iPhone better.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.000]   How were iPad sales?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.080]   How were iPad sales?
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.240]   Were they good?
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.640]   I mean, good to everybody else.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.560]   They're fantastic.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.520]   Were they up or down?
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.400]   Down, but revenues were flat because the iPad Pro
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.480]   was providing higher margin.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.040]   Ah, OK.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.280]   So yeah, iPad Pro seems to be a bright spot
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.680]   within the iPad itself not doing as well.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.240]   So that was kind of interesting.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.120]   How about Mac sales?
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.800]   Again, not great, but--
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.360]   Better than everybody else.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.560]   There were no Macs to drive Mac sales, which was the--
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.920]   You called for the last years.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.720]   For the last 18 months, there were no Mac Pros
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.640]   for the last two years.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.240]   There were no Mac Pros and no Mac--
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   sorry, MacBook Pros.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.080]   For the last three years, there's been no Mac Pro.
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.240]   For the last two and a half years, there's been no Mac Mini.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.800]   And the new products drive sales,
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.080]   absolute new products, it just peters off.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.560]   It's so funny because I go to the Mac Pros site
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.480]   and it's not been updated.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:58.960]   No.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.960]   It's beautiful still.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.400]   Here.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.240]   But it's three years old.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.440]   And they're touting things that are kind of old hat now.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440]   They even--
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.440]   Well, Thomas just beginning a second term.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.400]   Yeah, they mentioned how well it works with Aperture.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.320]   Yeah, it's a Power Mac G4 Cube.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.040]   But you know, I mean, I guess you make a great site.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.720]   Just leave it that way for three and a half years.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.800]   Why change things?
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.080]   Do you think anybody has bought a Mac Pro this year?
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   Anybody?
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.320]   Yeah, not many.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.400]   Alex, have you bought a Mac Pro this year?
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.840]   I bought three when they first came out
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.000]   and I'm still using them.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.680]   Yeah, I get one when they first came out.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.520]   I might buy a generation two or whatever.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.840]   They were a slight update and I bought them.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.400]   And then I-- and we still use them.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.280]   And we use them every day.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.000]   Are they practical?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.800]   I mean, if you're using Final Cut, yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.040]   I guess though, at this point, you'd probably
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.720]   wish you could upgrade it.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.040]   I mean, they're the least compute--
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.800]   I mean, they're probably lower than your Mac Pro is--
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.440]   I mean, compared to our--
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.920]   almost every other piece of hardware
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.040]   other than our laptops, they're the slowest thing
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.880]   we have in the office.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.240]   I mean, we've got a lot of beefy machines in here
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.800]   and multiple GPUs and all kinds of big CPUs and everything else.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.320]   And so for us, these are the little machines
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.880]   that we-- some of our software--
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.120]   Oh, the small auxiliary machines is what you're saying.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.880]   Yeah, I mean, they're extensible enough
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.960]   that it makes sense to have them because the iMacs
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.040]   don't have enough thunderbolts.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.880]   And there's all kinds of little things about that
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.080]   that make it worth having the--
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.280]   what are typically-- we all call trash cans.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:35.680]   And so the trash cans have what we need to do what we--
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.400]   they're useful for what we're doing,
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.080]   but it's mostly video production or specifically
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.720]   the Ozos that we use have a lot of Mac software right now.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.440]   And so we run some of the stuff there with that.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.960]   But really, our hard work is done by some pretty beefy PCs
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.600]   and well, Linux boxes.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.160]   And by the way--
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:57.320]   I stand corrected because I said they hadn't updated the site.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.960]   And they have, it says Mac OS Sierra comes with it now.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.000]   Like, that was a search and replace, Leo.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.640]   It probably was, I'm thinking.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.680]   The thing with the Mac Pro to me that's galling
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.000]   is that you can talk to hardware people
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.040]   and you can listen like, well, Intel Xeon chipset
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.960]   is on this schedule.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.440]   And when companies are fabbing graphics chips,
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:17.360]   like we don't have the capacity to demand they do--
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.480]   there's all these excuses for them,
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.160]   but they chose to make it an appliance.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.560]   If they kept it in the cheese grater,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.000]   people could be swapping their own cards.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.640]   And they could probably be swapping a lot more--
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.360]   But once you choose to make it--
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.040]   Once you choose to make an appliance,
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.880]   you take all the responsibility for updating
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:30.960]   and keeping that appliance current.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.160]   I don't mind that you're making an appliance,
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.200]   but you're then telling me that I don't have to worry about it.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.680]   You're going to give me new versions
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.760]   and a frequent enough schedule that I will always
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.240]   be cutting edge with my technology, because that's what I need.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:42.760]   And that's what they've-- and three years just inexcusable.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.560]   Well, and I think--
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.120]   Yeah, Apple has-- that's a deep responsibility
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.400]   that Apple has by being the only source of iOS products,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   the only source of Mac OS products.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   They may not want to make a cheese grater box
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.680]   for their high-end Macs.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.040]   They may-- that might not interest them,
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.760]   but they have a responsibility to do that.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.360]   And not just in fear of losing users, but also
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.800]   to basically avoid just kicking users right in the back,
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   because it's no small thing to, after 10 years of using
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.040]   one platform that you really like,
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.720]   to have to switch to a different platform.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.640]   And if you have to--
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.560]   You have to have a really good--
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.880]   I think you have to have a really good reason for saying,
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.440]   we know why you like this style.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.280]   We have decided that we like to do a quicker
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.280]   Oatsbox-shaped computer, because we get bored with squares.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.080]   And I think that one of the things that--
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.920]   when you look at all of this hardware at this point,
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.680]   and I'm sure we'll get into this soon,
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.920]   is that I just think that Apple should release the--
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.480]   release the restrictions on the OS,
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.920]   because they're obviously not interested in Mac.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.760]   Hold that thought.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.480]   Hold that thought, because you're absolutely right.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.920]   That's the next conversation.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.000]   In fact, I got it brought up the pro as a segue
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.560]   into what obviously is going to be the hot topic of the day.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:54.960]   Well done, Seth.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.560]   Sneaky.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.760]   Before we do that, let me do that.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.880]   They opened the door.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.920]   I tried to sleep my way through.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:22:59.840]   You did.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.040]   The camel's nose, all of that.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.720]   Anything else to say about the quarterly results?
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.960]   I think we said it all.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.440]   Service is 24% year over year growth, as we mentioned.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.720]   That Apple said that.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.560]   Wait, because everything but iPhone,
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.080]   that's the other thing that's interesting there,
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.440]   more than anything but iPhone.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:20.000]   In total revenue, $24.3 billion for services.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.720]   And Apple, I think people widely agree,
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.360]   isn't that good at service?
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:24.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.400]   There's a lot of-- but that means there's a lot of opportunity
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:27.600]   there.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.600]   iCloud.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.880]   People are using it, right?
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.640]   Apple music.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:32.360]   They're using it.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.720]   So here's an opportunity for Apple
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.360]   to show even more growth there.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.840]   Let's take a break, because we will talk about the Apple
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.400]   event.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.640]   That's what I've been holding on to.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.760]   It's my ace in the hole.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.800]   But first, I want to show you what was such a great thing.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.160]   Had I had trick-or-treaters, I would
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:56.960]   have been able to see them coming with my ring video doorbell.
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.160]   And I kind of missed the boat on this thing.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.440]   We didn't have any trick-or-treaters.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.160]   But if you did, the idea that you could see people coming up
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.760]   your walkway and get to the door before they ring that doorbell
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.040]   gives you all sorts of fun opportunities, doesn't it?
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.680]   And you've got crystal clear video.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.600]   Every single person who came to your door on your Mac,
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.400]   your PC, your iPhone, your Android device,
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.960]   I love the ring video doorbell.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:26.920]   I just saw yet another news report of a bad guy busted
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.600]   because of the ring video doorbell.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.320]   He was prowling the neighborhood.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.040]   They got video.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.000]   They were able to catch the guy.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.160]   I'll find that story for you, because somebody just emailed it
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:37.360]   to me.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.200]   It's just amazing, really, what the ring video doorbell does.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.280]   Easy to replace your existing doorbell.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.320]   Or if you don't have a doorbell, you can even add it anywhere,
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   because the original ring has a big old battery the last year.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.640]   You could charge it up with the Mion battery.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.440]   Or if you don't need it, if you've got wires coming out
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.680]   of your door jam, because you have a regular doorbell there,
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.400]   you can use the new Ring Pro 1080p video.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.520]   Not just video, though.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.800]   It's got a microphone and a speaker on it.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.080]   And it's connected to your Wi-Fi.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.520]   So when somebody rings your doorbell,
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.640]   or even just walks up your steps,
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.960]   you'll get notified on your computer, on your phone,
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.480]   wherever you are in the world.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.800]   And that is kind of amazing.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.080]   I love the Ring video doorbell.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.720]   I want you to take a look at it.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.480]   Actually, they've got a whole range of products now.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.080]   The Ring, the Ring Pro.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.800]   They've got the new Stick Up Cam, which is basically
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.560]   a doorbell without the doorbell, just the camera, microphone,
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.240]   and speaker, so you can keep an eye on other parts
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.440]   of the property.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.600]   And you can power that with your new solar panel,
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.240]   so you don't even have to plug it in.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.520]   You can be completely wireless, which is really fantastic.
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.680]   You can put it out in the back 40.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.520]   Keep an eye on what's going on out there.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.120]   The Ring Chimes is nice, too.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.680]   That allows you to put a doorbell where you don't have a doorbell.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.880]   So if there's a part of your house, maybe your wood shop
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.520]   or out back, you can put a chime, plug it into the wall,
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:02.080]   pair it to the Wi-Fi.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.160]   And now you can hear the doorbell everywhere.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.560]   So they've put together a bunch of kits.
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.960]   They call them the Ring of Security Kits.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.040]   And you can save right now up to $150.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   Choose the kit with the devices you want.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.720]   Every kit, of course, gets this new illuminated Ring sign,
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.120]   which is a great way to let the bad guys know
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.560]   that you are protected.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.960]   And the sign has solar powered, so it's always
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.120]   brightly lit at night.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   You don't need to light your pathway, though.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.880]   I didn't mention this, but it has night vision.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.680]   So you can see everything going on at your door all the time.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.600]   I want you to go to ring.com/macbreak.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:42.040]   Ring.com/macbreak and pick your Ring of Security kit
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.720]   and big savings for you up to $150 off.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.200]   Ring.com/macbreak for yourself, your family,
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.800]   your friends, for your parents.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.520]   If you want to keep an eye on what's going on in your front
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.240]   walk and on your porch, this is such a great solution.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.040]   Ring.com/macbreak.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.160]   We're talking Macbreak Weekly.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.000]   Adam Anks is here from Tidbits.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.280]   You stayed home and watched the stream,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:08.960]   you said, on your Apple TV.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.240]   Yeah, we'll say that-- I mean, when it works,
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.840]   which it usually does pretty well,
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.880]   that's just such a win for not having travel across the country.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.320]   So nice, especially since you get one week notice.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.240]   Andy Inacroix does this day home, too.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.040]   He actually joined us for our stream.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:25.640]   I wasn't here.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.360]   I watched your-- you from Gainesville.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.640]   And that was a lot of fun with Jason and Megan and Andy.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.720]   Yeah, I was at the Microsoft event the day before,
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.440]   so that was another reason to keep me--
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.280]   Oh, keep on the use screen.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.040]   That was interesting juxtaposition, wasn't it?
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.040]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.560]   Also with us Renee Ritchie from iMore.com and Alex Lindsey.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.000]   I'm glad you're here today, Alex, because you, of all of us,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.160]   are the target market for any pro product Apple makes.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.320]   You do Final Cut, you do all sorts of video stuff,
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.120]   high-end graphics.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.040]   And so you're the audience at Apple.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.760]   Now, Apple's traditionally had, but I wonder,
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.400]   did you watch the Microsoft event?
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.560]   Did you look at the Surface Studio?
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.680]   I didn't watch either of the events.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   We were on streams.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.840]   Oh, you're busy.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.240]   I did read up the-- I read the cliff notes
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.600]   and saw the photos and saw some of the videos of all
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:23.800]   those bits and pieces.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:29.440]   I think this is a-- it's so surprising to see Microsoft go
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.480]   after this audience that traditionally Apple has owned.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.000]   They call the next edition of Windows, which comes out
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.480]   in March the Creative Edition.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.040]   They created a computer that really, at the price point
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.000]   of $3,000, same price point as the Mac Pro.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.200]   Of course, it includes a screen for that price, a 28-inch
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.160]   high-res Apple would call it retina,
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.640]   but that's an Apple marketing term.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.520]   High-res P3, full-color gamut.
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.120]   In fact, you have a little switch on it
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.880]   that could choose between SRGB and P3, which is kind of--
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.560]   I presume something professionals want.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.720]   But more importantly, it's a touchscreen.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:10.560]   You can use a pen.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.800]   It's pressure sensitive.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.560]   And you can tilt it to an angle like a drafting table,
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.320]   a 20-degree angle, and use that little knob, which
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.840]   reminds me a lot of the Griffin Powermate from this gone by.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.440]   That must be 20 years old now.
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.760]   But unlike the Powermate, you could put it on the screen.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.400]   It will sense that it's there if the right software is running
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:36.080]   and do something interesting with it, like give you a palette.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:38.920]   And a lot of it, it's very similar to a--
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:40.640]   I mean, it's like having a big whack-um tablet.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.160]   A centic.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.840]   I do believe there's still-- yeah, I mean, it's a centic.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.120]   But the centic's 1,500.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.400]   Is there a 28-inch centic?
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.720]   It's expensive.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.760]   I think there might be one, but it's about the price.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.480]   The centic is about the same price as the large centic
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.840]   is about the same price as that computer.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.160]   So I think that there are some definite advantages to that.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.880]   I think that--
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.600]   I do think Microsoft really knocked out of the park
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.880]   as far as price and performance and the kind of features
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.280]   that they put together.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.840]   Cintic is tops out at 27.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   27.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.240]   For sure is why they made it.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.640]   It was just a little--
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.640]   A little bit bigger.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.040]   Let me just see what the centic 28 would set me back here.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.000]   I was talking to some friends of mine who are creators,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.560]   as a matter of fact, as luck would have it,
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.200]   I was having lunch with a friend of mine who's a colorist.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.080]   It works for DC Comics and bounced some things off of her
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:32.880]   and some other people.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.040]   And that basically they could buy a brand new--
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.720]   the brand new Surface Studio for about what it would cost
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.440]   to upgrade their own studios to have third party stuff attached
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   to whatever they've got right now.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   People aren't--
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:48.280]   People aren't thrown by the price, particularly
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.480]   because as Alex, I think, will pull a test.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.760]   If you make money with your hardware,
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.400]   so long as you're making money with it,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.880]   you forget in 20 seconds that you paid $3,000 or $4,000
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.000]   for this if it's making you $8,000 or $10,000 a month.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.320]   And we have to acknowledge that whether it's
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:09.120]   Microsoft or Apple, this is a small segment, but--
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:10.120]   It's a high margin segment.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.920]   You know, psychologically it's an important segment.
[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.160]   It's an influential segment.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.880]   Yeah, it's hard to--
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.360]   Anyway--
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.320]   Well, if you look at--
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.720]   It's also innovative.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.320]   Yeah, this is--
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:19.880]   Well, that's right.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.520]   This is the--
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:20.960]   This is--
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:21.720]   This is the--
[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.760]   This is the driven PC marketplace for years
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:26.800]   because that's the stuff that really requires all the hardware.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:27.600]   And this is the same--
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.800]   This is similar, isn't it?
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.120]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.720]   This is the payoff of a lot of decisions
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.080]   that Microsoft has been making over the past three
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.920]   or four or five years.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:36.720]   And I'll list--
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.040]   I'm sure we'll get into this later on.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.800]   But this is the sort of thing you're hoping--
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.200]   This is the video that you're hoping that Apple shows off
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.000]   after they say, can't innovate my ass.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Well, let me show you how we can innovate.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.760]   And that's what you're hoping to see.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.520]   Well, if you watched the video, the ad for it--
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.680]   I mean, if I hadn't told you ahead of time,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.640]   you would think, oh, I'm watching a surface ad.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.320]   I mean, Apple ad.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.440]   Yeah, let me play--
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.200]   Yeah, let me just play a little bit of it for you
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:05.720]   because it's--
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.600]   And I'll play the music too because this is from the--
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.440]   from Willy Wonka, right?
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.160]   [LAUGHS]
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.640]   So you--
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:21.600]   So it's a very happily kind of close up
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.280]   focusing on the feel.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:26.760]   In fact, that even looks like the Apple invitation.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.400]   Also, also, there's a lot of theater involved too.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.800]   When they showed it off on stage, it was deployed
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.440]   and it's like desktop iMac configuration.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.120]   And they waited until after the video saying, look,
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.400]   we can actually fold it flat to a drafting table angle.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.240]   They did that last year too, but Nespun A
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.760]   is very good at the reveal.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.400]   So there's one little problem.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.160]   It's running Windows.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.240]   And I'm wondering if that makes a difference
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   to the creative audience.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.040]   That's not available until next year.
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.720]   Unfortunately, you can't run Aperture--
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.880]   oh, wait, you can't run Aperture on the Macs either.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.600]   Well, you can't run Photoshop.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.120]   Oh, you can't run everything but Final Cut on it.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.560]   Basically, this is a lot of--
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.800]   I see this is a lot of chickens coming home to roost
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.520]   after Apple has basically said, well, fine, leave us
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:18.840]   if you don't like the new Final Cut.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:20.000]   We don't care about you.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.360]   Fine, leave us if you don't-- if you need the new Aperture.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.200]   We don't care about you either.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.760]   And so they realized that they wound up
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.840]   with a lot of Mac users who are now
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.160]   switched completely to apps that are available on any platform.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.360]   So for a lot of users--
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.040]   I think it would be a lateral move to go from whatever they're
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.440]   using right now, a Mac Pro to a Surface Studio,
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.120]   if they thought that the Surface Studio was a compelling
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.640]   device for them.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.720]   And I think that I think that the creative group
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.760]   would--
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.600]   folks that I work with for us--
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.560]   it'd be a big change to switch over to Windows on a variety
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.000]   of bits and pieces.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.800]   I think that--
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.080]   Well, as you mentioned, for a second--
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.440]   OZO has Mac software, right?
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.680]   Yeah, but that'll probably evolve over time.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.240]   I think that that was where they started.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.760]   And there's a handful of things that we can only use.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.720]   Of course, we actually use Final Cut, which, by the way,
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:17.680]   had probably one of the more important updates last week
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.080]   as well.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.440]   And so it's a huge upgrade for the platform.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.920]   It is.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.560]   So for instance, we abandoned it here
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:31.440]   because-- well, the lagging hardware platform,
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.960]   but also because of some technical issues.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:37.560]   We couldn't use our SAN with the Ruby released Final Cut.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.640]   So we went to Adobe Premiere and Dell Workstation.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.240]   And a lot of the SAM and SMB issues have all been--
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.120]   I know those have been long, long handled.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.200]   Had we stayed with Final Cut, we'd be OK.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.640]   Now, although we'd be kind of bemoaning the 3 and 1/2
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:52.160]   year old Mac Pro.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.960]   But I mean, do you got to look at what you're also doing?
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.520]   I mean, what makes more of a difference for Final Cut,
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.640]   for instance, is the drive speed.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.400]   So if you're able to get faster drive speeds,
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.920]   you can still edit--
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.640]   I mean, I edit 4K on my laptop.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.680]   The Mac Pro is still understandable, too.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.400]   But it still, as I said, most people aren't doing that much 4K.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.680]   And we're already able to do that right now with that.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.960]   So it does need to be updated.
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.240]   I will get into my complaints about that.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.840]   Do professionals go into the 5K iMac?
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.680]   Because, of course, that is faster.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.400]   No, I think a lot of people are still using the Mac Pro
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.560]   because of the connections.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.160]   I think that's what really makes a difference for a lot of them.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.760]   Now, definitely, they're doing smaller things.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:42.400]   And the thing we have to realize is that while we talk about high-end
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.600]   film professionals and TV professionals,
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.080]   the vast majority of users in the education market,
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.280]   corporate market, personal market, at the price point
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.360]   that Final Cut is running with the level of performance
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:58.120]   that it provides, the other--
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:00.240]   Premier and Avid don't really make a lot of sense.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.560]   I mean, you're paying-- there hasn't been an upgrade cost
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.120]   for Final Cut since it came out, since the new version came out.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.160]   At $300, it's really hard to--
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.680]   and now what's happened with the--
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.240]   we just had a Mac break or a Final Cut virtual user
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:13.960]   group last night.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.840]   So if you go to the X-Cores YouTube channel,
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.040]   you'll see a big breakdown by the pros talking about this.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.040]   But what Apple did is instead of trying
[00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.360]   to do whiz-bang features for Final Cut,
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.920]   they basically changed the way that they manage audio,
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.720]   metadata on audio, all the things
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.600]   that you need to do a big film, to do a big complicated--
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.880]   the heavy lifting of doing really complex edits,
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.920]   stuff that they really took on as far as organizational process.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.920]   Is it too late?
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:45.280]   No, Apple-- I think Apple has a larger--
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.160]   Apple has a larger installed base of Final Cut right now
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.000]   than they had when--
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.440]   OK.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.840]   Because I kept hearing you know,
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.160]   Hollywood was abandoning Final Cut over the last couple of years.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.560]   Yeah, but Hollywood is-- there's a huge pyramid of users.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.520]   Hollywood's just a little slice.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.560]   You know, so when it comes to actual mass,
[00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.160]   I don't think that Final Cut's in any trouble there.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.360]   And they continue to upgrade it.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.080]   And the challenge that both Adobe and Avid will have
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.360]   is that they're on an older code base,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.040]   and they're not going to be able to innovate as fast,
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.640]   you know, as far as adding a lot of these features
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.280]   and continuing to move that stuff forward.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:22.720]   So at this point, Final Cut has surpassed what Premiere can do?
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.440]   Yeah, I opened up-- I mean, there's some tools
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.880]   that I've used in Premiere to, you know,
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.120]   and I interrupt ability with After Effects,
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.360]   and Photoshop is still pretty useful,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.280]   but I could never go back to--
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.000]   Interesting.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.960]   Layer, tracks, like that whole--
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.320]   it's cute, but it's 20 years old.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.240]   And so if you're actually wanting to work quickly,
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.720]   you know, what Apple is really--
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.520]   what their team has really gotten good at is metadata
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.040]   and being able to find things and organize things
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.240]   very, very quickly.
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.960]   You can be-- you know, at this point,
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:02.840]   Final Cut can bring in all the IAM XML
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.200]   and a lot of the other metadata that is available.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.800]   So there's a lot of things that can be done
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   with that.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.280]   So for that group of people, they're still--
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:15.320]   you know, they're still going to use a Mac.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.360]   Now, for people using Photoshop, you know,
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.680]   it's just a matter of them getting over the idea of using a PC.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.200]   Photoshop Mac and PC is identical.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.560]   Lightroom Mac and PC is identical.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.040]   Right?
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:26.680]   It is, other than use the rest of the computer.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.360]   It depends on how much you use the rest of the computer.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.400]   You know, for a Mac user, it's still--
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.120]   I mean, I have a Surface tablet as well as a Mac,
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.400]   and I carry them around.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:35.760]   And I--
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.240]   I do.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.360]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.680]   So I'm not-- but it's still more painful.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.000]   You know, I mean, Windows is not as easy to use
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.040]   as so on and so forth than a Mac.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.600]   So the-- and I've been going back and forth between PCs
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.040]   for 25 years.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:58.200]   And so it's-- I think that the interesting thing here
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.480]   is that what I find myself now looking at
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.800]   is that I really--
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:03.880]   and what I talked to a little bit before the commercial break
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.000]   is I really wish Apple would just release the Mac OS
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.240]   and let us run it on any hardware
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.240]   and stop worrying about it.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.880]   I don't think that they're making hardware.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.200]   I don't think they're making hardware for professionals
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:12.560]   anymore.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.480]   I don't think that the Mac Pro is--
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.640]   So that's-- OK, so let's get down to it,
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.000]   because that's really what this conversation is.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.880]   And I led off with Microsoft just showing
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.880]   that they're at least eyeballing that market
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:27.160]   and trying to make something that might get that market excited
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.360]   with the Surface Studio.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.240]   But really where this conversation begins
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.000]   is with the Apple event.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.640]   And we've all been watching with interest
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:41.440]   to see-- for some commitment from Apple to the Macintosh,
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.800]   as we've talked about how they haven't been updated much,
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.080]   but then we've also pointed out that Intel hasn't really
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.040]   given us a reason.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:55.040]   There are new GPUs out there and so forth.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.040]   And now they've announced laptops
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.720]   where it looks to some--
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.880]   and you can go back and forth on this--
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:07.520]   that Apple has prioritized thin and light and battery life
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.280]   over power.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.560]   If I hear thin and light one more time from that--
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.160]   Well, and Francis Apple said, we're
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.560]   not going to make more than 16 gigs of RAM available,
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.120]   because we want to save battery life.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:21.720]   So I think that--
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.760]   And the pro will look at that, right, and say, well, that's--
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.200]   I mean, I've heard you say I had a 32 gig Mac Pro,
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.000]   and you said, well, that's about the minimum.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.240]   Well, if you're using Photoshop, it's very memory hungry.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.680]   I presume that Final Cut is as well.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.400]   Well, I believe that some of the restrictions--
[00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.840]   and I can't remember where I read this--
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.840]   I was looking through some articles
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.600]   that some of that might be some esoteric--
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.480]   well, not esoteric, but restrictions of the FAA
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.280]   related to checking--
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:52.880]   Oh, really?
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:53.720]   --100 watt--
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.280]   Oh, there's a--
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.920]   --100 watt hour Macs on the--
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.400]   Yeah, that didn't--
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.600]   And I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:04.480]   Well, Phil Schiller sent a note to a Mac rumors reader
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.200]   saying, thank you for the email.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:06.960]   It's a good question.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.680]   To put more than 16 gigs of fast RAM
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.520]   in a notebook design at this time
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.600]   would require a memory system that consumes much more power
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.480]   and wouldn't be efficient enough for a notebook.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.880]   I hope you check out this new generation Mac book pro.
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.760]   It really is an incredible system.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.600]   Maybe there are other reasons, but I mean, sure--
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:22.800]   Oh, it's--
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   --it's--
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.600]   --it's about battery life.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   It's complicated because there's--
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.200]   Well, battery life--
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.760]   --over that 100 watt hour.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.240]   So they want a certain--
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.320]   like, for instance, if they did all of that,
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.760]   they're still stuck with the same size battery.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.280]   And so you end up with it lasting for an hour and a half
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.360]   if it's not plugged in.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.360]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.120]   So if they were going to put more RAM in it,
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.440]   they'd want to put a bigger battery.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.160]   And then they would run up against.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.240]   Yeah, so it's a little bit complicated.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.640]   So what happens is Intel Skylake still does not support
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.200]   the low power version of DDR4 RAM.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.040]   That's been pushed to Kaby Lake.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.360]   And maybe it won't land in Kaby Lake.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.480]   Maybe it'll go to Coffee Cake.
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.360]   It's not going to coffee lake or Canon Lake even.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.200]   So in order to use low power RAM,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.280]   Apple is limited to 16 gigabytes.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.320]   They can go-- oh, they can do what some other companies have
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:05.600]   done.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.840]   And that is use a different chipset
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.280]   that allows you to put in more RAM.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.080]   But then you don't get the low power version anymore.
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:11.800]   And you get what Alex said.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.360]   You get two hours of battery life.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:14.680]   And it's a real restriction.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.880]   The battery, you cannot ship--
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:17.720]   like, you cannot literally ship it to customers
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.320]   or customers cannot take it on airplanes
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.200]   if that battery goes over a certain size.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.640]   It's why the iPad Pro filled up the case with speakers
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.240]   and not battery, even though people like just--
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   but more battery.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.960]   And it becomes illegal at a certain size
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.520]   and a certain cell density to put more battery in.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.160]   So the thinner and lighter is sort of Apple--
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.920]   lying is the wrong word.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.720]   By choosing the parts that they chose,
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.480]   they are constrained to a certain size.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.960]   They can't make the computer bigger.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.080]   So the case thing gets to shrink,
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.360]   because all the other components of shrunk,
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.200]   because that's what technology does over time.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.320]   So they can literally put the case in the dryer for a while.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.600]   And it ends up being smaller.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.320]   But the smaller is not a design goal.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.280]   The smaller and lighter is a result of them being on Skylake,
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.880]   having this memory limitation, having
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.160]   this power envelope that they want,
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.320]   this thermal envelope that they have,
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.760]   and the power levels they want to meet.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.240]   And then all of those parts come together,
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.880]   and they basically wrap it up in a shiny aluminum coating.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.200]   So it is an absolute limit of technology
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.600]   given the choice that Apple wants to make.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.720]   Or their unwillingness to make a giant desktop version
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.200]   of a laptop.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.920]   Well, or a slightly thicker version of a desktop.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.240]   It doesn't work either.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.920]   It doesn't work either.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.120]   Remember how just a month ago they were saying,
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.320]   oh, it's so hard.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.440]   We have so little space.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.880]   If only we had more space to put all kinds of wonderful things
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.240]   in these things.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.520]   But that's a tiny problem.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.120]   - But you've fallen at the water, you can see.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.200]   - But I'm saying that a laptop,
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.560]   you could make it a larger case.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.080]   Even if you're constrained by what you can do
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:44.280]   with battery size, you can still make it really
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.880]   one of the best high end laptops you can possibly can
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.440]   in terms of convenience and features.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.360]   But they decided they wanted to make it
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.720]   three millimeters thinner.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.480]   - It would be a bigger case that is still empty
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   because the components would be the same size inside it.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:01.040]   - Well, you could fill it with a decent keyboard.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.960]   You could fill it with the SD card slot.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.800]   - That is absolutely.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.480]   - You could fill it with all kinds of other things.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:07.160]   You wouldn't be filled with air.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:09.080]   - And I know that we're obsessed with these USB,
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.280]   you know, USB-C.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.240]   But limiting that to only those just means that we have,
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.480]   I just have a whole bunch of other things
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.560]   that I now have to have in my bag just to connect to it.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.200]   I still look back at when Andy said
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.680]   that we would miss the ethernet.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.400]   And I think of that, you know, every day.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.640]   'Cause I hook on a ethernet cable up to my computer.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.400]   And we're talking about pro users.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.520]   So the thing is, is we're not talking about, you know,
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.120]   I get it to have like one or two USB-C's
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.200]   in a consumer laptop in the Mac book or whatever.
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.320]   But when you're talking about pros,
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.080]   we're gonna hook peripherals in, you know,
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.880]   and we're gonna be on the road where a MagSafe
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.920]   is really an important piece of material for us.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.840]   I mean, I, you know, I'm now looking back to the years
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.920]   where my computer got yanked off of, you know,
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:53.800]   I'm looking at this USB-C as power.
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.840]   And considering the years that I had my computers
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.600]   yanked off my desk, had the pins bent, broken, you know,
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.560]   all of those things had gone away with the MagSafe
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.320]   for a long time.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.920]   And Apple chose to, you know, take that out.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.400]   You know, which was, you know,
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.080]   I almost want someone to build like a case with a battery
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.440]   that goes around my MacBook, you know, a MacBook Pro
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.440]   that builds me a flush Maglo.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.880]   - My Mac, a MacSafe.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.640]   - Like a lot of real size mophie.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.320]   - Yeah, right.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.560]   - But there are more fun, I mean, with all due respect,
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.680]   Alex, there are more fundamental issues.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.960]   The lack of more than 16 gigs of RAM, it's DDR3,
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.320]   not DDR4 RAM.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.360]   We're now learning the details of the Radeon
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.960]   that is in there, the Polaris architecture.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:42.640]   They're very unimpressive compared.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.920]   I guess the real point, and a lot of people are saying is
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:49.600]   I can buy a PC laptop for half the price
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.480]   with twice the power.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.360]   And Apple, because they're the only people
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.520]   who make this thing,
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:59.840]   Apple's really turning its back on the power user.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:01.440]   - But here's the thing, I mean, and, you know,
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.600]   and Alex can certainly talk to this more.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.000]   It feels to me as though the laptop is never
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.560]   gonna be your main machine.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.080]   - It is my machine.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.400]   - Oh, it is.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.240]   - But there's only--
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.560]   - There's so many of us.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.880]   - Well, and I think that's what Apple's
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.360]   proposing is that that or your iPad Pro
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.360]   is your main machine. - No, but they're also saying
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:21.840]   that a power user is changing, like,
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.560]   John Densidarski was very vocal on Twitter saying,
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:24.480]   "I'm a power user.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.360]   I don't do any video, but you can't not call me a power user."
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.040]   And I love this, or I don't know if you say a lot,
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.080]   but he really liked it.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.160]   There's, based on at least the responses I'm getting,
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.160]   there is a huge gulf now in what we determine
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.040]   as a power user.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.920]   Video professionals absolutely hate this machine.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.640]   They hate the RAM limits, they hate the interconnects,
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.880]   they hate everything, all the choices made in here.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.560]   But there is this huge other swap of people
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:46.880]   who also self-identify as professionals.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.040]   Even some of them who do photography, not all photographers,
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:51.720]   but developers and people in design industries
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:54.560]   and all sorts of other areas who absolutely consider themselves
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.080]   pros and are thrilled to have modern high-speed connects
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:00.400]   on this thing, just thrilled to have a P3 display
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.720]   and are thrilled to have the things that Apple is focusing on.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.240]   So I think it's also dangerous when you just lump all power
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.240]   users into one big bucket.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.040]   - Alex, I'm sorry, Adam, you're about to say.
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.840]   - You're talking like the 4K, you're talking about
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:13.800]   the Retina, the 5K Retina, I'm Eric.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   I mean, that's a 4 gigahertz Intel Core, quad core i7.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.120]   And that's on mine, which is the original one.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.080]   I don't know what the current speeds are.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.480]   It's gonna be a lot faster.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.960]   It's gonna have a better screen.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.840]   There's just no question about that.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.600]   And so the laptops, yeah, they're fine machines.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.000]   Don't get me wrong, but they're just never gonna match up
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.040]   to the desktops.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:39.600]   - I don't, but that's not one word.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.880]   - Okay, but it's like, there are a lot of people that,
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:45.720]   I can't afford to have a top of the line MacBook
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.760]   and a top of the line iMac.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.960]   Okay, this is going to be my, it's very correct to say
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:56.720]   that you can't really define one type of person
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.920]   as a professional user.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.880]   There are a lot of people for whom this is going to be
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.360]   the hub of my entire life, whether you're working
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.160]   in an office or you're self-employed, you're a writer,
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   you're a photographer, whatever.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:09.160]   And I think that something that gets thrown
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.840]   into the bus is people who don't necessarily want
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.360]   extreme high power, but they want convenience.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.720]   They don't wanna have to travel with a increasingly big bag
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.120]   full of dongles and attachments.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.400]   They don't want, they wanna have a comfortable keyboard
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.880]   or even a decent keyboard to work with
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.520]   that saving three millimeters off the thickness
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:32.240]   of a device adds nothing to the power of the device.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:34.400]   And once again, we have the, we just butt heads
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:37.640]   with a situation that if this were Dell
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   who decided to make these changes, okay, well,
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.720]   if that's too bad, I guess I'll take a look at Lenovo
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.920]   and take a look at what Microsoft is doing with Apple,
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:48.520]   it becomes, is this the machine that I,
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.400]   do I need a machine of this class?
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.720]   Yes, or is there a platform-wide limitation
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.600]   that I can't work around?
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.760]   No, yes, there is.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.600]   So, okay, so I guess that you're kind of screwed out
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.680]   of having a mobile Macintosh for the entire future.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.520]   - And it's not-- - And I know
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.640]   so much better than the previous MacBook.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:07.240]   I mean, the 12-inch MacBook was a disaster that way.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.240]   - Well, the 12-inch MacBook was a--
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.240]   - Well, the 12-inch MacBook was a trusser.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.160]   - Was it C4 compared to fourth under both ports?
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.560]   - The 12-inch MacBook had an advantage
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:18.120]   in that it was designed to be smaller.
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.400]   It was designed to be lighter.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.600]   It was for people who wanted to make that vote,
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:23.520]   for people who were frustrated maybe that,
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.360]   gee, I really wish there was something even lighter than,
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:30.280]   I wish there was, I envy somewhat some of the Windows
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.200]   ultra lights that are more powerful than a MacBook Air
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.200]   have the higher density screen, have a touchscreen,
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.080]   have all these really nice creature comforts.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.680]   But are super, super light.
[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:40.400]   And if you didn't like it, that's no problem
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.800]   'cause there's still MacBook Airs,
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   there are still MacBook nothings, excuse me,
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.960]   there's still a MacBook Pros on there.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.360]   - No, I don't think the complaint is about the Macs
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.080]   that they're offering, the complaint is that there isn't
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:51.360]   one more Mac that's a no compromise MacBook.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:52.360]   - It made a lower- - I think that's
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.800]   a few version that took out all the,
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:55.200]   like you could get one with less ports
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.600]   and you could get one without the Magic Bar,
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.080]   but you can't get one on top of the 15 inches that says,
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.560]   hey, we're giving you a couple extra ports,
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.160]   we're giving you a better graphics option.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:03.360]   Yeah, there's less battery life,
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.840]   but if you keep it plugged in at your desk most of the time
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:07.200]   or plugged in at work most of the time
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.120]   then you don't care, you have this offering.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.440]   And that to me is the harder part.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.160]   Like the dongles I don't really care about,
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.320]   like the MacBook helped me get rid of those.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.760]   I'll keep dongles for a year.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.640]   And I was looking after this event
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:20.400]   because I was furious about the ports and the lack of dongles
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:23.240]   and I realized I had the MagSafe one to MagSafe to adapter,
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.200]   the ethernet adapter that had to then change
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.960]   from this kind of ethernet adapter to that.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.600]   And I've stopped, over the course of the year,
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.800]   I've stopped using them.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:31.440]   And it's easy to stop using a dongle.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.160]   It is impossible to take an old connection.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.000]   - Just put a new iPhone.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:34.840]   - You can actually put a new iPhone.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.840]   You can't connect it to your MacBook Pro.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.840]   - I haven't connected my iPhone.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.840]   - And frankly, you have them better in years.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.840]   - You have them two pairs of headphones now.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.840]   - Good for you Renee.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.840]   - Yeah, but lots of other people do.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.840]   And now you need two kinds of headphones
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:48.840]   because the headphones that work, I mean, it's as if,
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:51.840]   I don't know, it seems like they could have done one more.
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:53.840]   - I mean, I'm just looking at, I'm just looking at
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:54.840]   like, scheduling snacks.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.840]   - I don't even use headphones and I've got four pairs
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:57.840]   sitting on my desk.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:58.840]   (laughing)
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.840]   - I mean, there's, like I said, there's absolutely fine.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.840]   And there's a scheduling snafu here because that iPhone,
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.840]   this MacBook was supposed to be out before that iPhone.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.840]   So that headphones would not exist in the world
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.840]   with this thing actually shipped on time.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:11.840]   - Okay.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.840]   - And they don't, you know, and they,
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:16.840]   and there is the lightning USB, USB-C cable.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.840]   - Yeah, no, there's no, you have dongles
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   that can make it work with everything.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.840]   - It's just a different, it's a different cable.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.840]   I mean, you know, you're paying $3,000 for a laptop out there.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:25.840]   - Yeah.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.840]   - $2,000 for a laptop.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:27.840]   - Yeah.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:28.840]   - It's now a couple of, a couple of,
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.840]   a couple of, a couple of, here and there is in the big deal.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:32.840]   - It's not the money.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:33.840]   It is that, you know, I spend a lot,
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.840]   I mean, I do 250,000 miles a year on the road.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.840]   And the thing is, is that for me, it's all about,
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:40.840]   I can't go somewhere now and get a connector
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   that's gonna work.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   You know, like with a regular USB, for instance,
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.840]   you know, now I gotta figure that out.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.840]   If I, if I lost something, forgot something.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.840]   And then again, the number one reason I don't travel,
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:53.840]   I got a 12 inch, you know, a little MacBook or whatever.
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.840]   And the number one reason I stopped using it was because
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840]   I didn't have a MagSafe.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.840]   Like, like, like when I'm traveling,
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.840]   it is getting, my computers are sitting on my lap,
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.840]   they're getting pulled, they're getting pushed,
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.840]   they're whatever.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:04.840]   And I was just like, I was, I was just in the door
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:05.840]   that I was gonna break it.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.840]   I was gonna break it, you know, and I'm just,
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.840]   and when you're used to a MagSafe,
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:11.840]   I mean, it is one of the best things that Apple ever created
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.840]   and to take it out of the laptop line is literally, you know,
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.840]   I don't, you know, I'm kind of mystified by that.
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.840]   You know, it's, it is a, you know, because it is the thing
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:24.840]   when you're, as a road warrior, it is the thing that you,
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.840]   you know, people kick it out all the time.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.840]   And you just, you're always plugging it back in,
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.840]   going, oh, I'm really glad that wasn't a hard connection,
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:32.840]   you know, to my computer.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.840]   And, and especially the way these things are built
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:38.840]   where they're basically not really fixable if they break.
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:41.840]   So, so they're, you know, those kinds of things
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.840]   are going to be lethal, you know, and, and so,
[00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.840]   and, you know, we, we have a lot of them, you know,
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.840]   so I have, you know, it's, it's not just that I'm,
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.840]   that I have a MacBook Pro, like, you know, I have, I have 40 of them,
[00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:53.840]   you know, like we are in the company.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   And so we have to decide when and how we're going to upgrade those,
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   and, you know, and, and so on, so forth.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.840]   And I don't know.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:03.840]   Like, like I literally don't know how I'm going to manage that process.
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.840]   You know, we'll do it begrudgingly at some point, but it's, you know,
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.840]   I'm just sure that I'm in half of them, and I get messed up.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:12.840]   I have to, I accept that Apple can't make a computer for everybody.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   It can't even make one computer for the five of us.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.840]   Yes.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:22.840]   So I understand that, but it, and I'm not even complaining
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.840]   because frankly, the MacBook Pro is fine for me,
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:29.840]   but I'm, I'm, I do see a lot of people saying,
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:31.840]   we wish there were more power.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.840]   Well, I just wish that I, again, I,
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.840]   and everybody's talking about this article in Medium, by the way.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.840]   This is, Apple just told.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:37.840]   Which is a little confused.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.840]   I'm not sure I think, I don't know if that's the article.
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:42.840]   I was just like, we looked at it.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.840]   I was like, oh, you know.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.840]   The article was Apple.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:45.840]   It was just announced to the world.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:48.840]   It doesn't know who the Mac book Pro is for.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   I think it knows exactly who it wants to get with the MacBook Pro,
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   and it's married some decisions that, you know,
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.840]   we're going to prioritize thin and light, for instance,
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.840]   and better battery life over more power.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.840]   We don't want to have a fourth skew that is a super MacBook Pro.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.840]   I'm just wondering what that means for the professional.
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:11.840]   What that means for a segment of the market that Apple has really
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:12.840]   owned for a long time.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:14.840]   I would like to share a deeply about it.
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:16.840]   Well, that's the real issue.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:19.840]   Is there a lot of people who are very upset about this?
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:20.840]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:24.840]   To me, it's not the issue of making professionals happy,
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:26.840]   because it's easy to say, well, Apple's a consumer company,
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.840]   and they're a lifestyle brand.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:30.840]   They're not a maker of profite and computers anymore.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.840]   I think it really is about the question of, if I walk into an
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.840]   Apple store with money that it took me time to earn that I value,
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   do I get to have what I want and what I need?
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:43.840]   Or am I going to have someone tell me, oh, you'll get used to it?
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   Or, oh, you know, you're just hanging out with something that's
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.840]   old fashioned and you're just one of these people that is,
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   you're an edge case.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.840]   It doesn't matter.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:55.840]   I mean, for $2,000, I mean, help for $200, I should be able to
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.840]   get something that I want.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.840]   And so that it really does borderline depress me that time
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.840]   and time again when Apple comes out with something new,
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   when someone makes a legitimate complaint and there are legitimate
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.840]   complaints abound about new hardware, it becomes, you'll get
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.840]   used to it.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:14.840]   Not this is perfect.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.840]   This is wonderfully designed.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:16.840]   This is thoughtfully put out.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.840]   This is a, there are reasons why this decision was made and they
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:21.840]   are consumer positive.
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.840]   It's don't worry.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.840]   And a couple of years you were going to be using this connector
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.840]   anyway.
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.840]   And until then you'll be using dongles and it'll be what you'll
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:29.840]   get used to it.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:30.840]   Come on.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.840]   You're just getting stuck in the model.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.840]   For me, it really is hitting me personally because the keyboard
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.840]   is terrible.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:36.840]   Okay.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:37.840]   That's an obvious thing.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.840]   You try the new one because some people are saying, yes, it's
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:40.840]   the same as the Macbook.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:41.840]   It's pretty much the same.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:44.840]   It's a second generation, but it feels like it has more travel.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:48.440]   I've had only 10 or 15 minutes with it and I can't really tell
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.840]   the difference between that and the old keyboard.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   And to me, it is a real showstopper because I agree with you.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.840]   And it's not that accurately with the Macbook.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.840]   And it's not just, again, I didn't really complain about it when I
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:55:59.840]   reviewed the Macbook.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.840]   Nothing because, again, there's a reason for making a super
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:02.840]   flat keyboard.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:03.840]   There's almost no space for anything.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.840]   There's no space for air molecules inside there, literally.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.840]   But, I mean, this is, there's a reason why some people buy the
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:12.840]   Macbook Pro and not the Macbook Air or whatever is going to replace
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.840]   the Macbook Air.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.840]   It's because I am making the vote that I'm willing to get a
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.840]   computer that's a little bit thicker and a little bit heavier,
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:21.840]   but I want to be able to be sure that when I plop that on the
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:24.840]   podium, when I give one of my talks, I don't have to think,
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:25.840]   "Oh, God, damn it.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:26.840]   I forgot the light.
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:28.840]   I didn't bring my ethernet thing.
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:29.840]   Oh, damn it.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:30.840]   I didn't bring my adapter for this."
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:31.840]   Or, "Damn it.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.840]   I need to plug in this thumb drive, but I don't have the right
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.840]   port.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:37.840]   I don't have a USB 8 style style port in this.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.840]   I needed to bring the right adapter for this."
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:45.840]   But, with the keyboard, that's an absolute show stopper.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.840]   I can't underscore this enough.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.840]   That is an absolute show stopper.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.840]   And for no rational reason, they have decided to put this
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   terrible flat keyboard on the premium machine that's going to
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.840]   cost me thousands of dollars.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.840]   And I'm really, I'm very, I think one of the greatest gifts I
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:05.840]   gave myself was accidentally dumping an entire can of Diet
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:09.840]   Dr. Pepper into my perfectly good two-year-old Macbook last
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:13.840]   year, forcing me to buy one in 2015 because this one is going
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:15.840]   to last me a couple of years now.
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.840]   And I am, for the first time in my life, I am trying to get my
[00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:23.840]   head around the fact that in two years, I will need to buy a new
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.840]   notebook and that notebook will not be made by Apple.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.840]   It will not run Mac OS.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   It's not because I think that Apple has stopped innovating.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.840]   It's not because I think that the Mac still isn't my favorite
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:33.840]   operating system.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:37.840]   It's because this keyboard is absolutely unusable to me.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.840]   And if you like it, that's great.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.840]   I'm not saying you're stupid for liking what you like.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.840]   But I'm saying that I'm not an idiot, I'm not old fashioned,
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.840]   and I'm not refusing to get used to something because my fingers
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.840]   are telling me this is a crappy Atari 1983 keyboard.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.840]   I mean, I bought this as luck would have it.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.840]   I bought this on eBay.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.840]   This is a ThinkPad external keyboard.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:03.840]   They took the keyboard off of a ThinkPad, a Lenovo ThinkPad,
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.840]   and made it into this external.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.840]   And it's gorgeous.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:08.840]   It's beautiful to use.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:10.840]   I love typing on this thing.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.840]   And it absolutely cost me $48 and it absolutely kicks the
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.840]   ass of the keyboard on this $2,000 device.
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:21.840]   So it just bothers me that I'm going to have to maybe, actually
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:26.840]   likely, buy either buy a Windows laptop in a year or two or decide
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.840]   that I can get buy without having an actual laptop.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.840]   And if there were a reason why Apple did that, I would say,
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.840]   "Great, that's technology forward, good for you."
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.840]   But they basically said, "Hey, three millimeters thinner.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.840]   You're welcome."
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.840]   So it's also possible they screwed up.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:43.840]   I mean, they have done that.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.840]   Like the iPod shuffle when they--
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:48.840]   No, I mean, the iPod shuffle when they went to no buttons.
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:49.840]   Like, we're innovating.
[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.840]   There's no buttons, and they very quickly--
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:53.840]   So the thing with Apple is there's so few products that when they
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.840]   make these big gambles, they have to win.
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:56.840]   They have to win every time.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:57.840]   To me, that's the challenge.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.840]   You know, in a PC marketplace, if you're buying a Windows machine,
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   there's such a variety and there's so much competition that you can
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.840]   almost certainly find something that is pretty close to what you're looking for.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.840]   But Apple's the only company that makes these.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.840]   And this is kind of to what you were saying, Alex, that maybe they should
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:17.840]   let the Mac OS fly free and let some other companies make these things.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:18.840]   But this is the choice.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   These are what they give us.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:24.840]   And Apple doesn't want to make a 20 different skews of the Mac book.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:25.840]   I understand that.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.840]   So it fors a lot, frankly.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.840]   But they got to make the right ones.
[00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:32.840]   And right now, they're making a really weird collection of them too.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.840]   But maybe--
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.840]   I mean, I'm going to trust that they've done a lot of research,
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.840]   that they've looked, talked to their--
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   If you're a business, what you're going to do is try--
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   Knowing you can only make four or five models of laptops is trying to make
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:47.840]   the ones that are going to sell the best, right?
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:47.840]   Or no.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.840]   But sometimes they think they know better.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.840]   I mean, they do look at numbers in a cuddly smart company.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:52.840]   They prototype everything.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.840]   They're all sorts of different versions of these Mac books.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.840]   And these are the ones they chose to go with.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.840]   But sometimes it's also just their gut.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.840]   We think the market is going this way.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.840]   You can't always follow the markets because then you never sort of get the
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.840]   customers to come on.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.840]   And I spend a lot of time defending Apple.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.840]   And people will call me out on it.
[01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.840]   I just want to explain why they made these choices.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.840]   And then you can choose to hate them or to love them.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.840]   And you can say it's not for you.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.840]   And I've not spent enough time with this MacBook Pro to make my own choice yet
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.840]   because I'm coming from a 13-inch with the keyboard that Andy mentioned
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.840]   and a lot of things that I love about it and a lot of different ports.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.840]   But this is absolutely the one they want to make.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:29.840]   And if they bet wrong on this, we'll see a quick change next year.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.840]   But it's definitely the most divisive MacBook I think I've ever seen,
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.840]   even more than the MacBook 12.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:38.840]   And for whatever your opinion on this, and everybody's probably also read
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   Chuck von Russbeck's pieces on this as well.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.840]   And he says, "This event's criticism has been louder, more widespread and
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.840]   angrier than I remember seeing for a long time."
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.840]   I mean, I just would have, as a Mac Pro user, I would have preferred them to make...
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.840]   I just wish they just made minor updates.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.840]   Like, don't even do it, man.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   That's what Chuck says.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.840]   He says, "Chuck, the problem is we demand Apple Innovate, but we insist they don't
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.840]   change anything."
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.840]   But I think it's true.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.840]   No, we insist they don't screw it up.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.840]   You know, like it is...
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.840]   If you're going to innovate, innovate good.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.840]   No, it's true.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:13.840]   You have to.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.840]   But it's just that they're so obsessed with, you know, forgetting the past
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.840]   and minimalism at this point, that's fine for the iPhone.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840]   You want to get rid of the headphone jack?
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.840]   That's fine.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.840]   But the thing is, is that as pros, we do have needs.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.840]   And the thing is we have need for it.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.840]   You know, like, you know, and the thing is, is we have to tie this together.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.840]   And the thing is, we don't care about it being thinner or smaller.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.840]   Like, we don't care.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840]   Like, don't care.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840]   Like, you know, like, it is...
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.840]   You know, like, you know, I don't care that it's a little bit lighter and a little bit
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.840]   whatever, it doesn't matter to me.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.840]   Like, I just want it to be fast and, you know, fast and work well
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:52.840]   and have a good keyboard and be something that is the one computer that wanders around in
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.840]   my backpack, you know, that's giving me, you know, that's sending me to the chiropractor.
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:56.840]   You know, I don't care.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.840]   You know, I don't care what that looks like.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.840]   If you look at the rest of my backpack, it's ten times more, you know, heavy than whatever
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:03.840]   I'm carrying here.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:08.840]   And so, the thing is, is that we need it to work well, you know, and I guess, you know,
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.840]   I would have been happy.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.840]   I probably would have been less bitter if I had...
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   The mags, if I know it seems like a little thing, but it's going to, you know, there's going
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.840]   to be a lot of people that are going to start talking about that once they have this, is
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.400]   that suddenly they go back to Apple users, go back to having their computers kicked off
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.840]   of things that we haven't had for a decade.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:32.840]   It also, it's also a context that makes this more painful because the Mac Pro, of the
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:40.840]   Mac Pro, because of, it's been so long since we've had an update, because of the Mac Mini.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:49.040]   And I think that underlying all of this angst really is the sense that maybe Apple is giving
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.040]   up on Mac and Mac.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.840]   And I hope that this is an iPhone company.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:03.320]   Like, I hope that Apple gives up on Mac and just releases Mac OS so that we can use it on
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.840]   other pieces of hardware.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.840]   Like, just give up, just give up, just put it out there.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.840]   You know, like, I don't want it.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.440]   It's never going to happen so it's no point in even bringing it up again, Alex.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:14.840]   That's never, Apple's never going to do that.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.840]   Well, I'm just, and it'd be hard because it's so tightly integrated into what they do.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.840]   And there's like, Adam just so close into the business.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.840]   It's just, I can't see Apple ever doing that.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.840]   Well, I think that if they care, they're going to have to figure out something other, figure
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.440]   out what, you know, how their head is shoved into the ground here or not.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:37.040]   I think what you have to do as a user is, watch this with development, with interest,
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:40.760]   and at some point, you're going to have to choose a different ecosystem that gives you
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.040]   more choice if you want that choice.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.040]   Right.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.360]   People come to me all the time and say, well, I want my iPhone to do this or that, or why
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.800]   can't I do this with my iPhone?
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.240]   And I tell them when you choose Apple, you're choosing to do it Apple's way.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:58.640]   And you can complain on bitch all you want, but you're going to be doing an Apple's way.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.640]   That's what with your wallet.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.080]   The only choice you have is to find another ecosystem.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.840]   And I think that the issue is, that's a good point.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.720]   I think that the issue is, is that like with my phone, I don't really care.
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720]   I don't care.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.720]   It's simple.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.720]   I don't care that it doesn't do everything that an Android does.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.720]   But some people do.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.560]   I mean, it just doesn't do about pro things.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.240]   You know, everybody has their thing, right?
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.240]   No, no, I understand.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:23.120]   I think that as a pro, I think because I spend so much time on my, you know, on my on my
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:29.080]   Mac Pro is that is that I'm much more sensitive to what's being taken away from it than I
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.080]   am with my phone.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.080]   Right.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.080]   They can do whatever.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.080]   This is your work.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.360]   Like I do enough on this that I'm, you know, now I've, I've kind of divested myself a little
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.680]   bit like starting after that event.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.920]   Like I'm just like, I'm not going to, I'm trying to figure out how I move to an iPad
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:45.920]   Pro.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.640]   How do I, you know, how do it is, is Windows something that I could, that I can live with.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.480]   I mean, it's the first time I've had this conversation about, about that in 20 years,
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.240]   you know, of like, I don't know if this is going to be some, you know, I don't know
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.240]   if this relationship.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.860]   It's unfortunate because there aren't that many other choices, even, you know, if you
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:05.900]   move away from Apple and there's a lot of things that we love Apple for and we love
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:08.500]   Mac OS for that we would be giving up.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:09.500]   So it's a very difficult decision.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.500]   I want to take a break.
[01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:11.500]   We'll come back.
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.620]   I want to talk about touch.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:17.780]   I think that's important and things that Apple didn't talk about in October and what
[01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:25.380]   your sense is, you know, the Mac mini and the Mac Pro and iMac and, and what your sense
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.300]   is for the future there.
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:33.260]   They talked about an LG 5K monitor and said, if you really want an external monitor, you
[01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:37.260]   should buy this, which implies that maybe they're getting out of it that they really
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.540]   are getting out of that business.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:39.700]   Anyway, there's a lot more to talk about.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.780]   I want to take a break though.
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.340]   Everybody can relax a little bit.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:48.340]   Have a cup of tea and breathe and breathe and I'm very sympathetic because I, you know,
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.620]   I'm going back and forth.
[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:56.900]   By the way, bought the 13 and the 15, but I also bought this, the Surface studio and I
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.740]   think it'll be, we'll have the Surface studio December 15th.
[01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:03.100]   We'll have the two new Mac books in a couple of weeks.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:09.260]   And I think there's going to be an interesting thing to look at that in context with what
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:12.540]   the Surface studio is doing.
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:16.380]   It's all very interesting, but we're going to take a break now so you can relax.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:19.460]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:25.860]   Now Squarespace is a great place for you to relax and make a great website without a
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:30.420]   lot of crazy work or spending a crazy ton of money.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:36.460]   You can make a site that uses state of the art engineering with a beautiful design.
[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:40.380]   They go hand in hand and the best hosting all at Squarespace.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:44.540]   It's like everything you need, the perfect portfolio, a professional blog, an online
[01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:45.540]   store.
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.300]   If you're a restaurant, this is the place to make it.
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:51.380]   If you're a business of any kind, if you're just an individual, that's where I keep my
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:52.380]   blog.
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.780]   Sites look professionally designed because they are.
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:00.020]   They have the best designers and you can start with these great templates underneath the
[01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:02.140]   best engineering.
[01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.460]   So it's mobile responsive.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:05.380]   You've got e-commerce in every site.
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:08.380]   And when Squarespace does e-commerce, they do it right.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:11.180]   They don't make it like something hanging off the side of your website.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:13.620]   You go to the shopping cart, it's this ugly thing.
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.820]   It looks like your website.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:16.740]   It fits with your website.
[01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:18.420]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:21.820]   If you're a developer, now if you're not a developer, you've got all these settings and
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.980]   tools you can or can't don't have to use.
[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:29.260]   It's one of those magical things where you can choose to do it as simply as possible
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:33.900]   and look great or you can get as deep as you want and you change fonts.
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:38.060]   They have hundreds of fonts, literally colors, page configurations.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:42.980]   And then if you're a developer, wow, the developer platform gives you full control over the site.
[01:07:42.980 --> 01:07:50.060]   The HTML, the CSS, the JavaScript, you have a JSON API to output content from the CMS.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:53.700]   You can use a base template that gives you all the functionality.
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.660]   You can layer your design on top of it or use one of the existing templates if you want
[01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:00.500]   the design but you want to have the functionality in your hands.
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:04.060]   And once you register as developer and flip the developer toggle, you can start using
[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:07.820]   SFTP or Git with Squarespace.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:08.820]   Start coding.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:12.060]   I mean, it is this, they've thought of it all.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:15.060]   Get a free custom domain name when you purchase an annual purchase.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.660]   They do domain names now too, by the way.
[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.660]   They have hundreds of TLDs.
[01:08:18.660 --> 01:08:21.460]   You can of course use that great Squarespace content.
[01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:25.780]   It gives you a lot of additional features shipping and so forth inventory control.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.580]   Very, very powerful.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.300]   I love my Squarespace site.

[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.180]   Adam Anks is here from tidbits.com.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:51.220]   Randy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:53.300]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.220]   Renee Richie from iMore.com.
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:09:01.780]   A good conversation and it's a conversation we're having here but I think Apple fans all
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:09.500]   over the world are having at the same time after Apple's announcements of last week.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.500]   What about touch?
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:15.940]   A number of people said, you know, by the way, start with Steve Jobs saying, "Well, you're
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:16.940]   not going to do touch.
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:18.980]   Nobody wants to hold their arms out like this."
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:23.860]   And yet lots of us now have used touch on other operating systems and on other laptops
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:26.620]   and desktops and say, "We like it."
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:30.380]   Apple is committing, you know, they would have to redesign Mac OS so they give us the
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:32.060]   OLED touch bar.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.460]   Is that enough?
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.020]   I honestly think that Apple's missed the boat.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:43.020]   I think that it was, I think that it made logical sense that nobody's going to want
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:46.620]   to use a computer like this and get the gorilla arms.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:52.860]   But then, but the thing is, I mean, now we have years of experience of people using computers.
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:57.380]   We've had years of experience with now Microsoft having laptop computers with that.
[01:09:57.380 --> 01:09:58.380]   And it's great.
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:09:59.820]   There's so many different things you can do with it.
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.060]   Maybe you don't want to use it instead of a mouse.
[01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:05.940]   You wouldn't want to have that instead with a computer that can only use that as a touch
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.020]   input or as a way of input and commands.
[01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:10.020]   But it works really, really great.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.940]   And I have to say that as I really do like the touch bar, I think it's a really great
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.820]   idea if it's implemented well.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:21.140]   But I really think this, I had this little tiny little maybe unfair twinge of remember
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:26.780]   the time when like Blackberry made like phones that had like iPhone like touch screens but
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.980]   still had keyboards underneath them.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:34.460]   And remember like, like, it's like the, you could sort of hear this boardroom meetings
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.020]   like, oh, damn it.
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:41.180]   We bet on the wrong horse and now we're screwed and it's too late because we can't now revamp
[01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:45.020]   the entire Macintosh operating system so that it works with touch.
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:49.140]   Whereas Windows has been revamped so well, integrates touch so well that you can make
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:54.980]   a 28 inch touchscreen like the drafting table computer and it works brilliantly.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:11:00.060]   So I think that I don't see the touch bar as a failure, but I do see it as an acknowledgement.
[01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.860]   Oh, dang it.
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:06.660]   Had we been able to see five or six years in the future as clearly as we were able to
[01:11:06.660 --> 01:11:12.300]   see it with the iPhone, we would have started integrating touch into the Macintosh operating
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:17.700]   system because, oh dear, this is the best we can do right now.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.060]   And I think that I think that the issue is that again, I think everyone thinks of it
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:24.380]   as creative and I think even some degree Microsoft thinks of it as creative with the
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.340]   studio, the touch studio and so on and so forth.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.620]   But I think that there are a lot of other places my primary use for use for touch is
[01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.620]   not drawing.
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.900]   I'm not very good at drawing.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.340]   My primary use is marking documents, blocking out ideas.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:40.460]   So if I'm doing a keynote, I'm like, I want to box here, here, here, here, here, you know,
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.140]   and I do it mostly on an iPad.
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.140]   My navigation is growing.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:47.900]   Yeah, sometimes it's funny because sometimes I'll see a button and it's just natural to
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:51.740]   touch it or I'll scroll up and down and imagine how kids are going to feel kids who grew
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.500]   up with iPads are going to be touched first.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.580]   And that's the real test, right?
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:57.460]   If you've been using the iPad for a while, don't you touch your laptop screen?
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.460]   Yes, once or twice?
[01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:02.820]   My kids have very little experience working with a regular laptop and they are so frustrated
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:05.940]   on a pretty constant basis with the laptop because they just keep on touching the screen.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:10.020]   So in the lab, Apple has to have a touch version of back OS for years.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:13.660]   They will run iOS as far as I remember the touch versions of Max Rand, what looked like
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.660]   iOS.
[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:15.660]   Oh, how interesting.
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:16.660]   I guess you have to.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:21.060]   I mean, Microsoft went through a horrific period when does a positioning the desktop to
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:23.740]   touch and they all the pain of Windows 8.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.100]   That was three years of awfulness.
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:30.260]   They've kind of gone beyond that Windows 10 is still a desktop, but it has the touch
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:31.260]   interface.
[01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:32.460]   If you need it and want it.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:36.580]   I think they've kind of solved the problem.
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:37.780]   But I don't even need it to be read.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:39.780]   It's like I'm really OK.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.820]   But the tiny touch targets are frustrating after a while.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:48.380]   No, but I'm saying I'm OK with using a trackpad and typing and using a mouse or whatever.
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.660]   And just when I, you know, I just want to be able to pick up a pencil and draw on things
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.020]   and go, no, not this is this.
[01:12:54.020 --> 01:12:55.980]   Sometimes I like it.
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:56.980]   That's all.
[01:12:56.980 --> 01:12:59.260]   An Apple pencil plus the screen is all I'm asking for.
[01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.180]   And I'll still do everything else normally.
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:04.100]   But when you're talking about teachers, you know, grading papers, when you're talking
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.260]   about CEOs looking at contracts or lawyers looking at contracts, when you're looking
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.060]   at people just drawing, you know, wanting to sketch something out so they can send it
[01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:11.060]   to somebody.
[01:13:11.060 --> 01:13:15.140]   It is, is this, you know, we have a rock right now, which is our trackpad or whatever that
[01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:18.940]   we're trying to draw with, you know, instead of, you know, and when you get used to the
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:22.820]   iPad, I think, you know, the problem with the iPad for me is that I have no IO, you
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.780]   know, so I have like really no effective IO into the in and out of it.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:27.260]   And I don't know where any of the files go.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:30.540]   Like it's just like, like wherever the iPad keeps files is magic.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.780]   You know, like, you know, it's and so land of ghosts and winds.
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:38.460]   You know, it's like, they're somewhere in there that is keeping the real thing with
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.660]   the touch bar, though, that comes into play is that we're talking one machine.
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:47.940]   And so if this is going to become something that's core to the Mac experience, it's got
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.780]   to show up elsewhere.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:53.900]   But then you get into running to issues with if you're going to do touch ID on it, then
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:14:00.620]   how far away can you get your your Apple T1 chip and it's secure enclave from the CPU
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:02.420]   and still have it be secure.
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.980]   So could you very far an external one?
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.140]   Yeah, no, they can do it.
[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.420]   It's the same as a touch ID verification for iPhone on Apple Pay and Safari now.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.420]   It works on the same thing.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:15.820]   So the chip generates a token and only the token is encrypted end to end in ship to OS
[01:14:15.820 --> 01:14:16.820]   10.
[01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:17.820]   So they could do it from.
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.820]   So you do it from an external keyboard.
[01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:20.820]   Yep.
[01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:21.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.820]   Magic keyboard with a touch bar.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:23.820]   Very soon.
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:27.220]   There's also accessibility things to at least think about.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:32.100]   I mean, I hope that my I again, I think it's a really great idea.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:37.700]   I think that the best application of it is not as a replacement for anything that's going
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:43.500]   on in the on screen operating on screen interface, but as an enhancement as a sort of like a
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:47.780]   keyboard set of keyboard shortcuts, a set of, oh, well, if you happen, I know it's sort
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:53.180]   of like a some of us have like extended keyboard, some of us have like normal desktop keyboards,
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.940]   not all keyboards have an American keypad.
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:58.660]   But hey, look, I see that you do have an actual dedicated role of function keys.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:14:59.660]   Great.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:04.020]   I will let you I will attach things to this that makes things easier to use if you want
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.380]   to use it this way.
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:09.180]   I think they could cause some problems that I can't really understand that I can't really
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.540]   anticipate right now.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:16.900]   If that did become a Photoshop or final cut or I movie became more difficult to use if
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.500]   you don't have a touchpad.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.500]   Renee, did you get to play with it?
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.500]   There's right.
[01:15:21.500 --> 01:15:22.500]   Any link nobody hears.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.860]   Yeah, for very long though, right?
[01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:30.020]   I got I was selfish and Tom made as much time as I possibly could.
[01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:32.660]   It's really interesting for people who haven't heard much about it yet.
[01:15:32.660 --> 01:15:35.620]   Basically the T1 chip runs an embedded version of iOS.
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.540]   It's similar to what the Apple Watch runs.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:42.100]   That's a very stripped down core and all it does is handle the secure enclave generate,
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.620]   you know, read the fingerprint, generate the token, push it back out.
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:51.380]   And that and display Apple Pay on the actual touch bar itself.
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:55.820]   But the touch bar is really interesting to me and I had no idea how I'd react to it
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:16:00.900]   because I'm not a huge fan of touch screens on computers for a different reason.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:04.740]   I have it on the Mac on the iPad Pro and I just find it takes my brain a few seconds
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:07.180]   to switch context back and forth.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:11.020]   And this I wasn't sure about either because this idea this theoretically is better.
[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.900]   But because it's not keys, it's it's display.
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:17.180]   I have to look down and I'm doing the same kind of context switching.
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:20.260]   So I'm ultimately not sure if it's going to be of that much benefit to me.
[01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.900]   But I also have a terrible memory for keyboard shortcuts.
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:27.460]   I have the basic ones hardwired into my brain just from years and years and years of repetition.
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:32.020]   But there's so many that I never use because I either not aware them or I forget about them.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:36.100]   And what the magic, sorry, I keep on mind, the touch bar does is it takes,
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:39.380]   when you first booted up, it shows the escape key and it shows the media controls,
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:42.420]   like what you almost what you get on the old function key and you could put it
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:45.020]   into full on function key mode if you really want to.
[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:50.100]   But what it actually what it does otherwise is it takes on highly curated contextual commands
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:53.940]   for the application that you're running and they've built into every app that ships
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:56.340]   with OS X as far as I can tell, it's even in terminal.
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.700]   I didn't check chess, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:03.540]   And then it has like on photos, you can actually see little photos and scrub through them.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.020]   On Photoshop, you can pick your color from a palette.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:10.980]   On Final Cut Pro, you can see your edit timeline and move around in it and adjust endpoints on it
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.220]   and so on.
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:15.660]   And I do have to look at it, which I really, really don't like,
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:19.820]   but I like that it's servicing all these data detectors, data predictors.
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.620]   And it's sort of what we talked about with Microsoft is that Apple's been building all these technologies,
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:29.340]   everything from watch OS to secure enclave to end-to-end encryption to passing tokens off to keychains
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.060]   so they can't be spoofed by developers.
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:37.780]   All these different technologies, they come together and they can basically do a fused hybrid iOS arm computer.
[01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:41.780]   And yeah, it's got a lot of people saying, "Well, if those touchscreen iOS Macs run on arm,
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:43.940]   maybe Apple's waiting till it can do everything."
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:45.380]   Like, "Here's the brand new Mac book.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:48.380]   Don't look under the covers. It runs arm. It runs iOS and it's a full touchscreen."
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:49.420]   And we've been waiting.
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.460]   Apple doesn't do touch.
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:53.860]   We don't believe in touch on the computer because it hasn't been done right until now.
[01:17:53.860 --> 01:17:56.020]   You know, and we could have one of those dreadful moments.
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:00.180]   But this does show you when you start bringing, when you think about a different context,
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:03.580]   to bring touch to a Mac, and it did work pretty well.
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.300]   It's a matte finish. It feels like a keys.
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.060]   It doesn't feel glossy like a display.
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.980]   It feels exactly like the keyboard does.
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.660]   The Touch ID sensor is really nice.
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:14.500]   It's almost indistinguishable in the actual thing.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.340]   And I'm talking way too wrongly. I apologize.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.500]   No, no, no, no. You're the one who's playing with it.
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.700]   You've actually heard that.
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:20.820]   I want to hear it.
[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:27.780]   You know, frankly, I don't feel like I can weigh in on the keyboard or the touchpad until I have it.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:29.300]   And had it for a while. I don't think we'll know.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.820]   It's a new user interface device.
[01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:31.540]   I still don't know.
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.660]   It's going to take you a while now.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:33.700]   I will know in six months.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:34.260]   It's maybe.
[01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.340]   Yeah. I mean, it's really hard for me to do.
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:41.860]   It's easy for me to imagine really being thrilled that about to pick up the mouse,
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:45.220]   because I need to dig deep into a menu to get it at a command.
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:50.980]   But fortunately, Photoshop or Word or Scrivener has thoughtfully surfaced.
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:54.420]   Oh, I bet he wants to know.
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:57.060]   I bet he wants to export this as an ebook right now,
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:18:59.380]   because that's usually the context he's in right now,
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:19:03.060]   and surface that as an actual function button for that context.
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:06.020]   I have a hard time imagining the thing that got me a little bit puzzled
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.780]   during the demo was watching.
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:11.300]   Now you've got here, you can scroll through the timeline of final cut right through here.
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.740]   And here's where you can.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:16.180]   Here's where you've got the address bar of Safari right down here.
[01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:19.380]   And I'm saying, yeah, but I'm going to be looking right up here for the address bar.
[01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:20.020]   I mean, I don't.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.180]   This could be a lot of wait a minute.
[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.860]   Where the hell did that element go?
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:29.860]   And now it's it's I'm curious to see how easy it will be to adapt to that.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:34.260]   And to be fair, I mean, if you had, I can't remember what my reaction was to the mouse
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:38.900]   when I was like 10 or 12, but it might have been difficult for me to think.
[01:19:38.900 --> 01:19:42.820]   But I can't I can't be looking from here for the hand to the screen to the here to the hand of the
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:46.180]   screen. Sometimes it's hard to imagine these things until they're placed in front of you.
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:48.020]   The Safari was clever though.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:51.460]   So when you're using Safari, it actually shows the windows, not not the tab,
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:52.260]   medicine on the tabs too.
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:54.820]   I saw the windows and typically I don't know where my windows are.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.500]   They're lost in a stack 20 deep and I don't know which ones which and you could scrub through
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.820]   and see perfectly readable because it's a retina display.
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:02.980]   I think it's 21 70 by 60.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.860]   Perfectly readable versions of your webpage quickly swipe to the one you want.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:08.340]   Let go and suddenly and then bang us right in front of you.
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:10.900]   And it was much faster than trying to switch because I did that test too.
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:14.420]   I tried to switch the old fashioned way and the touch bar was much faster.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:20.180]   One thing that did come up almost immediately afterward is again, talking to friends of mine
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:23.620]   who actually who do like a real art stuff for living.
[01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:28.580]   They use that they really are good at like hand I coordination where they will have like
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:33.460]   their finger literally on like the F 11 key or literally on the F six key, whatever it is,
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:36.820]   because that's a working because that does that does something that is really important to them
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:41.700]   as they're working and they were concerned about how now they don't have if they if all the Mac
[01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:46.340]   pros don't have physical function keys and they're all virtual and remember that people who are
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:50.180]   complaining. I was disappointed that so many people are saying, Oh look, they've deleted the
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:55.060]   escape key. The escape key doesn't exist anymore. It's like it will be there if you wanted to be there.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:21:00.500]   But there's still but it could still be for those people who need to not have to look down at the
[01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:04.340]   keyboard to make sure their finger is where they think it is on a function key that could be a
[01:21:04.340 --> 01:21:08.580]   problem. So we'll find we'll find it when when thousands of these ship and we see people who
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:13.540]   be using this for a month. What adjustment needs to be made to how these things work.
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:17.140]   This was the first Mac. I didn't know immediately whether I'd like it or not. Like usually I can
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:20.740]   tell right away and even if it's a controversial plan, I can tell if I personally like it and this
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.180]   computer. The first thing is I'm going to have to spend a lot of time with this to see if I even
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:27.060]   like it or not because I'm so entrenched in my old MacBook Pro.
[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:35.380]   Yeah, we actually both time and I have have relatively old MacBooks. She has a 2012
[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:42.260]   2011 11 inch and I have a 2013 13 inch and she immediately ordered one of the new MacBooks
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:45.860]   because she just needs something that's that's more capable. So we're going to see there but
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:50.980]   enough of these things gave me pause that I was like, okay, well, just wait, I'll try yours when
[01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:55.460]   it comes rather than just ordering a second one right away. I didn't order yet to point out.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:58.820]   You didn't order yet really. No, I didn't. I don't know. I had a 2012
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:06.740]   MacBook Pro here and it's not out of date in any of the way. No, not selling that. I mean,
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:11.700]   it's not like I feel like oh, it's sluggish and slow and so forth. So there's a so there's a
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.620]   group of people buying new MacBooks just because they want to have the new shiny MacBook every
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:20.660]   few years. Yeah, there's people who really need the power. Tanya probably really needs the power.
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:27.860]   She doesn't. It's more that the 2011 11 inch is really starting to age. It's wearing out. I mean,
[01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:33.940]   that's the battery starts to the battery is well, you know, and just in general, they get funky when
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:38.980]   they get, you know, four or five years old. I don't I don't think I'm really pasted comic book
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:44.420]   characters on my keys and I can't. That's the reason I'm buying a new one. That prankster.
[01:22:44.420 --> 01:22:50.340]   That prankster. One of the things people started doing after this in the conversation
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:56.340]   started going about Apple perhaps losing their way is a video resurface that was Steve Jobs
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:02.340]   interviewed in the triumph of the nerds document. I think Robert X. Cringley interviewed him in
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:08.660]   which he talked about what happens to a monopoly when they're dominant when they're truly dominant
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:13.860]   and some say this is what's happening today at Apple. Do you want to see that? Have you all seen
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:19.540]   that video lately? Let me just play it. It's it's about a minute and a half and it's always nice.
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:24.580]   It's by the way, always nice to see Steve Jobs and just remember the good old days. He's sitting
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:30.580]   in front of a next monitor, by the way. He is not at Apple at this point. John came from PepsiCo
[01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:34.980]   and they they at most would change their product, you know, once every 10 years. I mean, to them,
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:39.860]   a new product was like a new size bottle, right? So if you were a product person,
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:45.460]   you couldn't change the course of that company very much. So who influenced the success of PepsiCo,
[01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:49.540]   the sales and marketing people? Therefore, they were the ones that got promoted and therefore,
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:56.260]   they were the ones that ran the company. Well, for PepsiCo, that might have been okay, but
[01:23:56.260 --> 01:24:02.420]   it turns out the same thing can happen in technology companies that get monopolies,
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:08.660]   like OIBM and Xerox. If you were a product person at IBM or Xerox,
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:16.020]   so you make a better copy or a better computer. So what? When you have a monopoly market share,
[01:24:16.020 --> 01:24:21.220]   the company is not any more successful. So the people that can make the company more successful
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:27.220]   are sales and marketing people and they end up running the companies and the product people
[01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:35.700]   get driven out of decision making forums and the companies forget what it means to make great products.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:43.060]   It's sort of the product sensibility and the product genius that brought them to that
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:48.740]   monopolistic position gets rotted out by people running these companies who have no
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:54.980]   conception of a good product versus a bad product. They have no conception of the craftsmanship
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:59.700]   that's required to take a good idea and turn it into a good product. And they really have no
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:04.180]   feeling in their hearts usually. The historical context of this because Steve is on the outs,
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:11.300]   he's next, not at Apple. And he's definitely talking about Apple under John Scully because
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:17.940]   the marketing salespeople were running Apple at that point. Is it germane to today's Apple?
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:21.780]   The funniest thing is there's this great, there's Brett Victor on Twitter, he's worried
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:26.340]   re-amont Twitter. He worked in Apple prototyping for years. He's not there anymore, but as Apple
[01:25:26.340 --> 01:25:30.180]   releases products, he's been commenting on him. And right after the show, he said,
[01:25:30.180 --> 01:25:33.540]   you know, things we prototyped years and years ago at Apple continued to trickle out.
[01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:37.380]   This touch bar technology is eight years old. They started doing this eight years ago. It was
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:41.060]   conceived. And that's when Steve Jobs was still there. Same with Force Touch trackpads.
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:45.300]   It's worth reading his Twitter stream because he's like, after a few years,
[01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:49.060]   with computers without this technology, you're going to feel broken. And I don't know if that's
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:51.940]   true. I mean, some people thought that out of resistive touch screens when we had,
[01:25:51.940 --> 01:25:55.860]   once soon as we had the capacitive ones that had one-to-one direct manipulation.
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:59.700]   But a lot of the stuff we're seeing now is stuff that was created at Apple when Steve Jobs was there.
[01:25:59.700 --> 01:26:03.540]   And the people running Apple now, like Phil Schiller and Johnny Iver, the people at Steve Jobs picked
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:08.340]   to run Apple. Are they products for interesting? Yeah, I mean, Phil Schiller is a great product
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:14.260]   person. Jaws is a fantastic product person. A lot of the people who run Apple marketing
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:20.340]   are incredibly smart. It could almost make the case that's the opposite problem at Apple is that
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:24.740]   the product people are in charge and getting to do what they want without it.
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:29.300]   They have the disagreements we have. They argue this, like the same arguments we have on the show,
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:33.540]   they have internally. And once in a while, you'll hear a remark from them that shows that.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:37.380]   I think the iPad should be this. No, I think the iPad should be that. And they're a continual
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:41.140]   battle spot. And once in a while, you see different sides get the advantage.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:46.580]   Tim Cook's not a product person, though. But to his credit, especially with the reorganization,
[01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:52.580]   he has put the product people at the top. Steve wasn't logistics. We put Tim Cook as his right-hand
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:58.100]   person. But Johnny Ives, a product person. He's in charge of the Apple UI across the board.
[01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:02.100]   And again, I think that I just wonder whether there's this kind of
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:07.860]   design obsession with simplicity. It almost feels like they've gotten the other way.
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:12.500]   They just keep on going down this. They just want to get rid of all these extra things.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:15.380]   And there's a whole bunch of different things. And I get that there's a certain level of
[01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:21.300]   symmetry to have two USB-Cs on either end. And that's all. And we don't have to think about
[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:26.740]   anything else. And maybe a couple of years in the future, it'll even out. But it's
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:30.900]   I just feel like it might be moving a little too fast.
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:33.620]   It's a brick. It's an aluminium brick. There are no ports. There's nothing.
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:36.100]   It's all wireless. You put this brick on your desk and it does everything.
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:38.500]   Well, we'll see with the iPhone 8, right? I mean, I don't know if these...
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.020]   That's my pro.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:43.060]   The next my pro could be a brick that has holographic everything.
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:43.540]   Yeah.
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:47.460]   Anybody else want to say anything about that video before we have...
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:53.540]   Only that's an interesting comment about what big companies that have kind of monopolies over
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:28:00.020]   an audience. Yeah. I mean, it was true when he said it back then. But again, it also
[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:04.500]   points to how different the technology market is that we talked about this a little bit at the
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:09.860]   beginning of the show that there is a responsibility that Apple has to say that you can't really just
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:17.380]   say that you can't remember that back then when Steve came back, Apple was the company saying,
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:22.740]   "Think different. Apple's the company that said, 'Here's the crazy ones.'" And the fear is that...
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:26.420]   I don't think the reality is here yet, but the fear is that the new slogan is conform.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:29.060]   Conform. You will use the...
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.540]   I've heard people say that too, that 1984 is...
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.820]   Yeah. Apple is the new 1984.
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:38.260]   They're not big on giving people options.
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.300]   They shouldn't be.
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.260]   It's not...
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:45.380]   Well, I want to go back to those days where they have to do their truth.
[01:28:45.380 --> 01:28:49.860]   We keep coming back. I keep coming back to the idea that with every company, there's like a
[01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:56.020]   transaction involved with Google. It is... I'm going to allow you to have incredible vision into
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:00.100]   who I am and what I do and what I like. But you're going to use that information to give me
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:04.180]   things that I like and that I want and make computers that are more tailored to my experience.
[01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:08.260]   Apple's transaction is you are going to give up an immense amount of control.
[01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:12.580]   You will not get to do things the way you want to do them. You will not be able to buy the hardware
[01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:16.740]   you want to buy. But the other end of that transaction is that
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:23.620]   Apple is going to believe at least that in two years' time, you will be happy that you have what
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:28.820]   you have now instead of what you wanted to buy two years ago. So that's just a difference in
[01:29:28.820 --> 01:29:33.780]   philosophy. I don't know that one is necessarily better than the other, but it's a thing that
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:36.340]   people should be conscious of when they vote with their dollars.
[01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:41.860]   So the thing that troubles me a little bit about the product decisions and product conversation a
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:50.100]   little bit is that this is the first new Mac at all in How Long Now? I mean, and ever...
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:55.860]   Well, yeah, but I mean, we're talking 18 months since the last Mac, but Macbook Pro is much
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:30:01.620]   longer than that for the Mac Pro and the Mac Mini. The iMac is somewhere in that range as well.
[01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:08.740]   That Apple actually isn't doing very much on the product side for the Mac. And what they seem to
[01:30:08.740 --> 01:30:16.500]   be doing is keeping old stuff around to provide what choices there are. You want a cheaper version?
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:22.820]   Oh, well, you can still buy the 13-inch MacBook Air. Who cares? It's old. So that's how they're
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:27.700]   providing this to the phone. Are they still selling the Air, I wonder? 13-inch? The 13. They
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:34.340]   dropped the 11 and they dropped the 2012 MacBook Pro with SuperDrive. That's a college kid.
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:39.380]   But they didn't say anything about the Air. I kind of got the feeling the new MacBook Pro,
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:43.060]   the low-end Mac Pro was an air replacement. Do you think they're going to keep making the 13-inch
[01:30:43.060 --> 01:30:49.780]   back? They didn't drop it. And so you end up with this very, very weird lineup. I mean,
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:55.300]   if you actually say, if you walk in and say, "I want a Mac laptop," you're kind of going in,
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:31:01.220]   going in clean. And you would look at this. I actually have a list in some ways. It's like eight
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:10.020]   SKUs and at the base models. And you are just this dizzying array of possible,
[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:15.060]   this one's faster, this one's smaller, this one's lighter, this one has more ports. That one is
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:19.860]   newer ports. This one, it just-- Usually you could just say, "How much you have to spend? Okay,
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:24.420]   that's the one for you." It was a continuum along a price line. Good, better, best. Yeah.
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:29.460]   I think they keep the airline because it's the only Mac you can get for a night. They can't make
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:33.060]   these Macs cheap enough. And as soon as they can make one of these for $8.99, $9.99,
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:38.260]   then those will go away. How about the Mini? What's going to happen to the Mini?
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:43.220]   Spring. Spring. Spring, you think? Spring. I'm excited. They didn't do it now.
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:48.340]   It's an important product? It's such an important computer for them. It's the least expensive entry
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:54.420]   point into the Mac. It's such a practical machine for so many homes and so many businesses in so
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:32:00.900]   many schools. I actually haven't seen the breakout of the recent sales of the Mac Mini, but
[01:32:00.900 --> 01:32:06.900]   I'd be surprised if even now with the borrowing an update recently, it's really, really surprisingly
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:13.220]   a dull gray box, but a very spectacular performer. Yeah. We have a lot. A lot of it,
[01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:18.580]   many since. You know, doing a lot of basic tasks and being able to have them rack mountable and
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:22.020]   all those other things are things that we use them a lot for. I think back, like,
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:27.380]   four. Yeah. I'm actually not budgeting for it yet, but thinking about, you know, 2017,
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:32.260]   I might actually buy a really good Mac Mini, particularly thinking that, well, I'm probably
[01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:38.100]   going to have some money available from my potential MacBook budget. Point-caught.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:44.820]   Use my own damn keyboard for that. Mac Pro. Is it dead? Will it be?
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:50.180]   Yeah. Spring. Also, do you think they'll update it? Yeah. I mean, I really think they've done all this.
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:56.820]   I don't think they barely rev this design. I really wish they would have done all this earlier.
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:59.700]   I think that they wish they could have done this earlier. And I don't know why the desktops
[01:32:59.700 --> 01:33:05.380]   are pushed out till spring. What's holding them up until? I think at this point, and it's a
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:10.660]   terrible answer, but I think at this point, iOS takes up the iPhone absolutely has to ship on time.
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:15.700]   There is no world for Apple where that iPhone is not ready in September, and anything that has
[01:33:15.700 --> 01:33:19.620]   to be moved around that will get moved around that. And it's like, you'll think we have a new
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:23.860]   engineer. We can assign him to work on the Mac thing, but it's no new engineer. Please go
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:28.260]   push that as fast as you possibly can. So all the resources they have get distributed in terms of
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:32.020]   the importance of that business. And it's not that the Mac is unimportant. It's just relative
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:37.060]   to where Apple makes all of its money. It is not as important as getting the iPhone. I mean,
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:40.980]   they didn't even use new iPads this year in getting that iPhone out in September.
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:45.300]   I think Renee is absolutely correct. And that's the thing that people really, particularly long-term
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:50.740]   Mac users have trouble remembering is Apple is the iPhone company at this point. It's all iPhone
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:55.780]   all the time. And it feels as though, I mean, we know that Apple has tens of thousands of
[01:33:55.780 --> 01:34:00.020]   employees. Couldn't they be both? Couldn't they have the Mac company and the iPhone company and
[01:34:00.020 --> 01:34:05.140]   be able to ship both of them on time? And I think partly things are integrated so deeply
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:12.100]   with iOS and Mac OS now that it's hard. And I also think that Apple has a
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:19.620]   they're really good at focus, which is now showing its potential liability.
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:26.100]   So yeah, that now they really have to focus on the iPhone because that's where all the money is.
[01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:34.580]   And they may have 5,000 people working on the Mac, who knows, but they can't get break free of
[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:41.060]   the iPhone laser focus that the executives and the sales and the marketing and the manufacturing
[01:34:41.060 --> 01:34:45.700]   everyone has to have. So it really feels to me like the Mac is getting pushed to the side
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:50.420]   time and time again to make sure, as Renee says, September comes new iPhone chips.
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:57.540]   Again, as a pro user, I wish they would have just pushed it further aside and just
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:01.780]   just said we're going to do something.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:08.260]   If they just if they just freshened up the chips, I think a lot of people that are upset would
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:11.780]   have been happy. You know, like, you know, just make it a little faster than it was before.
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:16.740]   And I'll upgrade my leases and call it a day. You know, like it used to speed bump things more
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:20.420]   often. You know, you just like they wouldn't even announce it. You just boom. There's a new
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:24.820]   space. The sky is bump because they wouldn't. So there's a few things like a simple were
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:28.020]   upset that there's not Kaby Lake in this computer, for example, but Kaby Lake was just
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:31.700]   announced is just starting to ship is not the right chip for Apple. And Apple, once it gets
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:35.620]   the chip, they spend months like they spent months on Skylake making sure not only does it sleep
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:39.540]   properly and wake up properly, but now it actually boots when you open the lid and all that stuff
[01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:44.180]   takes a lot of work with them and Intel. And my understanding is that just bumping it to Skylake
[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:47.940]   back in January, you would have gotten a result similar to what drove Paul Thorett and Matt
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:51.300]   on the surface and they weren't all or into it. I mean, two, eight months of the surface
[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:56.420]   book and it took them forever, Microsoft forever to get the surface book to handle power properly.
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:59.620]   Nobody trusts Kaby Lake now. So like they don't want to just put it in trust.
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:03.140]   I don't have as much problem with them not putting Kaby Lake in there at all. I don't think that
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:08.900]   that's a big issue. No, I don't think I'm just saying that I don't. When was the last Apple released
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:12.260]   that they released something when we really just wished that they had there's so many people,
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:16.500]   maybe not all of us, but so many people just wish they had just done a minor update and not done
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:20.420]   an event. I mean, I just can't remember the last time that I had that that impression, you know,
[01:36:20.420 --> 01:36:24.020]   where I just just wish they'd made it a little faster, made it, you know, bumped a couple little
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:27.620]   little things, but I didn't need them to do anything significant to it. They haven't really
[01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:32.180]   been doing the little speed bumps so much. Yeah, they did it to the MacBook, I guess.
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:38.420]   The iMac got a little speed bump. The iMac did, but you know, Mac Mini hasn't seen one in ages.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:43.540]   No, it really showed. I mean, yeah, we're gonna make the Mac Mini an appliance as well. So you
[01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:47.060]   get the same responsibility. If you're going to seal it, your job is to then update it for me.
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:51.700]   Right. And now I'm afraid now I'm afraid that we're going to get a Mac Mini with four USB-C
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:57.300]   connections. USB-C connection. USB-C and what you're Alex get used to it.
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:37:03.380]   Oh, yeah, I just think the SSD is super fast on one of the things that blows me way every time is
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:08.180]   just how fast they've gotten as a technology as little as Intel has pushed, you know, pure
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:12.420]   performance. This SSD at times is twice as fast for me at least as last year's model,
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:17.380]   which is I didn't think would be true. I was surprised to see Tim or Phil, I guess it was Phil
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:25.220]   talk about a four or five K display from LG and recommend it. Does that confirm? Yeah,
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:28.580]   they're not going to make any more cinematists. They worked with LG on this. They worked with
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:32.340]   LG to make this the the next generation Thunderbolt display. I tried to buy one of
[01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:36.420]   them. It wasn't available yet. I'm not sure when it was December the five Ks in December. Yeah.
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:46.900]   Okay. Yeah. I do think that Apple could make a little things a lot easier for themselves and
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:51.540]   the users if they decided to be a little bit more open about future plans. I'm not talking about
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:55.780]   show me the show me the future car five years before you even decided you're going to build or not,
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:38:01.460]   but at least say that BV cognizant of the fact that we haven't said anything about the Mac Mini
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:06.660]   in 3.8 years. We're going to we're going to make a 12. We're going to make 10 minutes in the next
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:11.780]   keynote or the next event basically just to talk about the direction for the Mac Mini just to say
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:16.740]   yes, we are where we still sell these things. We still think it's a viable product. Not again,
[01:38:16.740 --> 01:38:20.260]   we're not going to show you the case design. I'm not going to show you the direction, but
[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:25.220]   at least remind us that you know that you still make this and don't make me feel like an idiot
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:30.740]   for maybe wanting to buy one today or maybe wanting to buy one next year because right now
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:36.100]   it's reasonable for certain people to think that I think that I want to buy a Mac Mini,
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:39.780]   but I'm going to hold off because I don't know if Apple's going to cancel it or decide to just
[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:46.100]   basically let it let put it on the boat, push the boat out to see wave a grandma and grandpa
[01:38:46.900 --> 01:38:51.060]   and say they had a good long life. I'll go off to Valhalla with the both of you.
[01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:56.980]   Alex, you know, you should you should start pushing for not Apple to open source OS 10,
[01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:05.460]   but Adobe to make their creative cloud available on Linux. No, I'm serious because I think okay,
[01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:09.300]   here's the problem is that you have you know, it's Apple's where the highway let's face it. We
[01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:15.380]   know that and that's so you have two choices three choices. You could get a Windows PC and learn to
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:22.340]   love Windows 10 hard for Mac users hard for me. You could hack and touch it that's still viable,
[01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:28.660]   right? It's illegal and certainly nobody like you is going to do that. But but but but somebody
[01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:34.500]   who's an enthusiast, you can run well swear by it. Right. I mean because then I could get I get
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:40.740]   100 gigs of ram I get whatever I want. I build my own PC and then put OS 10 on it and it works with
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:46.340]   Sierra. I mean, there's lots of disadvantages, but it's but it's it's actually gotten better,
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:51.620]   not worse, or you can say I'm going to get a PC with all the bells and whistles and I'm going
[01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:56.500]   to go to the legal route. I'm going to put Linux on it some form of Linux on it. But what's missing
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:40:00.180]   there, frankly, the only thing that's missing there is the desktop apps that you've come to
[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:07.220]   love on Windows and Mac, chief of which is creative cloud. Yeah, I think I mean creative
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:12.500]   cloud is part of it. I mean, I think we're in there's a lot of Adobe users also that
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:18.020]   would probably you know, there's a lot of talk about what we're going to stay in.
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:21.380]   And I know there's dark table Linux people are going to email me say there's dark table and
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:25.060]   there's the game. But there's a game if I could get Photoshop and Lightroom on Linux.
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:30.820]   And I think it's different for everybody. I don't know why developers are bitching about the
[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:36.180]   new MacBook Pros because just get a you can get the amazing Linux boxes even have to be a machine
[01:40:36.180 --> 01:40:42.420]   made for Linux get a Dell XPS 15 incredible hardware loaded up and then put Linux on it.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:48.740]   You'd be the iOS devs. Yeah, they want X code, right? Yeah, there's those are the people who are
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:52.340]   most and they want to plug in their phones every day and now they can't without playing that table.
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:56.100]   So they're double screwed. There's a lot of there's a lot of peripherals and all kinds of other
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:41:00.420]   stuff that we would need to sort out. I mean, we do use a lot of Linux boxes, but you know,
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:03.460]   we're not used to having them. I don't even I don't know if any of them have an interface.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:08.980]   So really the only really viable option is is Windows 10. Yeah, for us. I mean,
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:12.180]   I think that that would be the case. I mean, we all the Linux boxes we have,
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:15.060]   we everyone just command lines into them and does what we need to do. I don't think I don't
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:18.500]   think we've installed an interface to it. I use Linux on the desktop all the time. I put it on
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:22.820]   most of my Windows laptops because I can't bear Windows 10 and I'm very happy with it.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:28.900]   But it's mostly because I have, you know, a browser and an email client, not even a very good email
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:36.180]   client. Unfortunately, there's a really great one. Yeah, I use my I use my but you know,
[01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:42.020]   Thunderbird is basically good enough for you, Mr. Big Sean use my use mutton. He maxed my friend.
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:50.100]   Now I have you. All right. Anyway, enough of that. So but that's the issue. And let's look at it.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:56.740]   The reason Apple people are so vociferous about this is those are the choices. And we would like
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:01.700]   it to we would like to stay on the platform. I love OS 10. I love Mac OS. And frankly, I love
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:05.700]   Mac hardware. Isn't that a big problem for apples that you have all these people who literally have
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:10.900]   rich Stevens. I was with Apple before Apple was doomed t-shirts and now they feel disenfranchised
[01:42:10.900 --> 01:42:14.340]   by Apple. They feel like they stuck with them through thick and thin and now their needs are
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:17.780]   not being met by the company that they've spent decades loving and that you know, might sound
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:22.020]   like oh, Apple is moving on to mainstream and we saw that or like Apple's making iOS devices
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:25.300]   or hundreds of millions of customers. And now Microsoft is going to the niche because that's
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:30.100]   what you do when you want to extract value from a smaller marketplace. But you have all these people
[01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:34.580]   who've loved Apple for so long who've vocally supported it who are all over Twitter evangelizing
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:39.380]   it and you know, and pushing it and now they feel like they've been abandoned. And that could be
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:43.540]   a big problem. Even if it's not a significant part of your revenue anymore, it could still be a
[01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:50.340]   significant part of the of the entire brand identity. Part of it is so and we're done. I'm sure we
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:56.580]   don't need to open up our four of. But part of it in the back of my mind is that I have a picture
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:43:03.940]   in my mind of what a great truly great company is capable of. And a lot of oftentimes with decisions
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:08.980]   like this, I see Apple, they don't want to do anything that they feel will really put themselves
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:14.260]   out. They're not going to that it would be harder for them to make a product that is not due to
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:19.860]   not owing to their nature, but a great company. Sometimes they have to swing at the at a pitch
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:24.340]   that maybe is a little bit trash because they got to defend the plate. That's a bad analogy.
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:28.580]   What I mean is that they don't they don't they don't they. I keep coming back to
[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:33.620]   banging Olafson. Everything they make is brilliant. There's incredibly well designed, really innovative.
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:40.260]   They have TV screens like 8800 inch TV screens that will tilt and pivot on their own like motors
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:43.860]   to make sure that they're aiming towards you at the right time. But who do you know who has a
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:50.020]   bang and Olafson TV? They're making a great living, a high profit margin, highly designed machines,
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:54.020]   but they're not a great company in that they don't know how they know how to make that, but they don't
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:44:00.420]   know how to make a TV set for actual normal people. So it bothers me if they decide that we're going
[01:44:00.420 --> 01:44:05.700]   to we're going to be making technology only for people who can afford super luxury brands,
[01:44:05.700 --> 01:44:11.460]   and only for people who are willing to sacrifice what they want for what we feel is the right choice
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:14.500]   for us to make right now. So that's really what's happening is that
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:20.340]   Apple has chosen a path for itself that's completely reasonable, highly profitable.
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:27.380]   It's good business, but it's but it inevitably cuts some of its users, some of its most passionate
[01:44:27.380 --> 01:44:32.180]   loyal users off. I think that's really what's happening. I mean, we can argue about it and maybe
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:36.100]   they'll prove me wrong in the spring. But I don't know that that's what's happening.
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:41.140]   No, nobody likes to see a great relationship end. Yeah, it's hard. That's hard. I will
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:45.460]   admit there is a certain emotional component to this. Oh, yeah. I can't I can't be in a position
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:51.060]   where my main computer is not a Mac. I would hate for that to happen. And that's that actually was
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:55.300]   part of my thinking when I switched to Android, I had to say, no, you're holding on to relationship.
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:45:00.180]   You're you're you're in you're in love with the memories of how good this relationship used to be.
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:04.660]   You're not in love with how good this relationship is right now. You have grown apart.
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:10.820]   And now and now here is Android who really wants to be the sort of person that you want to be in
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:15.620]   relationship with right now. So that's that that could be part of the field out there. And I'm not
[01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:21.940]   there's nothing. It's it's a it's a bleak prospect. That's all. I mean, I might be single for a while.
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:26.740]   I don't know as as much as Final Cut Pro disenfranchised a lot of pro editors, it allowed me to do a
[01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:31.060]   three camera shoot. It took me 15 minutes to learn it, five minutes to do it. And I could never do
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:38.580]   that before. Right. So right. Hey, one thing Apple is moving along with and this we may have just
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:44.580]   had the last Apple event at the old campus, new drone footage. It's beginning of the month. Can you
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:50.100]   believe it's November? Remember first we have new drone footage from the two big drone guys. Let's
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:58.420]   take a look at the Apple campus as of now and it is they're starting to put in trees. The solar
[01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:05.780]   roof is done. Still no anti aircraft battalions. I bet they have a sonic and solar sun. So you
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:11.300]   sure can and filled with nets. The gladiator nets. That's the this is the garage. The garage is
[01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:17.140]   solar all over it, which is pretty amazing. They've started to move some of the construction
[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:23.700]   cranes out. It's now you know, it's it's it's they say the solar installations about half done.
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:28.820]   Sure looks like it's more than half done. Can you imagine the capacity? Look at all those panels.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:33.620]   And they can just focus all those solar rays into one laser.
[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:41.940]   Still only 16 gigabytes of rain. The big the pyramid in the middle, which will be of course
[01:46:41.940 --> 01:46:45.860]   where they'll put Tim Cook's bones. I don't know what they're going to do. Is that is that a park
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:50.260]   or is that just dirt still there? Can you imagine if Tim Cook called up Johnny and asked where his
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:54.180]   corner office was? Even just as a troll. I just asked for one thing. Where's my corner office?
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:47:00.260]   The separate R&D facility. That's where the pirate flag will go up. And of course,
[01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:06.020]   no one can get in there without a very special kind of card key. I imagine. Although wouldn't
[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:11.940]   don't you think there's underground passages to all of this stuff? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I feel as though
[01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:16.820]   the route to the auditorium there are underground passages like how they get goofy and Mickey.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:21.140]   Yeah, exactly. It's a Mario Kart cast members. Mario Kart.
[01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:27.060]   There's the tunnel to the 11,000 space parking garage, underground parking garage.
[01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:32.500]   That's pretty remarkable. There's the Apple remote. Yeah, there's a giant Apple remote.
[01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:38.340]   No, no, that's that's that's dongle storage. Dongle storage facility.
[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:42.020]   Dongle remote. It's because you said somehow big this is when you see the maintenance facility,
[01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:47.140]   which is one of the smallest buildings on the property that this thing is massive.
[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:52.420]   They haven't seen a little bit yet. The round roof, of course, is the entrance to the
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:58.020]   incinerator. No, good. The theater, the new Apple show place where the next, I presume,
[01:47:58.020 --> 01:48:02.020]   the spring, if they have a spring event, certainly. So they told us Leo. They said it was a
[01:48:02.020 --> 01:48:05.140]   media thing, but it's an incinerator. It's an incinerator. They have plants that can make both
[01:48:05.140 --> 01:48:11.620]   soil and red, yellow and green. Look at the way. The size of the security kiosk. Holy cow. Look at that.
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:17.380]   Most vehicles will be housed in the two main garages.
[01:48:17.380 --> 01:48:24.900]   And it's still not big enough for Apple staff, which is amazing to me. Yeah. 300 car charging stations.
[01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:29.860]   That seems woefully inadequate for 11,000 people. Yeah, that seemed.
[01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:35.220]   1000 phone support people. Oh, any cubs getting infinite loop, are they going to have pneumatic
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:40.500]   tubes? That's that's the auditorium. So you see underground, like houses seats, the seats,
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:43.620]   although so you can see like has been covered with dirt yet, but that's you can see like the
[01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:48.260]   bank seats right. Right. And also look in the backing see like the lake that has not been filled
[01:48:48.260 --> 01:48:55.140]   in yet. There's a lake. So wow. There should be there should be RC boats outdoor dining. Oh my gosh.
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:59.380]   That's that's where they'll be hunting humans. They have a special enclosure.
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:04.180]   This is the new 100 dangerous game. Yeah. That's what the that's what the dinosaur is.
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:10.980]   All right. That's the Matthew Roberts. Honestly, I think this is the most dangerous game we've ever
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:15.700]   made. Really does look beautiful and 17% thinner than our last game.
[01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:20.020]   Say the first event they have there, I am going to definitely lobby for the
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:26.420]   for an invitation to I would really like to like to get inside a little bit.
[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:32.660]   So let's take a break. We I shouldn't say that everybody satisfied. We've
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:36.900]   chewed on this long enough. We're good apples doomed.
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:37.140]   Yeah.
[01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:42.500]   Yeah. I mean, if we have half an hour, I'd love to hear Alex's opinion on the TV dot app.
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:46.580]   But I don't know. You know, I did not bring that up. And I'll tell you why Apple often does this.
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:50.420]   They announced an app like the cards app that nobody ever uses and just goes away a year or
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:54.580]   two later. And I would bet that's exactly what happens to this. Well, it's no Netflix support.
[01:49:54.580 --> 01:50:00.980]   In theory, the premise is good, which is think about how you watch TV. And maybe this is a dying
[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:07.060]   thing. But in my day, when people they would sit down and they would turn on the TV and
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:11.220]   then they would surf till they found something and wanted to watch. So the new Apple TV app is
[01:50:11.220 --> 01:50:16.180]   really that you open that up when you turn on your TV. And that shows you all the things you can
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:20.500]   watch. So it's a little more like the normal TV watching experience. But because it lacks
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:23.460]   things like Amazon and Netflix.
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:30.980]   But that's not it's because it's not apples on it's not under Apple's control.
[01:50:30.980 --> 01:50:35.620]   I understand Amazon wants to withhold rights. So that's it's no, no, I'm not blaming Apple.
[01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:42.580]   I'm just saying I'm saying that that it does mean that if it has to an app like this has to present
[01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:47.140]   such a brilliant solution, the first two or three first, second and third time you use it.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:52.100]   If you don't find yourself instinctively now thinking, I want to watch TV, I'll launch this app.
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:56.740]   But instead you start thinking, am I in the mood for YouTube, I'm in the mood for Hulu,
[01:50:56.740 --> 01:51:00.820]   my mood for Netflix, which is how I interact with the apps on all my devices,
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:03.460]   then it may as well not be there. But it'll be there for people who like it.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:08.740]   It really feels more like Apple's attempt to grab your attention, to grab your,
[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:11.620]   to watch what you're doing than something that's going to be useful to you.
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:15.460]   That's a lot of stuff. It's not that they're trying to crack. And I don't think they figured
[01:51:15.460 --> 01:51:21.460]   out how to crack it yet. I think that the we are, I believe that this year is the kind of the
[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:26.740]   inflection point between TV and online video. I mean, we've all been doing online video for a
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:31.220]   long time, but I think that there's something that it just tarred me to put any stats to it.
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:34.820]   But you can feel it when you look at the drop in the NFL, and you look at the,
[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:39.380]   you know, the pickup of, you know, the different live services, you know, that I think that there's
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:42.660]   this point where things are pulling away. And I think one of the things that I do think Apple
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:48.580]   does need to get sorted soon is the 4K, because 4K allows the online video to actually make TV
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:53.540]   small. And when TV gets small, then TV is never going to be able to go to 4K in any significant
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:56.500]   way, because they're never going to have the revenue that they used to have that they spent
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:52:01.780]   on getting to HD. And so, so there, and you know, they're, you know, never, but that's a really
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:06.420]   interesting point, isn't it? With diminishing revenues, they're not going to have the chance.
[01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:12.980]   It's a vicious circle in the wrong direction. When you have the other side of that is just bits,
[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:16.500]   you know, you know, like, so, you know, YouTube decides they want to supply more bits or apple
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:20.980]   sides that want to more bits and Amazon's are a bit fine. Yeah. And so is Netflix. And so,
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:25.300]   online video is about to become the big screen, you know, smaller than, you know, the mid screen,
[01:52:25.300 --> 01:52:29.380]   you know, smaller than theater, but bigger than TV. And once TV is considered over and over and
[01:52:29.380 --> 01:52:32.500]   over again to be the small screen, and you're looking at TV manufacturers, they're going to
[01:52:32.500 --> 01:52:38.180]   want to push this because they want to sell you 4K, you know, 4K TVs. The, you know, as TV kind of
[01:52:38.180 --> 01:52:41.700]   goes that direction. And as a lot of us, you know, I don't remember, I don't know
[01:52:41.700 --> 01:52:51.220]   where most of these TV shows live anymore. I don't know what broadcaster makes, you know,
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:55.380]   the different shows that I watch. You know, I just know that I, you know, I hold up Siri and I
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:59.620]   want to show. I want to, I want to play this song. I want to play this, this, this episode or
[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:06.020]   whatever. And so, and so I don't think that browsing is the analog. What's happened to newspapers,
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:11.620]   you don't go to a website for a, for a newspaper or for an online blog anymore, you look article
[01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:16.260]   by article and you're using something like Twitter. Right. Right. So I think that that,
[01:53:16.260 --> 01:53:21.380]   I think that this Apple's trying to figure it out. I mean, I think that, you know, I think that
[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:24.340]   that's, it's going to be hard. I think that they're best bet if they really want to crack this is
[01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:28.500]   to do something, do something outrageous, like by Disney, you get ABC, you get Marvel, you get
[01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:32.900]   ESPN, you get all of those things, you know, and Apple has the cash to do it. And if they bought
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:36.500]   something like Disney and just sucked it in, they'd have all the things that they needed to prove
[01:53:36.500 --> 01:53:41.140]   their model, you know, and without that, they're screwed. So like they're not going to ever get
[01:53:41.140 --> 01:53:45.780]   in. But if they do that, they basically, they basically take a crowbar and a sledgehammer and
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:50.340]   just slam it into it. I mean, they'd probably be, you know, they don't own a majority of that
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:54.020]   market. I think that anti trust would be difficult. I think, I think they, they could probably get
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:54:00.180]   through that. And, but they have to own a bunch of these bits of the market to prove that it's a
[01:54:00.180 --> 01:54:04.980]   good idea because they're not, no one else is going to willingly give it to them. Time Warner
[01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:11.140]   or Netflix. Time Warner is available. Yeah. No, I have to say this point, in a way, Chromecast has a
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:17.300]   better story than the Apple TV, because at least you can go to one device, find what you want,
[01:54:17.300 --> 01:54:22.500]   and then send it to your TV. If Chromecast were on more apps, it'd be better. But, but it's on
[01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:29.060]   enough apps that that's a that that your phone becomes the unified app, because you can pick what
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:35.380]   you want there. Anyway, let's take a break. And we're going to give you a chance, all four of you,
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:42.500]   to do your picks of the week. So prepare. I shall start with my pick in a way tracker.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:47.700]   I think the tracker is just the bestest thing because I lose my keys a lot. I miss, I don't lose
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:52.340]   them. I miss play. I have them. They're here somewhere. I just don't know where. That was until
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:57.620]   I put the little tracker on my key chain. And by the way, I then clip my key chain into my
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:55:03.380]   my handbag. What do I call that man bag? My brief Indiana Jones, Satchel.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:08.420]   My Satchel. And that way I'm killing two birds with one stone. Of course, you can have up to
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:14.740]   10 trackers on your your app. So you can have the remote controls on there if you want.
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:20.100]   I hear people starting to put them in luggage as well. The tracker is about a size of a quarter.
[01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:24.820]   It's lighter than a quarter. It's anodized aluminum. It's very thin, light enough, thin enough,
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:28.740]   small enough that you could actually use it for a pet tag. It's about the size of a pet tag.
[01:55:29.540 --> 01:55:34.740]   Engrave it with Fido's name and number. Put it in their waterproof case. You'll never lose your pet
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:42.500]   again. And by the way, you can't get customized laser engraving or their new really cool UV
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:46.580]   silk screening on this. That's what we did here. We got the Mac Brake Weekly album art on our
[01:55:46.580 --> 01:55:52.740]   on our tracker. And the tracker is one of the few Bluetooth tracking devices, the only one I know
[01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:58.980]   of, that you don't throw out when your battery wears out. That's just nuts. That's what a waste
[01:55:58.980 --> 01:56:04.020]   that is. The tracker, it's got a new battery. You just put a battery in there. It's using Bluetooth
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:08.660]   LED. The battery lasts about a year. There are those little coin sized batteries. You can get
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:13.300]   it in any drugstore. And I like that. I don't like the idea of throwing out my tracker just
[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:19.780]   because it's battery is used up. It works with iOS or Android. You can customize two-way
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:23.780]   separation alerts too. So if you're one of those people that tends to leave your phone behind as
[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:28.500]   much as you leave your keys, you can have it beep. The tracker will beep at you when your phone gets
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:33.140]   out of range and your phone will beep at you when your keys get out of your tracker gets out of range.
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:38.980]   But the best part about the tracker, I think, is their crowd GPS network. There are now three and
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:43.380]   a half million trackers out there. They have sold them like crazy. I think the guy told me
[01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:47.700]   that we're doing, I think, a hundred thousand a month now, something like that. Some huge number.
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:53.060]   I take credit for that, by the way. And the nice thing is, look at that map. It's getting pretty,
[01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:57.700]   it's going to be all blue pretty soon. The nice thing is, do the slider so you can see
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:03.700]   how the tracker network has grown. Because it's just grown tremendously over the last few months.
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:07.380]   And that means there are more and more, you see those hot spots? That means there's trackers
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:10.980]   everywhere. There are more and more places. So here's what happens. You pair it to your phone,
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:16.660]   you leave your keys. Let's say I leave my keys on the counter of a drive-through
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:24.260]   drive-in restaurant in Alamogordo, New Mexico. And I drive home. Well, now as soon as I get
[01:57:24.260 --> 01:57:27.140]   more than a hundred feet out of range, my phone doesn't know where it is. It can tell me where it
[01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:32.500]   saw it last. As long as nobody moves those keys, I know where they are. But let's say then somebody
[01:57:32.500 --> 01:57:38.660]   picks up the keys by accident. The trucker takes off and he drives to Fort Collins, Colorado. Well,
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:44.340]   now anytime somebody with the tracker software running on their phone walks by my keys,
[01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:49.700]   the software goes, "Hey, I see Leo's keys and sends me a note." And now my map is updated on my
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:55.700]   phone. It says, "Your keys will ask you to Fort Collins, Colorado." This is awesome. The tracker.
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:58:00.820]   Go to the tracker.com and you will, I mean, just get a bunch of them. You never want to lose
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:05.220]   anything again. If you enter the promo code MACBRAKE, you're going to get a free tracker bravo
[01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:11.060]   with your order. Yeah, free. The tracker.com promo code MACBRAKE.
[01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:16.180]   When I get excited about some of that, I tend to buy a lot of them and put them everywhere.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:20.500]   And I get trackers everywhere, everywhere. But I know where everything is now.
[01:58:20.500 --> 01:58:27.380]   The tracker.com promo code MACBRAKE. Time for our, and we thank them, by the way,
[01:58:27.380 --> 01:58:31.380]   for supporting MACBRAKE. Our picks of the week. Let's start with Adam and
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:33.860]   stall the way on the left there. What do you got for us, Adam?
[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:39.300]   Well, you actually sort of got a little bit of the same area. I've been playing a little bit
[01:58:39.300 --> 01:58:45.300]   with these things called wireless sensor tags, just a little pun of a square weight plastic.
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:49.540]   Are those beacons? No, they're not beacons. I actually have some of those too, which I
[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:54.580]   couldn't show you, but I'm not showing them today. But what the wireless sensor tags are,
[01:58:54.580 --> 01:59:01.220]   as they do motion detection, temperature sensing, and humidity and things like that.
[01:59:01.220 --> 01:59:06.260]   And I got them because we have a big 20 cubic foot chest freezer in our garage,
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:11.460]   which is now 15, 16 years old. And also because this summer, we're having trouble with our,
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:18.820]   our refrigerator not closing properly. And yeah, so it's basically that. And so you just say,
[01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:24.340]   tell it what range you want to keep your device in. And if it goes out of that range,
[01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:29.380]   alerts your iPhone. Oh, that's cool. So if your fridge starts to warm up, it says,
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:33.540]   hey, somebody left the door open. And because it's actually giving you this nice chart of the
[01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:39.380]   temperature all the time, you can actually see, oh, maybe I should be turning my fridge down or up,
[01:59:39.380 --> 01:59:44.260]   as the case may be, because it's, you know, it should be, you know, freezer should be, you know,
[01:59:44.260 --> 01:59:49.380]   hovering around zero degrees and look minds at actually 10 or 15, which keep stuff frozen,
[01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:55.140]   but not ideal. Or maybe I'm getting down at minus 20, I should really be not wasting so much
[01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:59.220]   power. So cute little device, the only trick I had in setting it up was you've got to punch a
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:03.300]   hole through your firewall, pour, you know, do a port map. Because it can't be Bluetooth,
[02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:11.540]   because it says 700 feet range. Wi-Fi? It's proprietary. And so basically, it just talks with its own
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:15.940]   thing. But that way it can get, you know, work on the inside of a freezer in the garage. Right.
[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:22.100]   Right. Right. And so yeah, so that works. And it works brilliantly. The app is, you know, not,
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:28.340]   it's a it's not super sleek, but that's because it has so many features in terms of, you know,
[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:34.420]   setting your notification levels and, you know, tell me if it changes every one minute, five minutes,
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:40.580]   10 minutes, 30 minutes, hour or four hours, that kind of stuff. So it's very, very configurable
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:46.900]   and customizable. And I was actually pretty shocked to see the, it's like the inner life of my refrigerator.
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:54.740]   Look, it's turned on again. It's gotten cold. And so it was kind of fun to get the alerts. I've
[02:00:54.740 --> 02:00:59.380]   been tweaking the sense, you know, the settings so that it doesn't alert me nearly as much now.
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:03.700]   But even still, I'm like, whoa, something happened, you know, I go check it out. I haven't yet had
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:07.860]   a failure. I'm not sort of waiting for like the fridge to not get closed or the something to go
[02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:13.060]   wrong so that I'm like, whoa, it saved me. But it hasn't had to do that yet. And the, so the app
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:19.460]   is the is the Kumo app. And the app is there's sort of two things. There's them like the main app.
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:22.820]   And then they have these things called Kumo apps, which I haven't really played with, but they seem to be
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:29.780]   more specific sets of notifications. Like if this is true, and this is true, and this is true,
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:35.460]   then do this other thing. And I think you can use it with IFTTT as well. I haven't played with that yet.
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:39.060]   So it's these are really another Internet of Things kind of a device.
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:44.260]   Yeah. And they're not home kit. I asked the company and they made some kind of
[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:49.620]   pain noises about how Apple just charges way too much to fit them to bother with home kit
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:57.540]   support. But you know, the app works perfectly. The sensors work perfectly. And I mean, I forgot
[02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:02.260]   how expensive they were exactly. But you know, I have the price list right here. So you have to
[02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:07.220]   get the the tag manager, right? That's the base station. That's 50 bucks. And then you get the
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:13.060]   like, yeah, I got the I think I think I just got the $29 tax variety of different sensors,
[02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:21.540]   promotion for water, and then temperature and humidity. It is really cool when you're traveling
[02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:25.460]   somewhere. And you know, your refrigerator tells you that it's gotten a little warm, you know,
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:29.780]   it's not much you can do about it right then and there personally. But you know, if it was the freezer
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:33.460]   outside and it was getting a little warm, I could call a neighbor and say, okay, this is really
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:37.620]   terrible. Could you please go put, you know, blankets on it and you know, start making plans
[02:02:37.620 --> 02:02:46.820]   for getting a replacement? Cool. Wireless tag.net. Wireless tag.net. Very interesting.
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:53.220]   Well, now let's see if you now Adam's done. So it's Alex Lindsey's turn. We haven't had a pick
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:57.220]   from you in a long time. I hope it's a really expensive one. No, I'm going. I'm going easy. I'm
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:03:03.140]   going easy on. Oh, man. Yeah, you know, so it's but it's still a little pro tip here. So,
[02:03:03.140 --> 02:03:10.820]   so we use a lot of these little SSDs. We kind of use them like tape, you know, for, you know, on
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:15.780]   the road. It's almost all of our recorders use them. And even when I'm editing, I simply just plug
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:20.100]   those into my laptop and edit off of those because they're so much faster than dealing with other
[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:27.700]   things. So so the we have a few ourselves. We use these to record the shows. In fact, this is
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:34.180]   these are little cartridges from our ingest station. Can you believe that we now sneaker net our
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:40.260]   shows basically record them on SSDs and Bloppy tries got a lot more interesting than they
[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:46.580]   zip drive bring them down to the hall of the editor. But it's actually faster. The bandwidth is
[02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:52.340]   better. I mean, this is like one of the one of the couple of the stacks that that we have. Wow.
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:59.700]   Wow. And they're, you know, they, you know, they all have little like what what angle they were
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:03.140]   because we'll have a bunch of I so's and stuff that we're reporting from an event. And anyway,
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:08.100]   so transferring all that data or getting to the program to do a fast turn or whatever becomes
[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:12.580]   a challenge. And so so we have, you know, we've been using the Thunderbolt, I think I've talked
[02:04:12.580 --> 02:04:16.020]   about them before, the Thunderbolt ones, but we wanted something a little cheaper that we can
[02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:20.020]   actually because when you send these to clients, even though we know what they're useful for,
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:26.180]   they're like, I don't understand, you know, so so we got these little and then I think a couple
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:31.380]   people make them, but the one specifically we use are these little Sabrent. And what these are
[02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:42.980]   is just USB three to SSD. They're $10. And you just plug them in. They're very wrong. We literally
[02:04:42.980 --> 02:04:47.300]   just plug them in. You know, you just you just we literally just ship these like, you know,
[02:04:47.300 --> 02:04:50.980]   if we ship something to somebody, it's like, you know, just just here's the here's the little
[02:04:50.980 --> 02:04:55.940]   connector that you need for your USB, you know, whatever. And and if you buy like these 120s,
[02:04:55.940 --> 02:05:00.500]   I don't know how big this one is, this one's bigger, probably this is a 500. But but there's
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:05.380]   if you take a little 120 gig drive, it costs less than a lot of the hard drives used to,
[02:05:05.380 --> 02:05:09.620]   but it's 120 gigs, you can put a ProRes file on there and send it to send it to somebody and
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:14.660]   and not invest a lot in how they're going to connect to it. So anyway,
[02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:24.100]   it's really cool. useful. $10 for that adapter. And you can just plug in your drive to any USB port.
[02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:26.420]   They have to make a type C one though.
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:29.540]   Yeah.
[02:05:29.540 --> 02:05:43.860]   Renee Richie, your pick of the week. I've got two. So the first one is
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:50.260]   the new Mac Pro, but a surprising version of it. And that is the stripped down version with the only
[02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:55.700]   two ports on the side. I'm gonna slide all you'll find. Yeah, there's still a 3.5 millimeter
[02:05:55.700 --> 02:06:01.060]   headphone jack just to mess with you still right there. So a total courage under fire. So
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:07.380]   this one is sort of intended backup a little bit is sort of intended and it actually boots up
[02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:11.940]   when you open it, which is pretty nifty. That's the thing no more bong. No, well, no,
[02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:14.740]   because now you can no longer predict when it's booting up and they didn't want to bong people
[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:18.820]   unexpectedly. I think you can restore it and set it. Yeah, there's a terminal. There's a terminal
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:23.700]   command. Yeah, by default, it will not bong in the middle of your broadcast. The interesting thing
[02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:28.180]   about this is for years, people have wanted a retina MacBook Air, but for a variety of reasons
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:32.420]   are written in the Mac, the MacBook Air platform, which is never well suited for the technology you'd
[02:06:32.420 --> 02:06:37.460]   need to go retina. So what Apple did was instead of making a 14 inch MacBook, and we can debate the
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:42.420]   merits of that at some point, they made a lower end version of the MacBook Pro that is essentially
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:48.020]   a MacBook Air with a retina display. It's the same sort of thin light device that you'd want in a
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:53.780]   MacBook Air, easy to travel with full metal design. It's got two USB C slash Thunderbolt three ports
[02:06:53.780 --> 02:07:00.260]   instead of four, but the full speed ports does not have the magic. Sorry, does not have the touch bar,
[02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:05.540]   but does have the function key row. So if you love the escape key, if you love your physical
[02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:09.940]   tactile buttons there, you have those. It starts at $500 more than the MacBook Air.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:15.860]   And it's it is a really good machine. I've been using it for the last four, four days,
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:19.780]   and I use the MacBook Air 13 inch MacBook Air for years. And I really love that machine. And
[02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:23.140]   even though it was highly constrained, just traveling all the time and having to cover
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:27.540]   events and trade shows and conferences, it was super convenient. And this sort of has
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:31.540]   that vibe to me where it has constraints, but I know them and I'm willing to sort of make
[02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:35.860]   those concessions because of the other things that I do. But because we no longer we don't live in
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:40.980]   the future yet. And because Microsoft as long as well as having their own event, they were on
[02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:48.020]   stage at Apple's event showing off the wonderful touch bar integration for the Microsoft apps.
[02:07:48.020 --> 02:07:52.020]   They sort of work well together. So I looked at the Microsoft hub, the Microsoft display hub,
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:57.140]   which they built for their Lumia phones. But our Windows central team recommended highly for just
[02:07:57.140 --> 02:08:01.860]   a USB-C to sort of multi port adapter. Mine hasn't arrived yet, but it's $99.
[02:08:01.860 --> 02:08:10.660]   Does USB-C in it has display out USB to out. Again, $99. It looks fine. It's sort of like
[02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:15.300]   the same sort of space gray color. The MacBook is so I figure if Microsoft really works this well
[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:18.100]   with everybody, why can't it work this well with that with that MacBook Pro?
[02:08:18.100 --> 02:08:20.660]   Yeah. We'll all be buying jocks.
[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:23.060]   One kind or another, but that's nice.
[02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:27.540]   And it's easy to travel with. What's the battery life like on that new MacBook?
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:34.260]   So I've only had it for four days and I've only had to charge it twice. So it's last. Apple's
[02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:38.340]   pretty conservative now with their battery life test. They do a lot of real world testing.
[02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:42.660]   It's not as bad as phones where we're using Snapchat and Pokemon Go and Facebook all the time.
[02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:47.460]   And those kill batteries. But this does not have discrete graphics either. So it's not getting
[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:51.700]   the drain that a discrete graphics chip would. So it lasted me, I think 12 hours the first time
[02:08:51.700 --> 02:08:56.740]   I used it. And so far, I think it's four or five hours on the keyboard really is the same as the
[02:08:56.740 --> 02:09:03.220]   MacBook, right? Yeah, I've said so it's next generation, domes, next generation, butterfly is
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:07.140]   if you hate the MacBook keyboard, you're going to hate this one. If you like the MacBook keyboard,
[02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:10.980]   this is a little better because it just feels and I'm having a heart because I'm a really terrible
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:16.100]   typist, not in terms like I can type fast, obviously, but I don't I don't understand. It's like music.
[02:09:16.100 --> 02:09:20.740]   I enjoy listening to it, but I understand nothing about it. So to me, it feels about the same. I'm
[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:26.340]   fine with it, but I know it drives some people mad. I'll find out. I spent
[02:09:26.340 --> 02:09:32.660]   awful lot of money on the top of the line 15 inch. If I can type on it, I'm going to be very unhappy.
[02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:36.900]   You just got the external keyboard from Microsoft. You might get me doing that. Yeah.
[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:42.740]   Andy and I go wrap it up for us. Well, why I should mention just briefly, consider the source.
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:49.540]   It's the New York Post. But according to the Post, there's some pressure now on Apple to buy
[02:09:49.540 --> 02:09:58.020]   Time Warner. This is from loop insight.com. Goldman Sachs is trying to persuade Apple to make a rival
[02:09:58.020 --> 02:10:02.740]   bid for Time Warner. Of course, as you know, AT&T is trying to acquire it. Cook's company is
[02:10:02.740 --> 02:10:06.900]   expressed interest in buying Time Warner in the recent past. And there's some belief that judging
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:13.380]   from his comments this week, he will not let AT&T carry the day. So you know what, you might
[02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:18.260]   have nailed that one, but it's DC Comics not Marvel. I think with Alex is right. The heart
[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:20.180]   wants what the heart wants. It wants Lucas.
[02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:24.340]   Andy and I are worse. Andy and I. There's a I.
[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:31.620]   I'll stay out of it. I said, I said, I said my piece. I think Disney's the right one for them to buy
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:35.060]   if they're going to buy something. They have very close ties to Disney, of course, as well.
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:40.100]   Well, they get they got they get sports. They get, you know, they get sports with the SPM.
[02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:43.780]   They've got a variety of broadcast. They've got Marvel. They get Lucasfilm. They get if they
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:47.460]   want to go to EDU, there's a whole bunch of things they could crossover with that. They
[02:10:48.180 --> 02:10:52.900]   in addition to that, there's a lot of R&D you can do with Bluetooth. I say buy both.
[02:10:52.900 --> 02:10:59.300]   And you get a game of Thrones and Star Wars. And I can't wait for the game of Thrones,
[02:10:59.300 --> 02:11:03.940]   Star Wars, mash up next Christmas 26 17 Superman versus Captain America.
[02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:09.300]   They should buy them both. Put them in a man's jar and then flake will fight to one of the
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:16.820]   lips. You'll just make a door. Thor versus the mountain. Yeah, now you're talking.
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:23.540]   Andy and I go you're bigger the week. Mine is kind of relevant to people. It's not technology,
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:27.380]   but so relevant to people who have to spend a lot of time at their desks being annoyed by
[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:32.580]   computers and stuff. There's a product category. I've really loved all my life, but only like
[02:11:32.580 --> 02:11:37.140]   three weeks to what I've realized, there's the name of the category is digits. These are like
[02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:42.340]   things that you hold in your hand that you just basically sort of fidget with your fingers and
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:48.340]   you burns off like excess energy or excess boredom. If you remember the cane mutiny of how
[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:55.460]   I was told. He's a strawberry. He'd have like two to like big ball steel ball bearings,
[02:11:55.460 --> 02:11:59.380]   maybe like sort of clack in his hands as just something to do with his fingers.
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:05.380]   And so this is a great company called Fidgetopia. When I wanted to give them money, it's only because
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:08.180]   for a great name and they make these really great. I'm going to.
[02:12:08.180 --> 02:12:14.900]   I'm not like this. And I bought like a bunch of their fidgets and they're so cool. This is their
[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:22.660]   bike chain fidget and all it does is this. You just hold it in your hand and you can just like
[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:29.620]   do this or like do this with it and you're not looking at your hands. It's just that you're waiting
[02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:34.580]   for a train and it's not enough of a long wait for you to like get something out to read or get
[02:12:34.580 --> 02:12:38.100]   an email to do. If you're on the spectrum, you just will love fidgetopia.
[02:12:38.100 --> 02:12:42.660]   This is well, this is this is actually a lot of these things are actually like almost prescribed
[02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:48.020]   for kids who are on the autism spectrum. But they're just kind of fun things to have.
[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:52.100]   This is the vortex. That's the one I want. Look at that.
[02:12:52.100 --> 02:12:59.940]   Chainless is basically just a not of like stainless steel links. It is satisfyingly like heavy and
[02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:05.300]   chunky in your hand. And I had to I had to move crane camp 3000 to show you how it works because
[02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:12.020]   all that you do is that you just can just sort of like flip these little things from one from like
[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:17.860]   one part of the not to the other in your hand. And it's just very, very satisfying. If you can't
[02:13:17.860 --> 02:13:24.420]   like carry like a cat or a puppy with you to pet all day long wherever you go. This is like sort of
[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:29.940]   the same thing gives you like that sort of like slight de stressing thing. I don't I don't want
[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:35.780]   to overstate this. Not like I'm like filled with anger and hostility and violence every moment of
[02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:41.380]   my life. But there's just something there's that extra like 1% of stress that like gets burned off
[02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:47.460]   when you just have this thing to just like fiddle with in your hand. I didn't and I used to have
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:53.780]   a I want to take you back to my days as an undergrad where my roommate had a collection of
[02:13:53.780 --> 02:13:59.940]   butterfly knives. This is and the much better than butterfly knife. Yeah, exactly. But like but
[02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:04.100]   but I remember like long, long, long nights in the computing center when I had to use like the
[02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:09.220]   supercomputer in the mainframes to write like these bet these this code that's that took a long
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:12.900]   time to compile and print. And I would just have this butterfly knife in my hand. I would just go
[02:14:12.900 --> 02:14:18.900]   flick flick flick flick flick flick flick open. It's like open flick of a close. And it was such a
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:22.900]   great way to like I've got 12 minutes until this damn output comes out and you tell me that I'm
[02:14:22.900 --> 02:14:27.700]   afraid I need to get an ominous menace at the same time. You know, Andy, I still do that with
[02:14:27.700 --> 02:14:32.740]   keys. I open and close my eyes with right keys. Oh, and actually I don't I have I actually found
[02:14:32.740 --> 02:14:37.940]   a date you can buy butterfly knives are illegal. You should not own them also as I as I learned
[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:42.580]   when I was in their non they're not going to legal or Pennsylvania. And as I learned when I was 18
[02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:47.220]   if you accidentally like hold it by the wrong end, you do the flicking maneuver, you can hurt
[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:54.340]   yourself kind of badly. I'm a piece of my my my my my pinky. Right. But they but they also make
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:59.140]   like training additions of these that you actually buy on Amazon. It's just like, it's a butterfly
[02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:03.780]   knife, but instead of like an actual like deadly shiv, it's actually just like a butter knife
[02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:07.860]   like in the middle of it. So it's like blunt on both sides. And so I bought one of those and like
[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:12.420]   up my old moves back. But this is this is less likely to get me like arrested by
[02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:15.940]   it's only butter the butter fly knife.
[02:15:15.940 --> 02:15:22.660]   And these and these like it's a really nice thing. It's only like 12 or 12 bucks. They also make it
[02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:27.940]   in like you call it rose gold. It's actually metal pink. And they also make it in like jet black.
[02:15:27.940 --> 02:15:33.620]   And then and also this is a really nice company because I bought like this and this in the same
[02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:38.660]   box. It came with you open the box and there's like a tootsie roll like place delicately at the top
[02:15:38.660 --> 02:15:43.860]   of the box and the hand not not like a pre printed and they sign your name but an actual hand
[02:15:43.860 --> 02:15:47.940]   written little note. Thanks Andy for buying your this void text and the other thing too. I hope
[02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:54.260]   you like it. And they also threw in like the smaller size of this for free because I'd spent all of
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:59.460]   30 all the $25 at their shop. So definitely underscoring that this is an American company that's
[02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:04.820]   a it seems like a mom and pop sort of shop. So in addition to great product in addition to
[02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:09.220]   inexpensive in addition to handmade in addition to a great name. I feel like okay I've helped
[02:16:09.220 --> 02:16:15.700]   somebody buy coffee in a muffin or or pay their electric bill this month. So like I said I bought
[02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:21.700]   it I bought it just as as a flutter not knowing if I'd like it but I find myself like just taking
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:26.340]   out my pocket when I'm just okay time for another restart and I'll just like be fiddling with this
[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:31.460]   for really really nice stuff. Andy and I go your pick of the week. Thank you sir Andy is at the
