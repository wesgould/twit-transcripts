[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.640]   Joining us from Hollywood, Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.680]   Can you tell us--
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.720]   can you say where you are?
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.840]   Is that top secret?
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.080]   No, actually, I can.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.840]   I'm on the set of Dexter.
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.080]   This is not the set of Dexter.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.960]   But I'm-- the set of Dexter is like right around the corner.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.040]   I've seen that room in Dexter, actually.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.600]   They might have used it for something.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.560]   But yeah, so one of our listeners, Robert Lewis,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.120]   is the producer for Dexter.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.640]   But like the producer, like the producer, producer?
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.160]   Although nowadays, when you see a TV show,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.120]   you see everybody's name as a producer.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.320]   Well, anyway, but he's doing a lot of stuff.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.440]   He's like working.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.120]   He's working and managing stuff and watching the show.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.480]   And he's a big fan.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.040]   And so he invited me to come down.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.240]   I was complaining that Dexter was getting taken off of Netflix.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.160]   So I got invited to come get dumbed down.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.680]   He would love to have you, Leo.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.760]   Yeah, I've heard it all before.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.760]   You should definitely-- just think of me as recon for the real
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.600]   and big.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.240]   No, I don't want to see a real studio.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.120]   I'll just get jealous and spend on money.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.200]   It's not there.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.840]   It is the best.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.560]   It is better than--
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.840]   Do they have bricks, though?
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.920]   I bet they don't.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.040]   Commemorative bricks on their wall of honor.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   I bet they don't have that.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.560]   They have a lot of sound blankets, but no bricks.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.280]   No bricks, see.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.480]   Maybe we should sell commemorative sound blankets.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.160]   We'll get over there.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.080]   We might need to.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.800]   Andy Inaco is also here from the Chicago Sun Times
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.080]   and his website, Celestial Waste of Ban with Hello Andy.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.120]   He was playing a nice little BBC serenade for us earlier.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.200]   Yes, that's just part of the benefits package.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.080]   When you subscribe to the Mac Break Live Plus podcast,
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.680]   you get to see the 40 minutes of stuff that happens
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.320]   when we're trying to-- oh, is it better like this?
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.680]   Hang on.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.560]   Oh, OK, wait a minute.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.240]   It's a wrong camera.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.680]   Hang on.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.720]   Gold, absolutely.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.840]   You know, that's a good idea.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.240]   Maybe we should sell that.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.960]   That's a very, very good idea.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.680]   Anyway, thank you, gentlemen, for joining me.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.120]   For those who heard me on Twitch say
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.520]   that we would have Larry Jordan on to talk about Final Cut Pro.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.480]   I was in error.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.360]   However, we will get him on in a future episode.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.680]   And you may remember his appearance
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.120]   at the NAB show is really great.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.960]   He was very excited about Final Cut Pro 10.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.880]   It came out last week.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.320]   We spent kind of the first half of the show talking about it.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.440]   And we spent two hours talking about it on Tuesday.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.880]   You did a whole thing from Pixelcore on Thursday.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.800]   And now on YouTube.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.960]   Oh, good.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.200]   YouTube.com/Pixelscore.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.200]   You know, it's--
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.520]   Pixelcore.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.160]   Yeah, it's YouTube.com.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.560]   And then it's something really long.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.840]   It is.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.240]   It's not just Pixelcore?
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.960]   No, it's not Pixelcore.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.720]   A hint to the young podcaster might be a good idea
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.160]   to have a name people can remember.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.200]   I know, I know.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.320]   But if you-- anyway, so--
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.820]   It's OK.
[00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.400]   I don't care.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.440]   I'm just learning how to use this thing.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.320]   The internet.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.680]   I do what a concept.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.880]   I was going to put it on the pod.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.120]   It's going to go into the feed.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.960]   But a lot of people are asking to get it quickly.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.680]   And so it's going to go into the general--
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.180]   Good.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.180]   --acbreak studio feed.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.180]   It's two hours long.
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.680]   And it turned out to be a great conversation.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.960]   It was our first real conversation in the new studio.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.480]   That's right.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.000]   You got the pride of inaugurating the new studio.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.400]   It works great, just in case you're wondering.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.840]   Thank you, Studio.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.440]   You know, by the way, I just have to say--
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.640]   I don't know people have been looking at the live thing.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.960]   Your studio looks just awesome.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.680]   As the stuff starts to fill in, I just can't wait to see the live.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.600]   That is nice as Dexter.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.960]   But at least there are no dead bodies on the set.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.560]   Oh, you know, that-- it adds a lot.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.200]   You know, the pieces, the well-cut pieces.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.320]   We're going to-- we've actually made an announcement.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.360]   I don't know if we've blogged it yet.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.080]   Did you blog it yet?
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.120]   No.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.920]   But we have decided kind of--
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.560]   we just decided to throw a dart out of the calendar.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.040]   And July 24th will be our first broadcast--
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.680]   will do "Twit" that Sunday from the new studio.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.200]   So I will do the Tech Guy radio show here on the 24th.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.440]   I will then pick up my ball.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.080]   And I will walk down the street, two blocks,
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.720]   to the new studio, where I will place the ball at the table
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.360]   and we will do a "Twit."
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.320]   And that will commence the actual production from that studio.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.200]   And I think the movers are going to come the day before.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.840]   We'll have the office staff.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.800]   Well, then, you know, Monday, that next day, we'll be there.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.240]   And then this place will be a shambles,
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.320]   because then the next step is to tear this thing up
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.440]   and bring that over the current studio.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.240]   July 24th.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.160]   And we're thinking-- and please save this date--
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.800]   August 21st for the party.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.600]   Andy, you will receive an invitation in the mail.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.120]   Thank you.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.760]   But save the date.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.400]   If I don't make it, just take a couple of those jumbo shrimp,
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.480]   just put an "A FedEx" envelope somewhere over there.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.640]   Really?
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.960]   Well, I just like to feel this though I'm part of it.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.720]   I want you to be here.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.880]   Anyway, we'll figure that out.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.440]   But August 21st, if Chris Apple probably
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.600]   do an announcement or something.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.040]   If Apple makes an announcement, I
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.320]   can make an attack deductible trip.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.760]   There you go.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.080]   No, they still tax deductible.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.720]   It's deductible.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.200]   It's true.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.880]   This is business, sort of.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.400]   There you go.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.880]   Sort of.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.400]   So yeah, and I think we're going to do a long--
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.240]   like a 12-hour broadcast associated with that.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.240]   We'll just-- because if all hosts are in town
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.800]   and there's a lot of stuff going on,
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.440]   we'll bring dignitaries in and stuff.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.640]   And I think we'll just do 12 hours straight from the party.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.000]   I'll wear a tuxedo.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.200]   Again, I keep coming here.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.440]   You're throwing it away.
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.640]   You want heft's pet house.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.800]   You want the smoking jacket.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.960]   All right, if everybody's going to be there,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.440]   you want a party, you want to like a light jazz band.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.960]   We'll do that.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.640]   That's a good idea.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   No, we'll do that.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.880]   And we have a place where a jazz band could play.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.560]   So anyway, but enough about me.
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.600]   How are you?
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.080]   Let's talk about Final Cut Pro 10.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.960]   It's been out a week now.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.600]   And according to Gizmodo, Apple--
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.480]   actually, this comes from EOS HD website.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:18.560]   Apple is apparently sending refunds to some people.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.360]   EOS HD is a site for people who use cannons
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.680]   for shooting video.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.720]   And they have a couple of emails from Apple saying, well,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.200]   here's one.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.080]   This is a British one.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.400]   Moving forward, I understand you're
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.000]   not satisfied with the Apple Final Cut Pro.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.400]   I certainly can certainly appreciate you
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.680]   would like a refund.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.720]   And I would be more than happy to help you on with this today.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.680]   In five to seven business days, a credit of £179.99
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.560]   should be posted to the credit card that
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.440]   appears on the receipt for that purchase.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.200]   Please note, this is a one-time exception
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.800]   because the iTunes terms like a digital state, all sales
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.480]   are final as we know because we heard Richard Dreyfus tell you.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:04.480]   And then another one, refunding both for Final Cut Pro
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.520]   and Compressor in US dollars.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.600]   So I mean, anybody else in the chat room
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.400]   got their money back?
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.840]   Has anybody asked for their money back?
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.640]   I hope we don't start an avalanche.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.160]   And yet you, you, Alex Lindsey, I don't think you want your money
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.120]   back.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.760]   No, no, I don't.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.240]   I spent good hard earned money on Final Cut 10.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.160]   And I'm quite fine with it.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:33.160]   I think that I do--
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.880]   and I want to make sure that it's clear that there's a hope.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.440]   I'm not talking about someone who's not
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.880]   using a lot of the heavy features in Final Cut 7.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.080]   We've used just about all of it.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.920]   We use multi-cam a lot.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.520]   We use a lot.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.800]   The multi-cam is gone, right?
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.720]   Yeah, we use EDL.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.360]   We have-- and on top of that, we have a couple of--
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   No EDL.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.200]   Although, Apple says EDL is an antiquated format.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.520]   You shouldn't be using it.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.920]   It is an antiquated format.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.600]   And there's-- what is it-- OH?
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.120]   What is the other-- the newer format?
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.280]   OMF.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.480]   And it doesn't support that either.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.160]   But it will, according to Apple.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:00.680]   Well, yeah.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.440]   And so the thing is, is that I am one of the--
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.480]   and I keep on saying one of the 10% of users.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.120]   I mean, I think that a lot of times we--
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.600]   we're hearing a lot of people get upset.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.400]   A lot of people are talking about it.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:13.160]   We have to remember that 10%-- when I say 10%
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.920]   are the people using Final Cut 7 tools that are not available,
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.720]   that's 200,000 users.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:27.240]   That is a massive percentage of all of the premier or avid
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:27.760]   users.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.160]   So the thing-- what you're really looking at is just
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.760]   a very, very large number of people who are--
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.320]   they're upset.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.040]   But they really are a small percentage of the users.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.080]   I've been talking to a lot of people, of course,
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.800]   because of the show and because of the stuff we did last week.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.400]   A lot of people have been talking to me about it.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.680]   And there's obviously Final Cut editors are app-afflected
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.360]   in the high end.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.960]   The high end.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.360]   They've lost Final Cut.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.480]   They've lost the--
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.840]   server, Final Cut server.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.320]   Maybe the question really is, did Apple
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.000]   mishandle this release?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.880]   That's what people are-- I guess really
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.920]   complain about it.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.160]   Some say you should have called it Final Cut Express,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.600]   or I movie Pro.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.080]   Or could have just called it--
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.800]   one of the things it was bouncing around is you could have
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.960]   called it just Final Cut X.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.280]   Rather than Final Cut Pro X.
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.240]   But the reality is, is that people are going to be using
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.200]   this for Pro solutions.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.560]   I mean, when you think about Pro Professional, people are
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.120]   going to get paid using Final Cut.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.680]   I mean, it may not be what people look at it for.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.280]   But when I got to say, when Final Cut Pro came out in 1999,
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.320]   it was not nearly as advanced as the one that's out here right
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:30.520]   now.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.360]   And it was called that.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.080]   But that's a good reason not to throw it out.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.480]   There's been a lot of-- there's been 10 years of solid work
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.360]   to make that thing a professional tool.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.720]   By the way, nobody's making you throw it out.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.680]   And of course, anybody who uses Final Cut Pro 7
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.080]   will continue to do so, right?
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.560]   Yeah, but here's the problem with that.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.080]   And this is where I think Apple really made the mistake,
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.280]   is that they need to do--
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.640]   and I'm kind of surprised that they're
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.920]   going to have to do this about face.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.120]   Because I think they're going to have to do this.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.000]   They're going to have to make Final Cut 7 available again
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.560]   to buy for purchase, maybe through specific outlets,
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   maybe through whatever.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.920]   But the point is, is that they had to do this with iMovie
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.080]   when they launched the new one.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.480]   I'm kind of surprised that it's--
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.280]   But iMovie was free, kind of, sort of.
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.720]   And you could download an iMovie.
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.440]   You could download the old version of iMovie for a long time.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.480]   But iMovie HD.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.800]   In fact, you might still be able to do for all.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.680]   Yeah, and here's the upset for editors or companies
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.600]   that pay those editors, is that they're now
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.080]   in a position where they have an application that they
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.400]   can't grow into.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.920]   I can't hire-- if you can't buy Final Cut,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.800]   it means that you can't add new stations.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.240]   So even if they want to stay with Final Cut--
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.080]   No, and that's right.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.920]   And we want to add a fifth station, for instance,
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:37.960]   a twit.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.320]   And you're in big trouble.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.880]   Because you don't--
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.080]   I know I've gotten by now.
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.640]   Well, that station will have Final Cut Pro 10 on it.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:46.140]   Right.
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.400]   But nobody will want to--
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.400]   actually, for what we do, I don't think that's an issue.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.760]   Well, that's the point, is that for what many, many, many
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.880]   people do, one of the things we're going
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.640]   to be showing, we're going to be doing another live stream
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.080]   on Thursday from-- it's Twiplive, this week in Photography Live.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.360]   And so one of the things that I'm going to be showing
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.560]   is I'm going to experiment from a photographer's perspective
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.560]   in a DSLR shooting some footage and editing it in Final Cut 10.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.920]   Because I think that photographers
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.480]   who are moving from stills to video
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.560]   is a prime market for this new one.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.000]   I've talked to a lot of photographers
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.560]   who just didn't get Final Cut Express.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.080]   They were playing around with the iMovie.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.840]   They didn't want something as heavy as Final Cut Express
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.040]   or-- and then because of that, they didn't want Final Cut Pro.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.680]   They didn't want Premiere.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.320]   They didn't want to have it all as too much for them.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.640]   For them, Final Cut--
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.440]   Final Cut X is the right solution for them.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.040]   Andy, what were you going to say?
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.840]   No, I was just going to say, it's good that both Alex
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.520]   and I are in Scapasaurus today, because I
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.640]   think in these two squares that represent the audience
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.280]   for the previous Final Cut and the audience--
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.840]   That's why, by the way, I put you in an ex formation.
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.760]   I just want you to--
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.240]   We are diagonally opposed.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.320]   Yes.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's really, really clear that Apple decided
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.360]   that the user that they want to call to the Final Cut
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.080]   are people like me, people who might have a good use for iMovie
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.400]   but might be bumping their head against iMovie,
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:15.600]   who really has a professional-ish usage for a video editing
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.160]   app, but who not necessarily is going to be cutting an entire film
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.480]   with it, not necessarily is going to be pushing out hundreds
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.280]   and hundreds of hours with a video.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.160]   I think that people-- I think they're going to appreciate
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.440]   that they're going to lose the professional editing station,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.560]   but they're going to save a lot of money in training.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.000]   I downloaded it last week and instantly.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.360]   I think I got more--
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.320]   I sort of downgraded already to iMovie from Final Cut Express
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.560]   because I could, after weeks, I could
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.960]   be sort of competent in the Final Cut atmosphere,
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.360]   whereas with Final Cut X, even though there is a learning curve,
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.720]   a steeper learning curve than iMovie,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.000]   I could get a lot more done after just the first day
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.480]   than I had learned in the first couple of months of Final Cut X.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.560]   And the last thing is it really does show off
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:04.280]   that a basic maxim of Apple is that I'm speaking to everybody
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.440]   out there who uses Apple stuff.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.920]   Apple does not care about you or your money.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.600]   They care about the money of people who are coming into the stores
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.560]   two years from now.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.440]   And they're hoping that you will be one of those people
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.120]   who are coming into the store two years from now.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:20.000]   But if they feel as though they need a version of Final Cut
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.560]   that's going to be relevant for what they're doing in 2013, 2014.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.280]   And if that does mean having to simply say, look,
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.600]   keep your current version of Final Cut running.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.480]   If you want to upgrade to the new stuff, well,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.320]   you're going to have to relearn it because we really
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:33.920]   don't think this is going to pay off for us
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.960]   in a couple of years' time.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.240]   You just have to deal with that.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.800]   That applies to every single product
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.080]   across the entire product line.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.600]   Yeah, in fact, Martin Sassenberg in our chat room,
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.920]   Moss Media points out you've got shake.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.760]   You've got logic.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.520]   You've got X serves.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.840]   You now you have Final Cut Pro 7.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.480]   The Apple has cut a number of pro products
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.640]   or they've started to disappear.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.520]   But as Daniel Jalkut of Red Sweater Software
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.440]   said on the Twitter, he said Apple
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.040]   is willing to piss off 5,000 pros to gain 5 million new users.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.760]   That's what a business would do.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.280]   But people, I think, don't think of Apple that way.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.640]   They think of Apple as rightly or wrongly as their friend.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:21.080]   Well, but I think that Apple is focusing on a--
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.440]   it's not just that we're going to get rid of these pros.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.000]   Because Apple doesn't want to lose these pros.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.840]   That's not the point.
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.240]   The point is that Final Cut was never
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.880]   going to be able to scale up to being what it could be.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.960]   It was at the end of the line?
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.920]   End of life.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.760]   They couldn't make the adjustments.
[00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.520]   Final Cut has never been good at--
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.760]   That's interesting.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.480]   You can pull a 14-foot trailer with a chavat,
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.320]   but you really shouldn't.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.560]   You think it couldn't become 64-bit?
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.040]   Was it--
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.680]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.640]   The amount of recoding that it was going to--
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.600]   this is my guess.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.960]   I don't have any information.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.560]   But the amount of recoding that would have been required
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.840]   to get that thing up to 64-bit, to get all those things working,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.360]   they had to have made a decision that if we're going to do this rewrite,
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.680]   the best thing for us to do is actually just rewrite it.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:08.800]   And I'm sure that they knew that this was going to be a painful transition.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.160]   You could tell that they were nervous when they did the stuff in NAB.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.920]   They're very nervous about this whole process.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.920]   But I think that they could never grow it.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.640]   Now they have an editor on a new operating--
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.960]   it's 64-bit.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.320]   It's completely re-architected.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.920]   And yeah, it doesn't have all the features.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.680]   And what they're going to do is they're going to organically add those back in.
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.280]   They've already said some of the stuff is going to come back in.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.400]   We expect to see multicam.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.520]   And I guarantee when we put multicam--
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.040]   when we see multicam come back to Final Cut,
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.160]   it's going to be a lot better than the craziness that was part
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:49.040]   of the Final Cut 7, which was doable.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.080]   And it was powerful, but it was a mess to set up.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:52.880]   I'll say one thing, though.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.320]   Isn't it kind of curious, though, that Apple's first wave of responses to a lot
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.800]   of these complaints is that, yes, that's on the drawing board.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.400]   That's going to be in a future release working on it right now,
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.680]   as opposed to simply saying that Final Cut Pro 10 is--
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.360]   Oh, you can hear what I'm playing right now?
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.120]   I can't understand why you're--
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:13.640]   you can hear it.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.800]   Keep talking, and I will figure out why you can hear that,
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.640]   because you shouldn't be able to.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.640]   OK, go ahead.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.840]   Now you know what I'm going to do next, but go ahead.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.200]   It's all-- I'll preserve the surprise.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:34.920]   It's interesting that they didn't handle the current transition a little bit more
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.760]   smartly.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.120]   If they knew that if there were certain features that were critical enough
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.080]   that it was definitely lined up for the next version of Final Cut,
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.480]   that they didn't simply say, oh, and either delay it until it was ready to go,
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.600]   or simply put that in as part of the release notes,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.920]   or find a better way to migrate people into it.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.680]   I don't disagree with their decision to switch through a hugely different version,
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:02.400]   a hugely different approach, but maybe they could handle that transition a little bit better.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:08.240]   I'll tell you, when you get in mainstream media for the upgrade
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.720]   to a pro product like Final Cut, I guess you're
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.360]   doing something.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.560]   Well, you're making--
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.840]   When late night comedians--
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   when you're that relevant to regular people,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.280]   that mainstream late night comedics can make--
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.880]   not just a joke about your company or your iPad,
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:31.400]   but an online video editor that people have not heard of and have never used.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.440]   And yet, we all laughed.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.280]   That's only a partial failure.
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.360]   It's embarrassing, but you can say, OK, but you know what?
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.680]   That says something positive about our company, I think?
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.680]   I don't know.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.840]   Let me play the clip.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.640]   I won't play the whole thing, because I don't-- well, we're going to get pulled off YouTube
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.480]   for doing this anyway.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.240]   Effect's probably for what I've done already.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.440]   We're going to get pulled off YouTube.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.760]   Here's Conan O'Brien last week talking about Final Cut Pro 10.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:01.160]   Apple just released a new version of their famous editing software, Final Cut Pro.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.440]   But apparently, it's so different from the last version of Final Cut, video and film editors
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.680]   all over Hollywood are having a very hard time adjusting to it, OK?
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.720]   Well, our editors here at Conan are some of the best in the business.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.800]   They actually like the new software.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.520]   In fact, they prepared this video statement voicing their support.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.960]   Already the audience is Chuckle Pro.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.160]   Hi, I'm Dave Greick, who one of the editors here at Conan.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.960]   We actually really like the new version of Final Cut Pro.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   We use it to edit the video you're watching right now.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.320]   Hey, this is Dan Dohn, and I'm the editor from Colorface
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   for Final Cut X's.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.320]   I have iTunes and I'm the all right inside the Final Cut X.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   That's great.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.680]   Hey, my name is Rob Ash.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.080]   What I really like about the magnetic timeline is it allows me to put everything in the right
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.320]   sequence and to keep everything in sync.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.320]   That course is web-serve.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.120]   It also makes it very easy to animate titles like this.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.320]   He points in a title that doesn't happen until later.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.960]   The X also makes it really easy to match color between two different scenes.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.960]   And there's the titles.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.360]   By the way, I think what's funny about this is--
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.960]   and I presume they did this on purpose-- it's about though-- it's very amateurish in the use
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.600]   of titles and just the editing.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:20.080]   They have a quiet recording sign, which is something an amateur would-intercut in.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.560]   Obviously, they knew this is aimed at amateurs.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.080]   This is eye movie from their point of view.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.400]   Well, not amateurs.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.560]   I think it's just designed not for people for whom video editing is 100% of their day.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.360]   But understand, if you're a video editor, everybody else is an amateur.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.360]   Yeah, of course.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.520]   So they do-- I mean, look at this animated title.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:46.320]   Well, by the way, for some reason, they keep the Final Cut Pro loading thing up there.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.000]   I guess they say it's something about the load time.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.400]   Well, and I think that these editors do use Final Cut very heavily.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   And they--
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   So what do they do, though?
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:58.840]   They're going to keep using Final Cut 7.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.200]   Well, here's what's going to happen.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.840]   This is that a lot of these high-end editors are going to hang on to Final Cut 7.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.600]   They're going to hope that they can keep on adding stations.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.080]   They're not going to buy another new machine unless Apple backs down.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.960]   Then they're also going to be doing research.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.600]   I mean, this is going to be a boom for Abbott and Adobe.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.600]   This is the moment they--
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.080]   What do they use at Dexter?
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.600]   I will have to ask them.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.560]   I don't know what they use here.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.480]   But Robert is watching.
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:25.760]   So maybe Robert will get a message.
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.720]   Pop your head in the door and just shout.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.480]   What do you use to edit Dexter?
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.120]   Robert, if you're watching, you're going down.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   I'm sure he is.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.120]   What else would he be doing?
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.880]   He's a producer.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.440]   But for them, using the EDLs, getting in and out
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.960]   of Pro Tools, getting in and out of all those other pieces.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.240]   I think they use Abbott, by the way.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.760]   Everybody's saying they use Abbott.
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.000]   I wouldn't be surprised if they do.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.240]   Abbott is still-- and Hollywood is still--
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.400]   That's why I used to tech TV.
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.920]   But that was 10 years ago.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.120]   Well, it's still a very--
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.280]   Abbott is still a much bigger truck.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.640]   I mean, to pull stuff.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.760]   As I've worked on projects--
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.760]   we talked about this last week-- that had over 100,000
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.480]   objects in it and Abbott, I would be very reticent
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   to put more than 5,000 or 10,000 objects into Final Cut 7.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.960]   And so I don't think that--
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.120]   I don't think Final Cut was ever that good at managing
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.400]   these heavy workloads.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.600]   I think you could do it because people were committed
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.880]   to doing it.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:20.280]   And it was a lot cheaper.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.400]   And Final Cut had the advantage of being resolution
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:23.920]   agnostic.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.000]   So you could put HD footage in.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.920]   You could put 2K footage in.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.800]   You could put 4K footage in.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   It didn't matter.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.000]   And Abbott was always-- you pay an extra $100,000 to do that.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.320]   4,000 signatures on the petition online that says,
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.840]   Final Cut Pro is not a professional application.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.920]   4,000 signatures.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.440]   4,000 out of 2 million.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.360]   That's about what Daniel Juckett was about, right?
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.520]   He said, this petition requested Final Cut Studio 3
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.960]   as reinstated, supported, and referred to as Apple's
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.280]   professional grade editing application.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.760]   Final Cut Pro is restored in her new name
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.800]   with a functionality and user interface of Final Cut Pro 7.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.320]   Final Cut Pro 10 is to be considered part of the iMovie
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.200]   family or a label for a sumer product,
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.520]   or this one, which I like the best,
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:07.800]   the source code is auctioned or sold to a third party.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.240]   Or else we kill another hostage.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.880]   Which would be a disaster.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.560]   Whoever bought the source code for Final Cut would--
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.320]   Nobody wants it.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.120]   Nobody wants it.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.920]   Not usable.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.960]   Well, the thing is that they--
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.080]   4,000, if that represents one out of 50,
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.080]   you're still talking about less than 10%.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.240]   This is why, by the way, I'm a big open source advocate.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.720]   Had this been an open source project,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.840]   this wouldn't be a problem.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.080]   Right.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.760]   Well, it wouldn't have ever been written in the first place.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.200]   They're never--
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:36.400]   Right.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.800]   There's nothing of this quality, although there are projects
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.520]   going on going projects to create editors.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.400]   Also, no one would have had the power to reinvent it.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.080]   It would just be a forked version
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.760]   where you'd see some lot of clutter
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.520]   from the previous version and a few nice tweaks in which you
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.760]   would now have to decide between four different versions
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.360]   of Final Cut instead of just two.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.120]   Well, here's an opportunity for those 4,000
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.960]   that people sign that petition and everyone else.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.320]   Let's-- if you really want to put a stake in the ground,
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.120]   let's support LightWorks or something like that,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.800]   an open source choice.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   Right.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.760]   True.
[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.640]   Why not?
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:12.960]   The other advantage of open source
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.000]   is that if you have an editing day with a right--
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.560]   if you're a company with the right kind of juice,
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.800]   you can certainly say--
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.080]   next time an editor says it would be really, really cool
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:22.040]   if we could-- if this app did that,
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.160]   you have access to the source code.
[00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.120]   You can just basically make--
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:24.800]   I agree.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.120]   There's a lot of people, Alex, included, who are out there,
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.480]   who could make a great open source program like this.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.920]   Yeah, I mean, they're the point being
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.960]   that when a company owns something outright,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.840]   they have the right to do anything they want with it,
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.000]   whether you agree or not.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.560]   You can sign all the petitions you want.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.560]   And I think when that company has a lot of resources
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.000]   and when there's other companies that have resources,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.800]   the chances of an open source project
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.000]   having the same focus and ability to implement is--
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Absolutely.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.840]   It's not really-- it's a great idea.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:59.200]   Look at Lightworks does advanced multi-cam editing
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.520]   with unlimited sources.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.720]   And I haven't used Lightworks, so I can't comment
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.600]   whether it's a good editor.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.880]   Apparently it was used to edit the King's speech.
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.520]   At least that's what it says here.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.040]   Congratulations to Tariq Anwar.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.600]   Talks about his career, explains why Lightworks
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.880]   is his editing system of choice.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.400]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.960]   Can't be too bad.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.720]   No, I've seen whole documentaries cut on eye movie.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:27.240]   It's not-- anything can be done with any piece of application.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.360]   It's just a matter of how long did it take?
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.200]   Is it scalable?
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.400]   Does it work well?
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.560]   I think when Walter Merch did Cold Mountain with Final Cut,
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.760]   which was really when things turned--
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.920]   that was when Final Cut turned the corner,
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.080]   I think it was definitely not ready for a future film.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:50.880]   I mean, it was mostly broken, and they kind of survived that.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.680]   And so we have no idea.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.480]   I'm definitely open to playing with Lightworks.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.600]   I mean, I know that we're going to be playing with a lot--
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.720]   to do multicam stuff, we're looking at--
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.600]   we're going to be adding training for at least in-house
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:06.400]   right now, Premiere and for Abbott,
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.080]   to make sure that we can handle anything that comes down
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.240]   the pipe.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.960]   So it's not that I'm ardently saying that the only thing
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.520]   that is to use is Final Cut and just move on and everything
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.080]   else, because there's things that the new Final Cut just
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   doesn't do that we need.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:19.920]   And so I think--
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:20.920]   I'm going to move on.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.440]   But does-- because we keep talking about this stupid thing,
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.320]   I don't care anymore.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.440]   I've really lost interest.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.280]   Does it support SANS, the new one?
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.320]   SANS and Partridge?
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.960]   So we're screwed, basically.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.040]   Because everything we do--
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.760]   I mean, I'm recording now to a storage area network hard drive
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.440]   over fiber optic.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.720]   That hard drive then is access buyer editors
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.080]   as soon as we stop recording and can edit it without any moving.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.680]   I'm going to go-- maybe we'll move to Lightworks.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.360]   Why not?
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.680]   I want to support open source.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.640]   We'll try it.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:52.480]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.600]   I'll make Tony use it, because he's
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.680]   the one who doesn't like Final Cut Pro X.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.160]   Right?
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.200]   He hates it, right?
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:57.680]   Good.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:59.600]   Tony, I got a solution for you.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.440]   I know why-- I know why-- I know why Dexter doesn't use
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.920]   Lightworks because they want support.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.640]   And open source support is an issue.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.640]   And I think that, again, the advert tool, especially
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.480]   from a broadcast perspective and a film perspective
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.080]   and the scaleability, the kind of stuff
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.760]   that you're talking about, it's really built for that.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.320]   And I think that that's why a lot of these heavy houses
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.960]   and then premiere has come up really--
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.400]   I'm really excited about experimenting with premiere.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.280]   And so we're going to be doing a lot more--
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.560]   I would love to see open source handle this problem.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.080]   This is a perfect case for open source to say,
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.520]   hey, we could do better.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.440]   And then make a very clear statement
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.720]   that when software is proprietary, when codecs are
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.840]   proprietary, you always are at the mercy of the company
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:46.240]   that makes it period end of statement.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.640]   And this is a perfect example.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.120]   And if you don't like it, this is why
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.480]   you shouldn't go to Avid, you shouldn't go to Premiere,
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.040]   you should go to Lightworks, or something else.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.160]   You should support an open source project
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.240]   so that you don't ever have to do this again.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.040]   Well, we'll add Lightworks to our--
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.080]   we're going to be doing some tests head to heads
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.160]   among all these editors.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:05.320]   And so what we'll do is we'll make sure we add that.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:09.640]   I hope-- it would be a shame if everybody moves to Adobe.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.720]   Because Adobe's no better than Apple in this regard.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.600]   Nobody's better than Apple in this regard.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.040]   They're all the same.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.960]   They have a fiduciary responsibility.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.440]   I love saying fiduciary.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.040]   They have a fiduciary responsibility
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.920]   to their stakeholders to maximize profits.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:26.840]   And if this is seen as maximizing profits,
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.880]   then they're going to do it.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.040]   And it doesn't matter how many petitions you sign.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.440]   I bet Apple doesn't budge a bit on this.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.120]   Well, so Lightworks is not available on the Mac.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.680]   OK, so we'll buy Windows.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.680]   Ah!
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.600]   But I'm saying that's probably--
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.960]   Actually, it probably runs on Linux, right?
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.440]   It's not why it hasn't been-- does it run on Linux?
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.680]   A lot of editors are--
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.360]   I can see the hardware nightmare already.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.280]   Oh, well, we'll see.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.400]   I would love to buy cheaper hardware.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:01.720]   I just love the way you put it saying, well, one of our editors
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.120]   has been complaining about file editing.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.760]   We'll make him use it.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.240]   We'll make him use a stick and an old shoe.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.320]   Now let's see how you--
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   Yeah, I get tonics.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.000]   But it's true.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.200]   I mean, you raised a very interesting point.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.840]   We want to add an edit station.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.280]   We need a fifth edit station.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.040]   And this is why I think that Apple
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.480]   needs to make Final Cut 7 available again.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.520]   I think that's the issue.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.520]   Is that if Apple made that available,
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.240]   and let people continue to buy it at $1,200 or whatever,
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:30.680]   you can just keep on buying it the way you bought it before,
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.800]   I think a lot of people's blood pressure would go down.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.880]   Oh, I think people should turn.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.360]   It's just that they're now caught between a rock and a lamp.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.080]   They don't want to move.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.480]   They don't want to change.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.440]   And it would give them a chance to see what the trajectory is.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.440]   But Apple has-- I just think they have to back down on that.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.880]   But what if they simply said that Final Cut 7 is a dead end product,
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.800]   but we are going to continue to sell and support it
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.240]   for the next 18 months?
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.840]   That's what they do with IMOVHD, right?
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.200]   12 months, 18 months, something like that.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.520]   Why don't you give it away?
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.920]   Otherwise, the best negative example
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.400]   is take a look at anybody who's managing Microsoft Windows
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.880]   networks and ask them how many different editions of Windows
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.320]   do they now have to support?
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.120]   I know people who are supporting all the way back
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.880]   to Windows XP, because if you put the hammer down and say,
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.120]   look, we are not going to support anything older than Windows
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.520]   Vista, you will always have those 10 people who cannot be satisfied
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.400]   unless you get this thing working on Windows XP.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   So at some point, you have to simply say,
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.040]   we have set fire to our ships.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.120]   We are motivating our troops.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.280]   Oh, I think they could sell Final Cut 7 and say,
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.120]   we're not doing any major support for it.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.280]   You can keep them fine if you want.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.920]   I think the best--
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.480]   I've just hit upon the solution, where every month,
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.920]   the price of the old Final Cut goes up by $100.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.720]   I hear from now, if you want a copy,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.160]   they will sell it to you for $1,200, plus whatever the base cost was.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.000]   How much do you really want to continue using the old version?
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.840]   That's the question they're going to have to answer.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.680]   It is interesting.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.960]   The price is relevant, because by making it $300,
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.400]   I think Apple thought, well, this will take some of the sting out of it.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.520]   But what they don't understand is a professional
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.680]   that couldn't care less about the price.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.520]   I think when the price of $2.99, they said, again, Andy and OPPCO,
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.560]   you who are-- you who occasionally have to say,
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.920]   I'd like to do that, but I can't because I can't.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.440]   It's for me.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:22.640]   And by the way, I'm not a professional.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.480]   I'm not even a talented amateur, to be honest.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.360]   I'm just schmuck.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.880]   We're going to take a break and come back with more of Andy and Alex
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.960]   and the new rumor on the iPhone.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.800]   It's a stunner.
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:36.080]   But stay here, because first, I want
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:39.240]   to tell you how to get rid of your old iPhone from Gazelle.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.320]   Don't sell it.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.880]   Gazelle it.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:47.240]   G-A-Z-E-E-double-L-E, like the Aminal, the one that runs across the plains,
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.320]   the veldt.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.440]   Gazelle is a great website for you to know about if you are a gadget here.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.160]   And I think we all are at this point.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.360]   How do you know if you're a gadget here?
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.360]   Well, just look in your drawers, your closet, your garage.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.240]   You got some old gadgets there?
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.560]   Something you might want to get rid of.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.120]   This is it.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.640]   Get cash for those gadgets.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.800]   There's a person in our chat room who shall remain nameless.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.240]   But she sold so many gadgets to Gazelle that she paid her rent.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:16.040]   This is a great service.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:22.040]   And actually, it's good for the environment, too, because Gazelle saves
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.320]   these gadgets from the landfill.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.840]   They recycle them when they can.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.160]   They sell them to others.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.960]   Kindles are nooks and other e-book readers going for about $100.
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:32.880]   You want that new Kindle?
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.400]   You can practically pay for it.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.480]   Or you'll get an iPad.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.560]   iPhones run from $20 to $200.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.960]   Macbook's about $600.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   But check out the rates yourself.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.920]   Let's say you have an iPhone 4.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.240]   What we'll do the process here.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:54.160]   IPOHIPH iPhone 4 16 gigabytes.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.560]   And then they have-- by the way, thousands of items in their database.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.240]   And then you have to say whether it works or not.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.680]   No mines in good shape.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.640]   I'm going to keep it in the case.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.200]   Free water damage, you bet.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.360]   AC adapter.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.240]   Yeah, I'll throw one in those original cables.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:07.920]   Not much to it.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.960]   Everybody has some of those.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.600]   $300.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.400]   Sweet.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.920]   That is-- wow.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:15.840]   They also have this graph.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.440]   It's just fun to do it to see the price go up and down.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.280]   It's going up.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.360]   That's very interesting.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.880]   $300.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.360]   Tell you what.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:24.840]   Tell you what.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.760]   You just take that.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.640]   You add it to the box.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.280]   Any old box.
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.200]   They will give you a mailing library for an answer.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   You don't even pay for this shipping.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.040]   You send it back.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.080]   They remove all your data from it.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:38.960]   If the condition is as you state, they will send you a payment.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.400]   And by the way, you can get a check,
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:44.800]   but you can also get an Amazon card, a PayPal card.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.240]   I think you can get a bonus if you take an Amazon card.
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.800]   20 product categories, 200,000 unique items.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.000]   Don't sell it.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.480]   Gazelle it.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.720]   You are going to find a great resource in your closet.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.040]   Get it out of the closet.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.440]   And onto the streets.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.160]   For a 5% bonus payment after you do all this,
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.480]   when you go to checkout, I want you
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.800]   to enter the bonus code MACBRAKE.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.000]   And you will get another 5%.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.240]   Just right on top of that.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.400]   I'm sorry, Twit.
[00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:14.120]   Did I say MACBRAKE?
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:14.880]   Twit.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.840]   I guess we only have one.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.800]   Sometimes they just do one.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.640]   I'm going to continue here.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.680]   I already have a gazelle.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.320]   Oh, this is so you got an account.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.840]   Well, I won't go through this whole process.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.480]   But you get the idea.
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.040]   Make sure you put Twit in there for an additional 5%.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.360]   Cash, cash, greenbacks, dollars back.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.080]   And you might want to do this because the latest rumor is--
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.280]   and this comes from Deutsche Bank and a Deutsche Bank
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.280]   analyst who is telling his clients,
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.920]   there will be two iPhones this fall.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:52.080]   The iPhone 4S, which will be an inexpensive iPhone.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.320]   And that's probably the one that looks kind of like the Samsung.
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:03.760]   And then another will be the actual iPhone 5.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.760]   Incredible, Andy?
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.600]   It's just a one source of an analyst without a proven--
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.200]   this is an analyst that doesn't have a really
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   proven--
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.200]   It's just a proven record.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.800]   So it's another piece of rumor information
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.600]   that sort of flitters in, gets caught in the storm grain,
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.960]   and then flitters down.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.000]   You know why I buy it?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.040]   Because we've seen kind of the 4S in the wild.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.760]   We've heard this 4S term for a while.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.960]   And yet there's also rumors about a higher end iPhone.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.560]   Yeah, I think it's interesting that there seems to be a lot of people
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.960]   who are talking about two different iPhones,
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.080]   the slight speed bump, and then the actual brand new.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.600]   This is why you're going to be switching from your iPhone 4
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.200]   to this iPhone 5.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.120]   The question being that does that mean
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.760]   that we're going to see the marginal upgrade in the fall
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.120]   and then the iPhone 5 next year,
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.320]   or we're going to be seeing both of them this year
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.560]   or none of them this year.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.560]   So I do like the idea of having to wait until 2012
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.960]   before we see a radical new iPhone.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.640]   You don't want to see it in September?
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.360]   Well, most of it I don't want to see it in September.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.240]   It's just that I believe that--
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:17.160]   I just believe that Apple's going to reserve the number 5
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:21.120]   for something that is as transformative from the predecessor
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.760]   as the iPhone 4 was from the iPhone 3.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.800]   It wasn't-- remember the iPhone 4 wasn't a small upgrade.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.320]   It was the reason why a lot of people who were on the fence
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.440]   moved and the reason why a lot of people bought their way
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.280]   out of their old contracts to get the new one.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.960]   What if it's 4G dual core?
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.320]   So it's an A5 and it's 4G.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.400]   Is that enough?
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.240]   That's maybe a bigger screen.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.960]   Well, 4G is good, a different application of the screen.
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.080]   Remember that if we're going to be doing 4G,
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.800]   Apple's going to pretty much-- Apple is not a company
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.400]   that's going to be happy with the idea of--
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:55.040]   and if you're in the following eight cities,
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.720]   you might even get as many as--
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:00.680]   Well, you know, it's rolling out pretty widespread now.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.600]   Yeah, but remember that they have to serve--
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.320]   but two carriers right now rumored to be a third one.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.520]   AT&T is also picking up T-Mobile.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.000]   So I'm not sure if Apple would be pretty pleased to say
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.840]   that they are not going to be able to sell a single AT&T
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.640]   phone because everybody wants the Verizon one
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.560]   because Verizon has the better 4G network.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.560]   Yeah, that's a piece of magazine just to set in.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.440]   And also remember that there's the component factor
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.760]   where they're not going to be able to sell this phone
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.040]   under contract for $399.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.840]   It still has to be $249 in order to make it a practical concern.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.440]   And it might be a while until they can get new camera
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.400]   components, new screen components, new 4G components
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.000]   to make that happen.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.440]   Here's--
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.880]   So basically, I think that we're going
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.400]   to see a sweet bump this year and iPhone 5 next year.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.640]   Here's Chris Whitmore's logic.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.760]   And I think there is something to say for this.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.680]   He says, with Nokia and RIM struggling, to say the least,
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.680]   the time is right for Apple to aggressively penetrate
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.400]   the mid-range smartphone market.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.840]   And I think he's thinking internationally.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.280]   Remember, he's Deutsche Bank, the German bank.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:09.120]   To dramatically expand its total market and market share,
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:09.840]   that would make sense.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.240]   Wouldn't it make sense to say iPhone 5 for the US, where
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.880]   we know we've got 4G and 42 markets or something
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:21.320]   like that on Verizon, AT&T's, HSPA+ is even wider spread,
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:27.520]   and a less expensive 4S, which is basically the 4
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.160]   kind of remodeled for the international market.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.200]   What about that?
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.360]   I think one of the challenges, though,
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:37.000]   is that when I'm in a lot of these countries,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.640]   one of the challenges is the difference between the $250
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.320]   and the $600, the difference between a BMW and a Mazda
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.160]   is a lot easier.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.480]   It's not what everyone's driving.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.240]   I mean, there's just a lot of people who--
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.480]   if they can afford to go to one, a lot of them
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.120]   can afford to go to the other.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.960]   And so I think that that's the one challenge there.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.280]   I do think that Apple should do something more stand-alone.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.280]   I'm not sure whether they want to make it easier just
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.920]   to use Wi-Fi all the time.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:08.200]   I know a lot of people who are using their iPod touches.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.120]   And that could be refined a bit more
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.200]   to make it a lot easier to use.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.880]   Yeah, I wonder if there's a reason why the iPhone 3GS might
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.840]   be one of the most bulletproof things that's
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.520]   on the Apple store right now.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:28.240]   If they can continue to have the really cool, really sexy,
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.520]   nice super-styled, super powerful phone that
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.480]   costs as much as any other super smartphone,
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.040]   but still have a $99 phone, still have a $49 phone that
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.960]   can run pretty much-- that can support any app that's
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.200]   going to be on the App Store with a few limitations,
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.640]   then they'll really have something there.
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.920]   They don't necessarily need to have the super retina screen.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.720]   They don't necessarily need to have 4G.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.840]   So long as people can say--
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.320]   people have an answer to the question,
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.240]   can I run the application that I really
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.480]   saw that I loved in that commercial
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.560]   or that I loved that my boss had on my cheap little $49 phone?
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:05.800]   I can't--
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.480]   Sorry, I turned off my mic.
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.480]   All right.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.400]   I'm back.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.240]   We shall see.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.760]   I think it's an interesting rumor.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.960]   I'm not going to give it some credence, but we'll see.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   By the way, Leo, I have an update.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.680]   Yes.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.040]   The Dexter set.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.800]   They use Avid here.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.640]   They do use Avid.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.640]   The editors would not switch to Final Cut from Avid,
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.400]   and now they can say I told you something.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.240]   Mm.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.320]   So they were pushed towards it, and they--
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.800]   That's interesting, isn't it?
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.080]   So-- and I think that happened a lot.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.520]   I mean, I think there was just a lot of different shows
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.880]   that made different decisions in those areas where they got--
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.960]   there was obviously a budgetary reason to do it.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.520]   And also, people just look at it as easier.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:45.280]   It's easier to find more editors.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.720]   There's so many more Final Cut editors.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   But anyway, I don't want to sidetrack this any further,
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.080]   but that was to follow up on what we were talking about.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.800]   What if-- just a thought--
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:02.120]   what if the new iPhone were edible?
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.960]   I think an editable one--
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.520]   and there's lots of times when I feel like--
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.080]   I'm a little-- I feel like a snack.
[00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.600]   I think it'd sell well in third world nations.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.120]   I--
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.400]   I often thought that the process would go
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.840]   a lot faster with the curves.
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.680]   Well, there is a little eggplant in there
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:25.720]   that might slow it down.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:28.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:34.120]   He is making a ginormous--
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:37.960]   It's very pretty interfaced.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.000]   Yeah, he should have just used apples.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.000]   What is with the Kiwis and the blueberries?
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.040]   I guess I really shouldn't play a video that is just music.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.440]   We'll have to describe the fact that this gentleman has carved up--
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.400]   it's kind of like fruit ninja.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:58.480]   And he's made a giant iPhone.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.240]   Although if you really--
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.040]   If you really have it in for Apple,
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.280]   if you really want to get Steve Jobs,
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.240]   I've said, bake one out of meat.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:05.760]   Meat?
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.320]   Yes.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.040]   He's a vegan.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.760]   Yes.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.080]   Beef, lamb.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.080]   My question is, did they actually eat this one?
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.600]   I thought the Wi-Fi one was the best.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.840]   That little Wi-Fi with the bananas.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.080]   Just the strangest thing.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:22.600]   It's topfruit.com, by the way.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.440]   We couldn't wait any longer for the iPhone 5,
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.480]   so we made our own Facebook.com/topfruit.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.400]   Do they sell fruit?
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.000]   Is that what they do?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.400]   Are they fruitsters?
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.120]   I don't know, but it was a good viral.
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:32.880]   They got us to play it.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.320]   They got us to play it, even though I had no way.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.320]   I understand that if you put your hand on the bottom corner
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:39.600]   of the table, you lose three bananas off the top of the top
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.240]   left corner.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:44.800]   You're eating it wrong.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:45.880]   I don't know, I just had to play that.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.560]   We're going to take a break.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.240]   Come back with more.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.600]   Andy Inako is here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.800]   What are we going to get to?
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.000]   We've got to get your good friend Roger Ebert on the show
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:54.520]   at some point.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.360]   I'd really like to get Roger on.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.160]   I will pass along.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.000]   Wouldn't it be fun to have him on?
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.400]   It's fun to have Roger Ebert pretty much anywhere.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:03.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:04.320]   Actually, you know what we should do.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.440]   Maybe you could help us get him on triangulation.
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.240]   I need to have a whole hour out of it all to himself,
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.080]   our interview show.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:10.840]   That would be fun.
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.840]   Chris Anderson joins us tomorrow on triangulation.
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.640]   Tom Merritt and I interview interesting big thinkers.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.240]   Chris Anderson, the editor-in-chief of Wired,
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.400]   not Chris Anderson, the guy who does Ted.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.480]   Very confusing.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.640]   I'll tempt him with a Feds.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.120]   You should get both of them.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.640]   You should have a dueling Chris.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.720]   Yeah, Chris Anderson, make Chris Anderson.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.640]   That would be fun.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.960]   It's like crossing the beams.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.720]   This portion of the tech I brought to you by our good people,
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.120]   our good friends.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.920]   We love Gene and Company at Smile Software.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.040]   Smile Software does so many great programs.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.880]   You know I'm a huge text expander fan.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.400]   I won't use a Mac unless it has text expander on it.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.800]   It saves me so much time.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.280]   And this new product from them, PDF Pen?
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.640]   Awesome.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.800]   Now you can get a 30-day trial at Smile Software,
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.280]   which you probably should do because you
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.280]   can buy it on the app store.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.920]   But if you go to smilesoftware.com/macbreak,
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:08.280]   we like that for a couple of reasons.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.160]   One, you could try it free.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.640]   Two, we get credit.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.600]   And we like the credit.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.560]   Although they know that when they sell a lot of--
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.040]   it very quickly went very high on the app store.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.480]   And I think that that's because of all of you,
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.880]   Mac Break Weekly listeners.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.760]   What is-- see?
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.520]   Hello, Mac Break Weekly audience.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.720]   So what does PDF Pen do?
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.320]   It is fantastic.
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.080]   It's the affordable PDF toolkit.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.880]   Don't go out and buy the expensive one from those other guys.
[00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.520]   With PDF Pen, you can easily edit PDFs.
[00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.480]   You can change PDFs without going back
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:41.400]   to the original document.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.320]   You can go paperless.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.000]   They've got OCR, optical character, recognition.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.800]   I have in my library my signature and my family's signatures.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.840]   I can sign documents.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:53.400]   Just bump, paste them on there.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:57.120]   Add text, add images, all with your mouse and keyboard.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.320]   It is so fantastic.
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:44:59.560]   That's PDF Pen.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.520]   And then, of course, PDF Pen Pro lets you create interactive forms.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.400]   A lot of people want to do that.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.560]   They've got a paper form and they want to replace it.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.800]   Well, PDF Pen Pro will let you do that.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.720]   So they're online.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:11.080]   Interactive forms are downloadable.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:12.520]   Interactive forms also.
[00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:15.480]   You can create multi-page PDFs, including hyperlinks,
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.360]   from websites.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:19.400]   PDF Pen and PDF Pen Pro.

[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.240]   You'll see why.

[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:59.880]   And as I said, you can also get it if you go to the App Store.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.480]   But well, I know, maybe you just
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.560]   could buy it site unseen.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:04.920]   You could trust me and buy it.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.960]   That's OK with me.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.200]   They'll notice the sales.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.200]   You don't have to--
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.520]   PDF, P-E-N.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.040]   I do have to admit I am buying almost everything now.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:18.560]   Even stuff I already own.
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.080]   I'm buying on the App Store because it's just easier
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.080]   to have the automatic updates and all that stuff.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:24.920]   I am completely convert myself.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.960]   I knew this would happen.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.280]   I have a free copy of iWork that I've
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.040]   been using for all that sort of stuff.
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:35.640]   But I've repurchased every single copy of that just
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.520]   to make sure that any time I'm in front of a computer that
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:41.120]   does not have a machine in mind that doesn't have iWork on it.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.240]   I don't have to look for anything.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.760]   I don't have to plug anything in.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.200]   Or at least for the rest of my life,
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.520]   until I work 11 or 12 comes out, I will have a certain problem
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.520]   solved.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:51.560]   And you could just--
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.960]   My sketch I bought a long time ago bought it online.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.720]   Again, partly because I want to support the sketch people.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.640]   But also because I don't have the updates.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.280]   Just an hour ago, I have the pick of the week
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.240]   which I bought off the App Store last week.
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.280]   I don't have it on this machine in front of me right now.
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.920]   But that's OK with 10 seconds.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:08.200]   I have it on this machine right now.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:08.600]   Isn't it cool?
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.480]   My pick of the weeks from the App Store, too.
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:12.760]   How depressing is that?
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.720]   Smile software.com/Macbreak.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.560]   Oh, this is an app regarding to genocide.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.360]   That shouldn't be very depressing at all.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.640]   So Sophie's Choice, the interactive game.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:27.600]   Actually, I have to say the App Store is great for games.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.680]   Because I don't know why.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.640]   I guess because of the iPhone and the iPad,
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.400]   I'm in that mindset where I don't mind
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.920]   buying a game like a casual game.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.880]   And so I've bought so many games.
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.760]   I haven't bought a game.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.120]   It's like they brought me back to the gaming scene,
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.160]   just because it was so easy.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.000]   And they have these simple casual games that
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.240]   are fun to play and stuff like that.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:54.240]   Did you see that the iPad accounts for 97% of US tablet traffic?
[00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.560]   Boy, that just tells you something about the Android tablets.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.400]   I mean, big deal.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.200]   You know, there is--
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.240]   I repeat, there is no market for tablets.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.280]   There is only the iPad.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.040]   HP has something interesting coming out.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.600]   Friday.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.360]   Friday, this is going to be good.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.720]   It looks really good.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.960]   But it's going to be a building year for anybody who
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.560]   doesn't have an Apple logo on their tablet.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.760]   Are we going to-- Eileen, are we going to buy a Touch Smart,
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.160]   whatever they call it, the HP Touch Pro tab thing?
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:22.840]   Touchbook.
[00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.000]   Touchbook.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.760]   I want to buy it.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.600]   I just-- again, last night, another good example,
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.680]   my two-year-old daughter picks up the iPad.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:32.320]   She hits the little button, turn it on.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.040]   She goes to the videos.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.040]   And she hits play.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.720]   And she looks at me.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:39.800]   And the thing is, is that she's watching the videos she wants.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.840]   And I'm like, a two-year-old is using--
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.040]   Shady, Tati, please.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.840]   But I just don't think that that would--
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.200]   oh, she-- Jack Jack.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.360]   That's what she likes to watch.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.960]   Anyway, so the--
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:55.400]   but the-- that-- I can't imagine happening on an Android.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.400]   And he-- you forgot to reset the SSH password after you
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.680]   jill up broke the iPad.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.680]   Don't worry, I fixed it.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.280]   SpongeBob, only the O is a zero.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.080]   But I think that's why there's a market for iPads
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.400]   and not a market for Android.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.320]   You know, I mean, right now, I think that they can get there.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.600]   I think that they-- I hope that they do.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.760]   I hope we get more stuff happening there.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.840]   But I actually think that HP has an advantage over--
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.680]   over Android right now.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:28.360]   Because I really do think that Android 3.0, 3.1,
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.680]   is just not the right answer.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.920]   It is definitely-- it's definitely the sort of operating
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.120]   system that was written without a lot of knowledge
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.840]   of the iPad and the iOS to see how well iOS works
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.880]   and why it works so well.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:46.800]   Android really is a desire to create a basic operating
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.760]   system that will be applicable to phones, to tablets,
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.960]   and to notebooks without inherently
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.600]   taking advantage of the event-- of what
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.000]   goes on in all three of them.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.480]   I spent a little bit of time with the HP,
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:59.080]   and it works really, really nicely.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:49:59.880]   I don't-- I don't think it's a--
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.240]   Oh, you played with it.
[00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.200]   I played with it.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.000]   And it is-- and I can at least tell you
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   that it is inherently a touch-based tablet machine.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.840]   It would not work if you tried to operate with a keyboard
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:10.360]   or mouse.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.000]   You might be able to interact with it,
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.120]   but it wants to be touched.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.680]   It wants to be operated with fingertips.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:21.600]   And the fact that they're like Apple controlling everything
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.520]   from end to end.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.520]   They're building the hardware.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.920]   They're building the operating system.
[00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.200]   And they're also going to be-- excuse me.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.000]   They're also going to be making sure
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.600]   that it's adaptable to their desktops,
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:34.080]   where if you buy desktops, you will have some interoperability
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.240]   with your web OS devices.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.280]   That's an interesting thing, too.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:41.160]   Right now, I'm more optimistic that HP will be able to sell
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:45.000]   some tablets in 2010 than anybody making Android tablets will
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.760]   if they keep the Android operating system.
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.920]   If they decide to do something like Amazon's room to do,
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:52.240]   which is to say, we'll hide the Android as best we can
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.440]   and we'll build our own tablet with our own Amazon operating--
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.960]   Amazon user interface, then that has a chance.
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:00.840]   But I don't really have any optimism for Android as a tablet.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:06.040]   I guess there's no reason to think that everything
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:09.160]   that Web OS does couldn't be done with Android, right?
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:13.200]   Well, right now, the way that--
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.320]   I just love Web OS.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.400]   It's so elegant.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:15.880]   Exactly.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.760]   I mean, you really have a hard time understanding
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.160]   how switching apps with a mouse pointer or with a keyboard
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:28.280]   would be better or easier than the way it is on Web OS right now.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:31.040]   You can use asking where it just excelled from day one.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:31.560]   Right.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.080]   And the way that it aggregates information,
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.640]   the way that it tries to collate everything
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.320]   that you're doing into one experience, that's also very--
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.080]   That's Windows Phone 7, by the way.
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:40.280]   That's straight out Windows.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.200]   That's Windows Phone 7.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.360]   Unfortunately, Windows has decided
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.120]   that Windows is going to be their next tablet,
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:48.280]   as opposed to Windows Phone 7.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.280]   They're taking some--
[00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.640]   Well, they might be in the middle because you saw Windows 8.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.200]   It looks like they're going to--
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.600]   It's the weirdest thing.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.680]   Google has some of the best--
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.360]   the best collection of talent, the best collection
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.000]   of insight sometimes.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.760]   And sometimes they come up with some really slick ideas
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.840]   on how to enhance their products.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.400]   So they're not a bunch of dummies.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.520]   It's just that fundamentally, they're making bad decisions.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.360]   I think that Windows--
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:16.200]   It's like when I said, when I wrote about the couple of keynotes
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.160]   came in Microsoft and Google at the same time,
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:23.760]   when my message to Google is that when Microsoft is kicking
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:27.160]   your butt in tablet design, anything user interface design,
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:30.280]   it's time to take a step back and take a long look.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:33.720]   Their Chromebook, their Chrome OS operating system,
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.040]   is just-- it's essentially they're now
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.800]   selling a beta of a concept that they really haven't deployed
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.560]   yet and probably won't be ready to go until 2012, 2013.
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.720]   Right now, it makes no sense for anybody
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:48.360]   to spend $500 on a Chromebook when they can buy
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:52.160]   a very, very good name brand, Windows 7 notebook,
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:55.280]   install the Chrome browser, and have so many other advantages.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.000]   I mean, it's just--
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.240]   I've never understood the Chrome.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.320]   The only--
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.520]   There's two reasons why you might.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.520]   The $20 a month for students, including internet access,
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.680]   limited.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.480]   And security.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.760]   That's-- if you don't want to have
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.320]   to maintain 100 notebooks that you're
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.960]   disturbing to people, it kind of makes--
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.720]   it certainly makes sense, although you're
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.680]   going to have more time finding a staff talent
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.320]   to help you maintain Windows 7 than you
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.600]   will finding them to keep our Chromebooks running, which
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:22.800]   will still have to need some people to keep them running.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:24.160]   I just-- it's just-- there was--
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:27.080]   I had a moment a few weeks ago when I realized that sometimes
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.040]   you just sit back with your brandy and your cigar
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:30.920]   and your auto harp or whatever.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.280]   And you think about it, and you just sort of get into,
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.280]   like, you know, let's think about the big picture stuff here.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.400]   And I was shocked to realize that I'm real--
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:42.280]   Apple seems unstoppable right now.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.360]   There's certainly a way they can screw things up.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.720]   But right now, they seem unstoppable.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.880]   Everything they're doing for the next--
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.280]   plan for the next couple of years looks rock solid.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.080]   HP with WebOS, that looks really, really great.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.640]   Again, it's going to be a building year this year.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.720]   But in 2012, and they get a lot more elements in place,
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:57.680]   it looks really good.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:59.680]   I am actively excited about the stuff
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.000]   that Microsoft is doing with phones.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.480]   I could see a time when I could be--
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.080]   if someone asked me what phone I should get,
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.600]   the answer will not be, well, you almost certainly
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.160]   want an iPhone.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.800]   It will be, what do you want to do with it?
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.160]   And then the right question might certainly
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.520]   be Windows Phone 7.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.080]   Of all the big players in this industry,
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:19.200]   Google is the one where I'm wondering, my god, five years
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.680]   from now, are they going to have retracted into--
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.760]   we have a really good search engine tool.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.880]   We have some really good online tools.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.840]   We are out of the mobile business entirely.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.280]   Or else we're going to be like the OAM that
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:34.080]   will sell you the blank operating system that then you then
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.320]   spend a year developing into the operating system that you
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.160]   want for your own device.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:40.200]   It's the one company, a big company
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.040]   that I'm not sure if they're going to still
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.760]   be doing the stuff they're doing right now
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.840]   three or five years from now.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.120]   I'll tell you who's getting iPads.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:56.200]   The Singapore Army recruits to the Singapore Army
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:59.880]   are getting as standard issue an iPad 2.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.280]   They're going to buy about 8,000 of them.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:07.000]   And they're even encouraging them to take pictures and video
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.600]   with the built-in camera to upload it
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:15.440]   to the Singaporean Army's online platform, LearnNet.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.720]   And they can-- and evidently, they
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:21.280]   can edit them from the front lines wherever the front lines are.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.000]   I think there are no front lines in Singapore.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.200]   It's an island.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.120]   The soldiers can send questions to their commanders
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.640]   through a live messaging system and group chat discussions.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.160]   That's what you want your army to be doing,
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.560]   is having group chat discussions.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.360]   A lot of Twittering.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.520]   And you're seeing turn around bursts today.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.600]   Also because it's preloaded with an e-book version of the Bible
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:42.400]   so that you can have that extra armored--
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:43.680]   But will it stop a bullet?
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.360]   Oh, if it's the Bible.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.880]   Military training is required in Singapore.
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:52.080]   So you're required to get an iPad, I guess, which is a good deal.
[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:53.400]   Now, in a related story, North Korea
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.120]   is going to give a piece of cardboard with iPad icons painted
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.400]   on it to all of their conscripts.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.880]   Which they will then attempt to eat,
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.880]   because apparently there's no food.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.160]   Maybe they could use that edible iPhone.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:15.560]   Let's see if there's any other mobile me to iCloud transition
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:18.240]   details now, kind of starting to come out.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:21.920]   For those of you wondering what's going to happen to your mobile me,
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:26.240]   Apple has posted a frequently asked questions page.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:30.360]   apple.com/mobileme/transition.html.
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:31.880]   I doubt you're supposed to enter that URL,
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:35.760]   but there it is for you, if you want.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.280]   Apple says web email, calendaring, contact management,
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.480]   and find my iPhone will be available from the browser,
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.960]   as they are now.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.600]   That's good news.
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:50.200]   Through applesme.com URL-- actually, I'm sorry,
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.240]   through iCloud.com.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.480]   So they are going to start using iCloud.com.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:00.880]   June 30, 2012, as we know, if you have a website on mobile me,
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:09.800]   if you've been using iWeb, iDisk, Apple Gallery,
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.320]   they do provide instructions for moving iWeb sites
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.920]   to another provider, as well as how
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:18.840]   to download photos and files from the gallery and iDisk.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:21.880]   I'm kind of wondering now if Apple hasn't shown us
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:26.320]   another component of iCloud, because they still haven't--
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.480]   I think that every time that I've--
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:31.280]   the past few years that I've visited someone's site,
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.400]   especially if it's a business site,
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.920]   I realize that, oh, they're using iWeb.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.520]   This is a .NET website.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:41.880]   You think that, OK, clip on bowtie, but still, it's the easiest
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.040]   way to publish and share photos and videos when you're--
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:45.600]   I agree.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:48.200]   And I feel bad for people who fell for that, because--
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.080]   Well, that makes me think that they're
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.800]   ready to say that iWeb and your mobile gallery
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.200]   are not going to work anymore.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.160]   I'm wondering if sometime before they roll out iCloud
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.400]   to the general public, they're going to say, oh, and by the way,
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.480]   here's something that we're giving you.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:04.480]   That's even better for sharing photos and videos
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.480]   for the general public.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.040]   I would think so.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.280]   Yeah, I would think so.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.000]   You see the dashes next to iWeb, publishing gallery,
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:11.760]   and iDisk.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.400]   I would think that they'd be providing something.
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.160]   If not, a company like Squarespace
[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:20.320]   would be very wise to write a iWeb import tool, or WordPress,
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.080]   or somebody, because that's a real opportunity.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.400]   But again, not to beat a dead horse,
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.120]   but-- and I think I said this from day one with iWeb--
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:29.720]   as pretty as it is, you really--
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:31.560]   we learned the lesson from Microsoft's front page.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:35.160]   You don't want to use a proprietary tool to create websites,
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:36.720]   because you're stuck.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:39.480]   Some people have really pushed iWeb
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.680]   as way beyond what it was designed for.
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.000]   I think those are people that are going to really
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   have a hard time making that transition.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.360]   At least they have a year to figure it out,
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.600]   but it's not going to be pretty.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.880]   Anything else?
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:58.400]   Oh, Andy wrote a nice piece on Theology of iCloud.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:58:59.760]   You had talked about that on the last show.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.600]   I was reading that, and when you got to the bottom,
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.360]   I was like, man, Andy just said this.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:06.840]   They totally lifted this from Andy.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.480]   I went to the top.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.280]   I was like, who is this son of a--
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.000]   And I was like--
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:10.400]   Stole Andy's--
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.840]   Oh, Andy did.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.200]   Yes.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.800]   I think it's just that sometimes I try not to say the same things
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.440]   over and over again, or at least not if I'm aware of it.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.360]   But then there's sometimes--
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.800]   It's such a good idea you had to.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.920]   Well, I just think that this is now
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:28.960]   what informs my own understanding of all these cloud services.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.000]   And I was also informing my concept of why Google is now
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:33.760]   in big trouble.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.640]   I do think--
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.680]   You say Google is an old testament.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.600]   You said this last week.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:40.360]   Fiest style cloud.
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:43.640]   Yeah, it's the difference between theism and daeism,
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.480]   where theist gods are the ones who--
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.760]   big magical guy in the sky with the right world.
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.680]   You pray to him for to save your crops.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:53.080]   He saves your crops, or he smites you if you do something wrong.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:56.040]   The daeist style god is the one where you don't know
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:56.800]   if he exists.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.760]   And he takes an indirect role in your life,
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.760]   or he did set things in motion a long, long time ago,
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.280]   and has had very much a hands-off sort of god.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:10.200]   I lifted the line from Futurama without attribution,
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:14.440]   which is probably the best description of the daeist theology,
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.800]   which is that from God's perspective,
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.880]   if he does his job right, then you will never
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.600]   have any clue as to whether or not he exists or not.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   And that explains a lot, I got to say.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.000]   That's what iCloud is really about.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.200]   Yeah, it just--
[01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.480]   With Google, you have to--
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.040]   It just works.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:32.320]   It will let you sync and stream your music.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:35.600]   But first, you have to upload all 5,000, 10,000 of your songs
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.120]   to Google's server.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.240]   You can do Google Docs, but all your docs
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.200]   will live on Google's server.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.720]   Google is the server through whom all blessings and punishments
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.360]   come.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.880]   Whereas iCloud is, oh, I don't remember
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.640]   having copied this file that I added this morning on my iPad.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:50.320]   Well, but there it is.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.920]   I must have copied it somehow.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.800]   And that's how these things work.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:54.400]   I was also--
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.040]   It gives new meaning to the doxology.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.920]   It's the Google doxology.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.080]   Crazed goog from who all documents flow.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:06.240]   I'm saying services while I'm away.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.960]   That is a joke that a small percentage of our audience
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.680]   will get.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:13.120]   Give me my tea, one wide bandwidth.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.080]   Give me my Wi-Fi on lock, friend.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.640]   Actually, everybody in the studio is nodding.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.320]   I think we have a bunch of deists in here.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.440]   In that IP.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.640]   In bandwidth coming.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.480]   Sorry.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.880]   Hey, speaking of God, Thunderbolt accessories are here.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.400]   [GRUNTS]
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.480]   Yes.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.280]   When I got that news this morning,
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.400]   the first thing I did was call my local Apple store
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.120]   to see if they had them, because it
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.280]   would have pleased me greatly to hold this up
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.440]   and make that my--
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440]   You should have, yeah.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:44.680]   The $50 Thunderbolt cable.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:46.960]   Thanks to Max Run who tweeted this information.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.920]   But to be honest, I was kind of surprised.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.880]   You mean there wasn't a Thunderbolt cable until now?
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.800]   No.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:56.120]   Over the past three months, I have been trying and trying
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.360]   and trying in any ways.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.600]   There's the front channel.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.000]   There's the back channel.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.480]   And then there's the--
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:05.240]   I know a guy who fabs parts.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.360]   He might have a small supply of these connectors
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:10.600]   if you're willing to try to wire it up yourself.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.840]   And I was getting absolutely nowhere.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.360]   They look a lot like Firewire 800.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.720]   But actually, it's the--
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.160]   you've seen it before, because if you have a display--
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:21.120]   mini-display port is the same connector.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.600]   But this could be used for target disk mode, which is great.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.840]   Huge for anything.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:31.200]   Tark disk code, target disk mode, video, regular master stage.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.880]   That will sell a lot of MacBook ears,
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:34.400]   because when I bought the new Air,
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.320]   I had to use ethernet to import the old Mac thing.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.200]   And it took like all day.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.240]   I just went away.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.400]   But if you do it on a Thunderbolt,
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.480]   it might take a few seconds.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.640]   I don't know how long it will be.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.400]   It's a really big deal.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.560]   And I think it also indicates that Apple knows
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:49.000]   that there are going to be a lot more Thunderbolt devices
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.440]   coming out available sometime in the next month.
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:53.760]   And I think that's why they're finally getting them
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.720]   ready for the retail channel.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.320]   They've got the cable and they're selling the promise
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.440]   for terabyte Pegasus raid.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.160]   And I'm thinking there'll be other things
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.680]   with an Apple logo on it with--
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.840]   That's actually $1,000 for four single terabyte drives.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.680]   And then enclosure--
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:13.280]   Can I come with the drives?
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.960]   I think so.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:18.120]   Oh, maybe it's not-- yeah, features four terabytes,
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.480]   7200 RPM drives.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:20.760]   I guess they're cheap now.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.760]   One terabyte, 7200--
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.760]   --is like $50.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.400]   So that's two or 300 bucks worth of drive.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.040]   So that's about right.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.720]   They also have an 8-terabyte version.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.920]   Two Thunderbolt ports.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.400]   I think that some manufacturers have
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.280]   been looking at doing one.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.600]   And that's going to be a real problem,
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   because that means it has to be at the end of a chain.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.400]   Two is important.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.560]   So it's got-- does the two mean past three?
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.800]   And remember that most of a lot of people
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.400]   are going to want that--
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.400]   not going to want the last item on their chain
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.160]   to be hard driving.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.760]   They're going to want it to be a monitor, which almost
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.600]   certainly is not going to have a past three.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:51.120]   Oh, good point.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.120]   Good point.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.440]   So this is pretty sweet.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:54.680]   I would buy this.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:56.320]   I've had a lot of money.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.400]   There's going to be a lot of options here soon.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.880]   I mean, LaSee is working on their little big drive
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.440]   or whatever.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.600]   And Sonnet's working on raids.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.400]   And there's just going to be so many SSD solutions connected
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:08.800]   with this.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.520]   I think we could replace our SAN with this.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.480]   No.
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.280]   I mean, you probably could.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.440]   I mean, now that if you moved to Final Cut,
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.560]   the new Final Cut, you have to figure out
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.760]   how you want to handle that.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.720]   But screwed.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.240]   I never even really thought about this.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.200]   But now-- but we can't move to the new Final Cut.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.800]   You just have to do it differently.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.120]   We're going to do some R&D around that.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.520]   Well, I mean, we can mount the drive,
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:32.880]   but that doesn't give you the--
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.560]   that's a gigabit instead of the full fiber speed.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.600]   Yeah, I mean, I think there's just some figuring out there.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.840]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.440]   No, that was me.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.840]   I was just going, everybody, everybody, everybody.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:45.200]   But it's very exciting.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:48.080]   And the professional Thunderbolt accessories
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.320]   that are right around the corner,
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.960]   I think are going to really make a lot of our jobs easier.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.280]   Is 50 bucks too much to pay for a Thunderbolt cable?
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.560]   For the people who are buying the first round of these,
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.800]   I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.000]   I'm sure it's a matter of time before a Monop price
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.400]   has the $4 version.
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.640]   But I think the people who are--
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.160]   Apple is really--
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.560]   Apple is not proprietary because anybody
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.160]   could make it a cable.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:16.120]   But it's more than just copper wires in the housing, though.
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:20.680]   I think that there are some proprietary pieces of that.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.960]   I believe that there's some royalties that have to go
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.840]   bounce around to use it.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.000]   So I don't think it'll be as cheap as some of the other stuff.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.160]   But I think that this has really aimed at professionals,
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.880]   at least in the short term.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.600]   Well, I think that everybody's going to want
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:39.240]   to have one of these cables in the drawer anyway,
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.520]   because it's going to be their default video cable.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:44.200]   For the monitor, they're going to be buying next to your--
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.520]   So you could use it that way as well.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.880]   You could use it as a monitor cable.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.880]   You could use it as data.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.680]   Well, it's going to be a confusing situation,
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.560]   because if you don't have--
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.480]   most people are going to be--
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.600]   I think most people immediately are
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:58.720]   going to be using a dongle to convert their thunderbolt port
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.920]   into a useful VGA or HDMI port.
[01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.680]   But in the future, they're going to be able--
[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:06.080]   they're going to bump their heads
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:08.200]   into a couple of different situations in which they wish
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.960]   they had the right cable, among them
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.640]   being that I would love to be able to use my iMac
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:15.880]   as an external screen for my MacBook.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.320]   Or I would love to be able to back up my desktop
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.920]   and stuff like that.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.320]   $49 is not out of line.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.800]   If you expect people to buy one of them,
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.280]   if you expect them to buy two of them,
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.720]   there's going to have to be a third party that's
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.880]   going to have to come up with a $20 solution.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.040]   We're going to take a break.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.120]   Come back with your picks of the week,
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:35.720]   and I just noticed Andy, you put your pick in, and it's mine.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.240]   But that's OK.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.280]   I'll find another one.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:37.960]   It's a great pick.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.000]   I totally agree with you.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.360]   I've been installing it on all my systems.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.480]   Double heart love.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:45.840]   Double heart love.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.000]   Although I found a bug, so we'll talk about that.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.480]   But first, let me talk about hover.com.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:54.000]   If you go to Macbreak.hover.com, you're
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.480]   going to check out what is absolutely the simplest, cleanest,
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.560]   best domain name registrar out there.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.320]   You may know-- you know, remember two cows?
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:03.400]   This is run by two cows.
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.720]   DomainsDirect was the old name.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.960]   Now they call it hover.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.200]   H-O-V-E-R. So go to Macbreak.hover.com.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:13.080]   Right now, if you go to Macbreak.hover.com
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.760]   and use the offer code Macbreak, get
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.960]   a new dot com domain.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.960]   I just registered.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.000]   Maybe I better not say it.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.680]   I'll save it because I don't want to--
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:25.520]   I do own it, but I just registered a new one.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.640]   $15 and domain privacy, who is privacy,
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.720]   is built in its automatic.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:31.760]   So that's a great deal.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.960]   If you move your domains over to hover.com,
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.560]   they'll charge you $10 for a full new year.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.880]   And with their domain concierge transfer service,
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:44.920]   they'll do it all for you.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:49.480]   All you have to do is call their number 866-731-6556.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.240]   Said, Leo said me.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.800]   Leo said, I could get you do this for me.
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:55.560]   And they'll be glad to do it.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:57.360]   Transfer your domain to hover.com.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.200]   We did.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:07:59.960]   I wish actually I'd use the concierge service.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.760]   I thought I'll do it myself and save money.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.400]   I'm a moron.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:04.160]   Now it's free.
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.600]   So anyway, hover.com-- just go to Macbreak.hover.com
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:09.640]   and take a look.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.920]   See how clean and simple this is?
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.560]   You couldn't make it simpler.
[01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.200]   All right.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.880]   I'll tell you the name of the site I registered.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.280]   tunictime.com.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.360]   I'm pretty darn excited about the new tunic business
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:23.440]   my wife is starting.
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.520]   If you need a tunic, tunictime.com.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.560]   Are you going to do a tunic show?
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.200]   I'm going to do this week in tunics.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.840]   This week in Cowells is already taken.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.480]   So this week in tunics, although we could offer a Cowell
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.480]   option.
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.680]   Well, it's better than this week in Unix.
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:44.800]   tunics, Unix, it's all the same.
[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.640]   You can add mailboxes to the--
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.240]   I like that.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.200]   In fact, one of the great reasons to use hover
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.080]   is to create a domain, a vanity domain for your email
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.560]   so that you never again have to change email addresses.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.600]   I want you to check it out.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.720]   Hover.com.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.960]   Go to Macbreak.hover.com for that special deal
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.560]   and use the Macbreak as the offer code when you check out.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.720]   $15 for brand new.com domain name with domain privacy
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:11.320]   included and no upsell, no extra clicks.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.720]   Somebody said, no dead elephants.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.560]   Macbreak.hover.com.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.320]   And now it's time, my friends, for our picks of the week.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.000]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.200]   Go ahead.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.000]   You get it.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.880]   I'm going to let you do it.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.040]   It's a great pick.
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.560]   Oh, all right.
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:31.520]   This is-- if you use Google Reader in a really significant
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:36.600]   and religious way, you're going to want a brand new version,
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.680]   Mac version of a popular iPad Google Reader app.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.880]   It's called Reader, R-E-E-D-E-R.
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.360]   You can find it at readerapp.com.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.080]   And I love it because it's such a gloriously
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.120]   Mac OS-oriented feed reader.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.480]   If-- the reason why I've been sticking with the web-based
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.240]   reader for so many years is because I haven't found any
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.360]   desktop reader for the Mac or the PC that really did anything
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.200]   to expand upon it.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.960]   You have scrolling list of subscriptions
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.080]   and then a pane that has the article that you're actually
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.000]   clicking on.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.040]   OK, why should I give you $20 for this when
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.840]   I can just actually just type a URL?
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.440]   And this is-- I don't-- unfortunately, this is--
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.600]   this screen is hooked up to my iPad.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.760]   I'll show you the desktop because I've
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.520]   got it installed here.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.920]   It's just fantastic.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.960]   It's very fluid.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.600]   There's really great animation.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:28.200]   It's really easy to fly through the stuff that you want to read.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.760]   It basically moves you from left to right through.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.240]   Your master list of subscriptions,
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.320]   you tap on one blog that you're looking at.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.560]   It'll give you a list and summaries of every single article
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.060]   there.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:39.920]   You tap on one of those.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:42.600]   And then suddenly you're looking at the close up view.
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.360]   And it's easy with arrow keys.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:47.320]   Just simply float from left to right and drill G down,
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.320]   then drill back up again, step by step.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.320]   What I really like-- and come back to me for a sec.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:54.240]   Someone said the sub-subscribe can show it to you.
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:10:56.560]   What I really like about it is that, for instance, right now,
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.880]   you saw there are some sites that are nice enough--
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.640]   I think you can see most of what I'm talking about here.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.600]   There are some sites that are nice enough
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.040]   to put the entire article.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.720]   I love it.
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.720]   Please do that.
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:07.320]   Exactly.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.000]   Inside the feed.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.840]   So in order to read it with this app, no problem.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.680]   Obviously, it'll give you all that content.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.440]   It'll format it.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.760]   It'll reformat it as nicely as it can.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.840]   There are so many, though, that-- for instance,
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.320]   here's the E online site that will only take you to a summary.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.520]   And with most readers, including Google Reader,
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.120]   your next step is to click on that link
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:28.600]   to open up a brand new web page in order to get it.
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.640]   What Reader will do is it will simply open up--
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.200]   you click on the link, and it will actually
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.760]   open up the actual web page in a new pane.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.000]   So once again, you're still using--
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.680]   you still use the R key to drill down, down, down, down, down,
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.560]   then back up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.880]   So you never have to leave the app in order to read
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:47.000]   all the articles that you've subscribed to.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.640]   And what I've noticed about it is--
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.680]   I just got it last week, and I've never left it since.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:56.240]   Part of the reason why is that it makes my entire browser
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:59.880]   so much more stable, because I've basically contained
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.400]   the majority of my reading inside this one app.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.800]   Instead of opening up--
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.720]   one of the problems is that I'll click these links
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.840]   to in Google Reader, the web interface,
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.320]   to open up this new page that has E Online, that
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.200]   has this article that it has New York Times.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.720]   Unfortunately, each one of these windows
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:18.800]   will have like three different flash ads in it.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.240]   And because I really--
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.800]   I'm sort of focused on getting through this list of blogs
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.480]   I want to read.
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:27.000]   I forget to conscientiously close all these windows.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.920]   So I went up with 30 windows with 800 different flash
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.680]   things in it.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.600]   And before I know it, Torp and molasses
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.080]   instead of functional computer, now that I'm reading it all
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.360]   in Reader, I now have only a couple dozen open browser
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.600]   windows on Instafar at any one given time.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.760]   And I've really cut down on my flash overhead.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.520]   So it's just 10 bucks, one of the best 10 bucks I've ever spent.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.880]   It was one of those cases of I did not even bother
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.000]   trying to scam a free copy.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.320]   I will be writing about this in my favorite Windows news
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:57.760]   reader.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:00.280]   But I knew that I'm going to continue
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.800]   to be using this like day after I've finished writing this
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.240]   review, I really have a moral imperative
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.600]   to give the sky 10 bucks.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.560]   Well, like you, I found it from the iPad app.
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.640]   And so let me show you though, a couple of things.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.760]   Oddly enough, I wasn't as big a fan of the iPad version.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.960]   I think the front page is just stupid.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.840]   But as soon as you remove the front page of that app
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.440]   and do it as a Mac OS app, I think it's really, really great.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:22.880]   I agree.
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:24.080]   You can customize up here.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.800]   I've got the icons for the things I do, for instance,
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:27.320]   to tweet it.
[01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:32.080]   And I've also applied Control T. We'll start a tweet
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.680]   automatically, things like that.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:34.840]   That makes it very interesting.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:38.040]   It integrates with Instapaper, Pinboard.
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.880]   And you mentioned, this always bugged me about Hacker News,
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.520]   for instance, you just get the headline.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.200]   But they have a readability built in.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:46.680]   So you don't even have to go to the website.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:50.960]   You can do the readability version of it, which is really clean.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:53.720]   And look, I'm getting the full article.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:58.720]   That by itself is huge from my point of view.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.880]   I mean, this is-- and you can do it.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.880]   You never have to take your hands off the keyboard if you want.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.520]   You could just go zips, zips, zips, zips, zips.
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:07.400]   And so this has actually become my primary means now,
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.480]   gathering news for all of our shows.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:12.160]   It makes it just so easy.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.680]   And I can't wait to see the align edition of it.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.400]   This is an app that was designed--
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.080]   I really think it was designed for full screen view
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.080]   and multi-touch.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.680]   It doesn't have a full screen mode, as far as I can tell.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.320]   But it does support multi-touch gestures.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.480]   You do have to enable them.
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.560]   But I can just so totally see on an MacBook or MacBook Air,
[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.600]   just super, zoop, zoop, zoop, zoop.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:33.280]   Another done mark.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.280]   That's interesting.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.440]   How you turn your face elements.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.720]   Great app.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.760]   That's very interesting.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.240]   I was wondering why the gestures were there.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.280]   That explains it.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:47.320]   R-E-E-D-E-R, $10 from the App Store.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.400]   And like you and Eb just put it on every computer I have.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.000]   It's just really fantastic.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.120]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:58.320]   So when I came down here, when I was wanting about,
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.800]   Robert Lewis has this case that I just have to show you.
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.840]   So Joby.
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.520]   Joby makes--
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.640]   Oh, like Joby.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:07.840]   So they make these great tripods that we use.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.000]   The little ones that you're mirroring.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:09.760]   The Gorilla pod.
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.280]   Yep.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:10.880]   Really good.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.720]   And they've kind of done that for an iPad case.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.080]   I know that sounds a little odd.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.440]   But they have this thing that's called the Ori for origami.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:21.720]   Now this is a metal case, very protective here.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.800]   And it's really cool.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:24.280]   Watch this.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.520]   OK, so I'm going to try to frame this.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:31.040]   So you have this case, and you can open it up like this.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:33.120]   And there's your iPad.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.520]   Now, there's a whole bunch of different ways
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:41.480]   to actually pull it up so you can tilt it this way.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.120]   And there's a little attachment there.
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:47.720]   So now you have a nice hard way to put it down.
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:51.680]   You also can pull it up this way.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:56.000]   And you can pull this up and actually set it in here like this.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.800]   And so now you have kind of that look.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:03.360]   And you can turn it like this on its base.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.000]   And then if you really want to get crazy
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.400]   and you really want something higher,
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.360]   you turn it around and it actually will go--
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.200]   it really should make sound effects.
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.240]   Oh, that's really neat.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:12.840]   It's stand up.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:13.720]   I mean, it is--
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.720]   Let me see if I can--
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.560]   I like it yet.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:19.080]   It is really cool, $80.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.960]   And there's just so many different configurations.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:24.920]   I mean, I definitely, on a set, I could definitely--
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.040]   How heavy is it?
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:26.480]   Is it way--
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:27.280]   It's really light.
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:27.920]   It's aluminum.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.000]   It's super light.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.520]   It barely adds anything to the weight of the iPad.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:36.320]   So it's a very light case.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.680]   It is--
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.760]   and it's quite a--
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.400]   it just does so many different positions
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.520]   that you're always trying to figure out
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.920]   where to prop your--
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:43.720]   how to prop it up.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:46.040]   It looks like an iMac that somebody in the chat--
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:46.640]   It was funny.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.160]   It was funny.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:47.640]   It was like--
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:48.140]   It was like--
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:50.240]   For some reason, it looked to me like one of those old--
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.120]   because it had this little circular area in the back,
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.560]   this is what you twist on, it kind of
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.200]   looks like one of those old DVD players.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.040]   And so I was like, wow, why is he carrying a game player
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:16:59.440]   around?
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.400]   You know, I was like, that's kind of weird.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.160]   And then when you open it up, I was like, oh, look,
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:04.920]   check this out.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.160]   And so it's got a nice--
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:07.520]   by the way, I'm curious to worry about metal.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.280]   It's got this really nice covering
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.040]   that'll go onto the actual glass of your iPad.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.440]   And then when you turn it over and set it down,
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:17.160]   it grips whatever it's on.
[01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:20.360]   So it's just-- it really feels like they've just kind of
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:22.200]   thought of everything.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.160]   So again, it's Jobe, it's Ori.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.720]   O-R-I. And it's about $80.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.600]   All right.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.200]   Very cool.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.760]   Just saw this in my reader.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:36.280]   I don't have a pick because it was going to be reader.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.040]   I knew Andy Hertzfeld was working at Google.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:42.680]   What the original Mac team member Andy Hertzfeld, who did a lot
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.400]   of the kind of ROM code, didn't he?
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.160]   He did all the ROM code, I think, or much of it.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.960]   Apparently, I didn't know this, but he's
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.640]   working on the new Google+, which
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:57.920]   is a social project that just rolled out today.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.680]   He and Bradley Horowitz.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.040]   Bradley gave me at Google Bootcamp a little plus one.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:06.040]   I didn't know that he was-- it was actually for this,
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.640]   the new Google+, in fact, Google's did a bunch of stuff.
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:09.960]   We'll talk about it tomorrow.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:13.440]   We're going to, I think, make a product announcement
[01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.120]   with Google tomorrow.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:18.720]   But this is the new Google+, that--
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:21.560]   this is, I guess, their social network.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.160]   And you know what?
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:26.640]   Andy Hertzfeld, not an Aco Andy Hertzfeld, still has his--
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.560]   I'm going to sign up for this--
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.200]   has his chops for UI because it looks great.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.120]   He was with Danger, wasn't he?
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.800]   He was one of the Danger guys.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:37.640]   Anyway, I'm signing up right now.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.400]   Andy and Aco is at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.480]   And of course, his website is the Celestial Waste of Band
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:47.720]   with www.cwob.com.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:49.240]   Check him out there.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:55.840]   And he is a maven, a maven, a connector, and a mench.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.920]   Leo, I toast you and I honor you on this your special day.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:02.560]   Whatever.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.400]   Whatever.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.360]   Coming to us from the lab at Dexter,
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.560]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, he's at the Pixel Core,
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.840]   Pixelcore.com for that Guild of Multimedia artist,
[01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:14.800]   Pixelcore.tv for their podcasts.
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.640]   And you're going to be doing another special.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.240]   We're doing them every Thursday until it drives us crazy.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:23.520]   But so 6 o'clock this Thursday, we're
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.640]   going to do this week in photography live.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.640]   We've got Fredrik Johnson, Derek Story.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.520]   And so we're going to be talking about photography.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.920]   I'm coming by.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.280]   You should definitely come by.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.320]   And all the guys from Twit, of course, are invited.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:40.120]   And if people want to keep up with what we're going to be posting
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:44.360]   and what we're doing live, make sure to follow Pixelcore on Twitter
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.440]   or follow me in Alex Lindsey.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.640]   If you want the more serious version follow Pixelcore,
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.880]   if you want the silly version, call them in.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.720]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.200]   I've been playing with this Google+,
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:55.760]   I think Andy was kind of critical of working at Google.
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:58.240]   He said they stifled him, I hate it.
[01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.040]   This is kind of interesting.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:00.560]   This is--
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.680]   So Colleen put post that earlier.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:03.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.520]   Well, it's got the Google Maps interface.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:08.400]   I can zoom in and I can move around.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.000]   It says that they're going to use this to connect much of the Google
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   stuff together.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:23.240]   Circles is, I guess, their kind of social thing that, in some ways,
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.080]   I think, is groups plus.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.400]   They've got Hangouts, which is--
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.200]   maybe that's groups.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:35.880]   They've got-- this is very interesting-- photos.
[01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.480]   Google has made a big step here.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:41.280]   I believe-- I'm not sure, but we were told that somebody from Google
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:43.960]   wanted to come on this week in Google tomorrow for a major announcement.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.960]   I suspect this is what they're talking about.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:51.320]   So something big just came out of Google.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:55.840]   And you could find out more about it by google.com/plus.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.680]   The sign, not the spelling.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:20:59.720]   This is really interesting.
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:01.920]   You can zoom in.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:05.200]   I don't know if there's anything in here hidden.
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.480]   And I found out because I ran the scroll wheel.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:07.920]   And look at that.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.320]   It just kind of does that.
[01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:09.880]   Thank you, Andy.
[01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:11.360]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.600]   This weekend photography is coming up Thursday.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:18.920]   Twip from the new studio, but from your section of the new studio,
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:20.480]   not our section.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:22.160]   You won't see all the cool stuff yet.
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.840]   That's just July 24.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:28.080]   Our own photo show, Twit Photo, with Katherine Hall coming up right after this.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.080]   Thank you for being here.
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:34.120]   And don't forget we do this show 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern at live.twit.tv.
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.920]   That's 1800 UTC every single Tuesday.
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:39.960]   If you miss the show, you can get a copy of it all to yourself.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:40.720]   I think you should anyway.
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.160]   Audio, video.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.920]   Just keep it for down the road you might want it.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.960]   Paste it into the collectible album.
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.320]   Exactly.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.560]   On holidays, bring it out.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.680]   Show it to the grandchildren.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.280]   Twit.tv/mbw.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:54.560]   That's where you'll find it.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.160]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.600]   Now you get back to work, cause.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:01.600]   That's a great time.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:08.480]   Oh, never stop.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:12.640]   I'll climb this thinking ladder till I might get to the top.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.840]   The blushing biology looks divine.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.760]   A bright groom he is doing fine.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.240]   I'd rather have his job than mine.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:21.840]   Well, I'm cleaning winfills.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.040]   That was a lovely music haul song.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:31.920]   Also, it got a band from the BBC in like 1934.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:34.520]   Because of the blushing ride line.
[01:22:34.520 --> 01:22:36.600]   I'd rather have his job than mine.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.200]   There's also the live words.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.520]   Funny the things that go inside when I'm cleaning windows.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:43.240]   Oh, I didn't hear that part.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.640]   It's a later.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.080]   There was a hot, hot, hot talking movie queen.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:48.920]   She looks more surfing.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:51.320]   That's a band this scene she looks wants.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:55.320]   Not like 60, then 16, but I'm cleaning winfills.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:05.520]   You see what good things we put your money to when you buy a Twitbrick?
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:10.920]   Yes, Twitbricks make it possible for Andy and not go to play the ukulele.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:16.440]   Twitbricks bring us things like Andy's hat.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:19.920]   Twitbricks make all good things possible.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:24.920]   So please, give generously to Twitbrickdom.
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:25.920]   Thank you.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:35.920]   And now Andy and I go...
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:41.720]   We'll play a song for us all.
[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:43.920]   I'm coming to try.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:47.320]   I can't walk out.
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:52.920]   Because I love it too much, baby.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:24:01.920]   Why can't you see what you do into me?
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:07.920]   When you don't believe in what I say.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:12.920]   We can't go on.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:16.320]   We can't go on together.
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.320]   Zach, I can't do the chords on the single at the same time.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.320]   I know it's hard.
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.320]   Together with the special spine.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.320]   I'm scoozing Andy however.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:39.320]   Actually, I think I only know the first couple things at lyrics.
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.320]   That was just fine.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320]   Just wonderful.
