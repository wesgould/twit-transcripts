[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.100]   Renee Richie is here briefly.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.540]   He's going to give us a quick review of the new iMacs and then head off for meetings.
[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.620]   Hello Renee, YouTube.com/Rene.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.620]   Hello Leo.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.780]   I'm coming to you lossless, but because it's over the internet you're only getting a lossy
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.780]   signal anyway.
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.780]   I'm losing it.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.620]   And what is that behind you over your left shoulder there?
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.900]   That looks right shoulder.
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.580]   That looks, no, you're left shoulder.
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.580]   Your left shoulder.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.580]   One of my shoulders.
[00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.580]   One of my shoulders.
[00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.980]   Army left right shoulder.
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.980]   It's a purple, a Joker Hulk pen.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.980]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.980]   Okay.
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.020]   Go fetch it because Doc Rock's going to want to see it all.
[00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.020]   Doc Rock is also with us.
[00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.120]   He's looking on it.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.820]   He says he's coming over to get it all the way from Hawaii to Montreal.
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.620]   Doc Rock, YouTube.com/DocRock, filling in this week for Alex Lindsay.
[00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.620]   Hello Doc.
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.620]   How you doing?
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.060]   I would do my best to be Alex and pick something really expensive.
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.060]   Good.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.060]   Good.
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.460]   He's the, he's the, I didn't realize you were so purple, but then as I think about it, everything
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.980]   about you is purple.
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.980]   Yes.
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.980]   Purple is my thing.
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.060]   I just actually, I got into the purple thing, Leo, because I strongly support the Alzheimer's
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.060]   organization.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.060]   Oh, I have.
[00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.880]   I have parents that are in that position.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.720]   Oh, I switched from my standard color to purple like two years ago.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.120]   It's the tradition, the traditional color of the Alzheimer's Foundation.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.000]   We've participated in the Walk of Fun for several years, and we always have that purple,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.600]   a purple flower on our porch.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.640]   So now, and it's Macbrakes color.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.040]   So we're all purple here.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.400]   Also with us, Mr. Andy, and I co from WGBH Boston and points.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.400]   Hello.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   East.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.340]   You always got it.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.280]   You always know the difference between a reviewer who got a loaner and reviewer who like just
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.160]   just bought it with their own money for whatever reason because he's got that right on the corner
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.720]   of that armoire.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.160]   But that just like, if that, if that base had feet, it'd be like three toes on top of the
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.200]   desk, two of them off there.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.960]   That's, that's, that's, I mean, I, that's the sort of stuff I would do.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.040]   Do a drop test as soon as you're done with all the real tests need to do the day before
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.960]   you got to send it back to see what a good run test.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.840]   If I just let it fall.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Actually, I think I just deemed topped all the reviewers.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.600]   Somehow she got Apple to give her all seven colors of the new iMac 24 and made a video
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.300]   unboxing.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.000]   Look at those colors now.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.120]   See now, when you're, now when you're looking at it, which color now the, what's funny is
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.280]   the backs are more saturated than the fronts.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   So no, no, that's, that's really good by design.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.560]   That's because you don't want to have like your face filled with like this red shockingly
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   red screen.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.760]   Or having that stuff reflecting off your glasses.
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   We know that's a good point.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   Really cool.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   So you want it more subtle in the front.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   It's fun in the back.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   It's a party in the back and business.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.760]   That's the mullet Mac.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yes, she had a set them up red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.560]   So you just did take that opportunity to roigy bivot and then throw the silver one in
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.560]   the corner.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.880]   You wanted her to do it by hue not luminance.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.560]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.920]   Looks like she's instead done it from light to dark.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.080]   Like she's the joy goddess of text.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080]   She gets to do what she wants.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.080]   It's pretty story.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.880]   She's done it by wavelength.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   Says John.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.520]   Yeah, jock wants it by wavelength.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.520]   Right.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.400]   You biv is wavelength and she's six thousand angstroms right dead center.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   Right in the middle.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.680]   Yeah, it's kind of your high your middle sea of colors.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.400]   That's the four 40 Hertz.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.560]   Pretty pretty impressive.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.760]   I like maybe that's maybe that's just how fast they are.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.240]   We're seeing the Doppler ship of like these things doing their benchmarks.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   It's all the same.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.960]   I'm at it's just traveling really fast.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.760]   Run Barry run.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.240]   So I think because Renee's going to have to run we should get right to your.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.880]   Yes, you need to do yes.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.880]   Yes.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.400]   What do you think?
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.680]   I guess the first question is is it so this is the low and I Mac in fact we're going to
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.640]   talk later about rumors that there is another I Mac more powerful coming.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.760]   But how low and could it be with an M1 in it?
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   Does it feel pretty snappy?
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.680]   Yeah, so I mean the M1 is so interesting to me because I'm used to Apple.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.440]   Apple did this whole civil silicon architecture thing.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.760]   They didn't want to become their own silicon vendor with like every single device as a
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.840]   separate customer because that would lose every advantage of making their own silicon.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.160]   So they created this scalable architecture and now they have the M1 in the iPad pro going
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.600]   all the way up to the to the I Mac and it performs the same in all of them.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.920]   But they use it for different things like they were very savvy in figuring out that efficiency
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:15.480]   leads to performance.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.480]   So they can use M1 to have world class performance but huge battery life in the MacBook Air or
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.200]   the iPad and they can use M1 to let them whittle down the chassis on an I Mac to almost nothing
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   and give you like a modern version of that translucent I Mac take not because the plastic
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.080]   is see through but because the thing is almost two dimensional.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.320]   So it's it's and it doesn't miss a step like it is every bit as powerful as any of the
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.320]   other M1 Macs.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.760]   It's just it's a really interesting really smart product decision I think.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.840]   Yeah, everybody focuses as we just did on the color.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.720]   The design you know is a refresh design but it is kind of feels like as thin as it is
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.840]   it's like a giant iPad on a stand.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.600]   But the MacBook Air of I Mac for the first time is a small screen.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.880]   It's bigger than the 21 inch but it is not as big as as a full size I Mac or I Mac Pro.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.520]   And I think the rumor is that the next one's next pro I Macs will be even larger like 32
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   inches.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.880]   Does the screen feel constrained to you 24 is not bad.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.560]   No, it's and because it's so thin like the interesting thing about this is that you can
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.520]   fit it into almost any nook and any cranny and because it's not a giant silver bubble
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.920]   butted backed wedge it's not as obtrusive as the old I Mac.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.120]   I put my 27 inch side by side with it and it just it kind of melts away in an interesting
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.760]   way and I heard a bunch of other people talking about them like yeah my family would never
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.800]   let me put an old I Mac there but they have no problem with an orange one or a green one
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   right in the kitchen.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.640]   Yeah, it's all psychological but it holds together really well.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.960]   So is that a market guys I mean the market of the people who want a computer but don't
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.160]   want anybody to know they have a computer I guess it is the computer.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.360]   I want people to know I have a computer.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   Yeah, me too.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.800]   But you know what and to Renee's point like for instance like in our house when you first
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.720]   walk in we do have a little like nook that we cut into the wall purposely to be like
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.720]   the communication stand right.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.440]   That's where you get the mail grab your phone off the charges if you're do not disturb her.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.920]   I tend to have my phone next to me.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.200]   Pull up the watch off the charger everything is in this one little place.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.200]   It's the perfect place to put a smaller I Mac doesn't have to be super powerful is close
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.640]   enough to the kitchen I could put up a recipe or something real quick but it's a good nice
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:35.160]   little place to have a small hub and I know a lot of people have similar condenses and
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.000]   things like that or a community computer say someone comes over.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.800]   I can't for work reasons I can't let them use my laptop but so I might need to use a
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.800]   computer.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.800]   Now I'm not suggesting you go out all ballerific and go buy a really high-end one but it's
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.320]   a good thing for a lower computer.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.840]   So I think the fact that it has a little bit of that beauty utility to it as well let's
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.240]   it lend in for a good design as a home computer.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.760]   That's really interesting that so now you're saying it's good for a second computer or
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.320]   a third or fourth.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.200]   Absolutely it's the extra computer the one that you use for you know just checking things
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   in the kitchen.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.400]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.520]   Remember that old school device sorry sorry Andy.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.920]   Remember that old school device I forgot what it was it was made by 3M it was white it was
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.520]   super kind of ugly at the time but it was the for Aubrey.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   That's what the Aubrey was.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.160]   The Aubrey was a kitchen computer they even built it in their way.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.440]   Yes, yes it didn't fly but nowadays we're getting to the point where something like
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.400]   this could happen so yes.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.000]   Andy what did you want to say?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.160]   All I was going to say is that it's interesting that Apple is even continuing the iMac line
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:45.320]   because all in ones like on the PC side of life they aren't really a big factor.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:52.560]   I think Apple themselves have said that iMacs are not the general people who walk into
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:57.000]   an Apple store to buy a Mac don't come in intending to buy an iMac they're for special
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.520]   users and special situations as opposed to like a Mac mini or a MacBook that are more
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.320]   general purpose computers for people.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.480]   Again this is what this is the sort of things that people are coming in to buy for someone
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.800]   who wants an all-in-one they have to have a reason for doing it and one of them would
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:16.360]   be I have a household I'm not going to buy my kids each of them a thousand dollar laptop
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.800]   or twelve hundred dollar laptop I'm going to buy one nice all-in-one that doesn't take
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.360]   up the entire living room doesn't take the entire kitchen or whatever and that's going
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.840]   to be the family computer where we have basically all of our accounts on.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.600]   So it's an interesting thing whereas the iMac used to be the Mac just like the original
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:39.800]   Mac Plus Mac 128 Mac 512 Mac SE was here is the box that you have that here is the box
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:45.280]   that you come in to buy the iMac that you come in to buy as a Mac this is now the it's
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:50.120]   nice it's the utility out fielder gets the job done fills out the roster but is certainly
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.000]   not the sort of stuff that's going to get most of the press at the end of the day.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.600]   It has a MagSafe connector on the back which I thought was interesting how does that work
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.520]   is it fall out easily Renee or is it pretty secure?
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.040]   No, no not all it fits in really really well it's got like a you know see if I can hold
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.800]   it I was quite too far away but it's got sort of a ring on the outside and then a little
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.880]   nothing in the middle and the whole thing goes in and sticks in magnetically.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   Is it snapping?
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.720]   It's got a nice satisfying snap.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.160]   Yeah, well a magnetic sort of a fuck you know like we're all addicted to the AirPods case
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.200]   you know it's mapping it over my clothes it's like fuck, fuck, fuck it's really 1550.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.320]   It's trying to save my name with a list.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:38.120]   Fuck rock, fuck rock.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.400]   Did you get that MagSafe adapter?
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.720]   Yeah and you can plug it in and I'm guessing because the on package thunderbolt ports are
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:54.400]   being taken up that it's using USB and I'm kind of like I'm a USB ports on the power adapter
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.160]   because why not it's off your desk you're already plugging it up.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.680]   Let me plug that printer.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.680]   Yes absolutely.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:04.680]   I love that idea of inside the brick.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.680]   Inside the brick.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.680]   I like it.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.680]   Go ahead and go get it.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.480]   Come on Renee we want to see it.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.480]   Go bring it to me.
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.480]   Do we know we got it?
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.640]   Yeah he's going to run and get it.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.720]   Now we can talk about how jealous we are and how much we hate him that he got a privately
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   side Mac.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   Oh look at the front.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.160]   Oh Doc Rock is it beautiful do you love it?
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160]   I'm in love.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:29.840]   Now of course some the only complaint I've heard about this at all is the white bezels
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.840]   and you can see them there.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.420]   I know I think you're right Doc Rock.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.640]   This is not the computer you put at your workstation for editing photos.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:40.920]   This is this is more really a family computer kind of thing right.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.480]   So the white bezels wouldn't be.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.360]   Yeah see you know the sad part about M1 I shouldn't say the sad part but the part about
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.040]   M1 that's going to be impressive people is it is so powerful that you are going to want
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.160]   to do those things but when they put it out there they weren't thinking hey we want to
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:01.000]   put out this workstation that comes in a fruit loop colors right it was intended to be a
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.400]   fun you know Apple I love to have fun and excitement and things into the product that's
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:12.040]   part of their character identity and as Renee said they have been recently following this
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.320]   design language that is very on point like they are very very specific with their design
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   language.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.520]   So I think my like for me personally it's a dope computer and although you can edit your
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.640]   photos and things on it because people are going to be coming from a hiring iPhone,
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:34.080]   hiring iPads and that I'm not going to replace my studio computer with it but it is a fantastic
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.200]   get some work done when I'm at the house you know let my niece use it when she comes over
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.720]   don't have to worry about her harming anything you know so yeah.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:48.960]   I don't know if this is related to pandemic or if it's you know design goes through cycles
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.920]   and Apple clearly color is in Google today at its Google I/O and now it's their new design
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:00.720]   language for Android 12 material you and it's all about color customizable colors picking
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:01.720]   up the color of your wallpaper.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.040]   Can I tell you why I hate this though?
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.040]   Why?
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:06.200]   Why?
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.200]   Why?
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:12.480]   So I like it in general and I like the white bezel I thought I would hate them because
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:16.320]   I'm all in on the black bezels but in a room like when you put it in a house they fade
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.440]   away like most people have lighter colored walls or colors in black it just sticks out
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.440]   so much against this.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.840]   Only Alex Lizzy has 30% gray walls.
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   Translucible.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.560]   Yeah yeah yeah yeah so that makes a lot of sense.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.840]   Did it feel stable is the stand very stable.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.440]   And people got mock ups?
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:36.960]   Yeah no it's totally stable but I mean like on the subject of the nostalgia marketing
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.560]   like to me I always think of The Watchmen not the movie but the original comic book where
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:45.600]   Adrian White was having like this futuristic millennium marketing and then the minute the
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.160]   doomsday clock started counting down he switched to nostalgia and explained that whatever
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.440]   people are stressed or anxious whenever they're worried about the future you remind them of
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.640]   their past because that's comforting and warm and nurturing to them.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.600]   It gives them those feelings of better days and better times but it's in the past it becomes
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.120]   hard to move forward.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.640]   So like I really want to push back against like nostalgia marketing because I think that's
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.600]   really cynical and hope that they're to that like a next step forward.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.400]   Reintegrate the good things about them but don't try to make us feel like don't pander
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.000]   to our anxiety because hopeful for the future again.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.360]   Yeah I also note related or not that Apple is confirming that they are discontinuing the
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.360]   space gray magic keyboards track pads and mice the keyboards that came with the space
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.680]   gray iMac Pro I'm going to keep mine there.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.480]   You're going to be collecting some.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.120]   Color is in this year.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:37.120]   It's back.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.920]   I mean it's totally sick like I mean it happens in fashion every decade or so.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.520]   It's more human like colors are like colors.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.600]   Sometimes we want to be more sedate and then sometimes not I guess.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.120]   You know the brave segment.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.120]   Go ahead.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   Sorry.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.120]   And the another having fun today dancing.
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:00.800]   I was going to say the brave segment of this is when the when we had it back in the
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.640]   past one of the things that was always weird was you go into the stockroom at that time
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:10.360]   I was at Comp USA and there'd be all of one particular color left or all of another particular
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   color left.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.800]   This is sold out.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.840]   But I think now like the planning of you know making sure you have the right amount
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:23.040]   of colors in the right space is very hard to do so I wonder like what type of thought
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.480]   they put into like we know for a fact red blue automatically gone.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   No matter what.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.920]   I'm just wondering how you manage that that part to me is brave very brave right now for
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.360]   something this price.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.280]   Famously it's a thing Steve Jobs did when he came back to Apple as he cut the skews because
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.440]   he can't you can't do that many different.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.880]   But he introduced the colors like he gave us that's true of the bond that I'm Max and
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.600]   the my books and then he canceled all of it and gave us a decade of the blast at aluminum.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.720]   I really honestly think it's it you have to keep your you know ear to the rail on on
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.240]   fashion and it changes.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:08.040]   I've been watching Netflix has a great series with you and McGregor on Halston the designer
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.840]   who brought color to women's fashions in the seventies and it's it's very much that same
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.320]   thing it's like oh it's been you know black and white Chanel suits and all of a sudden
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:21.680]   there's color and there's form and this is what happens in design and it's it's all
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.760]   cyclical the at the Google I owe the designer.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.960]   The Google I owe designer came on.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.560]   What was his Matthias came on to talk about it.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.560]   Matthias to our day.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.560]   Matthias to our day.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.880]   He's the guy who does material design and he's doing the new material you and let me see
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.240]   if I can find his quote.
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:48.840]   Emotion is essential and beauty is everything and that's how he announced the new color
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.920]   palettes for the material design.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.600]   So I ever love him from WebOS he can do no wrong in my eyes because he made WebOS.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.720]   He's a good designer and he comes on he wears floral print shirts and stuff he's famous
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.720]   for that.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.160]   So good I'm glad color is back anything else to say before we let you go about the new
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.760]   IMac any other thoughts.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.920]   The camera is actually good.
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.920]   I mean it.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.920]   Oh my God.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.640]   He has 120 P is in potato cameras on the Mac books for a while.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.080]   The 1080p cameras on the IMac were good but they had the T2 image signal processor which
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.440]   is an A10 repurposed A10 chip and this is basically the A14 the M1 is analogous to the
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.560]   A14 in terms of silicon IP.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.200]   So it's got the same every single processor as an iPhone and like if you had a YouTube
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.320]   drama or like T channel or like a reaction shell you could totally film it with this
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.680]   camera and these microphones.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   Wow.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.400]   And the speakers are ridiculous like I know there was a whole bunch of kavitching I'm
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.760]   sure you guys are talking about it later there was a whole bunch of kavitching about
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.280]   Apple not putting lossless audio into a lot of their Bluetooth devices but they spent
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.000]   so much of the last three years.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   D.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.960]   This is a couple of audio building it into the spatial audio thing.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.160]   They're doing it from everything now and like they've got speakers and they're like
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   this I'm active have no right to sound anywhere nearly as good as they do because this thing
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:10.520]   is like a stretched out I don't know it's like a griddle or something it is so thin
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:18.840]   and it's got the same sort of the force canceling technology that the MacBook Pro has so it's
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.440]   got really good base without it shaking your table the whole thing is really well done.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:28.760]   So you're making me want one even though I know I should buy one who should not buy
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.120]   this besides me.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:36.080]   If you want to be able to throw something in your bag you're going to want an item or
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.360]   a MacBook you know it's just like if you need your computer.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.520]   Clearly you don't throw an iMac in your bag.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.520]   Yeah but yeah.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:46.720]   Well I mean Mark has take sistle I'm not going to be judgy about it.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.920]   If you want to take it to the coffee shop as the ultimate after lockdown flex like you
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.360]   can it's 10 pounds but for just moving around your house it's fine but I think it's really
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:20:01.040]   or for people who really want to do like workstation level work there's going to be an M series
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:07.720]   iMac Pro you know within the next year that will give you way more cores and way more
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.400]   ports and just way more of everything things that are really appealing to pro users but
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   I think if you're looking for a computer for your home it's really hard to get good displays
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.400]   these days.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.120]   People discount the value of a good display and Apple has one of the best display teams
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.480]   in the world like it's hard to get a display this good that costs as much as the iMac and
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.120]   you get a free Mac thrown in with this right so if that appeals to you and you want to
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.640]   be able to put it anywhere in your house and have it like look like a piece of decor and
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.600]   not a piece of technology like you want it for the kids you want it just as like a home
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:42.120]   computer you want it in your spa and like front of house at a gym places like that places
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:46.400]   that I think want to have a real humanistic feel and a really big high quality display
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.840]   I think that's the sweet spot for this.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.400]   Price as configured that particular one you have.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:04.200]   This is the six I believe it's 69 is the gigabyte one tera is not to say that again you're
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.600]   breaking up say the whole thing again because you broke up.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.120]   Sorry it's two tera bite sorry it's one tera bite 16 gigabytes there's not a lot of options
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.760]   anymore with the M series processors you don't get to configure like the number of cores or
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.640]   frequencies right two ports in the back right thunderbolt ports to thunderbolt plus two
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:30.360]   USB three okay so I'll look the same so they have a little thunderbolt icon on it so you
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.480]   can tell the difference it's really it's tempting and and and what did you say the price was
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:41.040]   for that model do you know I believe this one is 1699 okay so it's not I mean nothing
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:47.120]   Apple does is cheap it's it's still expensive in that you know compared to other people's
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:53.640]   computers they started 1299 but as configured that's about 1699 that's still tempting you
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:59.800]   know if you needed one for the you know where you put this on the phone desk yes nobody
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:05.240]   is a phone desk anymore but if you had a phone desk that's where you would put this
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.960]   so that's what I made by my communications stand yeah yeah yeah my communications stand
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.560]   is a fall back to the old phone desk because I grew up with that and I liked having it you
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:19.120]   know we all dropped our keys there we just we came home that's where you checked for mail
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.200]   if you had any packages underneath in Hawaii everyone takes the shoes off and so ours has
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.840]   the place to put your shoes in like you don't wear shoes in the house here because of red
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.680]   dirt clay your house would be atrocious so you just yeah it's like the perfect spot for
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:38.200]   that so yeah so people still do we just don't have a phone line right it's funny because
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.240]   people know what I say when you say the phone desk even though nobody has them anymore grandma
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.320]   had a phone desk Renee we're gonna let you go I know you have another meeting to get to
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.920]   arms whip so glad we can get you on though with your review of one last thing Leo yes
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:57.440]   yeah the other thing I thought was really clever is the touch ID implementation oh I
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.960]   forgot to secure block yeah they have a secure block it's not even a like they started with
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:08.040]   a system and package with the T1 they went to a T2 chip which was essentially the A10 now
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.480]   they have the M1 so they don't need anything the secure element is built in to the iMac
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.080]   still but you need something to securely authenticate on the keyboard because you don't want to
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:22.160]   just ship on authenticate so they have a secure block in the keyboard that does the authentication
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.880]   for you and then beams the the secure token to the Mac and I think it's just a really clever
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:34.080]   combination of technologies good good yeah it sounds like I had to say it you know I was
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.880]   kind of poo pooing it is oh it's too low and I you know but this sounds like actually exactly
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:44.720]   where the iMac should be if you want a pro device I bought the iMac Pro it was very very
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:50.880]   expensive and honestly if you want a pro device you probably want a Mac mini high-end
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:56.080]   or a Mac Pro high-end not an iMac you want something to give you more monitors more capability
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.040]   and a certainly larger monitor so this is this is the home computer as as it should be and if
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.080]   there is a market for home computers this is the perfect one for it and it's a consumer friendly
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.480]   version against not just a smaller version of the same old iMac it feels like the iPhone
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:16.400]   10 R11 12 the iPad Air like the more consumer version of the product specifically designed
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.360]   for consumers not just pared down for consumers and I love that yeah Renee I'm so glad we could
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:28.480]   get you on and get your review I wish I could get a purple one that was beautiful it's really really
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.440]   all beautiful it's so hard to decide they really are they really are thank you Renee
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:41.040]   we're gonna let Aloha we're gonna let Renee go Doc Rock and Andy Inako don't you go anywhere we've
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.320]   got lots more to talk about as Mac break weekly continues just a little bit but our first all a
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.920]   little break so we can reset our monitors and that kind of thing our show today brought to you by
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:25:00.240]   Udacity Udacity was started by a Googler named Sebastian Thrun about 10 years ago
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:08.640]   I was I know I joined in 2012 and what what Sebastian realized is that big companies like Google and
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:16.960]   Microsoft and Apple are looking for engineering skills that just don't exist in the regular world
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.840]   that that people who are even though they're getting computer science degrees and you know going to
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:26.400]   technical schools they're not getting the skills that these big companies really need and expect
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:32.000]   he founded Udacity so that people didn't have to go to an expensive school they could actually
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.160]   do this stuff online get the skills they need and get the jobs they really want in fact didn't take
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:43.760]   very long before Google paired up with the audacity to create the nano degree program now there are
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:50.960]   big companies like Microsoft Google IBM Amazon all with nano degree programs the world's fastest
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:56.720]   most efficient way to master the skills these big companies are looking for Udacity offers a unique
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:01.760]   part-time online education program designed to bridge that gap between the things you learned in
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:09.440]   school and your career goals and and you can put in as little as five to ten hours a week for only
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:15.280]   about three months and learn a suite of employable skills that will get you a job the job you want
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   in-demand skills that are really needed in today's tough job market here's how it works once you

[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.240]   second the courses of course are online you can view them anytime in the day or night after work
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:38.000]   whenever whatever is convenient for you but i like it because Udacity doesn't stop with the videos
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.680]   you also do projects and that hands-on stuff is i think really important you're not doing it alone

[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:56.000]   field you also get human help personalized code reviews they even have a fantastic mentoring
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.280]   system so you can get mentorship 24/7 so you're never just i don't know how to do this you really
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.600]   you're going to learn how to do it you're going to get the information you need and then you're
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.400]   going to get the help you need to complete this series of projects and once you've done that you

[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.960]   slot we've taken the rene richie monitor and thrown it away it's just the three of us
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   now well we'll we'll forgive them of course we'll forgive them for getting
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.000]   pre-release hardware until tomorrow when i'm sure that as ipad uh bipad pro review
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.680]   video will drop uh yeah they all it all came out at the same time right uh so yeah you can go to
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:02.240]   the stores i think friday and get all this stuff i i ordered the ipad pro i should check or can you
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.040]   well that's part of the problem in fact we're seeing uh reports now from digit times in the
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.400]   supply chain that these mini led screens that they're putting in the ipad pro are very hard to
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:17.360]   make we knew this that the yields are bad yeah and they may not show up on new amax like macbook
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:23.920]   pros until next year i don't think they ever were proposed for the desktops but for the laptops
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.840]   that's that's kind of a disappointment so i hope you got in on the uh ipad pro you ordered one right
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.360]   anti yeah and matter of fact that was one of the reasons why i decided to order one really because
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   i had a feeling that between one thing or another if i if i didn't like it i'd always take it back
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.680]   within two weeks and if i liked it i'm if i and i didn't get it this part of the very very first
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.000]   ten minutes of orders i might have to wait for months i ordered it i think the july i think
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.240]   is a ship date now yeah for most people yeah for most people i got up five a.m pacific time to order
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:59.440]   you got to get up at eight a.m i'm jealous but i got up at five a.m ordered it and but i ordered the
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.640]   top of the line like the everything right maxed out and i'm still processing it says arrives june
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:10.800]   second through june ninth so you're with me yeah some people i know are getting it now we've
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:16.720]   already seen the first people who ordered get their uh there was a review uh on reddit that
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.520]   got republished most of the apple blocks so what was so messed up about that night lee
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.800]   is i'm like okay i got i got to get it right it was like two a.m right yeah i got to get up at two a.m
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.280]   so remember the sat there luck remember it okay this show is really good but remember it's
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:38.560]   when i woke up i was like holy crap so i was running around the house trying to find something to order
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:44.800]   with i finally ordered it with my phone and it was like oh you can get this in july and i was like
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:50.720]   so what i did was i did what you did i said let me max it out because then it should be okay
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.960]   so maxing it out nobody's gonna do that yeah i ended up the same date as you yeah and but i
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   heard through the grapevine so you might want to show up to your store early because if you were
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:10.000]   intending to get a one or two terabyte you know just with wifi it might be in the store okay well
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.680]   i'm sure that they got some in this they got some in the stores anyway so yeah if you do want to show
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:19.440]   up on friday that's probably your best choice chance of getting one before july yeah and as always
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:25.920]   even when even when supplies are really really constrained apple has some in the warehouse they
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.600]   know that they're going to make sure that there's no store that never has them
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:34.000]   week after week after week and it just pays if you really really want one to just keep calling
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.080]   around or just keep making a habit of dropping in and ask hey do you have you have them in stock
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:43.200]   that's how i got my first air pods when they were like out of stock everywhere just by every
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.800]   time i was passing by an apple store just said hey you got any air pods oh yeah we got one this morning
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:51.840]   great yeah here's a here's an incredibly silly amount of money so it's probably is it foolish
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.920]   you think to pre-order as as doc rock and i did it should i just at least for me and i think for
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:03.280]   you too doc rock we're reviewing them and so we kind of we want them as we're we don't in the
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.400]   position of i just dean and mark has brownly and rene richy they ain't gonna send us one we got
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.840]   a we got to spend our hard-earned money for them uh and so that means we got to get them as quickly
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:19.200]   as we possibly can correct and so that's why i went ahead and ordered it knowing that i will
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:26.720]   probably be at the mall on friday and like any way starting to match the beard yeah walking around
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:34.160]   with my velcro you know if you show these shoes if you show them where do i get velcro
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:39.520]   diabetes shoes that sound good you know the the old balance instead of new balances the old
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:45.440]   do you have one of those walkers with four feet on it the little kid i'm gonna put tennis balls
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:52.720]   everything because this is gonna be a lot of standing up bro they uh so but you couldn't show them your
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:57.760]   order on your iphone and say see i ordered this was you give it to me now can you do that oh because
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.960]   without no what i'll do is i i purposely need to have enough space on the apple card is i go ahead
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.960]   and walk in and buy one and then cancel the other you can't yeah there's plenty of time to cancel it
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.520]   i'm just looking at mine and yeah you know how it has that little bar that moves from preparing to
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.640]   shipping and all that my little bar is like well we got your order
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:24.800]   yeah let me my order to processing processing it's been processing for a long time so far not
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:30.640]   preparing to ship not ship not delivered none of that yeah now i got i even got the uh the cellular
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:36.960]   which is probably nuts but i just thought well let's just i have to test it all right yeah well i
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:43.760]   got sailors so now you can get it faster well i went i went through the same thing because the
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:48.320]   the store had a little bit of a meltdown like for the first five or ten minutes where i would
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.000]   keep i would put things in the basket and that's a great check out to oh well there's nothing in your
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.480]   basket well i thought i just did okay fine i'll put there it is put it in the basket and i'll go to
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:01.440]   check out oh i'm sorry there's nothing in your basket and your nuts and i've got so angry that i got
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.240]   so angry that like i did the same thing that you guys did it was like what if i put a one terabyte
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.960]   what if i get the machine that nobody really is buying i'll get that that went in and so that
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:16.880]   that's the reason why i'm getting a 512 gigabyte which which i wanted uh 12.9 inch which i wanted
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.640]   but in silver instead of space gray because all i knew was that that one was the one i had budgeted
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:27.120]   for it's not the color i wanted but that was actually landing in the basket and i just wanted to slam
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.560]   that puppy home while i had still had a chance of getting it some time before you know labor day
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:37.920]   uh and mine was arriving mine has shipped and it's arriving on friday oh so jealous so
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:44.880]   you know so funny is i wanted so bad to not have to order silver one and i was fighting the store
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:49.360]   having the same problems as any because it kept taking things out of my basket and i'm like it's
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:56.080]   gonna be in this case bro i don't really care what color yeah if it were orange or purple you know
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.200]   i would i would live with that the case yeah well i bought that that's that's part of the stuff that
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.880]   i bought like at the apple store over the week i did i got i had to get the new pencil because the old
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:10.080]   one doesn't work got a new folio case for it and i've realized that well if i get the orange one it
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.720]   kind of almost looks like getting the lighter colored one was an intentional choice instead of
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:20.080]   me being a fool for being impatient uh which keyboard are you guys you're gonna buy apples
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:26.000]   two and fifty dollar magic i did did you get it for just did it you did it it was funny i i him
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.720]   did hard about it the whole way through from when it first came out i was like don't not doing it right
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   the folio is perfectly fine whatever now that i've had this for like a week it's a pretty good
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.440]   idea i am mad at myself i didn't get it back then yeah because i definitely would have out-earned
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.200]   what i paid for it because productivity is so much better with this floaty thing we all see
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.480]   measures because i can't go flat but i don't care we mentioned last week that even though apple says
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:56.960]   technically the old magic keyboard does not fit the fifth generation 12-9 it fits well enough that
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:04.080]   you can use it but so i have it and actually i i thought you know i should really i haven't tried
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:09.760]   the logitech combo touch it is now available for 12.9 so i'll probably get it before i get my
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:14.160]   ipad pro but i thought i'd give that a try so good we can compare notes because i have
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.200]   the magic keyboard for the old ipad so supposedly though apple has some sort of a secret some sort
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:24.240]   of secret sauce for the trackpad that they as yet aren't sharing with outside hardware so
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:30.800]   so the the trackpad experience on the magic keyboard is is markedly better than what you get
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:39.440]   in any third party i'll let you know as it as it was like i could i could feel like the ghost of my
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:44.640]   father just glaring at me saying you spent how much on a computer without a keyboard it's a
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:50.480]   point you already bought a brand and that's and i have to i have to let my bank account like recover
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:56.400]   from that before i even consider a 350 dollar range is trackpad and and the logitech is about
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:01.440]   100 bucks less so there's another reason to do it i will let you know i'll tell i mean this is good
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:07.600]   that's good let's see if the trackpad is any good i have to say with the ipad the trackpad is
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:14.240]   almost redundant because you you also can reach out and touch it is almost but not and see i said
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:18.000]   all of these things Leo it's so funny i said all these things what is this thing this folio
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.880]   thing but not folio but this floaty dude this has been out for like a year and a half and i
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.560]   pooped it the whole way i love it i agree with you silly not going to happen once i did it i was like
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.240]   oh this is dirty two things i love about it then maybe a lot of people talk about but i was
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.640]   ignoring them because i didn't want to like it let's just put let's tell the truth the fact that i
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.960]   can charge from the right side and leave the left side port open so that i can connect my hyperjuice
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:52.240]   thunderbolt hub right i love that i love that thank you that alone is almost worth the money but
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:58.800]   there's gives you a second port because you're charging port thank you yeah a whole charging port
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:05.520]   so now when i take my western digital black you know or my sabbath like really fast drive and
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:11.280]   plug to that sucker open up luma fusion and do my you know basic edits off of here it's
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:16.720]   fantabulous because it's floaty you can take this when you have it connected and run the wire
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:23.040]   under it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah oh you just put it not dangling off your lap smart smart you know
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:27.680]   what i'm saying yep so it's chilling right there it's plugged in i'm editing editing editing
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.600]   having the trackpad makes editing so much faster and then when i'm done i can say send the xml to the
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:41.520]   desktop i come in slap titles on and final cut and then it's off to the races so it's crazy because
[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:47.040]   i can type better i feel i can't type let's get this tell the truth um but yeah it's worth it's
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:52.800]   worth the money and it is kicky screaming and it hurt but i just told myself i'll earn this sucker
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:58.640]   back at no more than a month after i bought it so just do it and i swear to you it's worth it i will
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:04.320]   in effect have the choice because apple and scooter x has posted this in the irc apple says the first
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:10.480]   generation of the magic keyboard is functionally compatible with the new ipad pro 12.9 due to the
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.360]   slightly thicker dimensions of the new ipad pro it's possible the magic keyboard may not precisely
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.800]   fit when closed especially for screen protectors are applied well i don't plan to close it so okay
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:26.720]   it's probably fine it's that that that's that so b's got to start earning from the day you peel
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:31.680]   the thing off the screen damn it hell yeah you're not going to sleep mode oh no you're not going
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:37.760]   to your now we're only uh we're only really just uh three weeks and let little actually i guess
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:44.480]   exactly three weeks away from uh apple's wwdc keynote so three weeks from now i may regret any
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:52.080]   purchases i've made according to mark german apple is readying a new macbook pro and a new macbook air and
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:42:01.920]   and even new mac pros i max and pro mac minis now we don't know when they're we're gonna ship it's
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:09.120]   you know because of various rumors but even the leak from quanta it looks like there'll be a 14
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:16.240]   inch and a 16 inch macbook pro uh on uh on the seventh i'm i'm gonna guess right redesign chassie
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:26.800]   magsafe charger more ports including hdmi and sd cards what this is this is this is i when this
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.840]   rumor started up about two months ago i i thought to myself i'm gonna have to like make up stickers
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:37.040]   i'm gonna sell them for like two bucks each and they just say andy was right because every single
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:41.760]   thing i've hated about macbooks for the past three or four years is like this is the andy is right
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.840]   including the butterfly keyboard right andy they got rid of the keyboard got rid of the touch bar
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.120]   gave me more ports put bring back the sd card slot and he was right not always but in this case
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:57.760]   yes also german says and again german this is a rumor but german's i can't think of a time german's
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:04.960]   been wrong he's very well connected he says for the new macbook pros again this i'm gonna say is
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.600]   it's three weeks off at least the announcement whether you'll be able to order and get right away
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.440]   might be another month or two apples playing two different chips not m1s
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:23.840]   codename jade sea chop and jade sea die letter c both include eight eight high performance cores
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:30.240]   two energy efficient course so it's a ten core instead of four plus four it's eight plus two which
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:37.040]   is interesting and will be offered in either sixteen or thirty two graphics core variations
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:43.280]   so these are gonna be it sounds like significantly more performance now it doesn't he didn't say
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.200]   anything about clock speed so maybe it probably be the same i don't know it'd be the same clock
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.720]   speed i don't know well it's it's it seems as though with the release of the iMac they've already
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:57.840]   covered the entire spectrum of the existing mac line by that's right m1 they are the exact same
[00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.520]   m1 chip so this this is why i love the rooming in the i-pad pro yeah exactly yes this is what this
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:07.280]   is why i love the reviews of the new iMac this morning we're kind of i take climactic because
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.720]   they're like okay well technically they're benchmark but they benchmark the exact same way
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.760]   we know how they'll reform yeah so i would i would be shocked if we saw any more new macks that didn't
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:22.720]   have a next generation chip with it and i'd be i i don't think did marker did german provide a
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:26.560]   timetable that said that it's not going to be for until later in this year or not going to be until
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:33.360]   2022 for some of the stuff uh not really um i'm so i'm making up june seventh oh i feel fairly
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:40.000]   confident about that uh is a is a garage yeah it just has to be because of development and
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.960]   psychos and getting things ready but but you know there's no pressure to revamp the macbook air so
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:53.040]   um so here's what he says redesign macbook pros are expected to debut as soon as early this summer
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:58.080]   said the people he always refers to the people people who know who requested and an
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:05.920]   emily discuss an internal matter followed by followed by a revamp macbook air a new low end macbook
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:12.800]   pro yeah so redesign on the low end the 13 inch maybe and an all new mac pro workstation
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:20.960]   followed by doesn't mean like in a month it could be september or later probably october i would
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:25.760]   guess or november the company's also working on and this is good news is first we've heard of this i
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:34.320]   suspected and hoped a higher end mac mini and and what's funny is when you look at the 24 inch i'm
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:40.240]   x they're shipping this friday it immediately tells you well they've got to be doing a 32 inch or
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:47.280]   something a higher end i'm x right that's at the very end and larger i'm x is it like the tail end of
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:54.560]   his is yeah 24 and 27 isn't a big enough swash to me so they got to go 32 maybe because i'm just
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.720]   starting to not be able to see i want well you can do it by taking off bezels right
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:07.920]   yeah yeah in theory yes and andi i just want to remind you that if you sell 175 and he was right
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:15.520]   stickers you could buy a magic keyboard well well actually actually i'm hoping i'm hoping to sell
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:22.160]   like 1500 of them and get myself like a mac i like a mac pro or uh or something i got the sticker guy
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.680]   for you i will send you a dm um big fantastic stickers get the cut out ones don't get the square
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.480]   ones make sure they need to cut out one with the chops and everything just chops andi was right
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:38.240]   that fits inside the top i buy that no no no no i'll i'll just gotta say andi they don't want to
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:41.520]   use the don't i don't want to market the chops because then i'm sort of like i don't want i don't
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:47.440]   want to bob ross got stuck with that hair he's holding out he's holding it after he wants more money
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:52.240]   for the chops that's what it is exactly that's all the chops have the my mutton chops have their own
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:56.720]   separate representation so we'd have to be like a different negotiation the chops version is five
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.840]   dollars in the regular text only version is two dollars bro i'm going to get you the keyboard and
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:10.080]   a brand new purple computer the chips according going on with the rumor please the chips and i'm
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:17.760]   sorry we're having fun we're enjoying our no fun allowed mr joy killer the chips also include 64
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:27.520]   gigs of memory that's a must right um and by the way there's also uh the further rumor that supplies
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:36.080]   might be very constrained on these according to mac rumors and digit times um the problem
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:40.800]   might be these mini led displays i'm not sure if they were gonna put those in the laptops or not
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:46.480]   but this is one doc rock is gonna have to get up at 2 a.m. for for sure if he wants to uh wants to
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:52.800]   i will make sure that i stay up if i have to drink eight cups of coffee prior and just be up
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:57.600]   are you holding out for the 16 inch for video editing and things like that i would say um you
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:06.000]   know i i'm because i went and got a crazily insane fully loaded i pad i am trying to just
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:13.520]   transition my love for my notebook anyway um i feel more free with my ipad i mean i have nice
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:17.440]   weather and things so i feel like i can just pick this guy up the battery lasts forever
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.800]   go outside sit out do some work you know go to someplace so i'm trying to avoid having to get
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:29.280]   another notebook um because i do have the mini which is just insane and then i have a fully loaded
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:34.960]   2020 iMac which hopefully i'd probably sell to swap it out for a 32 inch iMac right you know
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.640]   something i saw i want another iMac because i just love something about the iMac is just
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:45.520]   a joy to work on right because of what Renee mentioned about quality displays it's really hard
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:51.840]   nowadays unless you want to pay 6k for 6k to get such a beautiful display that doesn't just look
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:57.760]   whack or have weird like i'm trying to make it look gameery feet and it's just uh or like i don't
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:03.760]   like anything that's in a display market right now other than that ces 40 inch lg that they announced
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:09.600]   right which still i want you i'm on the other side i want to preserve kapata uh the capability
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:15.120]   to upgrade the displays or to change the displays and i really felt locked in by a mama iMac pro so
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.800]   i'm actually very interested in this more powerful version of the mac mini which is code name j374
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:27.120]   when when german quotes code names you kind of feel like he's got some inside sources here same chip
[00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:34.800]   as this new macbook pro these new jade chips four ports versus the pair available on the low end mini
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:41.680]   the entry level mini uh he does have the caveat that apple could delay or cancel the new minis
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:47.600]   launch as it has in the past but eventually the company will likely replace the intel equipment
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:56.000]   in now cells i'm very interested in the old rumor and it could be completely flawed that not only
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   will they do a mac pro cheese grater with the uh new apple silicon but they will do a mini mac pro
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.440]   which i would buy i don't care who cost is no objective there's a mini mac pro
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:14.160]   jade leo you know what i've been dreaming about lately i have been dreaming about a anniversary
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:22.400]   edition of the cube that is basically a baller mini that's like a mini donk i love that cube it
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:27.840]   was so pretty i had a cube i bought it the last day of availability unknowns to mean i bought it
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.160]   took it home and then read the astray apple cancels the cube that's how that's the
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:39.040]   new buy use that's how it started that was the first one yeah yeah bought it the end of life
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.600]   day of the end of life i still have my monitor for the cube but the body itself started to yellow
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.880]   and crack yeah that class it was terrible actually oh man i i just want to i want something of that
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:55.200]   nature it doesn't have to be plastic but something like you know a small next with like two
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:00.160]   m whatever next generations built in and all the ports and for all the people that are happy
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.040]   about the four ports that might be on this new mini realize it will still probably only be two
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:09.760]   controllers just because of the amount of heat that will get stuck in their box just you have to
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:16.960]   remember and then he buries the the line that probably a lot of pros are interested in the high end mac
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:21.920]   pro desktop plan for next year and that makes sense because apple said the transition is going to
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:28.240]   take two years so yeah next year will likely have a choice of two processors either twice or four
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:36.160]   times as powerful as the new high end macbook pro chip in other words 40 cores
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:44.880]   that's what they they they had to demonstrate they have to demonstrate two things to make m one
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.920]   it's m one is already success but there are two real goalposts here one is to prove it works and
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:54.400]   that was worth all the trouble they've already done that the next step is just here is how if
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:59.840]   here's if we if we want to really really flex on the power of this entire architecture and platform
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:07.200]   when we build the the stonehenge type uh cp stonehenge type computer that is designed for all these
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.720]   people who are trying to model wind tunnel effects uh in real time this is the machine that we're
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:17.680]   really really really going to flex with that's the one that that's that i would guess is going to be
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:22.080]   the last one to to uh to be released because that's going to require all the knowledge that they've
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.440]   accumulated not only from chip chip design and manufacturer but also about how well uh performance
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:33.680]   cores versus versus efficiency cores are working together uh how many how well like different bus
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:38.080]   bandwidths are working together that's what's going to be the the one like the like the memory
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.360]   x-ad of to the guides with a hair blowing backward that's what they're looking for meanwhile they have
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:48.800]   to meanwhile they have to fill it out with all the ones that they did last year are nice but they
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:54.160]   were just we for people who want a a macbook pro form factor for people who want a macbook air
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.640]   form factor where people want a mac mini form factor we're bailing the the exact same computers
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:03.200]   inside these three shells do you want a fan do you not want a fan do you want a desktop do you not
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:10.000]   want a desktop and so now the the next uh the next era for 2021 is going to be now we have to build
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.040]   like a macbook pro for real this design specifically around this not just simply a retrofit of the
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:19.360]   old one and that's going to be the point in which uh that that's going to be the point which people
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:26.960]   like me who bought a macbook pro m1 day one might have wished oh is there any way i could have possibly
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.360]   waited for the 16 inch ball because that one has more ports i suppose gonna that's what's going to
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:36.800]   have a better IO that might even come in purple i would love to have a purple if i was spending
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:41.280]   two thousand dollars on a laptop if i wanted to be purple damn it it gets to be purple here's what
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:47.680]   german's here's what german's saying about this pro he says codenamed and again with the codenames
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:55.600]   i feel like that's high confidence level codenamed j2c die and jade 4c die reesign mac pro is planned
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:03.520]   to come in 20 or 40 computing core variations made up of 16 or 32 high performance cores
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:11.520]   and four or eight high efficiency cores the chips would also include either 64 core or 120
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:19.280]   128 core options for graphics the computing core count tops the 28 core maximum offered by
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   today's intel mac pro chips and of course it's not intel it's not x86 it's apple silicon
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:32.160]   uh and i guess no more a m d either the new mac pro has been in the works for several months german
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:39.120]   reports and is expected to look like a smaller version of the current design they've also been
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:44.800]   working on for u doc rock a larger i mac within house processors but development of that version
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:53.760]   was paused uh oh months ago to let apple focus on the re-design 24 inch model so
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:55:02.000]   sounds like a higher end i mac or i mac pro might be a little ways off you think november or this time
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.360]   next year that's a good that's an interesting question because embers enough time six months later
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:12.560]   november is enough time to yeah because you think about this notebook is wwdc should be always has
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:18.720]   been it's kind of a thing but i do believe that the air or the other college mac books i do believe
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:24.080]   that's a august play because it gets you in time for back to school right so the re-design mac book
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:29.440]   air and then say a new mac book you know not necessarily pro but that's something that's not
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:34.320]   an air you know and please air get rid of the wedge just make it flat well let me read you what mark
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:40.800]   says about the higher end mac book air planned for as early as the end of the year i think i'm
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:46.000]   with you it should really be in time for college apple's planning a direct successor to the m1
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:53.520]   processor the code named statin will like the island will include the same number of courses the m1
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:58.880]   but run faster so right now all the m1s in existence are the same clock speed actually i didn't ask
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:03.520]   rene about the clock speed on the i mac have said but that's not using any creativity because if
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:09.600]   you're going to name a statin you must just go and name it wu tang i mean wu tang baby strong
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:15.600]   it will also see the number of graphics cores increased from seven or eight to nine or ten
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:20.320]   so you know that's interesting a faster mac book air would be a very very popular product
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:25.680]   especially as you say well with students yeah especially if they follow the i mac and made
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:33.120]   it available in seven different colors oh baby you know i'm thinking too when they get down the
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:42.000]   idea of okay say four m1s or whatever m something's on a plane right and they can switch independently
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.200]   between parallel processing or serial processing you're going to have a mac pro that will just be
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.400]   basically unstoppable when you need them to band together votron style then do the thing
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:57:00.640]   don't be incredible but when you're working on say four independent tasks and you can give like
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:06.880]   an entire processor to something or the other part that's kind of has me keeping up at night
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:12.720]   is what if they turn some of this work that they've been doing into graphic chips specifically
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:20.400]   so that you could get machines that have you know apple generated graphics chips that are just
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:27.360]   for banging out graphics because so many people in the video space in the virtualization space are
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.480]   mac folk let me actually to that point it's interesting there's a really good piece
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:40.240]   and a blog called the eclectic light company i love it in which he kind of took a look at why
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:50.400]   the m1s feel faster and apparently apple assigns to every task a qo s or i guess quality of service
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:55.840]   tag ranging from background which is the lowest to user interactive which is the highest the
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:01.920]   user's you know using it right now integer values spread evenly between nine and 33
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:09.200]   and so what he did is knowing that and you can actually check the qo s value of a process
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.400]   knowing that he took a look he has the the guy who wrote this has a compressor decompressor utility
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:22.080]   called cormorant which lets you set the qo s for its tasks very smart he created a 10 gigabyte
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:27.440]   test file compressed that many many times using different qo s and concomant and operations
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:35.680]   took a look at it on the intel zon w8 core where all qo s settings result in the same
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:41.760]   res you know speed and then compared it to the m1 and came up with some interesting an interesting
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:48.080]   strategy that apple uses he says if you look at you can see this yourself you look at the activity
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:54.480]   monitor open the cpu history display you'll be able to see what apple is doing
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:59:02.080]   all almost all the activities are mack o s almost all are running on the slower efficiency
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:07.920]   cores and then a kit and you i don't know i think i've seen this but i never really paid
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:13.760]   attention with an occasional blip on the performance cores running apps and performing
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.840]   other user tasks the other way around with the brunt born on performance rather than efficiency
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:25.520]   that's because those user tasks are more likely run with the qo high qo s at least 17 maybe as high as 25 to 33
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:33.040]   so and interestingly the apple is using those efficiency cores i guess this is probably because
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:38.400]   they're laptops and you want to say battery power yeah i'd be curious to see what this looks like on the i max
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:44.160]   the new i max because those processes are handed off to the efficiency core he writes all they do now
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:50.000]   is slow other mack o s background tasks to which because they're in the background they're lower qo
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:57.120]   s we're not paying attention to it so for instance your time machine backup will run maybe run even a
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:03.040]   little slower which you wouldn't notice because it's just running in the background but the stuff
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:09.280]   that you're paying attention to that's in the foreground runs that much faster as a result so that
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:15.280]   makes sense right genius when you really sit down and think about the amount of work that went into
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:23.120]   that and just thinking about like how to prioritize and then parlay task ad hoc on the fly and then
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:28.000]   you know and he comes in and like there's a special on pizza and he needs to get a pizza order out
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.680]   real quick like it knows how to like handle that and then move the order over to a slower processor
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.280]   that kind of stuff is just pure genius and it doesn't get talked about when everyone's out here just
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:45.520]   going off of benchmarks benchmarks are only good on the bench period like they're kind of sort of
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.880]   semi useless but we're just in love with them because we love comparative analysis well and i
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:56.000]   would also point out this is something actually a lot of microsoft has always done this they optimize
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:04.720]   for perceived performance if you know in other words they want it to feel a look snappy so the
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.160]   stuff that you're not looking at that's going on in the background is going to be slowed down
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.440]   artificially just because they want anything you're looking at windows popping up interaction
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.400]   they want that to seem as snappy as possible so it's actually kind of interesting to know that that's
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:24.480]   you know kind of the conscious strategy being used with these m1 processors and it's why
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.160]   you know we've seen these efficiency performance cores on the phone but we've never had them on a
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:35.520]   desktop before as he points out until it's all the same so it really without necessarily being a
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:44.800]   faster computer it can look a hell of a lot faster and feel much snappy and it makes perfect
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.320]   sense i mean we're the way that we're discussing it almost seems like the way that Samsung used
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:52.320]   to game benchmark tests but it's not but it's really not if there's something that you're actually
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.240]   paying attention to you would want that to be the fastest process that's actually working
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.800]   that's actually working for you it's okay to have this a a render that's going in the background
[01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.000]   to sort of take a little bit a little bit longer time and i mean what Doc was saying was absolutely
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:12.640]   right the more that we've learned about what's what's going on under the hood the more we realize how
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:18.240]   appreciating the performance and the design of these m1 these apple silicon chips
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:24.640]   is requires a whole new set of appreciation for how computers work that we're used to saying oh
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.560]   well gosh look at the look at this is not this is using the eight nanometer process not the 14
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:33.040]   nanometer process oh look at the clock speed of this oh look how the cache is working on that and
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:38.640]   those are important stuff but we're talking about uh simpler even simpler things like like uh how
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:46.560]   when uh when numbers have to be chopped up into bits and sent to sent into the cpu how big of a
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:52.080]   of a swath can these can these selections of bits be do they have to be one fixed length and with
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:56.960]   a lot of wastage every time or can they completely adjust these things on the fly to make sure that
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:01.600]   there's never a clock cycle that's not being used to actually trans it's actually shuttle data through
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:07.360]   and i'm greatly oversimplifying something that i have to read four times to make sure that i
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:13.360]   understand i appreciate that but but these are the sort of things that that we keep coming up with as
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:19.120]   engineers keep poking and prodding and experimenting and discovering things that apple is not willing
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:24.080]   to tell us about these m1s independent people who know exactly how these things work are saying
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:27.680]   my god they're not there's the easy way in the hard way and they decided to do it the hard way
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:34.640]   but the hard way is why we're getting these immense immense productivity the these this immense speed
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:39.520]   on one simple piece of silicon and that's and again these are just the first m1 chips out of the
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.120]   gate they haven't they haven't really started trying yet they want to make sure they worked
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:46.880]   they want to make sure they didn't you know you didn't get this pop sound every time that you
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.320]   tried to divide by 12 and with a remainder left over they did that and 12 times more and now they
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.480]   can see okay we got it working now let's get let now it's getting working so much that we will
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:01.760]   embarrass other people who are in the chip manufacturer business and thanks to uh h ochle the
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:08.480]   writer on the uh electric arc sorry eclectic like company blog it's eclectic light dot co
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:15.200]   he's uh an artist but he's also a programmer and has a very creative naming scheme it's not just
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:21.520]   cormorant which is his compressor program he also has a program called spundle for creating
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:27.280]   resizing and compacting sparse bundles stibbium for running and analyzing performance benchmarks
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:34.960]   on storage dinch for checking integrity of your files finch for drag and drop integrity management
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:40.720]   and cinch a command line tool to check file integrity so i don't know who you are a chokly but i'm
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.120]   going to be making uh more regular visits to the eclectic light company good it's not how
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:50.160]   george former used to name his kids all the same letter in the same syllable spundle cormorants
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.680]   to be him dinch finch and cinch really well the only one i know is a bird all the rest of them
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:00.880]   birds i mean a cormorant i know yeah yeah yeah very popular in japanese but what do you rest
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.840]   the deal yeah and it's not like finch so it's uh you know can't clever yeah maybe you like spurs
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:13.920]   uh actually i saw cormorants in action when i was in china in um southern china it's kind of
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:18.640]   creepy the first time i saw it i was like what the hell but the fishermen are out on these boats
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:23.520]   uh long boats is where they've been doing it for hundreds of years they have cormorants
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:27.760]   with wire forgive me if you're an animal rights activist you're not gonna like this
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:32.640]   wires around there next so they can't swallow the fish they catch the fishermen send them out they
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:37.760]   catch fish they're stuck in their throats then they bang a stick they come back to the boat they
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:43.840]   squeeze all the fish out of the cormorants mouth into a basket give the cormorant a fish to eat
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:49.120]   and then throw them back in the water to catch more fish they use it's a really really ancient
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:55.120]   japanese fish style it dates back four thousand of years those birds are well taking care of animal
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:02.160]   rights activist chill those birds are almost spiritual and in a place where it is like they're revered
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:07.120]   so if you actually see some japanese family symbols you'll see on a samurai jacket there's
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:12.640]   actually a cormorant on some of the moans called the combo that circle with the design in it that's
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:19.040]   your family seal similar to like a tartan i wasn't familiar with this when i saw this in china
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:24.160]   and i my son was with me my when he was his back when he was 14 and i was like what the hell are
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:29.760]   they doing to those poor birds but uh it's pretty cool it's kind of an interesting yeah it's ancient
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:33.600]   right four thousand years old yeah also if you're going to try to abolish that thing you got to
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.680]   realize that those birds are unionized that's the union shop you're not going to be able to break
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:41.360]   they don't seem unhappy the only thing that seems cruel is is at the end when the fishermen
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:46.320]   grabs them and and prise the fish from their mouth and that throats them back in the water
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:51.680]   but the cormorants could fly away there's nothing uh you know keeping them from leaving so obviously
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:56.400]   they except for possibly starving enough because they got a wire around their well that's true they
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:02.480]   do have the wire around watch here he goes oh god oh my god the poor bird it doesn't hurt him
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:07.440]   i guess not maybe it's like having a popcorn kernel like stuck between yeah they get released
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.120]   full that they fold out thank you and then he throws him back in the water okay all right that
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.960]   was a bit of a digression i don't know how we got to cormorant oh i do know how we got there but i
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:24.400]   apologize for digression let's get back to uh to apple stuff uh there actually is a huge apple
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:29.680]   story let me take a break uh because i kind of i mean i didn't bury the lead after all those new
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:35.200]   max are a big story but this is or even in some ways a bigger story and it's uh it's the other
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.960]   shoe dropping on a rumor that we've been hearing about for some time we'll get to that in just a

[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:29.920]   the balloon of my lungs and breathing out it really it's really well done i have to say headspace
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:35.680]   dot com slash mac break thank you headspace for your support we really appreciate it all right
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.400]   big news big news although in some ways disappointing news apple has announced
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:46.480]   it was a rumor but they have they put out the press release yesterday uh lossless audio
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.800]   for their entire catalog which is now what's several hundred million songs
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:14:00.720]   free 75 million sorry 75 million songs free so there are companies offering lossless audio
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:07.200]   Spotify's rumored to be planning it but Deezer and Tidal do it now but they charge you extra
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:14.560]   free amazon amazon used to but spontaneously for no reason whatsoever the next day that free
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:20.160]   as well yeah like going hour after the apple press release amazon said it's free well it's part
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:26.240]   of the regular deal i've been using actually paying for amazon hd because i i do think it sounds
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.880]   better especially if you have good speakers now that's the good news the bad news is and by the
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.520]   way it's spatial audio as well uh with support for dobe atmos the bad news is
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:42.000]   it doesn't work on any of their bluetooth devices because bluetooth sucks it should and i know
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:46.880]   this is going to drive everyone crazy but from a kid that grew up in the audio file store you know
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:53.520]   my whole entire life i have a dragonfly deck if you if you're unfamiliar it looks like an old school
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.080]   one of these you know like usb guys but you plug it into your computer and you put your
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:04.880]   headphones in and so if you have like you know audio quality in earbuds or over the ear headphones
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:11.040]   the d a converter will convert things back and make it sound good because bluetooth even with a
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:18.720]   tdp r2 dtub still sucks like it's lossless would be a waste of bluetooth and everyone is mad but
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:24.160]   like you have to understand how bluetooth works it's just not a thing it's recompressing it it's in
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.240]   and so even if they were doing it lossless it would become lossy
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   so it went over bluetooth so don't bother you still will get the spatial audio in fact i think you
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.320]   need apples airpud pro or the the headphones to get the spatial audio i don't know if anything
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.440]   else does spatial audio there's a rumor there's a new beats pro coming that will be will have
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:51.040]   spatial audio but it but it's also wireless so any it's a it's a foolish thing to try to do
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:57.920]   lossless audio through wireless get a DAC actually the iPhone's DAC is okay but like the
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:03.600]   Dragonfly is excellent i use something from a company called iFi i-f-i-dash audio nice yeah
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:08.480]   hip DAC i like you but i keep trying to drink out of it it looks like a little hip flask it's
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:14.320]   only a hundred something bucks so what's nice and it's battery powered so you can you know carry
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:21.280]   it along with your iPhone and you plug it in you have to have it's unfortunate they don't bundle
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.880]   the lightning connector into it i guess i would add too much to the cost so you need the camera
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.920]   connection kit to use this with an iPhone but if you have an iPad the type c connector works
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:36.880]   just fine or anything else and it does a very good job and it also has its own amplifier in
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:43.600]   it as well so you can turn the music up so hip DAC Dragonfly is very well respected is another
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.200]   great DAC digital analog converter and then and then listen with wired headphones i just bought
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:55.280]   Scott Wilkinson recommended you know i have very expensive hi-fi man electrostatic
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:00.320]   you know thousand dollar headphones but i'm not going to carry those anywhere because they're
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:06.080]   too expensive and Scott Wilkinson just recommended these new Sennheiser i-300
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:13.920]   in a year and they're fantastic um they're they're 300 bucks they're not cheap but the sound is
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:21.360]   surprisingly good for in ear earbuds um as i would say almost as good as as as much more expensive
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:26.160]   over the ear headphones so put that with the i-fi on the loss list you're gonna you're gonna
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.720]   appreciate it now there's people in charm saying nothing wrong with bluetooth sounds great
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:38.240]   sorry well no and then you know honestly Leo i've had to come to grips was i tried to explain this
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:41.680]   to some of my younger friends and we're talking like early months and we're talking about
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.600]   some of my younger friends and we're talking like early millennials and backwards
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:49.760]   they grew up everything compressed they grew up on it they don't know any more than i yard yeah
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:55.520]   we grew up on vinyl like again i worked in a high-end audio store for over 30 years of my life so
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.920]   when you just be happy that you don't know the difference to be honest with you because once you
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:05.840]   know it's irritating it's really true you bought you have to buy expensive if you are happy with spam
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:12.800]   enjoy the heck out of that spam and stay away from a5 wagyu because a5 wagyu steaks for 400
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:18.880]   dollars will ruin your life i agree with you it will ruin your life so be stoked if you like bluetooth
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:25.200]   man power to you brother sister and don't and don't ever let anybody sit you down and say let
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:31.920]   me show you what you're missing oh no because no mama said no yeah because they can't they if you
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:37.440]   are you might have to be taught but if you know what to listen for in lossless compression you
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:43.680]   can hear it i mean i you know uh you can tell so apple it's i completely understand why they're
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:48.560]   not going to do it uh it's not support on air pods air pods pro those very expensive air
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:55.760]   pods max you bought sorry home pod or home pod mini not supported but if you have a direct
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.440]   connection there's no headphone jack in the iphone so you'll need a DAC to do that or
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.520]   headphones that have a lightning port which they used to bundle in uh again don't do it with the air
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:11.760]   air pods anyway or the earbuds that came with your iphone that's a wasted time get some decent
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:17.440]   headphones get a DAC and listen that way i pad with the type c connector there's type c headphones
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:23.920]   as well or you can get a dongle mac same thing apple tv will also support lossless actually
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:28.800]   i'm excited about that because i have a very nice pair of elack speakers with an elack app
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:34.800]   that is hooked up to my uh tv and now i'll be able to play lossless through that from i always
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:39.920]   wanted apple music to do that so i'm very happy about that so if you have an apple tv you can also
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:49.040]   do it that way yeah it does show some of the short sinus of short sightedness of apple design courage
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.160]   like this i mean well exactly it's like okay so great so you you know you have lossless but it
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:58.800]   means that this fifteen hundred dollar ipad i just bought i'm going to have to buy something else
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:04.800]   just to get the exact same quality i get by plugging a pair of like fifty dollar wired headphones into
[01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:10.080]   this damn thing because this because lossless is really is this really is the first leap up
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:14.880]   in noticeable sound quality when you go from a compressed stream or compressed file to an
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:21.040]   uncompressed file that's the first one where where you undeniably things really really open up
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.040]   once you start getting into higher higher bit rates now you start getting into arguments about
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:34.160]   about how any uh any uh file format that's uh bit rate and and uh and frequency that's uh more than
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:37.760]   cd quality you're probably almost certainly not going to be able to detect it there's less
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:43.280]   vargurbence everywhere about how no no you're there there here is the math based on 30 years of
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:49.280]   science saying that cd quality is the that's why cd quality cd quality because it is exactly how
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:54.880]   much a human being can possibly appreciate with their hardware where their ears plus a little bit
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:59.360]   more for a little extra headroom and that's it but going from compressed to uncompressed that's
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:04.080]   something you're really going to appreciate and now again you just thank you for not giving me a
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:10.080]   headphone jack on this fifteen hundred dollar device thank you for uh it's selling a five hundred and
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:16.560]   fifty dollar pair of headphones where i can't just have like a you know a simple stereo jack on this
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:23.280]   on the side of it to say well just plug feed me audio through this copper wire into the drivers
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.920]   so that i can appreciate these beautiful headphones with lossless quality that sort of thing kind of
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:32.240]   bites but it does show you how apple tends to think about these things i don't think that they were
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:39.280]   ever really really thinking hard about uh uh uh the quality of the i don't think that they were
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:44.320]   putting a lot of uh a lot of stress on the quality of the source material what they were trying to sell
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:50.560]   is not reproduction but more like here is the great things that we can do with this audio with
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:54.960]   a processing that's inside these five hundred fifty dollar headphones here's the quote computational
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:59.600]   audio tricks that we can perform on it here is the spatial audio tricks that we can do it so if you
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:05.840]   give us a uh even a crummy compressed uh AAC file we can do amazing things with it just by simply
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:11.920]   cooking it and processing it and we're not terribly interested in just simply taking an audio signal
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:16.800]   off of a copper wire and reproducing it with the greatest fidelity and the greatest accuracy
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.960]   possibly i don't think that that sort of stuff really moves them but does it just goes to show
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:26.560]   five hundred fifty bucks you're going to get apple's point of view on what good headphones mean you're
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.040]   not going to get something that is going to be useful for pretty much everything you would want
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:34.640]   uh pair of headphones to do and by the way that's even if you use the wire that you
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:42.560]   wire sold separately it's still not gonna do it so uh what's interesting uh here is that apple
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:50.240]   is not gonna it's i guess you have to choose between spatial because spatial is on all of those
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:57.120]   devices that don't support lossless is there anything that does lossless and spatial i don't
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:03.200]   think so spatial requires airpods pro or the max right this that's a good question no but it's
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.880]   like you have to choose to do what and some people might like spatial i have not actually
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.880]   experienced it i have the earpods pro but i've never bothered because i didn't really care
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:19.120]   oh it's good just one but i for tv stuff i get it like on ted lasso spatial was just a trip it was
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:24.000]   just kind of weird but you know it didn't really bring anything extra to the show yeah but it was
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:30.880]   just i was just doing this like it was kind of fun but i don't see how again you know like i have a
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:38.080]   surround i don't see how it works system of yeah so i i have surrounds i have speakers all around me
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:43.840]   i have a center channel i've left right so i'm happy with that but that's not what spatial audio is
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:48.880]   apparently so i'm a little confused yeah and i'm curious if that will work with something like the
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:57.840]   file q1 q1 it's a lightning based deck yeah um all of the hi-fi you know nerd channels is one of
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:02.000]   the most popular i have a number of phyodex and i love them i think they're very good it's one
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.800]   like a hundred bucks but that is a lightning oriented deck you know it's funny because again
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.400]   audio file stuff and people i know when everyone wants to hear this but audio file stuff is similar
[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:17.200]   to us whiskey people or the wine people or the beer people and the people that don't get it
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.600]   always tell you that you guys are making it up you don't know but then same thing could be said
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:27.520]   about the beer folks or the wine folks whatever again if you don't know be happy just leave it alone
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.800]   don't get into this never become a connoisseur it's a bad idea it's an expensive idea i built
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:39.280]   an entire plex server just to make lossless copies of all the s a cd stuff that because i
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:44.320]   saw it as you see these that was a clap for all this failed and faded away and
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:51.040]   all of that stuff it's a shame i got 24 karat pink floyd disc i got oh man i like jealousy yeah
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:55.920]   so here's how this is going to work you'll have to opt in because it's uh it's going to be a lot
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:04.400]   more bandwidth they will be in a lack apples lossless format another uh more bad news if you bought
[01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:10.880]   stuff on itunes itunes will not offer anything on a lack for purchase nor will music match
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:17.040]   iTunes match upgrade you to a lack you'll still be an aac uh you know good quality aac but not
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:25.200]   lossless uh the standard lossless tier is cd quality 44 one by 16 bit uh which as andy as you said is
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:31.120]   probably all you have to get there's big arguments in the high res community about how high
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.880]   high res should be and all that apple will go all the way to a 24 bit at 48 kilohertz
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:44.240]   um which is plenty yeah more than enough and there's a lot in the nyquist theorem and there's a lot
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:50.160]   of evidence you know you don't really need to go that high cd quality i think for any streaming
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:56.400]   solution it's just more than adequate so uh it does say high res lossless in other words 24 bit
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:04.480]   192k or or more will require or less i guess 192 nothing goes higher than that high res lossless
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:11.680]   will require apple says a DAC a usb digital audio and log converter i don't know if that's true for
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:18.560]   the apple tv that's interesting apple really did a great job with this we need a we had damn three
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:24.720]   dimensional table to figure out put put your hardware on the x-axis your music on the y-axis
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:29.200]   and your DAC on the z-axis to figure out if you're actually going to get an improvement out of this
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:34.160]   well done if i you know i'm i'll be very happy with cd quality that's that's all i really need
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.400]   and then probably my age all i can hear the product ad was written by Sheldon Cooper yeah you know
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:47.280]   bazinga i did you know i had in my youth like a couple of years ago purchased a lot of high res
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:54.000]   music and i bought niel young's pono player and all that but i i did kind of ultimately decide
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:01.200]   cd quality is really all i all i need i can hear you know and maybe not at three to 20 kilobits
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:06.880]   aac i might not be able to hear the difference i can't hear mp3s and certainly in 128 kilobits i
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:10.880]   can hear the difference there's a little crunchiness in some of the free and subtle stuff if you know
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.080]   what you're looking for you gotta know what you're looking for you know what you're looking for
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.320]   so for instance i'll pick yo yo ma yo yo ma is playing sweet one right you can hear the finger
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:26.720]   movements up and down you can hear when he lives up on the g stream as it vacillates between the g
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.360]   and the d and like that's the stuff that when you know you're listening forward you know you can
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:36.880]   hear the ball stage you want to be in the room with yo yo ma as best you can the other thing and
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:44.400]   this is much more ineffable but there i feel like there's a broader soundstage with lossless and
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:49.680]   higher res than there is with compressed i feel like you don't hear the instruments aren't quite
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:55.280]   as well defined the soundstage is not as open now maybe that's my because remember there's a huge
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:28:00.880]   psychological on and in this but i agree with you 100 when it comes to compressed versus uncompressed
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:08.320]   but i think that in terms of that what what doc is talking about where again you you you were
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:14.960]   aware of the fact that yo yo maz fingertips have fingerproof fingerprints on them and the strings
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:21.200]   themselves how i have like ridges on them actually i and i don't think that's i've i've become convinced
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:28.160]   this less less a case of higher res audio as really really good mastering of the original audio
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:34.320]   like when you compare like the original cd of abby road to the remastered one that came out two or
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:40.080]   three years ago you're you're hearing things in that audio i bought all of those 50 anniversary
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:44.560]   Beatles recordings because i want to hear that i do i agree you know i also want to hear the original
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:51.600]   mono but but but but mastered remember there's all of that stuff was on tape but mastered as best
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:56.400]   as possible to a digital format and i think that that's improved too you know there's there's people
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:01.920]   doing things like on things like miles davis kind of blue which was recorded on real to real tape
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:10.000]   sorry it's not going to be 24 bit 192 kilohertz it's recorded on essentially a low res analog tape
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.200]   but they are doing interesting things all analog tape has a bias tone on it that's inaudible
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:21.520]   but that the equipment can use to compensate for speed variations there there are good people
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:26.320]   doing really interesting work with things like analog tapes from kind of blue where they use
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:33.520]   the bias tone to correct for speed variations in the in the recording and get it and get a better
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:39.280]   version of it than even the analog recording and i think that's worth it that's such a beautiful
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:45.920]   album that it's it's worth hearing it as as close to being in the room as you can so yeah but
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:51.840]   that's that's that's that's my that's my thinking too i don't i do have some high res high res albums
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:58.640]   but the only time i buy high res are when it's a brand new recording by one of my favorite artists
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:03.520]   and so obviously i can't do my usual cheapskate thing of buying like the ucd for four dollars and
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:09.360]   eighty cents on ebay and the thing is if i buy the cd new the week it comes out it's going to cost
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:14.080]   me seventeen eighteen dollars the high resolution version will cost me two and a half bucks more
[01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:18.240]   and i'll be able to download it immediately and there's something about the principle of
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:24.080]   if there's more data there that's always going it's not going to sound worse that's going to be
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:29.040]   at some at some point today or tomorrow or ten years from now that is going to be more better so
[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:34.960]   i will take the extra pile of numbers uh for that for almost the same amount of money if it's one of
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:40.400]   my favorite performer and to be fair ninety nine point nine percent of people who are listening to
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:45.200]   music right will not care this is a this is really to achieve parity with the
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:49.600]   diesel and title and i think really more importantly from apple's strategic point of view
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:54.480]   spotify which is imminently announcing this and an amazon which already has this is apple saying
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.120]   no no you want apple music honestly there's no reason not to have apple music also if you look
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.280]   at the press release and you take the the percentage of the press release that talks about spatial
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:06.960]   audio in the pro the percentage of the press release that talks about loss of they talk a lot
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.280]   more about spatial audio yeah because that's definitely something that you don't have to have
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:16.320]   gold plated ears in order to appreciate that holy call i could hear a violin behind me and a
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:21.360]   soccer ball to my left that's wonderful yeah and this it is a wonder it is it is a wonderful
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.520]   experience of course it might not be with the original uh with the original engineer intended
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:30.880]   but okay it's if you enjoy it you like it that's great apple music quote from the press releases
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:35.840]   working with artists and labels to add new releases and the best catalog tracks as more artists begin
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:42.560]   to create music specifically for the spatial audio experience and so that's important uh you know
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:48.320]   it's most stuff is not recorded that way apple says you can enjoy thousands of songs and spatial
[01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:56.240]   audio from the world's biggest artists thousands for remarrelson's it's a 75 million yeah uh track
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:02.240]   a database apple when apple launches lossless music uh in the next couple of weeks 20 million
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:08.720]   songs will be available that way they say by the end of the year all all 75 million songs in the
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:15.040]   catalog and apple musical support lossless audio um and uh but that's because in many cases they're
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:21.120]   ripping in order to get apple music they're buying the CDs and ripping them i don't think they're
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:26.080]   getting the digital masters in a lot of cases but you know hey that's better than nothing i know
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:31.120]   when they launched apple music they were doing that but apple has a really great relationship
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:35.680]   with labels they are by now they have a gotta be getting digital well also also yeah exactly they
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:41.200]   have a better relationship i believe i've been reading a lot of industry uh forums and there's
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:45.360]   and people who are professional engineers are saying that apple has a knack for getting like the
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:50.400]   best source audio as close to the digital original masters as possible whereas others particularly
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:57.200]   the ones that aren't like the latest hot release whatever analog tape that got duped uh 20 years
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:01.120]   ago right to some sort of digital format they're fine with it i mean the number of times where i've
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:06.240]   been listening to uh amazon music and okay well here's the album art that comes playing like
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:12.480]   this is obviously like someone took like a 20 year old used cd or album and just like put it on
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:18.240]   a scanner and didn't even bother to make the blacks black or anything like this is like is this a
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:24.240]   legitimate operation am i am i giving money to russians for boot like music is this yeah the thing
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:30.400]   that goes missed is when the beats acquisition happened it wasn't just about the hip-up star
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:36.000]   and it wasn't just about the headphones it was about the other johnny the forgotten johnny
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:43.040]   allowed the lot of those gaps to be closed between apple music and the music execs as they lived
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:48.720]   because johnny's a legend so johnny i helped close a lot of those gaps for really that's why there's
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:53.520]   better relationships oh i would have assumed it was it was dr dre oh you're talking about john
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:58.880]   jimmy iaveen not johnny i mean jimmy sorry i mean oh god i thought johnny i never really thought
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:02.720]   of him is the guy with you talking about jimmy iaveen okay good okay jimmy iaveen
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:08.960]   and so i mean okay of course him and andry they helped close a lot of those gaps iaveen everyone's
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.280]   like oh why did they need headphones they don't need it it wasn't the headphones no no that was
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:17.680]   accident yeah although headphones probably is pretty profitable for them i was a fancy
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:25.120]   accident yeah expensive accident yeah so um all of this will happen once you can get the latest version
[01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:32.960]   of ios 14.6 tvos 14.6 and bigster 11.4 that should be sometime in june they say
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:40.160]   and uh you know i guess there's a question mark there are new bluetooth formats coming
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:47.680]   uh perhaps down the road uh it'll be possible to do uh lossless over uh wireless
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.960]   headphones but just not not today yeah not with the technologies available it's not universally
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:57.840]   known that bluetooth is the the bluetooth standards are compression standards yeah and so
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:04.400]   there's you just cannot get lossless yes it's not possible yeah uh anyway you know there you have
[01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.400]   it i'm glad i'm glad we could uh we could mention this big article in the new york times
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:17.840]   yesterday uh talking about apple and uh their deal with china inside apple's compromise
[01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:24.640]   with china a hard bargain they say for apple and china censorship surveillance and profits
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:32.960]   um apple has actually built at the demand of the chinese government a data center
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:42.080]   for chinese customers of apple products in china uh chinese state is owned by the chinese state
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:48.560]   chinese state employees manage the computers uh the the digital encryption technology apple uses
[01:35:48.560 --> 01:35:53.920]   elsewhere is abandoned after china would not allow it the digital keys that unlock information on
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:59.520]   those computers stored in the data centers where chinese state employees have access
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.800]   to them in this is the new york times reporting it with internal documents reviewed by the times
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:10.640]   and interviews with 17 current and former apple employees and for security experts and new filings
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:19.680]   made in a in a court case in the u.s last week um basically tim cook has decided that the chinese
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:25.360]   market is so important to apple that they're going to adhere to the laws of the land and i
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.880]   guess that's what google didn't do and they pulled out of china but uh google is apple has decided
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.320]   they do need to work with the chinese government of course if you're going to do business in a
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:40.320]   kind of country you have to adhere to its laws uh but there is no privacy i guess for chinese users
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:46.800]   of apple products this is this is like it kind of gets to me that apple really wants to make that
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:52.960]   into a marketing thing that oh we believe that privacy is a basic human right but uh currently not
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:56.960]   for all of our customers i mean i don't i don't think they should be ricked over the coals for this
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:02.160]   like i understand the idea that there are corporation and corporations are not people they of course
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.640]   they can donate money like people but okay fine uh they're they're not people they don't have
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:11.920]   uh ethics or morals i don't mean that is a negative thing i mean that you can't have this idea that
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:17.120]   a corporation that's worth two trillion dollars has a single collective conscience but the thing is
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:22.240]   if you're going to try to sell yourself as saying we have this basic principle that we are unswavering
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.200]   at if you're going to use it as a club to strike out against facebook at google you also leave
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:33.120]   yourself way open to saying well how come you don't seem to be that very much bothered about privacy
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:38.480]   when it comes to a very very valuable part of the part of the world that you want to do business in
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:46.400]   and uh in the year after year after year uh changing things keeps uh and the and the government keeps
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:50.640]   putting in more and more pressure and more and more rules that uh that apple and other companies have
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:56.960]   to uh have to adhere to and i just keep wondering where is the line what is the line which apple
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.360]   says we will not do this we don't care about and this is this is way too important to us to to
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:07.520]   compromise on we will not do this thing and again two trillion dollar company i absolutely understand
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:12.320]   this not as simple as my deciding that well you know what you were you were mean to that friend of
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:17.280]   mind so you know what i'm not buying a hot dog from your carts or i said good day uh but nonetheless
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:23.600]   you can't leave them off the hook i don't like it gets me a little bit annoyed and upset over
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:30.880]   the past few days since this story broke is people saying well what can apple do like no no you
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:37.120]   they can stop doing business with china that is something they have the ability to do they are not
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:44.000]   forced to do business with china so at some level you have to absolutely accept confront
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.480]   and make peace with the fact that apple is saying we value this business more than we value this
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:57.440]   principle that we speak so hardly of uh so so much of uh in almost the entire rest of the world
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:02.160]   that again doesn't mean that you have to throw all of your max and and iPhones into the water as a
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:08.960]   former protest but don't pretend for one second that they don't have the option of not doing business
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:14.240]   in china they have the option they're choosing not to do that so that's the price that's they they
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:19.680]   have to own that they have to say in that big list of pros and cons things that we uh we're very
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.600]   proud of things that we regret but we decided to do what's best for the company that's on the list
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.600]   of that's not something we're proud of that's not so that we should be proud of but i have to say
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:35.600]   it's cooked as i say it's best for the company he says literally it's better the world is better
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:41.040]   off with that the world is better off with apple and china the quote from a conference in china in
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:47.040]   2017 tim cook said your choice is do you participate or do you stand on the sideline and yell out
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:52.000]   at how things should be my own view is very strongly as you show up and you participate you
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.160]   get in the arena because nothing ever changes from the sideline apple i should point out
[01:39:56.160 --> 01:40:02.800]   denies the new york times report the time says apple said we have never compromised the security
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:09.360]   of our users or their data in china or anywhere we operate they say the company still controls the
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:14.800]   keys this is a direct uh um direct negation of the new york times report that we still control
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:19.520]   the keys that protect the data of its chinese customers then apple has used its most advanced
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:26.880]   encryption technology in china more advanced than what it used in other countries although
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:32.160]   and by the way it's against american law the u.s as long prohibited american companies from
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.760]   turning over data to chinese law enforcement but there may have been a loophole because
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:43.040]   under the new setup according to the times chinese authorities don't have to go to apple
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:50.720]   to get the information uh they asked the gcbd a chinese uh authority for apple customers data
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:56.480]   the data center is run by china and apple believes that gives it a legal shield from american law
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:02.320]   according to a person who helped create the arrangement so i i wonder if apple's playing
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:07.680]   semantic games here rather than they have to that's what the lawyers will tell them to do
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:15.760]   but then i guess the the big question comes from right now as we stand today how many consumers
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:20.880]   are willing for for apple to win this line the way that they want them to win this line because
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:27.600]   they want apple to win everything are willing to pay let's say 30 more for every apple product
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:32.080]   because they could get it produced somewhere else the other thing is right now as we speak
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:39.520]   who else has the skills to generate the products at the level of quality that they're being created
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:45.920]   right now it takes 10 15 years to run that quality up in a different country you just can't pick it
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:50.480]   up and move it i mean i would say japan and korea have it they don't necessarily have the space for
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:56.720]   we don't educate our kids like that so we are far removed from getting that far up
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:02.480]   i remember they tried to come back to arizona and it failed miserably and if you watch that
[01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:07.920]   special on netflix where one of the chinese factories tried to build up in michigan somewhere
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:14.000]   and it failed miserably because we just don't have the same type of work to family
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.280]   like ethnic like it's hard to describe but you know we we have too many rights and freedoms
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:24.400]   which just doesn't match for that type of factory working i don't want to say anything
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.160]   dumb but you'd have to see the doctor meaning to understand what i mean because we have feelings
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:33.120]   and emotions and i have rights and that kind of kills productivity sometime so like who right now
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:38.560]   besides china could apple go to if they can't you say they could just pick up and leave like name
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:45.120]   a country i'm curious i'm not i'm not saying that it would be an easy move for the make for oh first
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:50.080]   well i'm just i'm i'm i'm simply talking about uh the area in which they're talking about
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:56.080]   regarding privacy as a basic human right if they were to simply say guess what we can't we can't
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.160]   sell the live phones in china anymore we can have we'll certainly still have the manufacturer there
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:04.720]   but we can't sell them anymore because at this point there is a line that's been crossed and we can't
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:12.080]   we can't uh we can't have all these deals and that is an excellent point and that is actually i would
[01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:18.640]   posit that as a problem apple more than almost any other tech company is so dependent on chinese
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:25.200]   manufacturing that they have been working with india right it's going to take a while we're years
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:29.920]   and it and and one of the reasons for for india is that india actually has laws saying hey look you
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:34.080]   can't you can't sell these the stuff inside our country unless you're manufacturing in our country
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.960]   as well um this is but one of the things that we've sort of uh that the entire world uh of
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:43.120]   manufacturing has kind of learned in the past years that it's a bad thing when all of your
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.600]   supply when everything is being manufactured by one country you kind of want to make sure that
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:52.960]   you're developing capability in different countries all across the well all across the globe uh and
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:58.720]   i think that uh you're it will take years for that kind of capability to be matched even in south
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:04.800]   korea even in vietnam even in tai land even in india but we're not going to ever get there if we
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.280]   don't ever stop if we simply say that well what are we going to do i guess we're just going to have
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:14.560]   to keep doing whatever the the chinese government says no matter how horrible uh it is i mean there
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:20.160]   this is not the first time we've had this kind of conversation about apple we're okay i guess that
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:24.560]   i guess that we're not going to we're not going to be uh releasing this app we're not going to have the
[01:44:24.560 --> 01:44:29.040]   new york times app in here we're not going to have this app that's uh that mentions the dali lama we're
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:34.080]   not going to have this app that uh puts this country in the in the wrong column uh but we are going to
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:41.040]   allow apps that actually support military operations that do bad things to sit to the chinese citizens
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:45.680]   these are these are again i'm not saying that this is what this is why apple is going to be you know
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:51.920]   pulled up before the hag tribunal or anything like that i'm just saying that we have to hold we have
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:45:01.200]   to if we're not going to at least demand uh apple resist or take action against uh a situation where
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:08.400]   they really don't have the ability to dictate their own terms we can't be so uh i don't know we can't
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:12.080]   have such low standards that we're going to say oh well it doesn't matter we understand apple we
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:17.600]   can you have no you have no other alternative but to simply play along with this when again you could
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:22.960]   you could apple if you really felt that this was a bad bad situation that that you didn't like if
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:28.320]   what again the these comments that you're making about the privacy being a fundamental right if you
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:33.280]   thought that that was 100% sac or saying for all people you could just pull out of china you have
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:38.480]   that ability you're not doing that so i'm not saying that we should be we should be really really uh
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:44.720]   attacking them about this but we should note that this is these this is something they can do and
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:50.320]   they're not doing don't let them off the hook for this is my feeling yeah i would really love to see
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:55.520]   them spin up a whole brand new educational process that would allow the stuff to come back home
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:01.520]   but i think we're just so far removed with where education system works and things like that
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:06.400]   and i speak from experience because i went to college in japan like when we got there the most
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:11.120]   disheartening thing was they go okay everybody will see you in class tomorrow
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.800]   tomorrow like american kids you guys don't have to come to class and i was like hold on wait a
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.800]   minute pump the brakes what do you mean and he goes oh you guys only go to school five days a week
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:23.520]   and i was like yeah but we're here to learn you know the japanese way so we're going to school
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:27.680]   all six days and they're like no we're told by your chancellor at your university
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:32.560]   you guys can only go to school five days a week so i literally had the call back here
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:39.040]   and yell at the universal white tester is like don't send us in country to have the in-country
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:43.600]   language learning experience and then tell us we only get to go to school five days and besides
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:48.320]   the kids from the other 38 countries look at us like we're a bunch of losers so i'm putting my
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:53.360]   foot down we're going and i just get fight with my classmates but at the end everybody was happy
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:57.760]   that we did it because we learned much faster but it was weird like they just thought like we're
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:03.520]   too dumb to be in school for six days a week and that was kind of painful you know to take that but
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:10.320]   what happens we're gonna take a little pause and come back with your picks of the week gentlemen
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:15.360]   so i'm gonna say rene richies pick of the week was a 24 inch i'm back in purple
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:21.520]   they look pretty i think doc rocks pick as well we'll find out what your picks of the week are in
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:26.880]   uh in just a second you're watching mac break weekly with Andy and ako and doc rock
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:34.000]   doc said he's gonna make his pick of the week be uh Alex Lindsey Worthy is it expensive go ahead doc
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:38.080]   i was not it's not it's not that expensive it's a little bit but it's a little bit
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:45.920]   what is it pick of the week okay all right so here we go i want to pick this thing here it's
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:55.120]   known as a nanlight pavo to to see and the reason why i've got it let me grab it nan light from nanlight
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:48:02.320]   us.com it's my vibranium light um this will do it will do all of the colors it's a little
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:07.520]   please right now right or a little purple it's purple but it's kind of hard to see it's um really
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:13.920]   light it only weighs about a little less than a half a pound is magnetic so you can stick it to
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:21.840]   things like that it has a quarter 20 on both sides and typical of these type of lights it has about
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:28.240]   let's say 20 special effects like police car paparazzi lights explosions you can do myriad things
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:33.840]   um currently it's telling me that i still have about six hours of battery left on it and it's
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:40.160]   already been on for more than the last two hours um it's just kind of incredible it does have a
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:44.640]   sleeve that you can use to make it waterproof right now i have the strap on it but you can use the
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:49.680]   quarter 20s to attach it doesn't have is it a flash as well or is it just a continuous light
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:55.440]   it's just a continuous light but i was doing some tests yesterday like for traveling this is so
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:49:00.000]   light this is going to go in my bag and if you go to the hotel and you can't get a good light of
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.800]   course if you wear glasses you don't want to put it pointing at you so what i did was all my two
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:10.000]   monitors here i draped the towel over it and then i put it on a tiny tripod and i put it on
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.440]   like medium brightness bounced the towel back to my face the lighting was beautiful soft lighting
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:21.360]   and i was like this is incredible how i got here is because we all run out as like well i'm just
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:26.640]   going to put you know hue lights in the back to get this lovely color and then i realized one
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.080]   thing a lot of people if you're a content creator try to stay away from anything other than video
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:37.840]   lights because eventually it'll start to roll and you can't stop it i could not get any shutter speed
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.640]   to catch up with that light it was just wrong the timing was off video lights don't have any
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:48.400]   flickering so eventually you will end up replacing all your stop gaps with an actual video light
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:53.440]   because i guess there's a time where the current changes a little bit just enough to cause them
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.200]   to flicker so my hundred and fifty dollar phillips lights were useless in camera uh you know what
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.640]   i mean yeah what is it the play the phillips play the two little yeah i have those hooks yeah
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:09.680]   yeah just my whole scene the last two videos is all flickering oh crap so i just have to forget
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:16.160]   it get get these that's how led's dim is instead of actually getting dimmer they just flicker slower
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.760]   you can't say flicker but that's effectively dimming the camera can see it the camera sure
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:28.240]   does yeah i put this guy on this is at one percent there's still no flicker so it does dim but they've
[01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:33.600]   done it somehow so it's not that's nice most of the things that are oriented for video light so
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:39.280]   your aperture brand your nano your west light you know the things you have in your studio most of them
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:44.480]   have figured out special controllers in the cob lights the circuit on boards that they use to
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:50.000]   generate the light they are designed specifically not to flicker whereas things that are designed
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.480]   for house decor it just doesn't have that built in because they'd be expensive anyway these are
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:51:00.880]   really cheap at you know a ninety bucks a piece and i bought a set of twins um so that way a is
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:06.160]   portable but in the studio they'll just be decorations for the studio but if i do need to go out
[01:51:06.160 --> 01:51:12.640]   it's so light and durable and magnetic e and quarter 20s i mean like it's very utilitarian
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:19.280]   how much is it carry on eighty nine dollars oh that's nice the nan light from nanlight us
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:29.600]   dot com pavo pa vo tube two six seat ten inch six watts RGB ww led two with internal battery
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:33.920]   currently they got their naming convention from motor roller yeah i know they're all do this is so
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:39.120]   funny it's so funny this looks like a very practical useful little video light is it bright enough
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:46.320]   to use uh so singly or do you need a couple oh no it is crazy break it's like just under
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:50.880]   twelve hundred looks if you want to know that's right that's very bright is bright is all
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:56.000]   saying yeah i mean seriously this is that one percent right now if you wanted if you wanted to
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.400]   pretend you're being chased by the cops just put it off camera and put it in the police mode and
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:07.840]   yes it does have that too i personally i don't like that i wonder why
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:12.720]   doc rock i always like having you on thank you so much for taking some time to spend with us
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:20.000]   i really appreciate it doc rock doc doc no dot youtube.com/docrock do you have a docrock
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:26.800]   dot com i had it's docrock tips dot com because somebody's been squatting on the domain since i
[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:31.840]   don't know like chirp two thousand poor chirp i never get it i hate it chirpy chirp chirp
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:39.840]   and of course uh he is a brand ambassador for e-cam and we love the e-cam so you're doing a good job
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:46.800]   andy and i co what do you got for us this week uh something very very simple and fast and cheap
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:51.600]   uh someone on twitter asked me about hey i've got a microsoft word i keep having to type in all
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:55.600]   these like mathematical symbols and stuff and is there like a shortcut or is there like a tool
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:53:00.960]   for doing it and it was a good time to remind people of a feature that came about come about and uh
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:06.880]   in makowus but kind of recently just if you just go down to the edit bar edit menu in any app and go
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:12.240]   to emoji and symbols and you basically will get a palette of yours all the key all the symbols that
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:17.760]   are inside the spawn right now and if there if there are symbols that you use quite frequently
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:23.040]   and you don't have to remember that okay the double integral is control shift alt command
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:30.000]   uh smiley face shift p option uh you can just like find it inside the character viewer and then
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:33.760]   just mark it as a favorite and now you've got a palette of like all of your favorite symbols and
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:39.200]   you just click it and it just simply types in wherever the insertion point is is one of those
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.480]   things that you know so it's actually a lot of things on max that you and i have been using for
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:50.880]   years and people go what you can do that yeah so i don't i do it's good to remember that not
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:54.640]   everybody knows everything and it's good to remember those things and tell them talk about them once
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:59.120]   in a while yeah exactly because even i was like oh i think i've seen this really cool utility that
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:02.800]   would automate that so well actually let me i haven't actually used like the character palette
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:06.240]   the character viewer in a while does that have oh actually no that has that has exactly the
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:10.640]   features that he's looking for okay good just you've already got it as pre-installed you don't even
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:15.360]   have to go to the control panel in order to activate it or anything like that uh and yep it's
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:22.160]   it works out pretty well for everybody i mentioned my pick of the week before but i wanted to reiterate
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:25.600]   it because it's gotten better and better and better it's still in beta which means it's still
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:33.680]   free if you use Alfred or if you use spotlight or if you use uh remember what was the the original
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:39.520]   one of these god i can't remember the name um is as obdive is obdive that's right that's the website
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:43.520]   i can ever i i switch to alford so i forget what is it called well let me tell you quick silver
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:48.960]   quick silver that was what started at all right you might want to look at raycast this is a brand
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:55.200]   new open source project that i think has now eclipsed to Alfred as the most compatible powerful
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:00.160]   replacement for spotlight for the command space you can map it to control our option space if you
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:07.120]   want raycast.com and right now it's free but what makes raycast very interesting is there are
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:14.960]   a huge number of extensions for a very large variety of things raycast by itself does so many
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:22.880]   things uh i mean i i think even maybe more than alfred app does that i would take a look at this i
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:28.480]   know and he doesn't like to add these uh device these tools to i don't have your bravery that's
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:32.320]   that that's what i'm saying i don't have your guess i don't have your your swagger yeah i understand
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:36.560]   because also you say well and i use a mac that doesn't have this installed i don't want to have the
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:42.720]   you know my my finger memory to be uh confused but i tell you what i put this on all my macs i just
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:49.920]   find it super super useful it's one of those things where you feel like you will not get 10%
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:56.800]   of the use of it you just you know because it has so many things it works with uh and by the way
[01:55:56.800 --> 01:56:02.480]   chiefly scripting which means it can do anything you want to do alfred does this too but it's a
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:09.920]   little easier on raycast raycast.com and it's absolutely free right now uh very powerful and we're
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:17.360]   starting to see a pretty rich variety of extensions being developed by third parties for it as well so
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.840]   you know alfred's great i love alfred i've used it since they started way back when
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:31.280]   but this might be this is quite an up and comer uh and and that's cool yeah rivals quick silver for
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:36.880]   it's a variety of of capabilities so worth taking a look at anyway raycast and you can map it to some
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:40.800]   of them i think that's cool you know like the thing we were looking for was launch bar that's
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:47.200]   what launch bar popular but even before that quick silver which was a big deal yeah that was the
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:55.760]   oh no i have a question how how close to alfred can you get um raycast because what happens is i
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:57:01.280]   love viro so i'm going to have alfred on everything but i do have machines where you don't have alfred
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:05.600]   and so if i could put this and get it close then you don't have the problem and he's talking about
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:11.040]   right because it's mainly the the keyboard i'm sorry not the keyboard the clipboard memory
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:16.880]   game changer very important i hate the fact that it's not built in yet and probably just a quick
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:21.680]   launch of things like those are the two that i use the most it has uh it has clipboard history of course
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:26.400]   does all the quick launch stuff but a lot more uh than that clipboard history is built in you can
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:32.160]   search it which is nice for text images links and colors that you copied previously you can pin
[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:38.320]   frequently used items to access them quicker it has floating note notes so it has some very it's
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:45.040]   actually it's it's it's a because it's an open source tool there's a lot of developer stuff
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:51.840]   involved uh it does light mode or dark mode it's a little bit more spartan than alfred uh alfred
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:56.240]   looks kind of more like a mackish app this looks like you've got some sort of power tool running in
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:03.440]   the background uh i and i and as i said honestly it's it's one of those things where there's so much
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:09.520]   depth to this you might not use all of it but one of the things you can do is you can uh you can use
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:16.480]   command k to find any action in the app so you can quickly find if you think it might do something
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:23.360]   you can quickly find what it what it will do it it integrates with g-suite and uh jira and zoom
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:28.240]   and so that's nice you could just say you know start a meeting and do it from you know command
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:34.320]   space there which is on us in there i think the scripting is really the secret power the hidden
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:38.880]   power color picker and i bet you there's an emoji picker in there too or a special character
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:43.040]   picker in there too i wouldn't be surprised anyway i just want to mention it i've mentioned it before
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:50.160]   but since i mentioned it last it's really expanded into a whole lot of power uh very interesting
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:56.800]   thank you every body great show i'm sorry rene had to run but it was great to get him on
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:59:02.960]   doc rock you're always a pleasure thank you for being here yay thank you andi and anaco the
