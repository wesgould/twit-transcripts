[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   Coming up on Mac Break Weekly, I sit down with Andy Anotko, Renee Ritchie and Alex Lindsey,
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:13.600]   while Leo is off gallivanting around CES to bring you the latest in Apple and their place at CES,
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:22.320]   the FBI asking Apple to unlock iPhones again, Apple winning Christmas and a brand new high
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.680]   on their stocks, as well as so, so, so much more, including that poop emoji on your AirPods.

[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:42.240]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Leo Laport is out this week because he is on the ground at CES,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.200]   hopefully not getting the conference crud, but I blessedly, blessedly so happy. Got to keep my
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.680]   feet firmly planted here in Petaluma, California, away from the handshaking and all the other germs
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.960]   that are involved with Las Vegas. That little chuckle you heard is Renee Ritchie of Vector,
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.600]   iMore, Mobile Nations, Future fame, all that and so many colors and beautiful lights. Renee Ritchie,
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.400]   how the heck are you? It is so good to see you, Micah. Mutual friend and actually co-host of the
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.640]   show, Lori Gill sent me a picture of Leo in one of those little segue egg chairs just looking so
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.680]   happy last night. So that's how I'm going to picture them for the rest of the show. Yeah. So Leo is Dr. Eggman.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.640]   I guess that makes Lori Tails and are you Sonic? Well, maybe maybe I don't know one of the nemesis
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.360]   is obviously Georgia Dow is Knuckles like there's nobody else who could be Knuckles. I'll be one of
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.800]   those little what are those little Tamagotchi type things that in Sonic. I don't remember. Oh,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:56.080]   I'll be baby Sonic who doesn't know about TikTok or Ninja joining us as well across the internet
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.440]   and to my far left is WGBH's Andy Anotko also with some great color some great light. How you doing?
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.200]   I'm doing very well particularly because I'm not at CES. I'm like the secretary of
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.480]   agriculture that they say, okay, we have to have one journalist that stays 3000 miles away from CES
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.800]   so that if God forbid all tech journalists get disillusioned at the same time,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.400]   someone will still be around to talk about the sort of sort of stuff. That's the that's the big
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.320]   disaster when we realize that this is all just a terrible terrible PR stunt and that segue has no
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.280]   intention of ever shipping that egg shaped chair ever. They just wanted to get the B roll the A roll.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.840]   We are happy to have Andy Anotko as the designated survivor joining me right here in the studio
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:50.320]   is Alex Lindsey of Pixelcore and I'm very excited to see your take down of the live videos you're
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.400]   talking about. I decided that next week I'm going to release I'm going to release a new
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.560]   tear down because I've just had it like I've been watching so many things and I've just reached
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.080]   a point where I was like I had to start doing this again. So I was so I I'll start doing them next
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:14.160]   week and some of the CES keynotes were great fodder. Yeah, I love to see this. This is why this is why
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.120]   all the news shows need to have like a white panel to get different opinions and takes on things
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.880]   because like you should be on like the Sunday news shows because like you'll have this one person
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   who's gonna who's gonna be talking about yes but we don't understand is what the economic
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.400]   things about the world war three are going to be the second the other one's going to be saying
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   yeah but you don't understand how that how that totally destabilizes the political scene
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.200]   that Alex is like let's talk about the frame rate on the live feed when the president announced the
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.520]   missiles. Yeah, all I want to all I want to do is see Alex circle both the the AMD pitch for using fan
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.720]   renders of the Xbox and then the Samsung pitch for using the Apple icons for wallet and I think both
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.760]   of those just draw those up into whoopsies. Yeah, they there was a lot of examples of things not to do
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.600]   and I can't wait to learn all of them. Now, I'm more is doing us all a great service this week by
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.920]   cataloging and documenting all the things that CES is bringing to us from from Apple. So all of
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.160]   the Apple related announcements there's an ongoing document here so that again we don't have to get
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:26.880]   the conference crud but we get to learn a little bit about what's happening. Now Renee Apple is at
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:34.400]   CES this year for the first time in quite a while but they're not there in the capacity of having
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:43.120]   some big stage where they are showing us the latest from Apple. What is Apple actually doing at CES?
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:49.040]   So I mean Apple hasn't like Apple hasn't had a booth at CES or hasn't had a keynote in CES for
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.280]   as long as people can remember CES. They've always sent people there like buyers for the
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.680]   Apple retail store. They go and see what products they want to put on the shelves just like Best Buy
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.160]   and the others do and Apple marketing people are there to see how like home kid or health kid or
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.280]   other partner stuff is going and to help them out and talk to them and and catch up. But this year
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.440]   Jane I don't know if it's Hoth or Hoth. I might be pronouncing that wrong so I apologize but she's
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.520]   Apple's director of privacy and she's going to be there giving a speech on privacy which you know
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.800]   is Apple doesn't usually join into these large speaker movement things but I think they believe
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.560]   so much in privacy and advocating for privacy. Last year Tim Cook gave a speech the European
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.680]   Council on privacy and as much as I love them putting up billboards because then if they ever
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.880]   make any mistake whatsoever we can say you idiot you put up a billboard now live up to this.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.040]   I think it's much more functional for them to actually have people talking about their values
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.920]   and ethics and the importance of privacy and security at these events.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.360]   And I bet that Tim Cook is saying you know what I'm so glad that I decided to attend the
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:02.240]   Golden Globes in person. Speak on CES. Lord have mercy. The executive who recommended
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.000]   that to me and booked that table for me is definitely going to be getting a fruit basket.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:15.600]   Well not a fruit basket AF fruit cake basket. That was that was rough huh. I have to admit I
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.520]   did not I don't really watch any of these award shows but I saw plenty of the conversation there
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:28.800]   on Twitter so Ricky Gervais. You might know Micah from a little show called The Office.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:35.920]   Okay but see the UK version of The Office. I don't want to get into it. I bear fans out there
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.120]   of that horribly sad and devastating show that is the UK version of The Office. It's so grim
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:50.800]   so dark just like Ricky Gervais can be. Anywho he basically took the time to not only roast
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.200]   Apple but also talked about how no one wants to hear the opinions of celebrities of which he is
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:05.840]   one sharing his opinion as a celebrity. So from his iPhone. Yeah that was it was he did make it he
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.840]   did make it he was making a joke but was one of those oh crap don't make that joke. So if you're
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.760]   listening to the audience where he was saying that look you're all going to be coming up here
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.440]   and talking about oh oh oh human rights oh oh. Meanwhile like you're working for these streaming
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.240]   companies that are just total bastards and pointed out that I don't know if the joke was but
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.080]   pointing out that I said I said I said I call your agents if I had a streaming had a streaming
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:39.040]   channel and called out oh dear it was like and called out the Apple's streaming service then you
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:46.640]   see cut to Tim Tim like sitting at his table like yeah that smile on his face and then the
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:53.120]   Joe and then the joke comes that that the Apple's using like child labor in China and of course and
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.800]   that they didn't cut back to him to see it going oh what a what a witty jape that was no but they
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.960]   kept cutting to Tom Hanks who had like the the best reaction shot yeah in fact like you can
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.480]   believe what he was hearing Tom Hanks reaction shot was shared with me by several friends in memes
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   that had already been created in the moments after that had happened and he was trending
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.280]   went along with it he was like the speech was trending Tom Hanks's reaction. You know I think
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:30.000]   the casting of yeah wow this guy is off the rails. That is so great. That is so you know you
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.800]   got to realize this is genius you're press organizations there's a lot of you know tense
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.280]   between the press and then actors there's a lot of tenseness yeah a lot of times so if you were
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:48.320]   press and you just wanted to kick the crap out of actors what you do is you create an event
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.720]   and you offer them little little things to hold on to and some TV time and then you bash them
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.440]   but you don't do it you don't as press you don't do it you sit in the table and you look at him
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.600]   go I can't believe he said that you know like like this is saying I can't believe in alcohol
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.440]   right like they were all they were all drunk I can't believe the actors show up for this like
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.840]   like I can see why why some of them go well I was sick you know who was yeah you know like yeah
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.360]   like I'm not I'm not I'm sorry couldn't you made it there I think there's there's gonna be some
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.320]   point if they don't get rid of him I think this is his last year I mean he says that every year but
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.320]   I think this is really the last year I don't care it's my last year I don't care yeah exactly well I
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.120]   think that this one really is his last year I think that people are gonna stop stop coming in and
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.720]   you know well but that's what I'm sorry getting all I'm gonna say is that it is reference to
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.560]   sweat shrubs you know it's it's always great to hear from people who have never actually created a
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.080]   company talk about how to turn a seventy billion dollar train a little bit you know and the fact
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.280]   that Apple is working on this every single you know all the time you know to prove that and the
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.520]   fact that the technology sector in China has brought most of the country out of poverty so
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:55.680]   so let you know like it's not perfect and neither was our growth in the United States like we have
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.440]   that we have this thing like everybody has to now be the way we are not looking at the fact that
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.840]   we did a lot of ugly stuff and beat up a lot of things to get where we were to so everybody's got
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.960]   kind of a growth curve that everyone's going through and China's going through that now too but you
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.040]   know that I always think when people make that comment I just there's a little check of yeah you've
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.160]   never actually created a company that made anything so so we don't hear from you okay well
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.760]   well he did he did like make the office which is like making products but wait wait I just want to
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:31.760]   say making products and making words are completely different things you know and and they are not
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.680]   anywhere in the same world of each other in the level of logistics that's required to put them
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:41.120]   together is not at all the same you know so so the someone who makes words shouldn't tell someone
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.600]   who makes products how to do that unless they unless they've actually done it that's all uh
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.720]   totally disagree but what the well but what I was what I was going to say was just that
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:59.680]   I kind of cringed at it because like you said uh apple is doing a lot more than most companies are
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:06.160]   they they most companies are saying that they care about hey there are laws and we make sure
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.880]   that our subcontractors follow those laws we have audits and stuff apple is actually putting skin
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.720]   in the game and they you when you follow up the question with okay but what are you actually
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.800]   doing to make sure that that's happening proactively apple can say here is what we're doing
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:24.560]   proactively and then you're like oh yeah exactly well so my reaction to that joke was wow I can't
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:30.800]   believe he said that what he really could have been saying things about how apple is cozying up to a
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:38.080]   kind of unstrung uh for a domestic leader and also is kind of cozying up to foreign uh foreign
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.760]   leaders who are maybe not unstrung but maybe doing things that are contrary to values and
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:47.200]   what are you doing leaving amazon alone because what what frustrates me is that amazon is all
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:54.720]   all these there's ooh ooh google ooh facebook like how about amazon that's basically selling
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:01.120]   selling like surveillance systems to uh federal federal law enforcement trying to encourage
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.840]   uh domestic domestic surveillance systems to local law enforcement they're selling cloud
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.600]   computing services to pretty much anybody who has an evil thunder machine that needs powering by
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.480]   by by uh by really powerful computing like just make i just want to make sure that if you're
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.000]   throwing darts that one of the people blindfolded and nervously clicking on a cigarette is amazon
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.040]   just pesos needs to be up there on the on the firing line as well he's been he's been he did
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.720]   include him in his credits he's been extremely good at staying out of the limelight for the
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.520]   most part which is no he wasn't included in the isis comment though he did say apple and you're
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.920]   all being paid by apple and amazon and disney and if isis created a streaming service you have
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:47.440]   your agents call it tomorrow again sent from his iphone because he's part of the problem yeah but
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:52.320]   disney the worst thing that disney has done is taken the star wars franchise and just turned it into
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.640]   another block block buster that's not a human rights thing that's more of a disappointing old
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:03.600]   people at argue they didn't even do that successfully yeah disney they're kind of
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   you enjoy if you enjoyed the movies i'm so glad you enjoyed it i'm not saying that you should not
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.440]   have enjoyed it i'm just saying that i know exactly the box office didn't do as well as the
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:17.200]   precedents though it seems to me that there's a certain fall off well disney may not have that sort
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:24.080]   of uh overt issue they kind of own everything and continue to just scoop up more and more and more
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.680]   well they've gotten that makes me a little genius move by the way like the
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:31.520]   the you know disney didn't start with everything they started with their own products which was
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.000]   fine but the idea that they when you look at the trajectory you understand why some ceos get
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.800]   paid on money i got some point you figured this out and then quietly bought you know pixar then
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:49.840]   marvel then lucasville the lupids you know it's exactly the so i was but he saw but he saw what he saw
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.400]   he saw was and a lot of us talked about it 20 years ago i mean we could see what was going to happen
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.480]   which was that we're going to stop going to movies this way i mean a lot of us were writing about it
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.520]   and talking about it 2005 you know like we could see this trajectory of you know people aren't going
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.920]   to keep on going to movies if their screens get this as good as they're getting at home you know
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.920]   it's not going to make sense you know and so and the the movies that you will go to are going to be
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.960]   adventure movies that are cinematic and big sound and big because that's what you want to see
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:23.120]   is bigger than your than your at home what they're not going to go to is romantic comedies you know
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:30.000]   and in kids' ways and so so what what they did really well was pivot and say we're going to just
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.640]   Hoover up all the things that you'd want to see in a big on the characters and stories and they're
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.520]   and it's paying off yeah i think i think when the when the smartest things it wasn't just
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.080]   understanding streaming but understanding that this really is going to be about international
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:50.320]   marketing and so if you can buy coke by writing a check if that's for some for some stupid reason
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:56.160]   Coca-Cola is willing to sell this amazing international brand it doesn't matter what you put in the
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.600]   bottles you will make a fortune so it's and in a corporate sense and this is not meant to be a
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:10.080]   dig this is just a simple business the the most likely organism the most likely people to take
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:17.440]   something like marvel superheroes or or star wars or any of those properties and make massive
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.200]   massive profits on it is to is to divorce it from the people who really created it and have emotional
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:31.760]   investment in it because you can see i don't think that there will be a marvel movie that tries to do
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.360]   what the Christopher Nolan Batman movies did or what the Joker movie did or promote a character as
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:43.600]   interesting as Deadpool which of course was from the old regime or or Harley Quinn because
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.320]   there's a certain person's gonna say no no you can't you can't have the Joker doing this or
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:55.200]   yeah i see i know that it would be kind of interesting to have have an event the six of
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:02.960]   about going a bad tangent but yes it would be it would be fun to have the the Hulkbuster armor
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.280]   suddenly make an irrational appearance but actually the story that we're telling there doesn't make
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.160]   any sense whereas Disney someone who just bought it saying there's a we're going to make a billion
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.520]   dollars we this is a this is an attainable goal for every superhero movie we do part of it is going
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.760]   to be we're not going to do anything to get china angry with us we're not going to do anything that
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:26.800]   will do that will make it harder for for younger people to see these movies so we're not going to do
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:34.560]   anything that's even a soft R or R or hard pg pg 13 those are the people that can take a franchise
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.840]   and really make sure that you you put you put you put you put three or four hundred thousand
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.480]   dollars in you take one point two billion dollars out and you get to do that three or four or five
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:54.320]   or six times a year i do want to do a pivot here uh still oh still about ces still about apple app
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:01.360]   and and you know apple related stuff at ces let's talk about the bridge pro plus this is a new
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:09.280]   keyboard from the bridge folks um i and leo i know for sure both have the bridge pro keyboard that
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:17.520]   essentially turns your ipad pro into what looks like a little macbook um it's kind of heavy it's
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:24.800]   made of aluminium and has a great little keyboard on it with a backlit screen but now bridge is
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:32.160]   coming out with the bridge pro plus which includes a trackpad so this is fascinating uh in in the
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:40.560]   latest version of ios you can access in the accessibility settings a way to actually use a pointer
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:47.680]   with your device so that could be an external mouse or a trackpad and in the case of of bridge
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.720]   they've created both a keyboard that has a trackpad built in and a separate bluetooth trackpad that
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:02.000]   you can use with your ios device interesting stuff i'm just curious how everybody feels about that
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.560]   because for some people it's like oh but why wouldn't i just get a macbook and i'm wondering
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.160]   when everyone's take is here at this i think laurie's review is already up with it she was
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.320]   she's been testing it for a while and she she had it for a bar though and i think she really liked it
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.600]   we tried to dare her to just do all of ces on the ipad pro with the bridge keyboard but she was
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.720]   leaving the next day and she's like i really want to but if anything absolutely anything goes wrong
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.680]   i'm gonna need a backup i don't know what she did ultimately but i think like i've always advocated
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:33.520]   for an ios clamshell i think there's a lot of and i know apple has them internally they've been
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.400]   testing them for a decade internally but i just think the laptop form factor is so classic and i
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.960]   totally get the ipad i think it's a totally separate thing but just the idea of an ios device
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.280]   even for kids in school or just people who travel a lot and they don't need all the stuff that's on
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.200]   os tan almost like a chrome book play where it's like 80 percent of the stuff that 80 percent of
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:56.880]   the people need 80 percent of the time super light battery life goes forever it's completely sandbox
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.720]   environment so nothing will go wrong enough to worry about downloading things and you can just
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.960]   use it and apple so far hasn't had any interest in making that but i think it's really cool that
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:11.280]   there is finally you know like markdown asterisk finally asterisk alternatives from third parties
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.000]   that include not only the keyboard but the trackpad because for me it's never been about oh you have
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.440]   to have a screen you have to have a touch screen you have to have a keyboard it's like i don't
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.160]   want to move my hands my hands are super productive where they are stop making me change modes because
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.360]   when i change modes i lose track of what i'm doing and it hurts me and this just lets you keep your
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:33.920]   hands there and work and i'm so i think a good example for me is omnigraphy which i use a lot
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.560]   and so i build all my diagrams for how i'm going to wire things in omnigraphy i can't do that on the
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.920]   ipad so i have omnigraphy on the ipad but i can't do anything that detailed because i can't do that
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.200]   with my finger in the middle of it when you have a lot of high frequency connections i can't put
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.880]   my finger over top of it and still see what i'm doing in the in the whole interface of how you're
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.560]   going to click on that and how you're going to do it still have to go back to a computer to do
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.800]   that and i think that's a good example of in a lot of creative stuff whether it's photoshop
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.600]   or illustrator or omnigraphy you're going to see things where you cannot get it you just simply
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.240]   can't do it effectively even with the pencil olympics what even with apple pencils don't like
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:18.400]   it's just the way the interface works on and because it's set up for touch it just becomes this very
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.240]   heavy thing and to be honest with you i haven't tried tried it with the pencil so i'm going to try
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.440]   now that you've said that i'm going to go back so i i don't know i just know that um for a long
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.400]   time the problem that i had was like i couldn't um you know i can do basic i could do with certain
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.840]   kinds of diagrams on the ipad and and i would prefer probably 80 percent of the time now that
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:43.120]   i'm outside of my house um i'm i'm on my ipad i don't take i don't take my laptop anymore
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:50.880]   um it sits as a little controller for my my switcher so um so i i still need photo the real
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:55.600]   photoshop um you know um and i need a couple of the things that are that are still on the laptop and
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:01.840]   some some of the heavier stuff but when i'm leaving i generally go i kind of sandbox my life in a
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.440]   lot of ways that if i'm going to do heavy work i'm going to do it at home and i'm going to when i
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.000]   go out i'm not taking that because i do like the fact that it's much more secure it's uh you know
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.480]   everything's been backed up if i lose it it's not that big of a deal you know like it's a big deal
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.080]   but it's not the thing that i worry about with my laptop all the time is that oh there's a bunch
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.400]   of stuff on it you know that that i you know that i'm pretty good at backing up but i like the fact
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:28.000]   that the ipad kind of forces me to keep it all in iCloud and not worry about it and i think this
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.520]   is a really cool step forward i don't i don't know whether when i saw the announcement why are my
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:41.440]   glasses so wonky oh well uh the uh i'll just i'll just step listed with my with my head like this so
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:52.240]   it doesn't anyway hey john can you rotate his uh view just like um no but uh yeah i totally agree
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.200]   with mary there you go oh does he now he's seeing the curse of having a background that has vertical
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:05.920]   and horizontal lines that's like god damn it uh but yeah uh there's uh apple has done a lot of really
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:11.440]   bold and wonderful things with the ipad in which they are insisting correctly that this is a real
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:18.160]   computer this isn't just this uh amazon did some cool things with a fire where for 50 dollars you get
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   a color hd tablet that you can happily let your kids in the backseat of the car watch their movies
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.320]   and play their games with because if they break it
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:32.080]   again go reach in the glove box by grab another one out of the pile of 10 that you bought during
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   black friday and hand them another one uh apple is making the case though that this isn't immediate
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:40.960]   device this isn't just for reading books or apple news this is for this is a real computer that you
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:47.200]   actually do real they don't they don't want to say work but you actually are pro-productive on
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:54.080]   and as much as as much as the the computers of the future in the movies uh imply that oh well no
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:58.720]   like you can tell this is a future computer because there's no keyboard well the thing is we've had
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.880]   we've had keyboards for since since the 60s and the 70s and people are still using that for
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.120]   data input we've not found anything better we found out that maybe if you have some sort of a touch
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.760]   device uh a pointing device that's a good thing to add to it but you still need a you still need
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:20.960]   a keyboard uh and the but the the promotion of of the bridge to say for those of us who really are
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.320]   using an iPad uh as a I'm outside of the office this is as much as I need but I still need to be
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:31.360]   able to write stuff and get through it get through an inbox I want a premium experience with that
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:36.640]   keyboard it's it's nice to have a super super thin like keyboard cover that's great for portability
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.880]   but if I really am saying I'm going to be taking this one computer with me because I'm going to be
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:47.680]   going going for the weekend I want a premium experience and throwing in a trackpad is uh when I
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.720]   when I read about this it was such an it I had it was one of those lean back stroke you put on the
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:58.240]   fake beard and stroke the beard moments because uh bridge makes a whole bunch of these keyboards
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:02.880]   for a whole bunch of different computers they make the uh the official uh the official sort of
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:10.560]   really cool keyboard touchpad uh trackpad solution for uh for Google's uh Google's uh pixel tablet
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.880]   device that they've now decided that maybe wasn't such good idea after all so it's not as though they
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:21.360]   had to acquire a company and figure out how to integrate a trackpad into this popular device
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:25.120]   they they simply took all their understanding probably a lot of their tooling and simply said
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.520]   great we're going to throw that into an iPad uh iPad keyboard as well so I don't know whether that
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.720]   was just them realizing that you know it wouldn't cost us a whole lot of money to just simply come
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:40.720]   out with a trackpad version of it because now that there is some sort of trackpad support not only
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:46.880]   would it help for people who actually use those uh use those assistance uh features for the reason
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.520]   for which they were they were originally designed but also there are people who don't need them but
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.760]   want to use them why don't we why don't we just do that anyway uh as opposed to do you have they
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:04.560]   had certain conversations with certain people inside of apple that led them to believe or were
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:10.640]   directly led on to say that perhaps it would be very very good for them to have a product like this
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:17.520]   already on the market boxed and on apple store shelves before october or september of this year
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.720]   shall we say uh is is do they do they are they taking a bet the track that real trackpad support
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:29.920]   for ios is coming or is there's a or at least is inevitable uh in any event for again for those of
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:38.000]   us who you have to understand outside of the apple market there's a i paid $1,100 probably
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.280]   something like that for for my from my ipad pro i love it i've gotten so much value out of it
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.440]   but that's but if i took that budget and said well what what can i buy if i simply wanted to have
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.320]   a computer for outside the house for for long weekends and stuff like that i could have bought
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:00.320]   a regular i could have bought a kick butt chrome book i could have bought a very very good mid range
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:08.880]   mid range windows 10 device uh those of us who invested in ipads and use it because we like them
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:14.640]   it's just another way for us to get that full value out of it because like rene said taking your
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.480]   hands off the keyboard stinks it's terrible it makes me feel as though i'm unloved by somebody
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.920]   and perhaps even done at the same time i would love to have touchscreen on my on my mac like
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.880]   yeah exactly the reason i use that you know a lot of the stuff when i do reviews when i review
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.080]   documents that are coming to me or if i review um you know a lot of times i get graphic stuff that
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.480]   you know interfaces and so and so forth that i just mark up i take that on my ipad i want to do
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:44.400]   that on my ipad i want to circle things and draw on things and write on things i don't want to
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.720]   type it up or do some weird little square or you know all of those things are things that i don't
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.880]   you know like it so that it's what's crazy right now is that apple doesn't give us all of one thing
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.400]   or the other right i personally think they're not giving us a touchscreen on the on the mac because
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.920]   it'll hold us to it for longer because it would kind of fulfill what i needed
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:03.200]   well they just don't have the resources they like they would have to take people off the ipad team
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.040]   to work on the mac and they don't feel like you know like that like microsoft did that and they
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.520]   went through windows seven and windows eight before they got out on the other side with windows 10
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.080]   which is i think like 99 percent of the way there but if apple's already shown that you know they're
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.480]   they're they pay very little i would argue with not enough attention to the mac as it is and if you
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.600]   start pulling people off to do um touch implementation that's a couple of years of work but the thing
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.840]   they already have a you know super successful top rating system it is but i as a user
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:34.560]   i don't need them to fix anything on the touch stuff i just need them to put it in i've got
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.440]   the thing is is that i just need them to put it in so that i can because if you touch if you put it on
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:44.880]   if as you use your ipad as the second screen and you you touch stuff there it works fine like i
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.480]   like i just know i'll know i'll know where to use it not to support right like what's on the track
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.280]   pad just like let me swipe let me tap let me i have the new surface i have the new surface laptop i
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.800]   just want to be able to draw right i have the new surface laptop and it has a touch screen
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:03.760]   as part of the experience a great keyboard it's it's well designed but it makes me now quite
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:09.280]   literally before the show began i went to reach out with my finger to touch on the notifications
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:15.840]   bar on my mac to try and turn on do not disturb mode uh it it has me thinking that way and yeah i
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:22.080]   would love to have in those cases where it made sense the ability to do so um now i want to say
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:27.840]   you said earlier it was uh and you were talking about how you want them to if maybe it's a bet that
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:34.080]   they will offer real support of track pads or other pointing devices on ipad two things i found kind
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:40.160]   of fascinating i was talking to rosemary orchard on ios today yesterday which was published this
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:48.000]   morning and she uses a mouse a logitech mouse almost exclusively with her ipad with a keyboard
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.680]   and not only is she able to use that mouse by the way the little assistive touch square you can set
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:58.720]   it to not be on the screen whenever you have one of these external pointing devices there so it
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:06.160]   doesn't get in the way but also each of the extra buttons on her mouse can be configured to do
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:11.040]   different things so she can actually run shortcuts on her ipad from her mouse which i find yep i think
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.960]   that's a really deep implementation already that they have it's just with there's this little um
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:22.160]   mental block almost where it's tucked under accessibility settings so it doesn't have that
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:28.240]   same root uh feel where it's a you know it's a pushed feature and i don't know i didn't seem to
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:34.480]   do it but we've we've we've talked about this before uh when one of the i love these uh the best way
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:39.920]   to do a pro feature like for not for the 80 percent of the users but for the 20 percent of the users
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:45.200]   is to put it in a play put it on a shelf where only the people who really want those kind of
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:50.480]   features will find it because they're gonna find it if there's a way for me to edit a document on my
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.520]   ipad with the precision of a mouse that's where i i do have like a mouse connected to every single
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.320]   desktop i have because when i'm doing editing when i really need to push move text around there's no
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:07.120]   quicker way to precisely select text and move it around uh is to so instead of having a a feature
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:13.040]   first sort of implementation of a pointing device simply say there is this feature in the in settings
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.680]   and if you click this on to this way uh then you're going to be able to access and won't be
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.960]   for won't be information through apple you'll get it off of imore or another really cool like a
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:27.360]   site that tells you how to do things on the stuff that you paid for uh here is how to do the people
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:33.520]   who need that sort of stuff is are going to find it and it's it's kind of shocking that i every time
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:40.320]   that there there are times when uh i i have had like it was i've had a big deadline or a big project
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.600]   that i had to get really push the push the status forward on on a day that was if you know what i
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:50.880]   mean a holy day of familial obligation where there's absolutely no way you're getting out of this
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:55.760]   your relatives from from eastern europe are visiting and the whole family's getting together
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.360]   there is no way you're even going to be able to come late because that way everybody on everybody
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.600]   even remotely associated with the family is going to realize that oh i guess he doesn't put family
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.800]   first and that's going to and they're going to they're going to talk and so on those occasions i have
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:20.400]   i will say great i'll here's my phone here is like a actually here is a a a portable ish keyboard
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:27.120]   that lets me type type type type type really really well and here is a mouse and if you hook up
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:33.280]   the the idea of having a phone that you also are using a mouse and a keyboard with is i can actually
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:37.920]   get most of the experience that i want because yes the screen is really really tiny but i can type
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:43.200]   as fast as i want i can when i really i'm again i'm really under pressure i suddenly realize that
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:47.120]   these three paragraphs i started with have no point they need to go or they need to be moved
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:53.360]   and it's such it opens up this thing that it suddenly stops thinking you stop thinking about this as a
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.880]   pocket-sized multimedia and internet device and you start thinking that no this really is a computer
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.400]   i can do anything i want with it i'm only limited by the tactile interface that obviously they can't
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:10.800]   put into the main device but the idea of being able to buy a bog standard bluetooth keyboard and
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:16.560]   simply pair it and suddenly a mouse pointer appears where there was no mouse pointer before
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:21.520]   and you realize that this is not bad if they if they had advertised this as a revolutionary feature
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:27.360]   that they're that you should buy an iOS device because of this pointer maybe you'd be disappointed but
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.800]   if you are used to not having a mouse pointer of any kind you'd be thrilled with it so this is
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:38.560]   i love these kind of features where the pro the pros will find it if you put it in there you don't
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.800]   even have to publicize it because again there are people like lory and organizations like i'm
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:49.040]   more that are saying chat your your your your mission for the next three days is to simply
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.720]   screw around with this new feature that we saw and documented at wwdc that we have a hunch could
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.280]   be exploited in a really wonderful way and if you can't that's fine but you're here you're here to
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:05.120]   spend three days pushing every button using every option on the keyboard you possibly can to see
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.440]   how well this can be exploited we will find it if you build it they will come and i think the next
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:19.280]   step is for developers i think it may be having a mouse mode so wow i took rene's suggestion and
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.640]   jumped into omnigravon and i know i couldn't i couldn't use the ipad so um but the reason
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:31.840]   for that is specifically because the selection points are fat finger size not uh selector size
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.920]   right and so it makes it really hard for the number of connections that i would need to make
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:41.920]   it make it very hard for me to actually um work quickly and so what i would need from omnigraphal
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:47.120]   as an example but i think this is uh relatable to many applications is that i would need omnigraphal
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.480]   to have a quote-unquote mouse setting which is hidden somewhere and you just go into the
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.480]   things a mouse setting and it makes everything all the selection points smaller it gets you back
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:01.120]   into a kind of a laptop experience um and there's lots of places where i'd love to be able to go back
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.280]   and forth or i'd love to be able to you know do it but but being able to maybe even get back to
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.160]   some of the same keystrokes and and so on so forth um in the ios version that you'd see in the
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:17.840]   mac version kind of helps us kind of pull pull all of that together well put um i think that's
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:24.240]   going to cover it for stuff at CES for now there's plenty more on the way uh as as CES
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:31.440]   actually kicks off uh but until then um let's talk about the FBI which is back at it again
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:42.720]   uh asking asking apple to unlock an iPhone um of the suspect in the Pensacola naval base shooting
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:50.320]   so we have uh again the FBI reaching out and saying uh we could use your assistance in unlocking
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   the cell phone for the report or for the you know investigation that we're doing um this of course
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:02.720]   is the the shooting suspect uh so why is it my question is why is this public because as far as
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:08.480]   i know the FBI asks this all the time like apple gets requests all the time they document how many
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:12.720]   law enforcement requests they get so i'm just curious why it's not a complete one i think
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.560]   this is completely a political move by the FBI yes they have a soft target that is going to make
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.800]   people feel bad and this is a good example for them to kind of keep on pushing their little case
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.480]   along you know this is why they're doing that this is has nothing to do with i mean you're
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.880]   you're absolutely right rene there are plenty of these requests that go that that go by but because
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:35.440]   this one has a lot of press they're now going to bring it up um and they're going to ignore the
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:42.560]   fact that the NSA can't even keep their own secrets secret yeah it's it's a they need a
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:48.880]   law enforcement needs a portfolio of case studies of here's what here's what we were not able to
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.160]   accomplish because these uh because encryption on these devices is on by default and there's no
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:59.920]   backdoor for us i'm sure i'm i don't want to sound cynical i'm absolutely certain that uh
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.600]   as as rene said these requests are routine and the FBI is doing it through the proper channels
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.560]   they aren't just simply bullying apple in the press they get they got a court order they certainly
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:16.320]   have a case where the data on this on this phone is very pertinent to to the case that we're developing
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:24.160]   however as a as another benefit i know i'm sorry i don't want to say benefit is probably tasteless
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:29.920]   but i think that law enforcement is collectively is also very very aware that the more times they
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.600]   can say that we were apple apple did everything we did everything we could legally we did everything
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:41.440]   we could by by approaching third party contractors or experts have the stuff we had the full cooperation
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:47.600]   of apple in terms of what they could do technically and we still could not get into a phone uh that
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:55.200]   is uh belongs to a suspect uh in a really really horrible shooting uh and if this person was uh
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.960]   was influenced by other people or uh or uh part of a group of people we need to know that even
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.520]   under these circumstances we still couldn't get all that data this is why we need to change the
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:11.440]   world so that we so that government has a backdoor into phones so that is again i want to say that
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:16.480]   their first their first objective is let's get data on this phone so that we can a make this case
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:21.120]   against its individual and also make sure that if there's information on that phone that can be used
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.240]   to prevent further violence we can do that but there's every single time there's a case like this
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.160]   it gets put into that file that says the next time we're before congress or the next time we're
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:35.520]   trying to uh we we think that there's an opportunity uh to sort of twist arms and make this happen
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:41.920]   we're going to use this as a to the side the legal reasons by the government we think has a right
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:48.480]   to insist that corporations not allow people to have uh encryption on that uh that uh the government
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:54.480]   cannot break and and let's be clear that government has an incredible amount of data now
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:02.080]   like it is like it is the the the level at which they can see what we're doing um is at a level that
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:06.480]   has never been in the history of the world you know they're like you know so they have an enormous
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.520]   amount of data and they it's like having they went from in 1990 they probably had a little 320 by
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:16.960]   240 screen now they've got a 4k screen and they've got one pixel that isn't showing up and they
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.760]   just desperately want that one pixel you know and and the thing is is that it is uh they have this
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.680]   in incredible amount of data they have all i'm sure that they have all the metadata from that
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:30.080]   phone so they know every day every one that that phone knew from the time it was turned on to the
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:35.360]   time that you know that that that's all that's all there um they have and we'll notice that the
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.640]   sambiran you know there was a lot of press about them wanting to get in and then they got in and
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:44.000]   then there wasn't a lot of press about anything that they found right so because it didn't turn out to
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.400]   be not to be anything there because if you were if you were a terrorist you wouldn't leave that on
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:56.880]   your phone you know so the thing is is that is that the um so the the problem is is that the chances
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:03.120]   of it really turning out to be um uh there it there's probably not a lot there there is the
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.440]   is the problem and the second problem is is that most of the data they needed they have
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.720]   you know in in in metadata they just don't like the fact that they can get they can't get into
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:18.080]   these things and again as an american society we make decisions of freedom over top of security
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.640]   all the time that's why we don't have facial recognition in san francisco it is because we've
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.440]   decided there is a lot of places you know and i will argue that san francisco is laying the
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:33.600]   fingerprinted at earth yeah but but san francisco's law that says that we can't use facial recognition
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:39.040]   puts more people at risk than apple's iphone block any day of the week and we've decided that that's
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.520]   acceptable i'm not arguing with san francisco's law but i'm saying that it's impact on people's
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.240]   actual day-to-day security of someone having a chance of being mugged or killed or robbed or
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:52.960]   whatever it's much higher when you don't have that when you have facial recognition in san francisco
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.520]   they could get to a point where there's very little to no crime if they wanted to turn that on all the
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:04.880]   way um but the uh so it would be much more secure to have it but we've decided that people's freedom
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:09.600]   is more important than that and that law has way more impact on us on a day-to-day basis
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:17.360]   than than apple's iphone thing yeah exactly just just like it would be it would it sounds horrific
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:23.760]   the idea that uh that uh government and law enforcement could simply and demand to enter your
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.560]   house and look at look at anything that you have inside that house but a warrant that they could
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:34.720]   essentially grab anybody they want to grab without any cause uh we do the reason why we they can't
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.000]   do that is because again a few hundred years ago a whole bunch of people decided that that would be
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:45.440]   a bad thing to let the government do we've just gotten under the under the thumb of a government
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.960]   that is we thought is too powerful so we're not going to let that happen uh and as alex said a lot
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.680]   of a lot of things would be a lot of the world would be a lot safer if that happened but that
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:01.440]   the cost would be way way too great now uh i do want to say again i try to i try to check my own
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.840]   cynicism and i'm not describing anybody else's feelings here but my own that you do you have
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:16.000]   uh yeah a smart criminal covers their tracks but number one not everyone is a smart criminal
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.960]   we're not to one of the biggest problems with domestic terrorism is not that there is a huge
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.600]   kydra-like organization that is making plans and carrying out orders and training people in
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:32.320]   spycraft it's that there are people who are releasing videos and creating facebook channels and twitter
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:37.360]   feeds that are trying to influence idiots into doing horrible destructive things and those people
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.200]   certainly are going to make mistakes and certainly are going to be leaving data behind and secondly
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.800]   even if they don't you you have to you have to search the car you have to search the house you have
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.560]   to if even if you don't think anything's going to be there you have to at least check to see if
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:56.400]   anything like that got left behind and that is the sort of thing that we are i that i am willing to
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.600]   say that yep it would be great if there were a backdoor into these devices because it is kind
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:07.760]   of scary the idea that i that i or anybody else could make up these meticulous plans a beautiful
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.960]   powerpoint uh or keynote spreadsheet uh keynote document that explains exactly how the master
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:17.120]   plan is going to work to make sure that everybody in my cabal are going to be exactly where they
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:21.920]   need to be and doing what they need to do and so long as i encrypt it i don't have to worry about it
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:28.320]   and that's a scary thing but like uh Alex says i've i believe it's really important
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.360]   important principle i believe that if we were able to explain to the founders of this country the
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:40.320]   people who create the bill of rights that should we just basically create a fundamental statement that
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:46.880]   says that a citizen of the united states has the fundamental right to keep a secret from the government
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.760]   i'm sure they would have gone i'm sure they would have gone all over they would have been all over
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:56.880]   it's oh great okay 11th 11th uh 11th uh amendment to the to the constitution however they didn't so
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:02.800]   now we have to talk about this as uh as a more uh not as as an abstract principle but as here is
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:09.280]   what is costing us to not have the ability uh to get into the secrets of individual uh citizens
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.880]   that's a it's a principle thing and i'm not against for anything i'd have i want to make sure that
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.440]   the go ahead go ahead running sorry tell us the only one answer that is that for a lot of people
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.560]   the our phones have become our secondary brains it's the closest thing we have to external cybernetics
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.320]   and one day that stuff is not going to be so external and we have to be real careful that we set
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:31.280]   the precedence for privacy now because eventually the ability to know everything that we're doing
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:36.000]   not just based on and everything around us but a lot of the stuff that's interfacing with us is
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.360]   gonna literally feel like my like arthur c clerk mind reading um and that's where i'm nervous
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.760]   about because once you make encryption illegal anything that we do in the future that involves
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:50.800]   you know like elon musk and hawkins jeff hawkins everyone's making these companies that stuff is
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.640]   gonna need to be protected too and i'd rather not sign away my rights before i see how far this
[00:44:54.640 --> 00:45:01.680]   technology goes anytime you and and you know i have to say that any anytime that you uh write a
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.000]   contract or anytime you work out a contract with someone you don't write it based on how you feel
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.960]   about them right today right you know you you write it based on if you were afraid of where
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.280]   where this would go where do you set the limits if someone else like for instance if i make a
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.080]   a contract with another company i think about well if someone bought that company and there's a
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:22.880]   bunch of people now running up that don't that i don't know and there are a bunch of you know
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:27.360]   rap bastards you know like you know like like with will this contract protect me you know and
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:31.920]   that's how you think about that in the same sense our government's doing okay i mean i i know
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.080]   people are upset about a lot of things i get that but in general if you if you travel around the
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:42.560]   world the country's doing better than most so you know so so it's you know it's it's doing okay um
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.600]   it could get a lot worse you know and and the thing is is that giving up all of this right now is
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:52.160]   not necessarily sure it's working now but 10 years from now 20 years from now 30 years from now
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:57.040]   when as rene said when we set the precedent of that you know it is we have to be careful about what
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.200]   we the the power we give the government and we only have to look at china to see where this you know
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.160]   where the end can go they're about they're about a decade two decades ahead of us you know in that
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:12.480]   in that surveillance level and yeah and and so the so the issue isn't it and again i'm not
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.120]   against surveillance i'm not against metadata collection i'm not against like all of those things i think
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.520]   it's the reason that we can go we can walk around in the united states without i mean i work in countries
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:26.480]   where there are security for every house there is walls with broken glass across the top of them
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.040]   there is dogs and and electric you know there's all kinds of things that are required there's guys at
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:36.000]   every corner with with uh submachine guns like that's i mean i work in a lot of places like that
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.680]   relatively often and so i i'm clear of what happens when you can't get that data and the reason that
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:46.480]   we don't have that here is because we have that data so i'm not saying that we shouldn't have any
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:51.040]   surveillance and i'm not saying that we should you know we should box up the nsa or the fbi i think
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:57.200]   what they do is why we have the way of life that we have as americans but we do have to set limits
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:02.000]   and we have to understand more importantly than anything else that they can't keep their own secrets
[00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.680]   how are they going to keep ours you know creating this backdoor we forget about whether the government's
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:11.040]   going to do it it's all these cities that get shut down because someone broke in that's nsa code
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:15.120]   you know like that's our own code being used against our cities and so the thing is is that that was
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.040]   the most important thing that they had and they couldn't keep it safe and so why would we think
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:23.360]   that having a backdoor was going to be isn't going to open something up that is going to be horrible
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.840]   yeah but what you what you said about contracts is really is really spot on
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:34.400]   because you never the thing is you you never when you're in a place of safety and comfort and
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:39.280]   security it's hard to imagine not being in that place of comfort and security they're things that
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.480]   when things are stable for a great long great the great amount of time you forget that it's
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:50.960]   possible for it to destabilize that i'm only using this as an example i'm not using this as a political
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:56.720]   statement or anything but i would never if if you would ask me ten years ago that do we need to have
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:04.720]   something do we need to have a plan in place for if someone is uh is doesn't is not if a if a sitting
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:11.760]   president is either impeached uh remove from office or elected out of office or comes to term limits
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.080]   but that president decides that well i'm not leaving because the work that i'm doing here is way too
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:22.240]   important i'm going to invalidate the election i would say okay look that might happen in those
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.680]   lesser countries but we are a greater nation no we're not it can happen it can it happens by
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:32.160]   degrees and suddenly you find yourself what do you mean that we have no what do you mean that we have
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:38.480]   no way to secure our data uh from from us from a a uh a government that has the ability to simply
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:44.960]   prosecute any political or thought enemy of the current regime uh it could happen definitely
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.440]   within my lifetime and this is why we need to make that stand for uh some things that are really
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:55.920]   important folks we've got a lot more to talk about uh but before we get there i do want to take a
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:02.240]   quick break to tell you about health iq you're doing everything right for your health today you
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.120]   exercise four more times per week and you get a minimum eight hours of sleep on average basically
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:11.840]   you're ensuring a longer life but if you're not planning for the what ifs of tomorrow and it's
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:17.200]   time you do see health like you use is science and data to secure lower life insurance rates for
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:24.800]   people like you you can get one million dollars life insurance from thirty six dollars a month
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:29.920]   the health conscious have overpaid and subsidized those who are less health conscious it's not a
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:34.960]   conspiracy it's just how life insurance works you might be healthy but does your insurance company

[00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:36.720]   alrighty let's talk about apple and stock and apple and earnings and apple and you know this is
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:40.880]   uh evidently they're on the ropes i hear yeah yeah you know they're not doing so hot right now
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:46.240]   analyst who says they're they're they're they're amazing though that like a year ago literally a
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:50.400]   year ago on january i think it was january second or third tim cook put out that letter saying that
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:55.280]   iphone prophets were not what they expected especially in china and that for i think the second time in
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:00.800]   the cousin in the company's history they were gonna restate earnings and boy did like the doom and
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:06.720]   gloom set in fast and then literally one year later to the day apple crossed three hundred
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:12.000]   dollars a share for the first time for the first time yeah i saw you tweeting about this rene uh that
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.120]   yeah you know that there was that oh boy we're gonna call in with um we're gonna let everybody
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:23.120]   know that we're probably not going to reach the earnings goals that we had and now they close north
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.520]   of three hundred dollars and i don't think the stock is like the bellwether for everything like
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:32.240]   it's not like it's it's an it's an indicator for wall street and a couple other things i don't think
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.640]   it's an indicator for us and the company writ large and where apple stands and where they're
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:43.040]   it's a very different sort of metric but it does shed light on just how savvy tim cook and luka
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:47.920]   my street have been in navigating not only the headwinds from foreign currency exchange
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.240]   not only the tariffs which have you know been hanging over them like the sort of damocles all
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:57.600]   year not only the chug the chinese market and the blowback from huawei and all those other stuff
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:01.920]   but they've they managed to navigate it so well that the stock cost across that are record high
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:07.760]   just one year later and i think you know as much as tim cook gets gree for not being steve jobs
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:11.840]   he seldom gets credit for being a really really good tim cook yeah i know that's that's one of
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.960]   the things i want to talk about their rene you say that you know this is not necessarily an indicator
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:23.040]   for those of us who don't exist in that analyst space well there is an indicator that the company
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:29.840]   is doing well for those of us who exist in that analyst space and that is that apple uh has nine
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:36.880]   of the ten devices of the top spots for mobile device activation in the u.s over the holiday
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:45.440]   uh week so between i think it's the 25th christmas day and the 31st the uh eve of the new year apple
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:51.440]   has the nine uh nine out of the ten top spots the 10th spot goes to i think a walway device or
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:58.480]   it's just show me i can't i don't recall uh what the the graph shows but uh nine out of the 10 top
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:06.960]   devices are iphone devices yeah that that 10th spot is the shao me uh shao me me uh for lt e
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:12.800]   uh the rest of your hand i yeah yeah what's going on there uh top one of course is iphone 11
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:20.480]   followed by i think of course the iphone 10 are and then seven eight and so on that is uh pretty
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:27.120]   wild i mean i i guess it's not wild in the sense that in my mind it's to be expected but i think that
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:34.400]   when we look at the sort of analyst stock point of view that can make things a little confusing
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:40.320]   a little muddied and this to me is speculation based right right exactly yeah and they also made
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.960]   money like the samsung and apple in the u.s a lot of people immediately say but you know china and
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:50.160]   yes great there's an entire world out there all of us have traveled we all know that um but in the
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:55.440]   u.s according to again another metric company and they can vary wildly in the quality widely in the
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:59.600]   quality of their of their metrics but samsung and apple were basically the only ones making
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:06.320]   money again in the u.s market were there any i i think you were about to say something Alex you
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:11.440]   recall what that was um well i think all i was gonna say is i don't know if i think that
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:18.240]   steve jobs got the company to where it was i mean made the turn built it up built the products put
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:23.520]   that together i don't think he could have navigated this as well as tim cook you know of the challenges
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:28.640]   that apples had in supply and and expansion and dealing with politics i don't think that steve
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:32.560]   would have had any interest in talking to trump you know i think that you know he'd be just like
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.200]   well we're gonna do our thing and they're gonna do their thing and i don't want to talk about just
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:39.600]   seeing him on twitter would have been amazing oh my word seeing with the gold globes would have been
[00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:45.280]   wow i guess i guess i guess pixar really really is doing that deep fake thing as a live stream yeah
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:50.480]   yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's uh and there's there's nothing that's uh that's more uh uh
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.080]   recreational as opposed to practical than talking about what was what was steve have done in a
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:58.800]   certain situation but i have a hard time thinking that he could have correctly navigated uh the shift
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:05.840]   to services as well as tim had because uh i it's not as though they weren't doing any services when
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:10.480]   he was around it's not as though the five years after he passed which is usually the time frame
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:16.560]   which we think about things that steve probably knew about and with and had his opinions on but
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:22.720]   the idea of let's start our own tv channel he was big on the intersection between engineering
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:27.040]   and liberal arts but i'm not sure if he would have thought that this is part of apple's focus i
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:31.760]   could i could have seen him i think a lot of ways i could have i could have seen him building a
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:36.080]   separate company for that well i i'm not sure if we would use the apple print for it i think the apple
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:44.320]   music contract or the apple music legal uh constraints put of steve in a handcuffs you know he wasn't
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:47.680]   allowed to do music you know he was allowed to distribute it but he wasn't allowed to
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:51.840]   until they bought bought their way out of that for a long time with beat with the beatles they
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:56.480]   weren't allowed to do their own their own thing you know and and they kept on to be fine with
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:00.160]   your music and so on so forth but i think that that was one of the things and i think that it's a
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:04.080]   mistake i think one of the things that that there's an interview with jimmy iovine i think last week
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:09.520]   that talked about the fact that all these streaming services are all commoditized and and everything's
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.520]   all you know and i do think that apple should be much more aggressive and i'm wondering whether
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:18.640]   their contracts currently with with record labels keep them from doing it straight out but i think
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:24.640]   that apple should be you know basically uh building bands up you know like they i don't understand why
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:29.680]   they don't do exactly what they're doing with apple tv plus or with what netflix does and just
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:36.080]   start you know signing bands directly to apple to apple music i mean i i'm i'm very surprised that
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:40.080]   they haven't gotten aggressive about that i'm my only guess is that the contracts that they have
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:44.000]   with the record labels to distribute the music precludes them from actually getting into the
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.960]   house with some videos right that was one of the stories that helped with videos and
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:50.960]   videos that they also buy exclusives which the the exclusives that they're buying for those
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:55.760]   essentially pays for the entire production of the record so uh so that those exclusives when
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:00.320]   they get like the first three weeks of a of an album or the first two weeks or a launcher or a
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:06.240]   month or whatever all of those things are helping to make them special at the beginning there but
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:11.040]   is not you know and i don't think they can make these deals the new deals with like a tailor
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.640]   swift or someone like that but because they were they have already have a big market they don't
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:19.760]   need apple but for smaller bands i think that there's a there's a lot of opportunity to sign them
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:25.440]   on and put them on as as label you know as their label or some kind of exclusiveness that lasts
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:31.520]   a year or two years um and and help pay for their and i think in a lot of ways it could increase
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:38.080]   the amount of creativity that we see in the music industry because you're basically taking away
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:41.760]   some of the performance needs for the for the band members as well you know in the same way that i
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:46.640]   think that arcade take allows a whole set of games that we wouldn't normally see because you're
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:52.320]   worried about uh retail value um when you're trying to build an entire group of things that
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:56.400]   people are just listening to i think you could do a lot and i think that again i think both spotify
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:00.240]   and apple are probably limited which is one of the reasons i think spotify is going after podcasts
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:08.560]   in kind of a yeah hamfisted sort of way yeah very hamfisted um so speaking of music oh go
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:14.160]   ahead Andy oh no no i was i was gonna just echo amplify Renee's comment that i think that sometimes
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:20.160]   the stock price it can be a it's it's the lifeblood of a company can sometimes be the live a liability
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:25.280]   for company like apple because it's the crazy expectation among analysts that it has to keep
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:30.080]   going up up up up whatever expectations there is it has to just just meeting the expectation
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:36.080]   is a sign of trouble it has to be exceeded uh and whereas apple would have a lot would have a lot
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:40.880]   less oh my god why are we why do we have to have a comment on this as a company that we have to say
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:45.920]   that oh no oh my god we only made a kajillion dollars when we should have been making a kajillion
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:52.560]   dollars uh it's it's the we but we we don't it's it's the idea of the health and the prosperity of a
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:59.120]   company is very much an analog decision and we don't like to it's hard to explain an analog thing but
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:03.920]   a number is digital and wait this number is larger than that number it should have been this much larger
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:08.560]   than that number well the hard part that that all of these silicon valley companies have uh you
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.840]   know in a very competitive environment between the companies all in silicon valley is that um the
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.480]   stock price holds on to the employees and if that stock price starts to slide it becomes you know
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:23.120]   you start losing people and and one thing i've learned over the last decade is how attached those
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:28.400]   employees are to those stock those those stock values so um you know you you can get into a company
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:34.000]   wide morass i i think that apple's a little less susceptible to this um but you can get into a
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.680]   company wide morass if your stock is falling all the time people are thinking about it all the time
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.800]   they're they're looking at it all the time they're thinking about something and it changes the way
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:47.360]   that they think and so a lot of what an executive team has to do is figure out how that stock price
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.840]   either stays where it's at or slowly moves up at each and this is why it's so important this is why
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:57.200]   you do stock buybacks is not so that investors get money back it's the the primary investors
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.640]   of stock buybacks benefit that the company's worried about is there a hundred thousand employees or
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.120]   fifty thousand employees that all have stock options that will be um upset if they if those
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:10.720]   things start to slide backwards and then they'll go work for facebook or they'll go work for google
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:15.040]   and and so so the you know so they're always you know a lot of employees are looking at that at
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:20.720]   that kind of growth um the growth of their value as a key piece of why they're there i saw they
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.760]   buy their houses all the rsu's and things like that it's immensely valuable
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:31.120]   uh so speaking of music you know what my airbags are missing they're missing
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:37.840]   i left one they are missing oh no not the blueberries they are missing a little poo emoji on the front
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:43.040]   of them i believe i want to know oh no yeah so are you reordering are you reordering you know what
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:48.320]   maybe i will darn it you just want to the case you just order the case by itself and he and he is
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:54.560]   disappointed um no no no i just like where are we gone there's nothing that there is nothing that
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:02:01.760]   illustrates for me like the cultural generation gap i get for me then if people if people think
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.680]   that the poo emoji is like funny and they like it green some joy i'm glad it brings them joy but
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:15.200]   for me it's like why do i go to like uh why do i go to a wall green so i can see like a a chocolate
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:21.280]   specialty treat that's shaped like crap why would i i don't understand the use of today and their
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.600]   flare trousers and their beep up music imagine it's bacon and each the imagination is a bacon emoji
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.640]   there and then everything will be right in the world again but bacon and feces are two totally
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.720]   different things i will pick any emoji that's near and dear to your heart that's true yeah so
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:40.080]   goes on your airpods what's interesting is i kind of thought that uh this is a little off topic but i
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:44.960]   kind of thought that the poo emoji was a thing everybody liked uh in not not everybody like but
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:50.720]   i mean in my generation everybody poops but not everybody likes the poo emoji in my generation and
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:57.040]   younger i thought that that was the case and i was at um a holiday party recently where uh they
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:04.560]   handed out they did a secret santo with uh with ornaments and someone had made one of those like
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:10.960]   bacon clay and bake type uh ornaments that they you know made out of i don't know what goes into
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:15.680]   it salt and flour and stuff and baked it and then painted it brown and it was the poo emoji and
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:21.200]   everybody was like oh that's so awesome you got the poo emoji and the person who got it who was
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:29.440]   around about my age was so devastated and disgusted and and angry almost that she had gotten this
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.080]   poo emoji and so it kind of like reset my brain there a little bit where not everybody's into the
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:41.920]   poo emoji and that's totally fine uh but all of this is to say that apple has updated its sort of
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:50.640]   font library i guess to offer engravings of certain emoji on airpods cases so before you could get
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   your name and you could use normal letters but now there are some emoji that you can get including a
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:04.720]   dragon emoji um a smile i think the peace sign is also available i love you is available um a
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:10.320]   a fist and of course the uh ever loved ghost emoji and of course as you know that there are
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:14.160]   sort of plenty of services that can do much more interesting things on you know so true as far as
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.520]   leisure i mean i would never get any of those i'd be like i'm gonna design something and then i'm
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.480]   gonna go ahead and get your own custom design i get is like i get a zucchini emoji when you can
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.880]   get the real thing oh my god subtly be damned where are the air horns
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:35.600]   you know that's all that there is to say about the other than i'm curious uh the engraving option
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:42.720]   has been around for some time for different devices what is the last apple product if you've
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:48.400]   gotten in ever gotten engraving what is the last apple product that you had engraved rene i'm starting
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:53.040]   with you i have never had one engrave because i always think that i'm eventually gonna pass it down to
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.480]   a family member or friend and i don't want i don't want to mark it up and they have to inherit it
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.960]   so i always keep it as pristine as i can for just in case i have to give them away or when i give
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:12.480]   them away the last one i had engraved was an ipad air no and i wait was the two an ipad air uh
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:18.000]   whatever was the second generation of ipad i had a regular ipad two yeah ipad two that one i had
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.120]   engraved with my name on the back the coolest one i ever saw was um christina warren's ipad
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:30.080]   and it said cmax ipad on the back of it but i haven't gotten anything engraved since then for
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:38.480]   the same reason rene andi and not go have you ever engraved in uh apple product uh no but i just tend
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.840]   to like if you go on if you go on to ebay there are people with really really good vinyl cutters and
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:49.200]   they will they have like symbols for everything so i tend to get a rebel alliance symbol on the
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:55.520]   sized and colored the way the colored red and put it on that thing it really is it really is
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:06:00.640]   important for things like airpods because uh it's you're going out to lunch with people you're
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:05.200]   hanging out with people or you're having a guest over for the weekend or something and suddenly
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:10.720]   and suddenly like a day later like you put in your ipad you're about to put in your ipods you
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:14.880]   realize that i don't want to be gross but this does not look like my earwax
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:23.440]   oh we must have switched ipods ipad earpods so you need to have some sort of identifying mark
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:29.760]   i'm horrified now but um i don't want to think about comparing earwax you don't well you need
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:34.800]   you need i'm saying you should look at you should look at your earpods before you insert them because
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:39.120]   maybe you need to clean house in there get a wooden toothpick and just clean house that's all i'm
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.920]   saying mine are always immaculate because i'm constantly grossed out of that uh Alex linden
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:49.120]   what's the last device you had engraved if you have never never the same thing is that i usually
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:53.920]   my i'm the first person to own it but i will definitely not be in my in my company it's you know
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:59.200]   it would go out to to other people or in my family it'll go out to other people but i'm usually
[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.160]   not going to be the last one uh to to have it so i don't want to put a put a mark on it and also
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:09.600]   most of my uh at least my my phones go into this is you know a case and then there's a screen protector
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:12.960]   they're kind of like in their own little cocoon so there's not really any reason for me to put
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.800]   anything on it because it's going to be packed into something else anyway is that a battery case
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:23.840]   it's not this is a wallet oh oh that's a nice oh magnets so and it doesn't affect the magnetic
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:29.200]   stripe it doesn't and not only that you can roll it over like this and then it wow now that's
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:35.040]   pretty cool this is uh the scene or the vena i think vena um i think i recommended this at some point
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:39.680]   but this is what i found this is a complete side thing but i think i talked about this before what
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:45.440]   i found is i lose my wallet or i lose my phone but i never lose both right so i by putting them
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.960]   go long it also limits how many credit cards you have because i have my driver's license and two
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.680]   credit cards that's it and it does look like a typical wallet card because i don't like wallet
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.680]   uh case i mean wallet case it doesn't look like a typical wallet case because i usually don't like
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:02.080]   those i had one that was a wallet case and and when i was in nigeria i set it down for a minute and
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:06.400]   a and a guy walked over and he said don't ever do this again he handed he handed it to me he stole
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:15.200]   one of my cards oh so it was a good i was impressed by the by the style in that in that process but um
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:19.440]   i'm curious i'm curious how many you can't back my phone and said don't ever do this again like
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:24.240]   don't leave your thing out but he taught me a lesson by taking uh one of the cards so anyway so it was
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.680]   hard to get back into the hotel so anyway but the um uh so anyway so that's i but i yeah i don't
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:36.320]   um i put a lot on my laptops i generally have a some kind of case i think in my most recent laptop
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:41.200]   had lego like a lego case on the back that i can do things with and i usually like do that and then
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:46.800]   put stickers all over them i mean i don't i don't like marking up my uh my stuff in general i don't
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:53.760]   have any tattoos either in case i'm barely aware of shirts with logos so like it's kind of like
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:59.520]   there's i'm kind of a non markup kind of going he's not branded yeah mica i'm curious did your
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:04.960]   curiosity get a get ahead of you or your germophobia and did you end up smelling for the blueberry
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:12.000]   i never smelled i saw it and i just didn't want to honestly rene i don't like being disappointed
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.440]   and i was i was worried if i smelled them they weren't going to smell like blueberries
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.840]   and so i have not and i'm not i can't i can't do it i can't smell mine and they smell like ozone so
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.680]   i i think you were smart yeah i just i don't want to be disappointed by the way
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:35.280]   toothbrushes work incredibly well um for cleaning out the hair parts and uh can i offer
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:41.520]   one you're using for your teeth i was about to say whenever whenever i whenever i toothbrushes
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.280]   are really great for cleaning lots and lots of stuff that's that but that's why i do take a
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:50.640]   like a little hacksaw and i cut the handle in half to to visit as part of the visible user interface
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:55.680]   that this is not a further this is not for san this is not sanitary this has been used on bicycle
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:10:01.280]   chains and things much worse than bicycle chains i i have other needs for toothbrushes with metal
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:07.280]   that requires lots of getting into lots of little details to to clean something and um so i have
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.160]   lots of toothbrushes there are also uh by the hundred and amazon of course for like nothing
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:19.280]   yeah and amazon also i mean every every place does i found that um the device is specifically
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:24.400]   made for hearing aids for cleaning hearing aids are great they usually have a wire loop on one side
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.720]   and a brush on the other and the wire loop is good for scraping room yes scraping we'll leave it
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.040]   at that that is a great way to put that it is useful to do it often because otherwise stuff goes
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:39.680]   through the screen which is what the thing that i loved about the edimotix was the edimotix has a
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.240]   removable filter so you'd be able to you could basically in the edimotic headsets you could pull
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.720]   it open and you have this little screw tip device and you pull pull out the filter and replace it
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:53.920]   oh nice so much nicer oh and i i kind of that's the that's my one thing about the edimotix that
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:11:00.640]   well a couple things they're great headsets uh by the way that case uh it was only 30 bucks which is
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:05.280]   a pretty good price i was expecting it to be a lot more um so now i'm going to think about getting
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:10.400]   one of those for sure uh let's it's actually a really good uh drop case too i drop my phone
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:18.000]   a lot oh nice apple is uh could maybe possibly it's rumors you know how these go uh possibly working
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:28.240]   on a gaming mac in 2020 yeah so i saw i saw an article recently where there was an argument being
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:35.520]   made against using the base model mac pro uh which of course is apples yeah quin from snazzy labs
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:41.040]   quin from snazzy labs rene knows yeah uh saying hey you know you might not want to use the base
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:47.840]   model mac pro for gaming what does it mean then rene for apple to be working on a gaming focused
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:53.840]   mac that comes at a reasonable price and is it going to sell in the same way that gaming
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:59.280]   pcs do so i don't think this is a real thing i'll give you a couple reasons why i don't so like
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:03.280]   it's not it's not a well-sourced rumor to start with but also when you think about
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:09.040]   what a gaming machine means the rumor itself is like i started reading i was like oh maybe they
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.440]   just got confused and apples finally working on the x mac which is the smaller more affordable
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.000]   tower mac and people can throw their own graphics cards in it they can upgrade the ram because that's
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.320]   the essence of gaming when people build a gaming pc it's they they you know they want put their
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:27.200]   chrome and their neon on it that's the whole spirit of it um but the rumor was like no it's
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.840]   going to be a mac book or an i-mac like that's kind of the opposite of of what you'd expect from
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.960]   this rumor and then it just seemed to go downhill from there because what does a gaming mac mean
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.160]   it probably means in videographics and apple and the video starts still aren't on very good terms
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:49.040]   but it also means a huge gaming like culture and that just doesn't exist on the mac apple can
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:55.360]   build like apple could make uh an ace or ace of style you know alienware style i forget what hp
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:59.200]   is called they could make one of those machines but you'd have to go into boot camp in order to
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:05.120]   play any games on it so the whole thing just if i were to if i were to like do the amazon thing
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.080]   and make the final press release for what apple would announce as a gaming mac and then work my
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:15.600]   way back to the product the the current rumor has absolutely none of the elements that i would
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:20.240]   expect to see to get to that end point and i feel like if you want that performance at this point
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:26.080]   with you know you you can get an outboard gpu and i'm not sure you know how much else you know what
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:32.400]   else you need and i did find a buddy in that article he said the ati uh not the ati cards but the
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:37.840]   amd cards uh are not built for gaming i'm like what like that's what they were built for that's why
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:44.080]   we hate them you know like i was like as a professional like who uses gpu's i mean in vidia is the heart
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.920]   was the hardcore you know um heavy lifting gpu that happens to now work really well with games but
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:55.040]   but the ati/amd boards that's what they were built for that's the problem with the way that they
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:59.520]   process the the graphics and so and i was well the gamers say the same thing the gamers say they're
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.360]   better for number crunchers number crunchers say they're better for gamers and both just want
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:09.040]   the in vidia gpu's yeah because they're really general purpose gpu's now yeah general it's where
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.720]   it's where it's where it's get gamers at this point they know exactly what they want they know
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:19.200]   exactly what how uh specifically a system has to perform so the idea at this point of creating a
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:26.240]   brand new gaming system in a in a world in an ecosystem like apples where no you don't get to
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:30.160]   swap out the inner connects no you don't get to have your own cooling system no you don't get to
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:35.440]   swap in to to fix this or tweak that yeah i don't it's that's that's a that's a real
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:41.440]   that's on the pc and admittedly yeah exactly that's actually one of the problems you know when i uh
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.920]   heating you know the the heat dissipation is a big is a big deal like for instance i when i do
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:51.760]   my photogrammetry i have to be careful um on my i'mac uh if i if i do it there i'm now doing most of
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:59.040]   it on a pc but um uh it will overheat and literally shut my computer down wow it turns out it turns
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:03.440]   out you know doing your file on your email i've been like working on ways to put like cooling on
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:08.000]   the back of the i'mac trying to dissipate it or whatever but the i'mac because the problem is is
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:15.680]   that it's sustaining uh a full cpu load for three days wow and and so it you know these are the big
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.200]   calculations not the quick kind of like is this going to work but like if i'm really trying to get
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.160]   all the data out of the photos that i'm using um it'll and it just runs literally at the very top
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.640]   of all the all the processors for three days three somewhere between two and three days if i'm not
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:33.360]   careful it will just stop and i come back and the computers restarted and i'm like what happened
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.960]   oh man took me a while because i kept on going away and coming back i would do it when i go on a
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:42.080]   trip i come back and look made it quick it was powered and uh then i put a ups on it and then i
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:46.960]   realized that no and then i had to put like a little camera on it to see like what happened and watched
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:51.840]   it watch the heat and so on so forth yeah there that's where we go that's it yeah no i was watching
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.000]   justine's video where she showed your photogrammetry on the mac pro and it was i think it took her a
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.800]   day to get through those files yeah just yeah i justine was like talking about how to how do i
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:06.320]   push the mac pro and i was like i'll send you some files you know like i could i could help you
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.200]   up with that and then she was rendering her video at the same time we looked at her tweet it was just
[01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:17.200]   like it was the most beautiful thing i've ever seen 28 you know 28 CPUs just that full capacity and
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:20.320]   i asked her i was like did you see that the GPU could hit every once in a while because there's only
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.040]   certain calculations in a photogrammetry that that hit the GPU and he's like oh yeah maxed out both
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:31.440]   of them you know like he goes you know at certain times it's it's a it's a great um it's a great
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:40.320]   real world cinebench so speaking of the earlier i think it was andy you were talking kind of about
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:48.000]   how we some of us don't understand what the youths are up to i think one of the things that i i see
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:55.680]   across different generations but i've never been able to myself understand is taking a device like
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:04.240]   an iphone and sticking a big old wart on the back of it known as a pop socket i'm happy that oh boy
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:09.680]   john's got a pop socket um listen you can educate us because i don't understand it either i'm like
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:14.480]   what what if you've got a socket you want to pop on the back of your device that's fine by me i don't
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.320]   with that i just don't yeah don't put an eye out with your pops like i just don't get it i don't i
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:26.400]   don't get it and so this is the first time that i have actually considered because i i don't know
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:34.240]   about y'all but i'm the kind of the type of person who i want to be uh if i can't be fully
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:40.240]   sympathetic i want to be empathetic i want to understand yes uh why and so you want to know
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:46.480]   the pop socket i want to know the pop socket i want to know what love is i want you to show me um and
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:53.120]   so i have never been able to do the pop socket thing because i want to be able to charge my device
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:57.360]   with my wireless chargers that i have i'm all in on wireless charging now that took me a while as
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:07.040]   well and this hasn't been possible well pop socket has now created uh a way for you to charge even
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.880]   with your pop socket plugged in essentially they've made a donut charger so the pop socket
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:20.080]   docket the pop socket docket pop lock and drop it you just drop your pop socket onto the donut and
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:26.880]   it fits nice in the middle and around the outside with you know whatever fun i see i like a uh uh
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:35.120]   rainbow fairy sparkle donut and a nice minimalist i'm so hungry now black lines donut
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:39.280]   and please don't take a bite of this one or an a i don't think it would be good for you
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.720]   although it could maybe recharge you anyway this may be the first time that i can actually sort of
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.960]   try to live the life of a pop socketer and see if there's something to it if the rocket bigger
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:52.320]   than the ring like i remember kevin mitchell look our you know our good friend kevin mitchell look
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.000]   like you had those rings on the back of the so and so all the time yeah yeah and i don't know what's
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.800]   better the socket or the the ring so the ring can lay more flat whereas the pop socket if you put
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:07.760]   your phone down it rocks up and down uh because the socket doesn't go completely flat it's a stand
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:14.480]   for your it also works as a stand yes but you put it straight down you put it oh i see what he's saying
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.800]   okay so karsten is pointing out that you would never lay it straight down on the back of the device
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:25.440]   because you can use it to sort of pop prop up your phone um which which makes sense uh but the
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:31.520]   the great thing about the pop socket is that you sort of slide your fingers around the uh socket
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:36.480]   and it can be held there really nice so it adds some some balance to you know you you're holding
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:40.960]   the device while you're carrying it around the thing is i have monster hands and so i don't really
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:47.440]   need a pop socket to have even with the iphone 11 pro max um it's not a problem for me to be able
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:52.160]   to hold this device with the second iphone s e in your hands yeah it is exactly but lory gill
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:57.920]   on the other hand i could see why a pop socket would work for her so anyway my point is given the
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:04.080]   fact that there's now this donut out there uh the pop socket drop it lock and pop it uh work it
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:10.240]   make it move it you know you get it i am considering going let's bogeying right that's right that
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.960]   that i was popping and locking but it was actually bogey for me just jeans pockets i can't put it
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:19.040]   in a jeans pocket oh yeah like i just you know like i slide mine into my pocket all the time and i'm
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:24.320]   just like you know it's you can but it's not polite i don't know is that a pop never mind
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.320]   not i would i put it in my pants and my jeans all the time it's not that bad i'll say like if you
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:32.160]   have a like closed like this if you have all all the way obviously you're not going to put in your
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:36.400]   pocket but i mean it's not too interested over here i want to see how flat it plays okay give me
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.080]   one second we'll walk with the board yeah i'm asking the technical director who's running our
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:44.720]   board to be any switching for a minute so yeah we'll just stay there called pog and they're taking
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:21:10.560]   the youth culture by school and this is why this is why car
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.960]   would drive me crazy uh that's like an Oreo cookie on the back just too old let's see it's not
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:21.280]   enough yeah then later on the table pop it out and later on the table i want it because we can have
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:27.520]   the the still the wide shot here yeah do you yeah that's not that bad so this is this is nice it's
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:32.080]   a nice it's a nice angle and let's go ahead let's put that next can you use it to open the small door
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.360]   on the back of the iPhone because it looks like a handle so this is Alex's case that i'm probably
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:43.440]   going to be ordering that has you can't use the it won't charge by the way oh oh oh no you can't
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:48.880]   do wireless charging with that i don't do that i'm most surprised that your pop socket is not
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:54.400]   promoting your allegiance to any one specific k-pop band however yeah that is which so that's so
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.520]   funny that you mentioned that Andy at that same um that same holiday party there you go very good
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:07.360]   where i saw the christmas ornaments thing there was someone there with a pop socket that had a um
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:15.760]   the face of a k-pauper on the back of it i don't know k-pauper's it was a kts exo 101 nxt 17 i think
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:25.600]   it was uh until nxts yeah i was there yeah um i was into bts once i mean it's it's a great starter
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:30.720]   boy band for getting into k-pop i mean but once you discover this with a stray kids are all about
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:37.520]   i mean it's see you're saying you watch bts during the and your new zepop special in New York city
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.720]   Andy no i know i'm saying that while we're talking about it i googled for a listening popular k-pauper
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:52.400]   boy groups brabissimo i love it i love it yeah sorry go ahead i know i'm just saying i can't wait to
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:57.840]   disruptive i'm sorry i love it i can't wait to be running back some plus vegas what it's not
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:07.120]   very quickly about the talking about bts yes get me my hibachi yeah by the way that rainbow unicorn
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:14.080]   spring coal is actually called cosmic cloud not whatever it was that i said um anyway point is i
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.920]   will report back at some point in the future because i'm thinking about pop socketing because
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.640]   the one thing that i do like to along with the ability to sort of fling my phone around and have
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:28.880]   it stay where it is is the ability to use the other accessories that they have so for example
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:34.320]   in your car you can easily dock it uh pop socket and dock it so this one you're gonna lock it in the
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:40.560]   back i i got a magnetic in my car and so i just like just stick it in the snap it so other than
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:44.800]   your other than the wireless charging it's pretty much the solve and right now i do have the i have
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:50.560]   a mophie uh dock in my car that will wirelessly charge my phone and so that's not gonna work if
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.600]   i've got the pop socket drop it but i don't know we'll see i'm curious about it though and now there
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:24:01.120]   is an opportunity to wirelessly charge with the pop power and i find it fascinating the way that
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:07.600]   they try to work on different integrations and i think that mophie also partnered with it was
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:13.760]   either mophie or it was um oh goodness there's another popular case maker that make those horrible
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:20.240]   cases that are thick auto box thank you uh that it may have partnered with pop socket one of the two
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:24.560]   two two-two-two keys that have it they're they're awesome it's like the first the first time
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:30.160]   the first the first time you drop a phone on a hundred-year-old tiled floor
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:38.800]   it's it's it becomes less ugly as every time every time it happens that makes sense uh yeah
[01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:42.880]   uh one of the other things i wanted to talk about and i don't know if it's uh in our document
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:49.040]   karsten so john get ready i'll post it in the chat so you have a link to it um i found this
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:57.680]   fascinating that we saw some news about this that apple uh was introducing a new little offshoot of
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:06.640]   its made-for-iPhone program uh that would allow you to use flashes and strobes that are synced
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:14.000]   with the flash on your camera and anchor is one of the first companies to come out with one they
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:21.360]   have an led flash that plugs in to the lightning cable on your iphone and then syncs with the flash
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:26.960]   on the iphone to provide even more lighting um so this is the the first one that i know of that
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:34.080]   provides uh the actual made-for-iPhone certified or certification and will allow you to integrate
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:41.600]   with the iphone camera app um and third camera third party camera apps as well and they think they
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:48.480]   include a little diffuser if you want to provide one as well so beyond the look that's gonna be
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:53.120]   that's gonna be so cool but but not only for people who just like do a lot of instagram stuff
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:59.360]   but also the the the more you the more you treat a phone camera an iphone camera as a real camera
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:03.280]   the more you get results are just like a real camera and being able to provide a little bit of extra
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:08.160]   illumination as a flash is is the missing link so that's that's that's such a cool development
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.920]   it's so i wonder i'm wondering what the discussion was like inside of apple like whether this was
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:16.320]   something that had been gestating for for a while that just was waiting for their uh to free up
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:20.080]   enough personnel that they could actually develop and implement it or whether it was one of those
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:24.400]   that's so obvious why didn't we think of this three years ago great do it do it do it do it
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:31.600]   yeah i'm happy that they are doing it now though for sure uh so so if you so if you if you're a
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:38.000]   security guard at any sort of you a museum be prepared now for a nuanced lot of sir sir i'm
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.440]   sorry we don't allow any thank you very much but this is an external no we especially don't
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:49.440]   know allow oh no no that that means that the rest of us now have to prepare it for like museum
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:57.840]   of fine arts fail fascist guard makes me stop instagramming oh man uh this should be interesting
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:04.080]   and i i don't know yet uh if the spec that's provided allows for uh devices that aren't
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:08.080]   actually connected via lightning yeah it'd be interesting to see the lightning it'd be interesting
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:13.920]   to see a product that had the lightning go to a typical um ttl connect you know like not ttl
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.720]   connection but but typical connection to to flashes like that's what you really want is you just want
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:24.080]   a a connector that's going to go and talk to existing flashes yeah you're actually that would be the
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.000]   bridge that would let you just use anything you wanted and now would make it a lot easier yeah but
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:35.040]   that you keep keep you match how how i imagine i guess if you just keep the shutter open for a
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:39.600]   six-eighth of a second synchronization won't be a big problem but i wonder if even timing it to
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.520]   within one six-eighth of a section of the second they're making sure that you're popping the flash
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:48.080]   while the shutter is open without having to keep it open for a second that i bet that's a non-trivial
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:52.640]   problem so i hope i get to read about how people are solving that yeah it'll be interesting we'll
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.960]   have to keep an eye now that this is out and we've got you know sort of our first companies
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.680]   releasing products that that idea of having it go lightning to this you know thing that
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:06.880]   communicates with your actual flashes that'd be pretty cool yeah something to keep an eye out for
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:13.040]   for sure i have a quick but unrelated question mica oh i love unrelated questions so the new york
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:18.400]   times is reporting that so nose is suing google and amazon basically for ripping off their home
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.720]   speaker tech but not apple and is that because they kind of feel bad enough about the whole
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.160]   pod they don't want to pile on or is it just different technology i don't know i just
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:33.440]   ought to be fun to ask yeah what it so can you give a little bit more info about the the actual
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:39.680]   lawsuit what is the claim there they will there so um sorry sorry i was i was going to say that
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:44.480]   they're they're not suing amazon right now because they only have enough money to sue
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:50.400]   google and not amazon they'll sue as soon as they're done with google they're moved to amazon so i'm
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:56.560]   sure oh apple get to have a line oh and there and there's no more intimidating phone call if you're
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:02.400]   a lawyer for google that says that a small company with a very very very small legal fund
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.240]   wants to try to soak you for a big big settlement that's like is it a call
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:11.280]   alan is that what you're getting at was the call correct i know i i think it's i think it's going
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:16.400]   to be hey jason go empty out the the vending machine on the first floor i've whatever is in there
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:25.120]   that's what we're going to offer uh so i kind of like rene your take on things i as much as i
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:32.880]   enjoy the home pod that i have um when i'm thinking about where i'm going next if apple if apple
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.280]   released a sound bar hands down i would get a sound bar from apple i would love to have a sound
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:46.000]   bar made by apple um but where uh the space in which i exist currently in my home there is one
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:54.880]   home pod apple you know device and the rest are echo speakers of different sorts and so i don't
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:30:00.960]   really sort of fall into that camp i'm not um a big audio file or anything like that and
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:09.760]   as far as i've seen and of course this is just my own anecdotal stuff uh my friends my family
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:16.320]   have never shown an interest in the sort of high-end uh home pod versus something that is more
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:22.240]   within their budgets in the amazon echo range and so i find well the chip is going to make it all
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:26.560]   work together mica that wonderful chip alliance is going to just solve everything any dana ash by
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:33.200]   the way i'm the only one that's pronouncing it by its full um given catholic name which is which
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:39.360]   is peachoype because it is product project uh to connect ship i don't remember even now what
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:44.560]   it's called actually but uh peachoype the the okay connected home over internet protocol thank you
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:50.480]   mica was it are you talking about the baptism name or its confirmation name um i am i'm talking
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:54.800]   about the baptism name you know okay so it could be could be like confirmation could still be loyola
[01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:58.880]   or something like that that's true yeah that's a good point i'm sorry you you awaken my catholic
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:03.600]   upbringing finally i can use some of this stuff that i what other question would you like you like
[01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:07.920]   i'm going to mask every sunday instead of just like reading comics at home with my dad is paying
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.840]   off finally let me know if there's anything else i can ask that let you bring up your catholic
[01:31:11.840 --> 01:31:16.160]   upbringing i am i am kind of looking forward to all of this kind of find in its way to something
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:23.760]   that actually works i mean i have as someone who owns uh i think 14 sonos amps oh my god um it right
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:28.400]   because they go to a lot of speakers in the house and uh you know every room's got its own
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.080]   amp and they're all in one server room but they all go out to everywhere that they need to go in
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:39.680]   the garden and stuff like that and so uh it's chaos like it's it worked at one point a couple
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:43.760]   years ago but it's just like it's chaos like like half of them work and then the other half don't
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:48.640]   work and and you reset it and then it bricks it and then you're trying to figure out why and then
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:52.000]   you're you know like it it is and every time there's an update to something you just know
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.120]   that is not going to work and so i think that part of sonos's problem is they got i can see why they're
[01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:02.720]   as as an owner i can see why they want people to buy the new ones at 30 off and then brick the
[01:32:02.720 --> 01:32:06.880]   ones that they have like just kill them because the ones that they have are not working and and i
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:13.600]   think that a lot of the the issue there is really that there everybody's got all these weird all of
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:18.560]   them are just this weird cobbled together we figured it out on our own right and finding something
[01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:22.240]   that's unified that just says okay this is how we're going to do all of this and make this all work
[01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:29.920]   and hopefully it'll be ipv6 not ipv4 we're gonna we're gonna we can only hope um that they'll
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:36.240]   move forward so but i but i think that um moving to something that is just normal and that we can
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:41.440]   just have everybody kind of live in for a while what would be great otherwise i have to admit as a
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:46.320]   homeowner that has a lot of tech and a lot of wire like a wire conduit's going through most of the
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:51.440]   house i'm not i have to i'd love to say that i did that but there was a cto that owned the house
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:56.160]   before me for a big company oh nice and so i i bought into it like i walked into the server
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.920]   room and and i saw all the sonuses and i was like is that come with the house because i that sells
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:05.760]   me on the house you know you know and so anyway so um so they they did all the work for me but i'm now
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:09.760]   just kind of waiting you know like i have to be like i have what i have and i'm just gonna keep
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:14.400]   waiting until i mean like my this year project is going to be to pull out all the copper and put
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:18.080]   all in fiber but that's about it you know i guess and then i'm just gonna wait for everything else
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:24.400]   to kind of sort sort its way sort its way what we we we always have to appreciate that the value
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:31.600]   that apple brings to almost any product is always how how well the damn thing works that you can and
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.560]   certainly the the the home pods i don't think the sound is that great because i mean most of
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:43.040]   mostly because the size i wish it worked with more stuff but i also have i i very much like my my
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:48.400]   google home speakers i've got now i've got a pair of the big google home maxes in the in the bedroom
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:55.360]   but man alive it just uh they're chrome uh chromecast just does not work the way that airplay works
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:34:00.240]   or if i see an airplay button on a phone and i'm trying to talk to anything that's airplay compatible
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:07.360]   i'm used to it simply working we're asked with chromecast it's like okay now is this an ai ff
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:12.560]   or is this another format okay now it's not going to work that way okay so what oh dear why is this
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.560]   speaker keep disconnecting reconnecting and why is it why is this saying that i can't
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.760]   it can't find this to try something it's it gets in the way of one to sit and relax and listen to
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:27.040]   music and sometimes i really do think that i kind of would much rather have speakers that are way
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:32.240]   more expensive than what i'm paying for what i've got now that aren't as quite as good sounding but
[01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:37.280]   if i pick up my phone or my laptop and i press a button saying please make soothing music now
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:42.160]   soothing music happens now and that's what happened as well i have to say i have a home pod in my in my
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.600]   kitchen and it's just sounds great i mean and i think that part of it is the calculations that
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:51.360]   they're doing the kitchen is a particularly a lot of hard surfaces and a harder thing to
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:57.440]   especially stick it in the corner and i'm you know i had i've had all of them all of the different
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:02.240]   smart speakers in that kitchen and and it's just it's night and day as far as i'm concerned as far
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:08.000]   as the quality now i haven't used the the google the new the newer bigger ones so i haven't
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.040]   haven't gone head to head with that and then i have but i have a lot of them i have the google
[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:17.280]   home somewhere else and i have the amazon uh i have uh every size of amazon with screens without
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:21.680]   screens you know floating around and and so it's it's not one of the other but when we want to listen
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.720]   to music you know in while cooking or or whatever we just use the home pod yeah
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:34.480]   uh well folks it is is the breakdown break time as this as the show is is almost over
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:43.440]   um but there are more places to enjoy the content we put out and in fact after this show you can
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:49.920]   catch me over on ios today i got to hang out with rosemary orchard again yes i had her back on the
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:54.640]   show because she absolutely killed it last time she's awesome she's so awesome uh and this time we
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:36:00.640]   talked about habit tracking apps yes it is the new year and yes some of you may have made new
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:07.760]   years resolutions or maybe you're looking at other ways to uh stick to different habits and and uh
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:13.200]   the projects that you're working on and so we went all in on a bunch of different habit tracking and
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:19.120]   resolution tracking apps some apps that are like many virtual life coaches and everything in between
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:27.280]   a way to even uh get a better understanding and view an overview of your life and uh your happiness
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.440]   in different categories which i thought was really fantastic before we talked about the
[01:36:31.440 --> 01:36:40.240]   news in ios ipad o s tvos maco well not maco s that's for this show uh and car play all that and more
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:47.200]   over on ios today so be sure to check it out be sure to subscribe for all that great content
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:56.240]   and of course leo the port will be back next time for ios today okay folks it is time for our
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:04.640]   picks of the week and we're starting with Alex Lindsey so i'm doing a re-pick so this is i'm
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:10.800]   picking it again because it's so great okay so i'm down um so i i'm picking shadow draw again
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:17.040]   and i picked it because i enjoyed it i'm picking it again because my my daughter just loves it and
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:22.160]   so and i my my ten-year-old daughter likes to draw and she loves this little like basically
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:26.640]   what shadow draw does is it it draws a line and has you follow along and so you're actually
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:32.000]   following artists in their process of drawing so you're learning how they draw you know by you
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.440]   know like here's a line do this then do this then do this then do this and and so it shows you the
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:42.880]   structure and the approach of of how to draw and i and there's two things about it i mean the
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:49.600]   the first reason that i uh picked it was because i feel like there's a future this is part of an
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:54.880]   education future that's coming which is that um you're gonna follow be able to actually interactively
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:59.440]   follow along with an example of something that learned that teaches you important skills on how
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:04.000]   to do it i mean a lot of us you know want to do step by steps this is kind of the next generation
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:08.240]   of step by step of teach you how to do something by actually having you do it right over top of
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:12.640]   the person doing it so i i think that it's it's important from a technology perspective
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:17.680]   but the reason i decided to bring it up again was i was just over uh over the christmas break got to
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:22.400]   watch my daughter constantly on it you know sitting there uh going from one picture to another and
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:26.640]   following along and getting better at it and then all of her drawing getting better she's she
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:31.760]   basically the two apps that she probably spends the most time in is procreate and um and shadow
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:36.000]   draw so she's playing in a shadow draw and then she's doing her own stuff in procreate and and then
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.600]   she you know makes music on garage band so that's kind of her that's kind of her uh her little her
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:46.640]   little world and garage band on her ipad and then she's using logic she's only 10 years old so you know
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:53.360]   we decided to get her into logic on the wow so um so anyway so uh so she's
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:57.360]   she's cooking she's cooking are you afraid that she's gonna start like out hustling you for clients
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.040]   soon oh yeah that's okay i'm just looking at labor laws when when we put her in and you know
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.240]   act i think when we when we when we activate the asset you know so uh so anyways as she's uh but
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:12.880]   but honey i'm so proud of you which is why i'm starting i'm gonna have to start start charging
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.680]   you rent per square footage as commercial space for your bedroom and yours at your end of the
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:24.320]   couch yeah so it takes me back but just watching how how her skill yeah the uh just watching how
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:28.720]   her skill her skills have jumped dramatically uh going through that process um it reminds me of
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.080]   things like zbrush one of the big things that zbrush had a long time ago was being able to kind of
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:36.320]   follow along and do stuff and i think cool that more applications need to think about whether this
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.680]   is just how to draw but more applications need to think about this kind of follow through rather
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:45.760]   than watching a video about how to do something actually drive the app so that i'm following along
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:51.840]   the steps within the app and and doing those i think is a is a powerful uh nomenclature very neat
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:58.960]   uh rene richy what have you got for us so mine is just uh a little bit of fun um if you're not
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:04.800]   familiar with uh sorry let me just go back for a second uh if you're not familiar with timothy buck
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.520]   he's just he's a really cool member of the apple community does a lot of really cool stuff and he
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:14.080]   and elissa and i'm i don't have her last name in front of me so i apologize have put out a new sticker
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:21.760]   pack called the decline stickers which is uh hand drawn just nope let's not can we not sort of just
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:27.520]   fun ways to hard nope uh anything that anybody might message your way and it just it struck me at
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:31.920]   a time when i needed a laugh but also when i was reminded of the importance of having strong
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:37.600]   boundaries and and strong fences and i just thought what a what a wonderful thing to share with uh i
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:40.800]   love here because they're an android version of this perchance
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:48.960]   i'm getting this right i don't want to say it right and is and is there a sticker for i'm just
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:53.600]   not in a communicating mode right now if you let me get you if you give me an hour to get used to
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:58.080]   the idea of talking to somebody i'll be right on it gross no yeah i mean i'm sure you can file a
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:02.880]   feature request gross no so is a good one for me that's true i want to just put that on every twitter
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:11.280]   thing is in my feed some warnings when i wake up i'm not verbal yet after coffee please and honored
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:19.440]   but can't yes honored but can't all that's sweet yeah um i know what you did not silly these are great
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:27.360]   i yeah well and Renee all jokes aside you know you did include some some very good points there uh
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:35.040]   georgia dao is a a strong proponent of the idea of setting boundaries that are important for you
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:42.720]   and you know has it's kind of taught me that in a way and i really um i think it's important and i
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:49.440]   think it's something that a lot of us don't pay attention to or don't give importance to that
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:55.440]   needs to be placed there that sometimes you do need to set boundaries and say you know draw i'm
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:59.040]   drawing the line here this is not something that i can do right now or what have you and
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:04.480]   when you need that reminder this little app that has a little bit of humor to it as well as that
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:09.920]   ability to set some uh some boundaries is kind of neat oh one thing i'll add is if you are in a
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:14.880]   stick if you are in a sticker mode um you can also pick up the mandolorian sticker pack which is
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.720]   just absolutely delightful when you don't want to hard note stuff which one have a little fun
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.840]   with it this this is the way this is the way uh i got that as soon as i saw it was available you
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:29.600]   better believe my baby yoda all right Andy not go what is your pick
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:37.120]   my pick is a generalized pick this seems to be a good year to try to get into high
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:43.760]   high resolution music files because the this is the idea of the music that you're streaming
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:49.920]   obviously it's highly highly compressed they throw out a lot of the a lot of the information
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:57.200]   that's uh in the original track even if you're like me and you buy CDs to get the much higher
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:02.720]   resolution there is another quantum step above that that's available in terms of and i'm getting
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:08.720]   an uncompressed digital music file that none that is much much closer to the amount of information
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:14.080]   that was inside the studio master and believe it or not HD music has been around for decades
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:21.200]   i think sony and phillips came out with a high resolution cd of trying to sell you a high
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:26.160]   resolution cd and high resolution cd players but if they that laid the groundwork but the thing is
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.320]   now you don't need a special player you don't need special headphones you don't need a special
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:36.480]   digital audio converter you can just download an unlocked non-copy protected high resolution
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:41.200]   audio file in a standard format that iTunes can understand or whatever your music player
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:48.640]   music library can understand and it will just plain work and i the first and you can dip your toe in
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:55.520]   pretty inexpensively uh for i the first album that i bought was the newly remastered version
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.000]   of the Beatles Abbey Road because AIDS won my favorite albums ever also i'm really really
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:04.640]   familiar with it and i felt this though i was not going to be wasting $20 on it if i'm gonna waste
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:10.160]   $20 on an experiment at least i'll have this and i'll i'll be darned i really really could tell
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:16.720]   the difference between my lossless cd digital rip so the cd quality and this new quality it's
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:24.320]   the best way to put it is that it's that whereas on the cd when you when ringo hits the symbol
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:29.920]   your mind set my mind and my awareness says okay there's that is a symbol something so that's a
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:36.480]   that's a symbol hit whereas hd tracks when i'm just listening to my like 60 $80 sony headphones over
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:43.760]   the ear headphones here you what you hear is you hear a wooden drumstick hitting a disk of metal
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:50.720]   and then as a result a vibration propagating throughout the symbol so you really do it's not
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:56.720]   it's not as big as the difference between as if you're if you're old like me and not everybody on
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:02.000]   this panel you remember what it was like when you went from like cassettes to CDs and suddenly
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.080]   wow there's no background noise wow there's no hiss and wow all this other stuff it's not as
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:10.800]   dramatic as that but it's very very real and if you are particularly if you're like me and you're
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:18.160]   already in the habit of for the my most favorite albums i will buy a cd and for my most favorite
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:24.480]   creators i will even pay 15 to 20 dollars for the cd rather than simply waiting on ebay for someone
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:30.720]   to have it for three bucks used it's it's very very much worth your time and so now my plan is to
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:36.960]   not necessarily go through like i really can't afford to go throughout my entire library and
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:41.440]   replace every single one of my favorite albums even just my favorite albums with these
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:48.560]   17 to 25 dollar HD versions of those albums however going forward there are two there are two
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:52.960]   releases coming up this week this month i was really looking forward to and now i've canceled my cd
[01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:57.280]   pre-orders on amazon because i'm going to be buying them in high definition when they come out
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:03.280]   now i will also so if you are so i will say this not for everybody if you love streaming streaming
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:08.480]   music you're going to find it's kind of like a bummer to now have to once again find a place to
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:14.000]   store music files to say nothing of the fact that you're going to have so little space on your phone
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.280]   for these enormous files they're they are compressed even though they're lossless but they are many
[01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:25.040]   times bigger than than what a 320k like compressed version would be so that's probably probably
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:32.400]   going to be out as well but it's but it's a but if you are like me where i was already
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:39.040]   i already transitioned from streaming to i want to have my own curated library of complete
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:45.760]   lossless cds i have like hunt now i have after several years i now have every single cd i've ever
[01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:51.280]   owned and now i've been when i've bought in the past three years on a server in high resolution
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:55.760]   so it's a very very easy thing to suddenly say that okay now the cop the files i'm the the the
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:00.720]   flak files i'm going to be copying onto my server are now going to be huge and more expensive but much
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:06.960]   more detailed as opposed to something that i bought for a dollar at the local library uh if it's all
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:12.000]   but but i just want to say that you don't if don't when you do a google search you're going to say
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.680]   oh well of course i we tested this out on a my two thousand my cheap two thousand dollar headphones
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:23.360]   and uh but i feel i felt this i didn't really feel the presence in the studio space until i switch
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:27.760]   for my six hundred dollar digital audio converter to the two thousand dollar one i know i shouldn't
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:32.640]   have cheaped out like that in the beginning no no don't worry if you just just on my three-year-old
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:38.480]   phone just with these uh sixty to eighty dollar headphones i definitely felt the difference and
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:43.120]   i'm also certain that in the coming years at some point i'm probably going to upgrade my speakers
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:48.400]   i'm probably going to upgrade my my headphones at that time i will i will appreciate it even more
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:52.960]   so definitely something to take a look at you can go to a site like hdhd tracks.com
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:59.200]   download buy one album download it listen to it and have that experience the the only the only
[01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:05.600]   really big disadvantage is that they're really we're asked now the regular the regular music
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:10.960]   digital music stores are now so well organized that if it's available on iTunes it's available on
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:16.960]   amazon it's available on google play music it's a little bit more fragmented in that if you go to
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:25.840]   you start off at hdhd tracks or another site called qo qo b u as z now here here's where you see you
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:31.280]   can absolutely see at what point did each of these companies get into this business because hdh
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:37.840]   tracks gone to this business where you could buy the u r l hdh tracks.com by the time qba's got into
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:45.200]   it they had to invent a name to get their domain name qo b u z and even then even then there are a
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:51.360]   couple of creators that i really really like where i was about to buy the album on cd then i
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:58.560]   oh geez is this available in hd go to kuba kubas no go to hdh tracks no then okay you know what this
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:04.160]   is kind of a niche classical classical music publisher let's go to the publisher site and directly from
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:09.280]   the site i was able to get hd music files so it's a little bit more work but again for specific
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:14.160]   music that you really really like that you really really enjoy listening to as opposed to simply
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:18.400]   having something to listen to while you run it's definitely worth the 20 bucks per album.
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:26.720]   Excellent all right well my pick is uh the ecobee switch plus this device is currently on sale at
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:33.840]   amazon it's normally 80 dollars it's right now on sale for 48 dollars um i saw this price dropping
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:39.120]   because i've had this in my camel camel camel uh queue for a long time for folks who don't know
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:45.040]   camel camel camel is the site that you use to track price drops on amazon over time and you can sort
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:50.400]   of set alerts to say hey this is drop below the certain price that you want to get it at and right
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:55.840]   now this is on sale so i have an ecobee thermostat in my home as opposed to a nest learning thermostat
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:03.520]   or one of the others i really like the ecobee for the um it offers a lot more control and one of my
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:09.680]   favorite things about the ecobee is that it has room sensors for the rooms in your house so what it
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:15.360]   does is instead of providing uh typically you know normal thermostat it's in the hallway or it's in
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:20.560]   an entryway or it's somewhere where you can access it and inside of it it is determining the temperature
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:28.720]   so you set the house to cool to 70 degrees whenever it's uh summer and it is cooling to 70 degrees and
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.040]   it's only paying attention to that hallway is the hallway at 70 degrees well maybe your upstairs
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:39.280]   bedrooms are still at 74 or something like that even whenever the hallway is 70 the room sensors
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:46.080]   allow it to sort of find an average between the 70 and the 74 to cool the house to and uses all
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:50.960]   of those to determine what the temperature should actually be set to and you can adjust how exactly
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:56.160]   you want that to work they also have little um occupancy sensors built into them so if i'm not
[01:50:56.160 --> 01:51:02.000]   in that room then don't do the average do this one etc the ecobee switch plus is sort of in addition
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:08.640]   to that whole experience but it comes with an added bonus which is that it has a l-e-x-a built
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:14.480]   into it so amazon's assistant is built in and uh it has the the normal microphone array that you're
[01:51:14.480 --> 01:51:20.880]   used to from amazon's uh amazon's uh aaly x-a enabled devices and so it also has that far field microphone
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:29.120]   setting so you can talk to the assistant on the actual light switch and it will do all the things
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:36.560]   that you're used to with the ecobee setup including the built-in ambient light sensor and motion sensor
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:41.520]   where you can say hey if you don't detect motion in this space for more than an hour and my lights
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:45.680]   are on you can go ahead and turn those off or you can set it to make it look like you're home when
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:51.280]   you're away so hey i don't want it to look like i'm away i'd like it to seem as if i'm turning on
[01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:56.000]   and off lights in my house and you can do that too uh you can set it to automatically turn on lights
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:02.160]   its sunset it basically does everything that you're used to a smart light switch doing with the added
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:08.800]   benefit if you do use echo devices in your home of having that built in as well now i don't recommend
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:14.480]   this next thing that i'm going to say but you can if you'd like to entirely do this you can ask it
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:20.080]   to play music and it will play tinny horrible sounding music right from the device itself it's
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:27.680]   really not made for that it's made for controlling other products that can do that and it is home kit
[01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:33.760]   enabled which for me is important because the rest of my devices in my house are works with apple
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:39.600]   home kit devices but it also works with the google assistant it works with a le xa it works with iftt
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:46.000]   tt it works with smart things from sam's song and so much more it is a wifi connected device which i
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:52.560]   quite enjoy over the bluetooth enabled devices that are available because they tend to be much more
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:53:00.240]   responsive so it's already a step ahead in terms of the peach wipe initiative um very cool product
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:07.200]   and uh very well designed ecobies products i've been happy with and this one is uh no slouch on that
[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:12.240]   if you have an older home that doesn't have neutral switch it neutral wires then you won't be able
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:18.560]   to add this to your home but any newer build is required to have neutral switches excuse me i
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:24.240]   keep saying switch is neutral wires and so you can uh count on that now if you don't this is the
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:31.040]   caveat i always give because i think it's important if you don't know how to work with the electric
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:36.480]   wiring in your home please for the love of god hire someone to install this um because that's not
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:40.720]   something to mess around with if you don't know what a neutral wire is and how that's different
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:46.080]   from line and load then also hire someone to come into your home because you need to know what that
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:52.000]   means before you go plugging different wires and and rewiring things but is there a version that
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.920]   will project like the latest fortnite dance onto your blinds so that your neighbors think you are
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:00.800]   home and also dancing i hope that's the next model with hologram technology because i heard
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:06.240]   ces has quite a bit of that um so hopefully one day that'll be the case but right now like i said
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:11.520]   available for uh i think right now is 49 this morning it was at 48 the prices keeps
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:17.760]   bouncing between 45 and 50 dollars so maybe if you check it in the morning and it's at 49 or
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:21.440]   something like that give it a second because it might drop back down to that lower price i don't
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:26.720]   know how amazon's magical price voodoo works but it's always uh changing but it is staying somewhere
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:31.440]   in between that half off range which is a really good price for this that's a it's an excellent
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:36.080]   get especially if you've been thinking about adding smart lighting to your home and you want the
[01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:40.720]   in-wall switch option um i should also know it because i don't think i did you do you it's not
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:45.520]   that you can only turn on and off the lights using these different methods it also is a push button
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:50.640]   so you can just tap it and it will turn on and off the lights like a normal light switch as well
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:55.680]   which for me is important because not everybody wants to do all of the nonsense that i do uh in a
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:01.280]   home so yeah that is my pick that is everyone else's picks i do find it interesting that we
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:07.840]   we just we basically talk about the fact that uh you know what what nest or or is you know what
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:12.880]   you think but we don't we don't talk about honey well yeah talk about like an incumbent totally
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:18.320]   missing the boat right right like just completely like the boat is that another continent but it's
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:24.640]   not made they realize because honeywell is just the worst yeah just the worst i'm sorry i'm
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:29.280]   probably that that sounds you're making with the jawclench yes maybe so angry yes you know like
[01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:32.640]   it's all these weird little settings and all these little schedules that barely work and you
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:37.120]   have to like practice you have to learn like an entire language that's like chinese just to figure
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:41.840]   out how you're gonna do this thing and just the worst this is this is this is such a cautionary
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:47.680]   tale that when you build your business over we don't sell to consumers who get angry with us and
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:53.840]   then choose somebody else we sell hundreds or thousands at a time to property managers and people who
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:59.520]   build buildings who never have to deal with our product on a daily basis right you get smoked
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:06.560]   eventually yeah agreed agreed well folks uh i believe that brings us to the end of another episode
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:12.400]   of mac break weekly and the in nato if people want to uh check out what you're doing or if you've

[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:38.800]   to talk to his consumers or her constituents constituents i was on uh the yesterday uh afternoon
