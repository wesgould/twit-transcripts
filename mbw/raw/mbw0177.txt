[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 177.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We're live from in front of the Erbobuina Center for the Arts,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   where just a few minutes ago Steve Jobs took the stage and announced a brand new category, really.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Not just a new device, but a new category, the iPad.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And we're going to do a special Mac Break Weekly today.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Back at the studio, say hello, it's Alex Lindsay.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hi Alex.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Hello. How's it going?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And Alex is running the board, so any mistakes, it's Alex's fault.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Ah, that was a pre-active strike. I see how it is.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Also with it's Dr. Kiki Kirsten Sanford. Hi Kirsten.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Hello Leo, it's nice to be here.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And of course on Skype, Merlin, man, an original Mac Break Weekly guy.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Hey Merlin.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   How's it going Leo?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   It's great.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   You guys have been holding down the fort while we were all in the auditorium.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I hope we were able to get a pretty good picture of that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I mean it was kind of guerrilla style.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   But I have to say Steve looked good.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   His voice was a little weak.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   He looked tired and thin, but he did a bang up job selling what is obviously something that's very important to him.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Something he's been working on for quite some time.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It looked fantastic.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It really has the fit and finish of a very mature device.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   It didn't look like it was a version one, the way we would see it come out from a lot of other applications or a lot of other companies.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   They obviously spent what looks like years making sure that it was just right before they pulled the trigger.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Well, and both Phil Schiller and Steve made the point, and I think this was a very good point,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   that this is a device that people already knew how to use.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   They were building on the success of the iPhone and the iPod Touch.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's the same UI.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's just bigger.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And more responsive.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   It sounded like from your report that you just have a lot more processing power, so you're getting a lot faster too.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Yeah, well in fact, I just, Tina's here, justina's Eric.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   She didn't get into the event.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I didn't, but I did get into touch the iPad, and it really is like a very large iPod Touch.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Phil, I'm hearing it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   There's an experience holding it that doesn't get communicated from watching and the stage presentation.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It feels, I mean, I'm speechless because it was like amazing.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   You know, it's everything that you would want in a tablet.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And it's so smooth.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   It really is an experience, which is something that Steve is all about.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yeah, it's pretty clear that the refinement that Apple does so well is built into this thing.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And not only in terms of the user interface, which we're very familiar with, but the fit and finish of the product itself.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And you're right.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You said an important word, speed.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yeah, no, it's awesome.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And I mean, it's...
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   How do you like the screen?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I like it.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   It's really bright.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   My biggest concern though is which one am I going to buy?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Am I going to wait for the 3G or the Wi-Fi?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   But like we were talking before, you mentioned the Wi-Fi, which if you have a Wi-Fi or a Wi-Fi card,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   then there's no point in waiting for the 3G.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Just in case somehow you missed the details of the announcement.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   In 60 days, you'll be able to get the first versions of the iPad.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   By the way, iPad, were you surprised by that name?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   A little bit like I really...
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I was becoming so used to like the little tablet or maybe the iSlate.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   But, you know, I don't think the name's really that important.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It's the obvious name.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I've just kind of...
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I thought, can we move on from i, but then they have an iBook store, so we're never going to move on.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah, never.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So the iPad will be available in 60 days only in the Wi-Fi version.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   There are three Wi-Fi versions.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   There's a 16 gigabyte for $4.99, which is a really relative...
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Well, $4.99 isn't really that cheap, but if you've been thinking of $1,000 or even $800, it's cheap.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Then it's a great price.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Steve did that, by the way.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   He put a $9.99 up, said, "This is what everybody's saying under $1,000."
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And then he crashed it to the ground, and it was $4.99.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   He really knows how to sell it.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   He really does.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Always start with a high price.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And then the low price doesn't seem to seem a lot lower.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   $4.99, $5.99, if you want 32 gigs and 64 gigs, a lot of storage.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   We lost him there for a second, so I'm sure we'll have them back here in just a second.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And through the magic of technology, no one watching the taped version will know anything.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   They'll just be like, "Wow, that was so seamless."
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   We used to always say that on Macbreak.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   We used to have a joke.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   We talked about fixing it in post, but I think you're really going to need to fix this in post, Alex.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I'm not going to have to fix it.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I think we're going to have to fix it.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Fire up your final cut.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   This one's going to be a rough one.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   No, it breaks your heart, but I think you're going to have to edit.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   The iPad naming.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   I'm still not sure about it.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   I just hope it makes a big one.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I think it's unfortunate.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Somebody forwarded a linked YouTube video from MADTV.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   They did an iPad spoof back in 2007.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   That's kind of funny.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Okay, and we're going to go back to Leo.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Hold on one second.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   What would you have named it Merlin?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   If you don't like iPad, what's better than iPad?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   You could hear me.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Oh, gosh, I don't know.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I got to, again, I'm a group of internet boyfriend.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I like iBook.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I think iBook would have been a good name.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   I think iTablet is dumb.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   I think iSlate sounds like it's made out of a rock until it's heavy.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   iPad is fine.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I'm sure I'll get used to it.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   It's strange that it's so close to iPod, which is something they're not focusing on as much.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Maybe there's some kind of like little slip disc in your brain that hears that and is familiar.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   It just seems like the obvious, isn't it?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   What do you think, Leo?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Do you like it?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Do you like iPad?
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I was saying they're not going to use i at all.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I had moved on from the notion of i-anything.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I like the name of it.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Dwight Silverman is also here.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   In fact, I was calling it iPad several weeks ago before the name iSlate came up.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I started using that in my blog just as...
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Then shortly after I did, the stuff about iSlate came up and said, "Okay, I'm wrong.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   It's not iPad."
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I was quite gratified.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   This is iPad.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   That mad TV video was quite funny.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   You were gruntled coming out.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   You were not impressed.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Well, it's great technology.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   It is very cool technology.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   It's a very sleek product.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   In looking at it, I always try to think, "Okay, what will the mainstream think about it?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   We're kind of geeks and we're into this."
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   The lady who is in Walmart who's buying diapers and who kind of lives her life day to day,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   is just going to interest her in all of the long run.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   If you can have a $2.99 netbook and do a lot of the same things, which you can do a lot of the same things,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   is this going to call to her?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I don't know that it's necessarily a mainstream product.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I think it will go to Apple's core audience.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   It will go to the higher end.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   People willing to spend the higher amounts.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I was talking to Tim Behren, the analyst, who said that he thinks that the $4.99 will not be the top seller,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   that it will be one of the higher end models.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It's always been that way when they sold the 8GB iPhone.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   People really wanted the 16GB.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   What people want on the iMac is the 27-10 Mac.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   27-10 Mac.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   That's Apple's customer.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Apple's smart.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   They created the low price point.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Obviously, that gets the attention.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   People are going to buy the middle one.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Do you need all that storage, though?
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   A 16GB iPhone is a pretty big iPhone, isn't it?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I haven't even filled my iPhone up and I shoot video all the time.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I can't fit all of my music on a 16GB iPod.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I don't think you put your music on this device, though.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   What do you think, Alex?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   You know, I'll buy the biggest one.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   But 64GB, I have a 32GB, I think a 32GB iPhone.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   But my iPhone's full.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I'm constantly, you know, I have to throw stuff away, turn things on and off to get it all.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Because I have a lot of shows.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   I travel a lot, so I have a lot of shows.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And I don't have all my music on it.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   On my iPhone, my Zoom is actually what I keep all my music on.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And so my iPhone just has a couple of playlists that I like.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   But I think that, and I also think that this is aimed at the Walmart audience at least right now.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   But what I do think it does is that I think it makes it very hard if you have another tablet that's $3.99,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   or $2.99.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   I mean, I think that we were just talking about that when you guys were restarting,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   is that it's a very difficult market to stay in when you don't have any room to move.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   I'm going to let Justine go because I gave you a card.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I don't have headphones, so I have no idea what anyone would say.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Well, not only that, I know you want to go play with it.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I do, I do.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   It was amazing and I'm really excited for it to come out.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I can't wait.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Get my badge from Roger over there.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   He's got the press.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   You can just say you're me.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   All right.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Sounds good.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I look like Leo.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Which one?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Thank you.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Justine.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Hi guys.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   All right.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Hey, we're going to take a break.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   We're continuing.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   This is a great, impressive, compulsive ridge of the amazing event.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And I have to say I'm glad we're here.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   We just really have a great time.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Everybody else is here.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Before we move on to more coverage of the iPad, I do want to thank our sponsors, especially Citrix.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And go to my PC.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Go to my PC is that great product that lets you access your computer anywhere you are.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.640]   I could have actually used go to my PC in the auditorium and send it to receive email,
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.560]   run programs, access any network resource.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.880]   If you can get online, you can get to your office system securely, quickly and easily.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880]   You can try it right now.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:12.520]   If you go to go to my PC.com/MacBreak, you try it free for 30 days.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.880]   30 days of unlimited use as many hours as you want.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.440]   Use a 24/7 if you want.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.320]   I think it's a good idea to try before you buy.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.640]   You want to get a sense of how you might use this thing.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.840]   You got a vacation coming up, go to my PC on it and take a trip if you've got a business
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.840]   travel ahead.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.360]   Or maybe you just want to go home early one day.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.880]   Go to my PC.com/MacBreak.
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.760]   We thank them so much for their support of MacBreak Weekly.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.400]   Now I could do it stand up if you want.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   You want to do it sitting down?
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   We can do it sitting down.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   Cross it.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.400]   I'm Gigi Garcia with Fox 11 in Los Angeles.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   Of course I've seen you many times on the TV.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.400]   Oh my goodness.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   TV.
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   You're very kind.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.400]   Isn't it silly?
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.720]   Here we are with a camcorder and we're using the Skype to broadcast to, you know how many
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   people are watching?
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:05.720]   How many people?
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   120,000.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   Wow.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.720]   I'm impressed.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.720]   This is amazing.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   It is amazing.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720]   This is modern technology at its best.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.720]   This is what it's all about.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   So, Gigi, what are you in there?
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.120]   I was there for the whole presentation.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.600]   I feel a little bit more but I really liked it.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.080]   I love the newspaper feature.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.640]   I think it's the best thing to happen to newspapers in a long time.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.520]   The chance to stream their content and maybe charge for it, make some money since sad
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.720]   revenues have gone down.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.720]   I really like that.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:32.720]   Love the iBooks.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.080]   I think that's going to revolutionize the way we read books.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.840]   But most importantly, what did you think about it?
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   You're the expert here.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:44.680]   So I was lucky I got to actually go into the demo area after and touch it and hold it.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.120]   I think that that's something that is a little bit missing from a presentation like this.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:53.320]   You can watch it on the stage and see Steve play with it and get a sense of it.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:56.600]   But really a lot of what this is is an aesthetic experience.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.640]   Holding this beautiful unibody aluminum device is smooth.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.880]   The screen is very clear.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.800]   The device itself is quite fast which is kind of unexpected for a device like this.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.080]   I think that the proof is really in the using of it.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:17.240]   I'll be very interested to see what consumers do because this is a new category.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.520]   This is not like anything they're used to.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.840]   So it's going to really be a question of, will consumers hold it in their hands and say,
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:31.000]   "Yeah, I'm only going to spend $500, $700 for this device even though I've never had
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.280]   a device like it before."
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.600]   With all the hype though, will you did it exceed your expectations?
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.760]   Were you disappointed or did it live up to the hype?
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.680]   Because we've been talking about this for some people have been talking about it for
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:44.680]   years.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.000]   We've been talking about it for months and there's been so much talk about this, so much buzz.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.840]   You know what's surprising is that even though Apple was very tight lip, they're notorious
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.600]   for not giving any information about this, we actually had a pretty good idea.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.120]   We got the name, we got the functionality.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.920]   A lot of people said it's just going to be a beefed up iPod touch, that's essentially
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.920]   what it was.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.200]   So really, there were far fewer surprises and a lot of the kind of outrageous things people
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.680]   thought it might have a solar panel, three cameras, that kind of thing.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.680]   Those didn't happen.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.720]   It's pretty much what we thought it was going to be.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.880]   What's your prediction?
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.800]   Look into your tech crystal ball, are consumers going to go for it?
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.480]   I've gotten a lot of tweets today that people are already lusting.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.040]   They didn't know they needed it and now they can't live without it and they haven't even
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.040]   seen it.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   Isn't that what Apple's so good at?
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   It's creating lust-worthy objects.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:35.120]   In fact, Stephen said this, the intersection of technology and liberal arts.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.320]   He's an artist, they're artistic and they've created something that is beautiful.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.680]   I think what will happen, they have these beautiful Apple retail stores.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.280]   People will go into these stores, maybe not even thinking they want this thing, but just
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.280]   saying, "Well, let's take a look at it," or, "I'm going to go buy a laptop, but as long
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.520]   as I'm there, let's take a look at the iPad."
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.960]   I have a feeling a lot of people will go out the door with an iPad.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.760]   I think this is going to sell very well this year.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.960]   In years to come, as they put more content on it, I think by next year, this time, you'll
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.080]   be able to watch television on it.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.360]   This is going to be a killer product.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.360]   Great.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.360]   You like it?
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.160]   So, Leo LaPorte's stamp of approval?
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.360]   Well, I want one.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.960]   Does that count?
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.960]   Best feature.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   The best feature on it.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.440]   What stood out the most, the most important thing on this?
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.160]   I think this is the best ebook we're ever seen.
[00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.160]   I'm a Kindle fan.
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   I have a Kindle.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.160]   I use the Kindle.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.160]   I love the Kindle.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.320]   It looked like something out of the 1920s.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.520]   That is an amazing ebook reader.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:35.360]   And even if people just buy it for that, and they're spending $300 and $400 for a Kindle,
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.640]   this is going to be a killer product.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.560]   But then you add all the gaming onto that, you add the movies, the video.
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.560]   And just like you said, the ability to read the New York Times, I've tried the New York
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.720]   Times and the Kindle is a terrible experience.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.480]   The Kindle is good for books, but very bad for anything you want to skim or jump around
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   in.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.480]   This is made for that.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.760]   I think this is going to save the newspaper industry.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   I agree with you.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   I think so too.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.760]   I think this is the best thing that's happened in newspapers.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.960]   And I think we're going to see newspapers all over the world lining up to get their product
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960]   on there.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   Thank you very much.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   Thank you, Gigi.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   You were on my show and I was on your show.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.760]   Is it weird having two microphones?
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.760]   Is that straight?
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.760]   We're going back to the fourth area.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.760]   We're very coordinate.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.760]   You notice that?
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.760]   Looking good.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   Thank you so much.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.760]   Thank you, Gigi.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.360]   Nice to meet you.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.400]   That's the weirdest thing I've ever done.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.800]   I don't know what that looked like.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   Hey, Patrick Norton is here.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.720]   Come on over, Patrick Norton.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   We are talking about the iPad obsessively.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.520]   Patrick, we're going to put you in this chair here because this is the chair with the headphones.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:34.840]   Sit on the left side.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.520]   So Merlin, tell me how wrong I am and everything I just told Gigi.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   About what?
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   I don't know.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.520]   I don't know.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   I don't hear.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.800]   Do you think that this is a consumer product that people are going to say when they maybe
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   not?
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.200]   I'm thinking that people are going to say, "Oh, $4.99.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:50.640]   I don't have something like that.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.280]   It's not an upgrade to something I have.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.440]   Do I really need it?"
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.800]   I think that they're going to go into the Apple store and they're going to hold it.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   They're saying, "Yeah, I don't maybe--"
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.200]   Well, I mean, it's a red herring to talk about things like the Lady at Walmart and stuff
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   like that.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.840]   I mean, I don't have an opinion one way or another about the economics of America.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.200]   But again, like we said a little bit earlier when you were in the hall there, Apple has
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.320]   had a lot of their success in the last few years by not chasing people who want to buy
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.120]   on price.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.400]   And the thing is they are not going to fill out the left side of their adoption curve
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.400]   by giving a lot of stuff away.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.680]   So yeah, I mean, to your point, absolutely I think regular people on the street are going
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   to buy this.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.720]   And specifically to your point about holding in your hand, yes, I agree.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   I think that's going to be what really sells it.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720]   I think you're right.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.800]   And I want to say for the fifth time, I was dead wrong about the price.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.400]   I thought it would be about prices.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   Be over.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.720]   Well, and I think it just shows you that this is a company that's interested in pushing
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.120]   out content for money.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.600]   I think that's the play.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:54.200]   Now, I wonder if there's subsidies in here, you know, that's that was kind of my theory
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.240]   was, well, they can't sell a thousand dollar device.
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.880]   They'll figure out a way to bring the price down by building in some subsidies in the
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.880]   content.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.560]   Maybe, maybe that's what Apple's going to do.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.880]   You know, historically, Alex, I know you'll back this up in the iTunes store.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.240]   Apple says we've never made money in the iTunes store.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.840]   We use the iTunes store to sell iPods.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.520]   This might be setting that model on its ear.
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.960]   This might really be, we're going to lower the price on this hardware and we're going
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.040]   to start to try to make money on content.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.120]   Well, I think that when you look at them taking 30%, I mean, on applications, I think
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.200]   that in all the content that goes into those applications, while they're not making much
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.640]   money, maybe on the music, I do think that they're starting to see some, there's some
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.640]   margin there.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.440]   You know, and it may not be a lot of margin.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.400]   It may not be big numbers at the beginning, but I think that as you look at something where
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.200]   people are consuming, you're not, you're not competing just people are consuming everything
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.400]   that they watch, everything that they read theoretically.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.800]   It looks like the price for the eBooks is going to be more expensive than safe.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.840]   Yeah, how much was the Kindle when it started?
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.840]   It was $3.99, right?
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   Yeah, it was pretty expensive.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:55.360]   You know, actually, it's funny to say that I think it'd be interesting to be a fly on
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.120]   the wall at some recent meetings at Amazon, because you know, we think of this as being
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.120]   one company.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.960]   But if you think about the business units, could you imagine being a product manager
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.160]   for electronic books versus being the product manager for the Kindle?
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.000]   Because they're going to be having some coming to blows in a big way over this.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.800]   Because you know you want your product on that device.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   Right.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.360]   Now, it might look like I've got a big fuzzy bear joining me, but actually it's my, what
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.360]   you're, oh my God.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.120]   It's really cute.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.920]   Oh my God.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.800]   It's a part of course, my own buddy from the screen savers in the host of Texas, at
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:35.760]   revision three, and you said something interesting, Patrick, you said $400.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.920]   I was like, we're talking with somebody before.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.920]   I was like, 400.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.080]   I tossed it out as a lark.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.080]   So think about it for an unsubsidized iPhone.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:48.680]   We're still tied down to a two year contract is essentially costing 50 bucks more than the
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.760]   base level version of this, right?
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.760]   So it's $4.99 and part of these like it's got built in GPS.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.600]   It's actually, this is really Steve Jobs, decided to bring GIS to the masses.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.080]   This is all about, isn't that interesting?
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.280]   I mean, you know, talking about geographic information system.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   Yeah, I mean, okay.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   And that's caps.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.280]   Yeah, maps, maps and integrating databases with maps.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.760]   But like, I look at people who do GIS and I can tell they're already frothing because
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:16.240]   the idea of having network access access to the data, you know, 16, 32, 64 gigabytes
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.280]   of storage locally, it could be a lot of fun for doing stuff like that.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.960]   We have a lot of rumors about a vertical applications for this.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.400]   Supposedly, he'd shown it, for instance, to surgeons at Cedars Sinai Hospital.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.560]   I mean, you and I have been joking literally for close to a decade now, right?
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:31.920]   Every time we see a tablet PC, be like, oh, it's the toilet PC.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:33.200]   You can browse the internet.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.200]   And doctors.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.200]   Yeah, and doctors.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.000]   And it's like, who uses tablet PCs right now?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.520]   It's agencies with vertical applications when they're doing when they're basically going
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.360]   to an accident scene for a car or for a house or something like that.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   Hospitals use them.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   Doctors use them.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.640]   It's too beautiful for that though.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.640]   Why?
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:51.640]   Why is it too beautiful for that?
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.960]   You know, it feels like I have to say the more I think about it, the more I think about
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.560]   how that looks that we've entered the Star Trek era.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.880]   Hey, this is welcome to the future, Patrick Norton.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.080]   Well, yeah, but I mean, you know, the end of the year wrap up for 2009.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   I was like, think about it.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.560]   I'm on the highway doing 70 miles an hour.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.920]   I find out that one of my childhood icons of punk rock is dead.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.480]   I don't have it out on my iPhone that I can mystically download this song at.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   Amazing.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.880]   I mean, and then play it on my truck.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.960]   And by the way, I can do video on the screen savers in 1999 was 2000.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.840]   We were building a car MP3 player, which basically involved a beige box in the back trunk.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.560]   And it's like, and now you can do, you know, an iPhone has everything.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.760]   It does everything it does.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:37.400]   It does it with a better interface and a simpler interface and a safer interface.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.200]   I mean, that's 10 years later.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   And we're in the future.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   Well, yeah, it does.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   Like, I don't, and you're still wearing barriers.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.360]   Well, you know, I don't think they want to jetpack.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.120]   They're with my favorite.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.840]   I'm actually.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:50.840]   NASA has one of those.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.840]   Did you see that?
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.640]   The one where it's like the plastic container with the.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   Yeah, I'm not going in that.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.840]   It's complicated technology that took the Marine Corps a decade to sort out down in
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.520]   the desert down it, you know, an Edwards Air Force base and we're going to wrap it around
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520]   a single person.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.240]   I want to be excited about it, but it terrifies me.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.240]   So you've not historically been a Macintosh fanatic.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:14.440]   No, I was actually, I was a Mac.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.240]   So you use it on iPhone?
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.600]   Well, I was like 1990 to 1995.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.080]   I never touched a PC.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.200]   And then I started using PCs when Windows 95 came out.
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:29.120]   Now I've got like, I think one, two, three Mac and Tash is two iPhones and Apple TV, a
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.360]   couple of random iPods, four PCs and a couple of them.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.720]   Of us.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.400]   One of us.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.640]   I wonder if everything I travel amongst all the drives.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.840]   Everything that doesn't have the same ring.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.960]   I got to ask you flat out Mr. Le Porte.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.560]   Are you going to buy one in which model are you going to buy?
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.560]   Hell yeah.
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.960]   Are you going to buy the stripped down Wi-Fi version?
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.600]   Well, I can't wait 90 days.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.000]   So I only have a choice.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   You're going to buy both.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.720]   You're going to buy the Wi-Fi version and then as soon as the 3G version comes out,
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720]   you're going to buy that.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.440]   But first I thought, oh Steve, just they couldn't, you know, I bought that line where he said,
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.320]   you know, it takes the regulatory approval and the deals with the phone company.
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.640]   It's just going to take us 90 days.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.680]   I just realized you're absolutely right.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.320]   Steve's figured out a way to sell two of these to every one of us.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.320]   I agree.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.480]   Were you shocked at the idea of AT&T like two things go.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.480]   Shocked.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.480]   No contract.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.880]   No one, no contract.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.120]   Two, having the price because as I, you know, part of the reason I stayed was sprinted
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.120]   is my EVDO modem.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.120]   The service was good.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.120]   The speed was good.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.960]   The coverage was outstanding.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.960]   There's no data cap.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.320]   And then finally like tailing the, you know, 2000, that all bleeds together, 2000 like
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:43.080]   2008, 2009, they finally followed AT&T and Verizon with the data cap on wireless 3G,
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.080]   right?
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.120]   And now you're looking at, because in three, you know, three movies off of iTunes and you've
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.840]   almost blown through your monthly.
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.800]   250 megabytes is not enough.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.960]   Even even five, but five gigs may not be enough.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.920]   We're doing for your all you can eat.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.360]   And he said unlimited, unlimited data.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.360]   It's really interesting.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   You think it's really unlimited or it's five gig unlimited?
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.240]   Well, if it's five gig limited, then it's not unlimited.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.240]   It's five gigs.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   That's what AT&T calls it.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.440]   A lot of web browsing.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:13.800]   But if it's, if it's actually unlimited for 30 bucks a month, then it's amazing.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   Then it's amazing.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   Major deal.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   That is half of what you're charging.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.920]   Well, I was like, you think, Merlin, you think they're, you think they're, that's the
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.920]   special.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.280]   Well, I have friends who download things from the internet.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.000]   I don't personally do it, but I'm so much familiar with the facts and the data around
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   these issues.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.640]   And I'll tell you that a one hour TV show at 480 is about 175 megs.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.720]   I saw them touting an HD device on this thing.
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.000]   And unless they're serving that for free, you're going to, I mean, you're right.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Exactly.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.440]   You blow one HD movie is going to blow your entire budget.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.440]   Yup.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.440]   And we, and we're.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.440]   Oh, no, I ruined it.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.440]   I broke the show.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:56.800]   You broke it.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   You broke it.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   I broke back break.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   Broke the internet.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.800]   Well, I was just going to say, you know, here's the MyFi card.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.080]   I've got the MyFi card.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.160]   I've got Wi-Fi.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   I'm happy with it.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.120]   I'll probably, I don't even know if I need 64 gigs, to be honest.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:15.000]   I think, I think, I mean, at this point, I'm using, I want to say I'm using eight and
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   a half gigabytes.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.840]   I don't have a lot of music on my iPhone right now.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.040]   But if you want to start traveling, 16's plenty.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.960]   Like 16's plenty is still have my iPhone or actually I'm using a Nexus one.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   768.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.200]   So you don't really need a high def movie.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.360]   Not that iTunes movies are high.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.720]   What is the resolution of this 10 to 24 by 768 I was sold.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   So it's 720p.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   No, not.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   It's more than 720p.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.080]   So the screen size is exactly the same as a Kindle.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.120]   It's exactly the same as a Kindle DX, I think.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.360]   Oh, interesting.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.680]   I was actually pleasantly shocked that they're talking 10 hours of battery life.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.920]   I want to, you know, what I want to find out is, you know, get it in the, in the real
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.240]   world and see if that's the classic, you know, 10 hours with Wi-Fi turned off and,
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.760]   you know, I immediately pictured nothing's going.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.840]   It's 10 hours, but if you use it, we lost them.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.840]   Hold on.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.840]   Hello.
[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   I would lost them.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.840]   There you're back.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.160]   Can you hear us now?
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.320]   We lost the audio.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   Are you there?
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   Okay.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.320]   We got the video.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   We can hear us now.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.160]   This is trying to use the iPad.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.960]   What's funny is we're getting the, it was just Steve was, Steve flushed the Wi-Fi earlier.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.840]   Okay.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.680]   We can hear you.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   We can hear you, Leo.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.680]   Can you hear us?
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:27.680]   Yes, I can.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.680]   Okay.
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   Great.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.880]   Well, then, higher way.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.680]   So I mean, is everybody excited?
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.040]   I mean, I did not expect to have any interest in this except that I think it's like, and
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.560]   I was thinking like maybe as a navigational tool for the truck, like the perfect mobile
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.600]   match for the truck, and I got to say at $500, like, don't tell my wife, but I won't
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.600]   want.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:49.080]   And I wasn't really expecting to want a tablet.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.440]   What about the lack of portability?
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.280]   This doesn't really feel like something you're going to carry around in your backpack.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:01.060]   I've been carrying around a 13 inch, 15 inch notebook for several, well, actually over
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.360]   a decade at this point.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.240]   So it feels to me like something maybe, maybe I'm wrong on this.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.760]   What do you guys think of the studio?
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.480]   It's something that you put on the living room, you know, on the coffee table.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.840]   I mean, the thing is, as what exactly what Patrick was saying, I have my laptop is on
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.840]   my back about 80% of the time I'm out of my house.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:20.840]   This is just a small approach.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:21.840]   And this is good enough to replace it.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.600]   I have a 17 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.120]   I would like to replace it.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.360]   Something more portable would be would be very great.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.360]   Yeah, love it.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.840]   Sharing around a cafeteria tray and pretending it's a notebook is a painful process.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.520]   You have a top that runs OK on batteries.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.160]   It's like I was pleasantly surprised because my running joke is like I could almost go
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.120]   without a notebook, you know, except in heavy content creation mode.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:51.000]   If I had the ability to plug a USB or Bluetooth keyboard into my iPhone, I thought it was
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.240]   very interesting they came up with that keyboard doc.
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:57.120]   That was a shocker there and it's like if the keyboard doc is there, which means they
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.440]   basically this is this is also I bet the I bet the air vaporizes in.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.280]   Yeah, there's no there's no need for an air is there?
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:04.800]   This kills off the air.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   It's cheaper.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:11.000]   This you buy the dock and it's a really decent notebook and it's a pound and a half notebook.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.640]   It doesn't have a webcam though.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.840]   You don't have a camera.
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:20.000]   So it doesn't really how often do you really use the web camera on a notebook?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   We use it.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.160]   I use it fairly often actually daily.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.440]   Yeah, but it was never I never use it.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.040]   So you actually use it.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.560]   You actually use it other than for recording podcasts.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.480]   Yes, yes, I do.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.480]   Really?
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   Okay.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.200]   Because I know people do and I've had a lot of fun like Skype, dude.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.200]   Skype.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.720]   No, why I use this is one of the ways my mother gets to see her grandchild in Skype.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.760]   So yeah, I figure you'll do that at home with the laptop or with the desktop.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.040]   Well, it'd be nice to be able to do it everywhere in the car with the magic device or maybe
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.720]   this may have also been something where AT&T was like, no, we'll give you your little
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.240]   cut rate data plan.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.840]   We'll give you your you know, maybe they but we're not we're not dealing with streaming
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.840]   video.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.360]   Let's address that because this is clearly a very locked down device.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.560]   I mean, there's you know, there was a guy walking more so than usual.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.720]   Guy was walking by with a sign saying welcome to the Apple zone.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.920]   You know, no openness.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   Everything locked down.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.680]   It's pretty clear that this there's not going to be Skype on this device.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.120]   There's not going to be Google voice.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.960]   This is going to be even more locked.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.160]   I know it does have a microphone.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.160]   It does have a microphone.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.160]   No, it has a microphone.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.160]   Yeah, it has.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.480]   So it has a oh no wait, I'm sorry.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.480]   Maybe it doesn't.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.480]   It has no, it doesn't.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.200]   It has audio playback, but you could you could that's something you could easily build an interface
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.800]   for that would go into its dock.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.080]   I thought touch if you plug in one of these like the headset I'm wearing, they'd like
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.880]   to set a modic that you like, it will give it a microphone.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:42.880]   What is it?
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:50.520]   Given that, I mean, Steve, I mean, the not Steve Jobs letter to AT&T about the whole like,
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.200]   you know, we've given you the perfect device.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:53.520]   What are you people stupid?
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.520]   Right?
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.920]   And I don't see I don't see any upside for Apple in not letting Skype or any other.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.000]   You know, I see a huge upside.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.960]   In fact, if you thought that Apple was going to open it up to Verizon, ha ha, they're not.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.600]   They're still an AT&T shop.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:14.400]   And you know, maybe the AT&T at this point is desperate to keep Apple happy.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:20.480]   But I think that it with Skype already available on the iPhone, it seems unlikely that a AT&T
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.080]   could turn it off.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.000]   You know, for that, you know, I don't think you get video Skype, but as far as audio Skype,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.080]   there's I think that's why there's no camera.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:31.920]   Well, yeah, they could certainly there's no reason they can't put a flag on the software
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.960]   that prevents it from running on the iPad.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.280]   I think the uproar from the people who have just spent $500 and told that they can't use
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.720]   it as a, you know, a voice system would probably be insane.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:48.520]   It feels to me like a very close system, but you know, not that the Kindle isn't system.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.040]   You're, you know, the iTunes is a closed system.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.560]   You know, if it wasn't for CDs, iTunes would be completely closed down.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.960]   Merlin, you were going to say something?
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.360]   I think I'm going to say something bold.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.440]   I think we've turned a corner.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.840]   I think we've seen, I think we're seeing something that started.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:07.600]   I think it probably started when they started pushing out the VARS a few years ago.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.720]   I think this is a company that's making it clear that they're not afraid to leave people
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:15.880]   behind to define who their audience is rather than let the audience define what they want
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:17.160]   for better or for worse.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.160]   I think that I think we saw that with the iPhone and iTunes.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.360]   And now if you think this is going to be a platform that's suddenly going to turn into
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.040]   Linux, you need to walk away because this is going to get tighter and tighter.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.760]   And there is a, there is an input output just to make sure we're accurate.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.760]   I don't know.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.360]   I don't think it's actually built into the iPad, but there is a, or there is a microphone.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.440]   And I'm not sure whether that's a, there's a mic input.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.200]   I'm not sure whether it's a built in mic or it's, it's an input for a mic.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.300]   It must be in the dock.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.600]   It must be on the dock port, Alex, because I did not see a microphone input on the side.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.440]   It just listed in their, in their text.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.080]   It's mentioned on the site.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   They mentioned it on the site.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.320]   I guess, I guess a Merlin's, Merlin, I think that, that opening five or six slides in the
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.600]   presentation, that was, that was a shot across the bow of the entire cell phone, like the
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.600]   mobile industry.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.160]   It's like, we made 50 billion Q4.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.800]   We're bigger than Nokia.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   Watch out.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   And no kidding.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.760]   I mean, that was just, that was, that was a giant, you know, I can't say that.
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.960]   And Steve, a classic, classic Steve move though of deciding, something I said before is just
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.160]   they're so good at deciding who their competition is going to be.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.840]   And the reason it's such a frustrating company to try and chase is that they decide who they
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.400]   want to have chased them.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.560]   And you think you understand what war you're fighting with Apple, and then they just completely
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.560]   change the terms without asking you.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.560]   And that's what we saw.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.560]   And they're, they're not afraid to go out and say, here's who we defined our competition
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   as welcome.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:36.600]   Well, and they, and I think that they, you still have an advantage that you, that, you
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.520]   know, was seen as a disadvantage when Steve wasn't there, which is the integration of
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.040]   the hardware and the software.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:45.640]   And I think that being able to have control of both pieces of that puzzle, you're seeing
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   this.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.840]   You could not, I don't think you could make this device.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.240]   If you didn't have full control over the software and the hardware.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   Nope.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.360]   We're, thank you so much for coming by.
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.880]   I know this was kind of a joint wildlife.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:00.880]   Of course you are.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:01.880]   It always happened.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.360]   I've not even, this was kind of a joint production of a techzilla.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.880]   And do you want me to say anything?
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.800]   Well, I can, can I do a quick, we have a camera rolling?
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.440]   And in general, I'll put my mind down.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:18.280]   When I was in the Google's event, January 27th, there was an iPad and nothing else, Mr.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.280]   Laporte.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   Are you excited?
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.120]   I am actually, I think in some ways, put the microphone in my face.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.560]   I think it's, I'm so sorry.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:29.800]   Obviously one of us is a professional here and I have a MIFI.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.960]   So I'm not going to worry about 3G.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.560]   I think a lot of people won't need 3G.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.760]   I think Wi-Fi is everywhere and Wi-Fi is fast.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.440]   Wi-Fi is practically free.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.440]   Why not just go with Wi-Fi?
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:40.800]   20 bucks says you buy two of them.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   Yeah, you might be right.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   It might be right.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:50.200]   I really think that the low end one at $4.99 for 16 gigs with Wi-Fi only is actually pretty
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.200]   compelling product.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.440]   That's going to replace my Kindle on day one.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   Really?
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.440]   You're going to drop your Kindle.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.440]   Absolutely.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.440]   Did you go in there and try it?
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   Well, you're going to run the Kindle app on there.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.080]   It felt, I was actually shocked that the interface feels awesome.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.160]   The screen is gorgeous.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.480]   The photos look great on it.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:12.600]   I want it right now just to use the Google Maps in my truck.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:14.760]   It looks like the perfect navigational tool.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:18.680]   And probably for people to do GIS, except for the fact that it's on a Windows platform,
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.360]   there's people who are probably sitting there going, "It's perfect.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   It's the perfect tool."
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.560]   It'd be interesting to see if there's a vertical market.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.640]   I think this is definitely a mass market product that's going to have a tough sell initially
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.240]   because it's a new category.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:32.840]   People say, "Well, I have a laptop or I have a phone.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.920]   I don't even know what this is.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.920]   Do I need it?"
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.200]   As soon as they go to an Apple store and they have this experience, I think they're going
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   to buy them.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:44.360]   I think it's also means the death of the MacBook Air because they came out with keyboard adapter,
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:46.160]   the dock immediately.
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.200]   I could dump my notebook.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.080]   Is this the death of the netbook?
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:53.920]   No, because there's a lot of people who like running Windows and Linux.
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:58.960]   And there's people who, there's a lot of people out here in the world who still despise
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.040]   Apple and they consider it.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.240]   A lot of people think about Apple the way a lot of people think about BMW.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.600]   Yes, it's a wonderful, perfect driving machine, but everyone who drives them are evil.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   I will never.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.760]   I think you could say that when Apple had devices that looked like computers, where they had
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.360]   keyboards and a screen, they were just another flavor.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.960]   I think what Apple's done here is very significant.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:25.440]   I think they've gone from being another flavor of computer to a new device and there is no
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:26.720]   equivalent.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   And I think in some ways what Apple's done here is truly remarkable.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.360]   They've actually created a new category.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   This is what they, I'm sure, hope to do.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.680]   This is my new jet pack.
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.080]   This is Star Trek.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.760]   And I think that people are going to be using the thing that's unique about this is it gets
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:42.240]   out of your way 100%.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.720]   That's what we always wanted with technology is that the technology gets out of your way
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.920]   so you can use it in a natural fluid way.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:52.840]   And I think this is the first device I've seen that really does that.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.200]   And what do they say?
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.960]   75, like 75 million people already on the iPhone or the iPod touch and it's a seamless
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.680]   transition to the new interface.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   Nicely.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:08.040]   When you hold this thing and you start using your finger, what mouse, what keyboard, it
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.280]   gets out of the way.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:11.360]   And I think that that cannot be underestimated.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.120]   There's a real significance to that.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.520]   And I don't think we really know yet how important that is.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.920]   We may look back and say, this is when the computer changed into something completely
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.920]   different.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   Oh, it's so funny.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.920]   Like, you know, I was joking at your end of the year show.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.640]   Like, I have my jet pack, you know, and I'm on the highway.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.960]   I'm downloading music.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.400]   I'm listening to stuff.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.400]   It's my cell phone.
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:29.400]   It's my computer.
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.400]   It's my tri-corner, right?
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.400]   It's my communicator.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.080]   Were you surprised that there was no video camera in it?
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   Not at all.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   I didn't expect one.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.080]   In fact, I have a checklist.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.240]   I thought that they were going to keep it simple.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.040]   And there's a really compelling reason to do that again, to get out of the way.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.440]   It's not a geek device.
[00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:44.840]   It doesn't have a lot of ports.
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.840]   It doesn't have a dock.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.840]   It doesn't have an HDMI port.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.000]   It doesn't have a mini display port.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.600]   It doesn't have USB on it.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.880]   It doesn't have a keyboard unless you buy one.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.200]   It doesn't have a camera.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.280]   It is something different.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.840]   And if you think of it as a computer, you're going to say, well, it's missing all this
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:58.840]   stuff.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.960]   Think of this as an appliance, which is really what started the Macintosh, right?
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.800]   Alan Kay said, I want to make a computing appliance.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.360]   This is an appliance.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.200]   I think the man is gone mystical on us.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.360]   You love Mr. LaPorte.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   Thank you so much.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.360]   My pleasure.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.360]   Thank you, Patrick Norton.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.400]   My old buddy, the bear, ladies and gentlemen, before we get on and we have some great people
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.920]   coming up, including Jason Snell from Macworld Magazine, Ryan Block from GDGT.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.320]   Tom Merritt is here from Buzz Out Loud.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.320]   Everybody's here.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.320]   It's a great event.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.480]   I do want to mention one more sponsor, a great sponsor.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.120]   We've loved for a long time.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   The folks at, excuse me, Squarespace.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.400]   In fact, we're using Squarespace right now for our in-house blog at inside.twit.tv.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.480]   You could take a look.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:46.520]   But if you go to squarespace.com/macbreak right now and look at, they call it, I think, the
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.800]   demos, but really, there's real sites using Squarespace.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.920]   You'll see the variety of Squarespace experiences.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:54.400]   It's really remarkable.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.240]   Squarespace is not a blogging engine.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:02.400]   It is a web host, starting at $8 a month, that has the most amazing software you've ever
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.400]   seen.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.600]   Talk about getting out of the way.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.560]   This software allows you to pick a beautiful template to start with, then customize it
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:13.080]   to make it your own, create websites that look gorgeous, work better than any other site
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:17.600]   because of their amazing VPS technology that allows them to add server bandwidth when it's
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   needed so you never get slashed out of their dug.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.680]   You could stay up no matter what happens.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.920]   I have to say, you're going to want to take a look at this.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.000]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   No credit card needed.

[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.080]   So we are continuing Macbreak Weekly.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.440]   We are outside the Moscone Center.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.640]   We're going to take a little break while we change batteries.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:07.160]   If you guys want to talk amongst yourselves, Merlin was only going to be on for one hour.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.000]   I think you're having fun, aren't you, Merlin?
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.920]   Yeah, I've been peed three times.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.920]   In your pants?
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.280]   Merlin, I'd like to keep back to you in the studio.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.840]   We'll be back live from Moscone Center as we continue our compulsive, obsessive coverage
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.840]   of the iPad announcement.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.720]   Yeah, OCD iPad coverage.
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.080]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.640]   You get the impression that Leo likes it?
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.640]   I think Leo.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.640]   Well, he touched it.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.880]   They put the magic sauce on it.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.520]   I think that was part of the...
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.280]   Now, a couple of housekeeping things while people are talking...
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.640]   While he's getting changed over, we had a couple of inputs.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   We don't know...
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:46.720]   There is a microphone.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.920]   We don't know that it looks like it's a built-in microphone.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.920]   Because there's also a three-point...
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.200]   He was saying built-in.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.440]   I think that from the specs that we see on...
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:58.120]   We haven't seen one, but it looks like there's a built-in microphone as a correction.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.200]   There's a 3.5 millimeter stereo headphone jack.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   I'm assuming that that's going to be a three-peron...
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:05.120]   A sleep-sleeve tip.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.240]   So that might give us another way to do audio input.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.440]   I don't know that for sure.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.320]   We're just kind of looking at that.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.360]   It does look like there is a USB connection.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.720]   I don't know whether that's through the dock or directly into the iPad.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.560]   It does say that charging is via power adapter or USB to computer system.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.880]   So it does look like there's a USB system.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.880]   There is also a...
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   It's an accessories.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   There's some accessories.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.120]   The camera connection kit.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.120]   Now, this does not look like it is a...
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.840]   This is not a connection kit that is going to let you get a live feed from your camera.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:43.080]   It looks more like this is designed so that you can import data from either a USB connection
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:49.360]   from your camera or from the camera's USB cable or from an SD card.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.040]   But for photographers, some people were asking about this.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.840]   Am I going to be able to put my photos in?
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.000]   So you can be in the field.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.400]   Then you can be throwing photos in there and doing whatever you need to do with them once
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.760]   they're there very, very quickly.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:04.240]   So that's a very interesting opportunity there.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.560]   A couple of other things as far as some tech specs.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.760]   Then you can get these all, of course, on the Apple Store.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.200]   But interesting things here.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.720]   There is a video out.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.040]   So your standard VGA adapter.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:20.120]   Or you can use the composite AV cable and Apple composite AV cable and get 576.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:26.320]   That's PAL or 480p or interlace both out of the AV cable.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   So there is a video out.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   It can handle H.264 video up to 720p.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.840]   Now it's not going to play it back at full resolution there.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.640]   But obviously because it's a...
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.520]   Because it doesn't have a screen size that's 720p.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.640]   But it is a capable of playing that back, which means that somewhere down the road.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.600]   Or if you want to play it out to a TV, we would assume that you would...
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.440]   Oh, it still says support for 1024x768.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.800]   I think mostly if you download an HD video that you're going to use on a couple of different
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.760]   devices, then you want to watch it at full resolution when it plays back here or when
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.120]   it plays out of its connector.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.200]   It's going to be a little bit smaller than that.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:05.480]   It's got to fit in 1024x768.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:15.080]   So it's conservative, but also it looks like all of the basic pieces that we would want.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.080]   It's very interesting.
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.080]   It is interesting.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.080]   There are people...
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.760]   I mean, when he first announced it earlier today, watching the chat room, there are a
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:28.280]   bunch of people just saying, "Oh, it's just a big iPod touch.
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.960]   It's not really that big a deal."
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.880]   So maybe I mean, who said it is something that you have to get your hands on to really
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.080]   understand and to see how it works, but is that going to be a downside?
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:41.800]   I mean, Merlin, do you think that's going to be something that's going to be a negative
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:44.480]   that it's just a bigger iPod touch?
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.320]   Again, not amongst the people who would make a buying decision about this.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:52.120]   I'm maybe I'm beating this into the ground, but I think there's easy straw men to be made
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.600]   out of going who will and won't buy this.
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.400]   I mean, the people who buy this are the people who buy it, the kind of people who buy iPhones.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.720]   I mean, there's a giant number of people who would buy this thing if it was like a big
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.640]   piece of poop with an apple logo on it.
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.960]   But I mean, I think a lot of people, again, it's very viral.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:12.200]   You see somebody with a blackberry and that looks like a pocket quarterback game I had
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   when I was 11.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.280]   You see somebody with an iPhone, you go, "That is a really polished piece of equipment."
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:22.160]   Now, the other side of the phenomenon that Leo describes of using an apple hardware
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.920]   product for a while, it's kind of like you hear these stories about people coming over
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.440]   from Windows and getting on an apple for a week.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:31.480]   They've been on Windows their entire life.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:35.400]   Windtail, I should say, and that's not just the software.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   But you know what I'm saying?
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.960]   You get on the apple for a week and then you go back to Windtail.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.960]   -Sagali.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   -Well, I realize-
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:41.960]   -I realize-
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.280]   -Here's a question I have for you though.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.000]   This is another thing that I think is a key issue as you look at the expansion of the iPhone
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.640]   and the expansion here is, and this is something that the Kiki was bringing up was, "How does
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.800]   this affect flash?
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   We do not hear flash.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   Obviously, it's not going to play flash."
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.720]   -I can get my resume together.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.720]   -What?
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.960]   -I mean, flash is going to be around for a while.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.320]   I think it's much more interesting that he demoed something from YouTube.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.560]   I'm kind of surprised.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:07.840]   There were so many predictions about how this was going to be the big opportunity for Apple
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.120]   to really formally make a break from Google.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.280]   The default search is going to be Bing and so on and so on and so on.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:19.600]   I thought it was kind of interesting that he did show YouTube content rather than choosing
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:23.120]   to go somewhere else like Vimeo or something just to make a point.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.560]   Flash the flash.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.200]   I mean, read the stats.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:31.040]   Again, Gruber posted this thing talking to people about the number of crashes in Safari
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.800]   that are related to quote unquote "plug-ins."
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   -Oh, no.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   -It's totally buggy.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.000]   -Well, and I think that this is a real issue for Adobe because a lot of their future has
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.760]   been based on this and the issue that you get into is that without, I think we talked
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:47.440]   about this, but I've talked to people who have to rebuild their whole site because the
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.760]   CEO can't watch it on his iPhone.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.760]   -There's two.
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:56.160]   It's ridiculous to me that the two most, there are two kinds of entities that do
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:00.600]   tend to use all flash sites, bands, and restaurants.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.760]   It's mind-blowing to me.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:02.760]   How many bands?
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.760]   -It's so annoying.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.960]   -The two things that you want information about when you're out and about are completely
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   inaccessible.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.640]   You get a single icon that says, "This site sucks."
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.600]   -We are back.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.520]   We've done the reset here and we're going to send it back.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.560]   Leo, we are sending it back to you.
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.040]   -You know, it's funny.
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:25.080]   Of course, Steve is pulling up the New York Times front page and everybody in the audience
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.520]   laughed because what do you see?
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.320]   That little Lego block, no flash support.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.440]   You didn't have to say no flash support.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:35.080]   It immediately scrolled down.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.240]   I was hoping when he was playing with the New York Times site that he would click on
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:43.640]   the live blogging entry because it would have been very meta to watch him.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.960]   -I don't think the journalists in that room were disciplined enough to not take advantage
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:48.960]   of that and exploit it.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:51.200]   -You know, Steve's thinking a little faster than I am.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.200]   Andy Inaco is here.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.200]   Chicago's Sun Times.
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.640]   He's back from playing with it and he'll tell us how it was.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   -And Leo, Leo, we're not getting Andy's mic.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.640]   -Can we check his mic?
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:01.520]   -Oh, make sure your mic's on here.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.520]   Let's see.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:03.520]   It is an on.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.040]   Now it's on and now we can see.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:06.040]   So say that again.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.360]   -We were failed by an analog control.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:09.960]   -Switch was up.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:10.960]   -I think.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.760]   -No, I was just saying that it would have been funny if Steve had clicked on the live
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.160]   blogging on the New York Times to see the live blogging.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.720]   -I was just imagining the king of controlling these things, essentially putting up a live
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   window in which journalists in that room could type whatever they wanted.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.960]   Everybody would have to read it.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.520]   -Like, "Ma, I'm on stage."
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.440]   -Good thing I already bought my Kindle to cost half this much.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.440]   Andy Inaco is here.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.680]   Chicago's Sun Times.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.960]   You were just playing with the iPad also with this from GDGT Ryan Block.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   Hey, Ryan.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.960]   -Hey, thanks for having me.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   -Tell me.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   What do you think?
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   -It's heavy.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:43.960]   It's a little...
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:44.960]   I mean, that's the first...
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:45.960]   -I mean, a pound and a half and you think it's too heavy?
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.040]   -It doesn't sound very heavy, but when you're used to the feel of an iPhone or a mobile
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.640]   device and you get it in your hands and most people don't really play with slate style
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   devices, it feels...
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.480]   I mean, it's not bad.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.960]   It's not unreasonable, but it is...
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:00.960]   -No, I know what you mean.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.680]   -Yeah, it's just definitely a little heavier than...
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:05.480]   I would like to see it a little bit lighter.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.080]   -On the other hand, that could have felt flimsy.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.280]   This felt very solid.
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:12.200]   It's a unibody aluminum with beautiful kind of curved back.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.720]   I think the industrial design of it is gorgeous.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.720]   -It's great and it feels absolutely...
[00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.840]   It feels like a brick.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.320]   I mean, it's been in the past few years and years, which is great.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.680]   So you've got that trade off.
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:27.680]   It's not...
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.480]   You're obviously not putting it in your pocket, right?
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:33.120]   So the weight is not that big of a deal in most cases.
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.000]   -I have to ask you because this is...
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.400]   You cover CE.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.200]   First of all, the A4 chip.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.200]   What the heck is this?
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.240]   Apple designed its own CPU?
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:43.320]   -Yeah, I think that we've got a little bit more to learn about this.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.560]   I don't know if when they say A4, they're referring to the ARM specification.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.240]   -Because there's an AA, which is a cortex.
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.240]   -Yeah, and then they're actually...
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.760]   They came back from AA cortex and they're bringing the numbers down a little bit
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:57.360]   because they're changing the architecture, but the new lower numbers are actually faster.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.040]   I haven't heard of A4, and so I don't know if this is ARM yet.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.720]   -I noticed, though, I was looking...
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:05.480]   Again, reading tea leaves here, but I was looking when he showed the picture of the motherboard
[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:09.080]   and they showed that A4 chip, and I wish I'd gotten a capture of it.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.000]   I'm sure somebody did.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.080]   We can maybe look a little closer.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.720]   But it had a chip number, and then it said OEM on it.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:20.760]   So I'm wondering if maybe it is an Apple designed ARM chip that is manufactured by somebody else?
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.520]   I'm wondering what that part is.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.520]   The other thing is...
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.720]   -It's almost definitely manufactured by somebody else.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:26.720]   -They don't have a fab.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.720]   -Yeah, probably Samsung.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.560]   I mean, that's how most ARM-based chips are.
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.280]   And that's actually how ARM itself works is they just design the specs.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:39.400]   They design some higher-level chip aspects, and then that just goes out and then companies
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.840]   like Samsung or whoever has the fab are the ones who actually make the chips.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.480]   -And the other technology was the IPS screen.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.640]   Do we know anything about that?
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.400]   -You know, I've still got a little bit of a research to do on this one.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.880]   I haven't seen a lot of products at this.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.840]   I haven't actually really met anybody who really knows the difference between IPS and anything
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:56.840]   else.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:57.840]   I mean, it's an LCD.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.440]   It's not the Pixel Qi display that some people have been talking about.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.640]   The Pixel Qi displays a little bit more like Eink.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.640]   So it's not that.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   It's not Eink.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.600]   It has that glass plate on the front.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   -Do we just lose it?
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.360]   -I thought it really looked good.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:19.800]   I played with the iBook Store and then I played with the reader, which I have to think is classics.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.760]   If you've used that iPhone application, it's the same bookshelf, the same page turn.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:24.280]   I think they must have licensed it.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.800]   But I thought it was very legible, very readable.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   -Yeah, but you're not going to take it outside.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:29.800]   And that's part of the problem here.
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.360]   I mean, if you've ever taken a unibody MacBook Pro outside, I mean, it is a nightmare.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.360]   You get so much glare.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.440]   It's just going to be really difficult to take with you anywhere out.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.440]   -That was a problem with the OLED screen.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.920]   -Okay, but that's 6.5 dozen the other.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.680]   You're also going to have the same problem if you're trying to read a Kindle on an airline
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:50.280]   and you don't have the light overhead just right.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.000]   -I prefer in bed reading to have backlight to be honest.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.520]   -I would much rather have a book that can be read in dim lighting than a book where I'd
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.400]   have to simply choose where I sit and how I turn.
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:05.320]   And the display, actually, someone's giving me information so quickly that I did not want
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.680]   to put down the iPad to pick up my pad so I actually wrote it on my hand.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   -He's written down in hand.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.680]   -It is.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:15.000]   So it's 1024 by 768 resolution, 132 dots per inch.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   -That's pretty good.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   That's very, very good.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.480]   Also, when you look at it really, really closely, that's certainly not the same resolution as
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.560]   the Kindle screen, but the thing is it's anti-aliasing a lot better.
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.320]   I think their font rendering is a lot better.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.160]   I would have to say that side by side, it's at least a push because the advantages of
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.560]   the Kindle are not the advantages of this display.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:40.360]   I did play with all the games that they had on the samples were just standard iPhone
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.360]   games.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.600]   I played with Assassin's Creed, blew it up to full screen.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.200]   I didn't see any anti-aliasing.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.200]   There were a lot of jaggy's.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.200]   It didn't look very good.
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:52.160]   It probably isn't what people were going to want to do.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:55.520]   In most cases, I think you're either going to play it at the 1X size where there's a
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.240]   small window within the big window or better yet you're going to get a custom built application.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:04.240]   -I'm very curious to see if part of the package specification for these new applications is
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:08.400]   that I can develop an ebook application or game application that has both sets of codes
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:09.400]   inside it.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:12.920]   If someone has to sell two copies of it, they will simply know what it's being launched
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:13.920]   on.
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.400]   It is an LED backlit display, which is a good looking display.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.400]   -Yeah.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.200]   The display looked amazing.
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.720]   The thing that they actually didn't really touch on and that you just mentioned in a
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:30.360]   ways, they talk about how the original native iPhone apps or iPhone OS apps as it were.
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:31.680]   -Run out of the box.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:35.640]   They run out of the box and so you have the regular resolution, the 480x320 and then you
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.720]   hit 2X, the button that says 2X and it blows up to the full screen size.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.120]   But the display at 1024x768, that's not actually 2X.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:45.200]   That's actually a 4X resolution increase roughly.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.200]   -Yeah.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:49.000]   -So it's 2X this way and 2X that way.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   -Therefore, it's quad.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   So I mean, that's a huge resolution increase and it actually looked pretty good.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   I mean, it did not look bad.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.320]   I've seen really, really bad upscaling in applications before in situations like this.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.640]   -Maybe I just picked the wrong app.
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   -Yeah.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:04.120]   No, I mean, I thought it looked pretty decent.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:07.240]   -The app that I really would have liked to see is like the Kindle app or Stanza.
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:12.280]   Like when you scale that up 2 to 4 times, do you get font scaling for free or does it
[00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:16.800]   simply render it out at iPhone screen resolution and then simply scale it as pixels?
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:21.560]   -Well, I think out of box, yeah, it's probably not going to render those fonts at scale.
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.160]   But I mean, I'm sure that'll issue an update or a different version.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:28.000]   -SDK ship today, so presumably people can look at it and we'll get more information
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.680]   as people have looked at it.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:31.200]   Maybe this afternoon we can get some calls.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:36.120]   Developers who've downloaded it, I'd be curious how difficult it is to port an existing iPhone
[00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.000]   app over to the iPad.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.240]   -Yeah, I'm assuming it's not very difficult.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.440]   I mean, it's the same OS.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.600]   Actually, I went into the settings and said iPhone OS 3.2.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.600]   -That's interesting.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.160]   -Yes, I mean, it's the same thing.
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.040]   It's just, you know, it's going to have some new hooks and some new APIs and obviously you
[00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.320]   got to build for a different resolution.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.840]   -Berlin, you had something to say about that?
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:56.000]   -Oh, no, no, no.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:59.840]   I was just, it was interesting that Ryan caught that.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:04.480]   It looks like my pal Tim over at Omnigre was saying the Dev site was down.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.720]   So I think a lot of people are probably banging on it right now.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.320]   -Oh, I bet they are.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:11.520]   I'm trying to log in right now, yeah.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:14.200]   -Andy, I love it that these guys, you know, these are the real journalists.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.120]   I'm going, "Ooh."
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.600]   And Andy tried to do a screenshot.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:21.440]   -Yeah, I was trying to see how much of the iPhone experience was translated over there.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.560]   The only thing that I, the only trick you can do on an iPhone, you cannot do on this
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:26.320]   that I tried was a screenshot.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:31.080]   The organizing icons, exactly same behavior, cut, copy and paste, exactly same behavior.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.560]   One interesting thing for guys like me who are really interested in that mechanical keyboard,
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:37.920]   all the little fan button commands will actually also work for cut, copy and paste.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.920]   You can do command C, command V off the keyboard.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.320]   -If you have the external keyboard, you know what else I noticed?
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:49.800]   The actual, the dock space on the bottom, you know, your home dock space on the device.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.320]   They showed it with four icons.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.440]   You can get up to six in there though.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.880]   So unlike the iPhone, which is stuck at four unless you jailbreak it, you can get up to
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:00.760]   six, which is limited to, it looked like five home screens plus the search screen.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:02.320]   The search screen is still there, which is interesting.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.600]   -I'm sure you could do more than five.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.080]   I mean, you could do more than five home screens.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:06.080]   -I guess so.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.080]   We could drag it over.
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.080]   I didn't try that.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:09.080]   -Yeah, no.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.680]   They only showed it with just a few apps on there.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.680]   We couldn't see the iBook store.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.480]   We couldn't see the iTunes store.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.640]   All the store stuff was kind of hidden functionality right now.
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.400]   They wouldn't, they didn't have that open.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.120]   But I mean, you know, you got to play around with the email client, the web browser.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.120]   They look amazing.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.240]   -How was typing for you using the keyboard?
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:29.320]   -You know, I'm actually kind of curious to hear how Andy felt about it.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.680]   I felt that the vertical orientation did not work for me.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.680]   It was just too wide.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.840]   And I felt my thumbs are kind of short and stubby.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.400]   So it was not comfortable.
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.960]   The horizontal, the portrait orientation, I'm sorry, the horizontal orientation where
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:46.800]   you actually have to kind of get in there like a regular keyboard was not that bad.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.240]   I was actually kind of surprised.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.040]   I thought it was going to be terrible.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.200]   It was very decent.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.880]   It just really needed some haptic feedback of some kind.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.640]   -Well, there's no feedback at all.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.320]   -It's really a little difficult.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.760]   But I mean, it was surprisingly good.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.520]   -I described it as more touch-tappable than touch-tappable.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.160]   I could use all of my fingers and I could use the usual rhythms.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.480]   I just had to, I type it 110 words per minute.
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.360]   I had a slow way the hell down.
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:14.720]   I was hoping that because the virtual keyboard on the iPhone does a really good job of figuring
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:17.000]   out what you meant to type instead of what you actually typed.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.720]   It doesn't seem as though that really scales up in the iPad experience.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.120]   -I didn't see any predictive text at all.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.800]   -Well, it does a lot of correction.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.520]   I did see that in the demo on screen.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.400]   I wasn't paying attention to that when I was typing myself.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.560]   But the fact of the matter is I did, of course, have to take a picture of the results when
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:36.080]   I try to, my usual typing test and it's like, "Okay, that's perfect for a guy who types
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.520]   really well and makes lots of mistakes."
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.040]   -Really?
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:38.560]   -Great.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.600]   We're talking with Ryan Block of GDGT, GDGT.com.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   I bet you already quite a few people have want next to iPad on GDGT.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.720]   -As of this morning, it was like 150 people.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:56.120]   As of half an hour ago, just the last time I checked, it was like 1,500 people in county.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.360]   -I'll be adding that to my account.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:02.640]   -Yeah, a lot of people are adding that to their want lists right now.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.920]   -Any other thoughts you had?
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.240]   Any surprises?
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.640]   This seemed to go in some ways.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.120]   Exactly as one would have predicted it.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.760]   -I wish that it might have been a little bit more widescreen.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.360]   It's XGA 1024 by 768, which is fairly standard.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:21.080]   -Do you think Apple has done a really good job at making a lot of their products widescreen?
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   -Go ahead, Alex.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:24.400]   -Do you think that that has something to do with the cost?
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.240]   They were trying to keep the price down and one of the things about when you produce these.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.240]   -In the form factor.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.400]   -Yeah, the form factor gets a little bit weird if you were to make that widescreen too.
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:37.120]   I totally get it, but when they showed the demo of some of those movies in like 16 by
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.120]   9, -Big letterbox.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:43.520]   -Yeah, it was just a tiny strip of movie and then a huge black bars on other side.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.440]   -I wonder if there weren't UI problems with that too.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:50.760]   Given that you have a square of user interface, you're going to have to access with one finger.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:54.120]   If you have that widescreen display that gives you a little bit more to reach, as it was,
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:58.000]   I was a little bit surprised when that screen shot, when that photograph of the prototype
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.120]   leaked on and gadget yesterday, I didn't know whether it was a real prototype or just
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:03.120]   an early ID.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:07.400]   One of the things that maybe sort of doubted was the fact that all the UI was at the top
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   of the screen.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.720]   I figured that, "Gee, I bet Apple's going to know that if you're holding in the tablet
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.520]   like this, they don't want to make you reach up to do that sort of stuff."
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:17.720]   But of course, that was exactly the screenshot of maps that we'll find on the iPad.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.520]   One of the things they did very well, though, I thought is handled the orientation.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.840]   It rotates very swiftly, smoothly.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.480]   Every single mode you're in, if you just want to suddenly decide, "You know what?
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:28.120]   I'd much rather be using landscape mode."
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.120]   It works.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:33.400]   In the mail application, it also has two totally different articulations of the user interface.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.360]   One that makes perfect sense when you're in portrait mode, one that makes sense when
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.360]   you're in landscape mode.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:41.080]   I didn't feel like there was a single aspect to playing with the device.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:44.680]   I feel kind of guilty, but I took a long time to play with it.
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:47.960]   I'm sure that there were people who kind of get off the device.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:51.520]   I really tried to dig into it as much as I could.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.640]   I just could not find anything that was sluggish.
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.960]   I could not find anything that was half-baked feeling.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:59.360]   It felt so polished and so fast.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.040]   I was really, really impressed.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.440]   I was so blown away.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:08.560]   On other devices, when they try to do an animated page turn, it's more like, "Okay, I understand
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:12.440]   that you have now executed the page turn button and now I will do an animation for you."
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:16.560]   With this one, it felt like you were turning the bloody page.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:20.280]   You try to do ridiculous things like I'm going to do pinch and scrolling zooming on a web
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:21.520]   page as fast as possible.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.360]   It was keeping up with me, microsecond by microsecond.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.480]   There's nothing cheap or shoddy about this in the user experience.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:32.160]   I want to get back to what I said earlier, which is I think this is an example of a device
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.760]   where the device gets out of the way and it is very intuitive, it's snappy, it does what
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.760]   you expect it to do.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.280]   I think that that's what makes this a next generation device.
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.720]   I think that people right now are thinking netbook, they're thinking laptop, they're thinking
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.720]   iPhone.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.960]   This is a new category.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:49.400]   This is a next gen category.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:50.560]   I absolutely agree with you.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.400]   I was thinking about the things I took with me for this little three-day trip and the iPad
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:59:00.200]   could have easily handled everything, almost including even if I didn't bring the keyboard
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   with me.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:06.400]   I was live blogging from a netbook and I was just nothing but aware of all the limitations
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:10.040]   of having to do anything fast and productive on that tiny device.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:14.000]   I do believe that once I get my new iPad, a lot of things are going to be sent out to
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   Pastor.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   I totally agree.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:23.280]   This is the one part that I feel like the jury is out in terms of consumer usage.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.440]   I'm really excited about it.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.960]   I can't wait to get in play with it and see how it integrates.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.880]   I've got my small device from the go and I've got my larger device when I need to sit down
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.240]   and really get work done.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:39.280]   I'm not really sure that there's a place in my life for it right now.
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:40.280]   I'm going to have to see.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.720]   For me, I'm going to have to see a lot of people.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.320]   You've got your smartphone, you've got your laptop.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.960]   You need those.
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:51.120]   Those are the two core experiences that you have to have.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.480]   He didn't beat around the bush on this.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:54.480]   He was very clear.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   This is a third category.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.160]   It's not going to replace your laptop.
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.320]   It's not going to replace your smartphone.
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.440]   It would have been very foolish to say, "Oh, yeah, throw out your laptop.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:02.440]   This is going to be the next."
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:04.640]   I think it's fair to say that you need the laptop.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.640]   You need the iPhone, but you want the iPad?
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.960]   Yeah, no, I think that's a pretty good way of putting it.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.120]   We're going to have to see how it's going to bear out in the market.
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   We don't know how many people are going to buy these or how big this is going to be.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.160]   It feels a little like the iPod to me.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.120]   They're introducing it.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.320]   This is going to be a market that they're going to have to basically build from the ground
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   up.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:29.080]   They're going to have devices in the past just like there were MP3 players in the market
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:32.360]   prior to the iPod, but they really built that market from the ground up.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.720]   Isn't that what Apple does best?
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:38.600]   That's what Apple does best is create a market from the ground up.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.440]   That's the thing that's in the store.
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   Go ahead.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.680]   I think Apple is most effective at coming into an already established market and shaking
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.680]   it up.
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.680]   The iPhone is possibly the best example of that.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.680]   Yeah, but see, that's the thing.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.520]   They use the iPhone as a bridge.
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:54.160]   That's what's so amazing about it is in retrospect, if you think about how much you use your iPhone
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.160]   as a phone.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.400]   For me, it all forwards directly to Google Voice.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.160]   I touch it as little as possible.
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.320]   It's really a phone in air quotes.
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.320]   What they've done here, Leocube's calling it an appliance.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.240]   I think that's a great name for it because if it's that fast and that reliable and that
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:13.560]   responsive, the problem is you hold this little thing in your hand.
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:20.440]   I've got a workflow that involves simple note, pay spot, text expander where I can do really
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.040]   sophisticated blogging on here.
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:26.160]   It would pretty much blow your mind and yet every time I get into a text area, even with
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.560]   my girly fingers, this thing still feels like a toy.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.160]   What you got here is you've got something where if you're a journalist, if you're Andy
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.400]   and you do master the typing on this thing, this thing becomes a workhorse.
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.400]   Absolutely.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:40.600]   I don't know if I see it being like fun to use spreadsheets, but for...
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:44.120]   Well, that's actually a note that I made.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.920]   This is the first spreadsheet that looks like it might be fun to use.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:51.440]   But I think that what comes to mind is if you saw the HBO sort of drama documentary
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.960]   about the development of the hardware to land people on the moon, they did a whole episode
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.200]   on developing the lunar lander.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.720]   They're trying to save weight, save weight, save weight.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.520]   And then someone comes up the idea, "Well, what if we just take out the seats?"
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.400]   And then says, "Well, they got to have seats.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.800]   Well, who says they need seats?"
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.320]   It's a lunar lander that will grab these one six and then suddenly realize, "Wait a
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:11.440]   minute, we've been developing this like we're developing another spacecraft.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.800]   We need to develop something that's brand new for this task."
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.760]   It's possible that the iPad is brand new for this task.
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:19.880]   It will cause a lot of people not on the day of release, maybe not even 2010, but in
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:26.160]   2011, when it's time for them to buy a laptop and they have, let's say, a six or 700 budget,
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.080]   they've been sitting next to people on airplanes with these.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.400]   They've been sitting next to people in conference rooms and they'll go into the Apple store.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.800]   They'll realize, "You know what?
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:35.240]   I never really need to do 110 words per minute.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.840]   I just need to answer emails.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:39.880]   I don't need this big, but I don't need to run a huge software library.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:43.480]   I just need six core applications and there are at least three great examples of each
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.080]   one of them in the iPad library."
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.080]   All right.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.080]   We're going to take a break.
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:52.080]   Hold on just a second.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.000]   Dr. Keke is in the studio with Alex Lindsey and Merlin Mann with me from GDGT.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.440]   Ryan Block, we're going to let you go, but thank you so much for coming by.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.440]   Really great.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.440]   GDGT.com.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   Want.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440]   Want the iPad.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440]   Want.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.240]   Tom Merritt's going to join us in just a little bit.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:09.080]   Andy, if you'll stick around for a little bit, I guess it's time to talk about Audible.com/Macbreak
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:13.160]   is the place to go to sign up for your free audio book from Audible.
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:14.160]   We love Audible.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:21.600]   By the way, if it's iPhone 3.2, I'm pretty sure you're going to be able to put your
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.960]   Audible books on here, right?
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:26.520]   If it's iTunes, it looks like almost exactly like the desktop version.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.520]   I'm not sure.
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.480]   They'd be very spiteful to remove Audible support.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.400]   I think we got a new Audible device.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:33.360]   It's just been born.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.200]   What better way to listen to books just whenever you're in a situation where you can't hold
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.440]   a book, you can't read.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.120]   I like to listen to Audible books when I'm going to bed.
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.160]   It's like my mommy reading to me as I go to sleep.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.400]   It does put me out fast.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.480]   It's a really great way to listen.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:50.960]   It'll bore you to tears and put you out.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.880]   You got to pick a boring book, not an exciting book.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.160]   You'll never go to sleep at all.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:57.720]   I want you to go to Audible.com/Macbreak right now because it's your chance to get a free
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720]   book.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.720]   You'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.720]   That's one book a month.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:05.200]   That's not enough for me, but it's a good way to start and pick any book from their 70,000
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200]   book collection.
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:10.160]   You get a credit toward any book there and yours to keep even if you cancel.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.920]   Pick well, pick wisely.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.320]   What did you listen to in the plane out?
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:14.720]   On the plane out, I just wanted to put it up.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:15.720]   I saw you looking.
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.080]   I don't think you'll be able to see it, but Craig Ferguson's memoir/Autobiography.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   I can't read it.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   American on purpose.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.600]   I'm only about three chapters into books.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.800]   I just started it during the first of my three attempts to get out of here.
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.800]   He's got some sense.
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:30.520]   He hits it like this.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.960]   It's a little like Mr. Scotterscotter teller.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.800]   He's talking about how they used to have a little whip that they'd sell commercially for
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.360]   the schools in Scotland.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.440]   And that beat me on that.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.640]   Not only would you have to go up there, but you'd have to hold out your hand, which made
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.280]   it even doubly cruel.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.320]   And then you're like, you know what?
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.920]   The pool at my school wasn't heated.
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.800]   And now I feel as though that wasn't a big hardship for me.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.040]   Craig Ferguson is one of my...
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.200]   I think he's one of the heroes of the late night wars, frankly.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.320]   He just sat there quietly, did his job, and did I think the best late night television
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.320]   show of all.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.440]   Every single night, it's fresh, it's fun, I'm expected.
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:08.320]   I think he's the first person since Letterman to come into that 1130 to do a little bit of
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.880]   a 13-time slot and create something brand new as opposed to we'll do Dave Show or we'll
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.880]   do Johnny Show.
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.880]   I just think he's great.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:16.960]   In this book, I actually noted it myself.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.280]   I can't wait to read it.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   It's Craig Ferguson.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.280]   It was American by choice.
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:21.280]   American by choice.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.760]   It's him in an American flag, killed.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:29.080]   So I'm sorry, American on purpose, the improbable adventures of an unlikely patriot.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.080]   That's our pick of the week.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   So go to audible.com/macbreak right now.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.080]   Sign up for that gold account.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.560]   I can't believe you haven't done it yet.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560]   Come on, get going.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.160]   This is a great book to start with.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:40.160]   I'm telling you though, once you finish, you're not going to want to stop audible.
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:42.840]   It's the best way to listen to books.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.120]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.920]   We thank you for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:47.920]   Leo Laport here.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:52.320]   We're in front of the now rapidly emptying Erbobuina Center for the Arts.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.920]   We're just about an hour and a half ago.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.160]   Steve Jobs introduced the iPad.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.320]   It's a special edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   Here with me, Andy Inaco for the Chicago Sun Times and the Celestial Waste of Banwith.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.800]   Back in the studio, Alex Lindsay is holding down the fort.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.240]   Are you sitting on the ball, Alex?
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.880]   I am sitting on the ball.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.560]   In fact, right now I'm bouncing on the ball.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.800]   You've got to be careful about the ball.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.240]   I haven't had to do this like you have as long very often.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:16.480]   My legs start falling asleep.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.720]   They get that kind of numb.
[01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:23.200]   But I'm soldering through here in the studio, along with Kiki.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:26.080]   He's getting his inner thighs sweat all over.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.560]   You're actually following me.
[01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:30.920]   You've got to hose that to remind me.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:35.960]   Also in the studio, we gave Andy a big bottle of Purell and a kosher Coke.
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.120]   Andy, Andy, a bottle of Mexican Coke.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.160]   Oh, look at that.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.720]   Oh, Tom Merritt to the rescue.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:42.720]   Tom Merritt's here.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.320]   I'm going to have a daughter just so that I can have her marry you for this.
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:45.840]   Thank you.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.200]   How's that loud?
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:47.840]   That's seen it.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.520]   Hey, Tom.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.040]   Hey, Leo.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:49.480]   How's it going?
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.560]   Great to see you also in the studio, Merlin Manvia.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:53.880]   Skye, Merlin, we love you, Merlin.
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.800]   Hi, Leo.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.880]   Hi, violin.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.040]   I've been nice with the pad.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.080]   Hi, violin and Dr. Kiki.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:04.560]   Kiki Sanford, who is still using her Samsung NC10 netbook.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:08.120]   Kiki, do you think this would replace that NC10 that you love so much?
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.480]   I actually don't think that it would for me.
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.480]   It is the right size.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.880]   The tablet is the right size and the touchscreen display is something that is a definite plus
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.240]   that my netbook does not have.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:24.080]   However, even though Andy was talking about it being a workhorse and being able to do all
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.400]   these great things, there's no multitasking.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:34.400]   I cannot listen to Pandora while I'm working on whatever I have to be working on.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:42.080]   For a media device, I'm seeing a lack of integration between apps and different programs
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.960]   running at the same time.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.880]   That, to me, is a problem.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:49.760]   Another big problem is what you do with all the media that you're creating, like all the
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.160]   pictures you're taking, all the video taking, giving that there's no card slot, there's really
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.880]   just no way to get that stuff off of your camera and share it.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.120]   Well, you can stick it.
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.320]   There's actually a--
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.720]   Oh, right.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.720]   In the--
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.680]   They're looking at the website.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.680]   So they have more information on the computer.
[01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.680]   Yeah, we have the advantage of the website.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.680]   So there is--
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:07.680]   Also, it's a spark that--
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.640]   There's an actual accessory to do either a connection to your camera or an SD card straight
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.720]   into the-- into the-- into the computer or into the--
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.960]   That is super awesome.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.960]   Not that--
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.320]   I don't think-- I don't think it'll be a replacement, but I agree with you, Kiki.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.480]   I don't believe that's a replacement for things you'd bring a laptop for.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.920]   It's just that there are times when I have these little three-day jaunts where all I
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:31.440]   need to do is be able to write a couple thousand words and do things that are unitask sort
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.440]   of based.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.560]   I mean, I came out here for three days and I brought the netbook and my Macbook.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.200]   I could see a day where I-- actually, no, I brought the netbook, the Macbook, and my
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.200]   Kindle.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.440]   And so, within a world with the iPad, now I'm just down to the Macbook and this device.
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.000]   In a world with the iPad is the only--
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   It's an iPad.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]   What about--
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   It's a Kindle.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.560]   It's a music player.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.600]   You make a good point, though, Kiki, but that's a very specific application.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.480]   And I probably can play music in the iTunes store and use the iWork applications, for
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.480]   instance.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.480]   It's multi-tasking.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.600]   It just has to be Apple approved multi-tasking.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   Multi-tasking limitations?
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.600]   Is the iPhone OS?
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.120]   Yeah, that is a negative right there.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.560]   Because you want this thing to work more like a netbook, more like a laptop.
[01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:13.560]   And that includes multi-tasking.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:17.320]   It'll be interesting to hear Apple's future arguments against multi-tasking given that
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:20.760]   now they have a device with a much larger processor, they have a device with a much larger
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.520]   battery so that the two biggest arguments that they were making against it.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:28.160]   Now all this left over is that we feel as though putting a third-party app-- excuse me,
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.040]   third-party multi-tasking will destabilize the device.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.040]   It will let the terrorists win.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.040]   Well, but I think also--
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.040]   What do they say?
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.440]   I was going to say one of the issues with the multi-tasking also is that the way the interface
[01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   works.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.480]   When you're using a Mac, I think a lot of times you know how many things are running, or
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:43.760]   you roughly know how many things are running.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:47.480]   I think the one thing with the iPhone is that if it's multi-tasking, I think it's going
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:48.960]   to be very hard to know what's multi-tasking.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.080]   So you're going to have to build new tools that really allow you to click on it if it's
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.080]   starting to slow down.
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.080]   And right now it's an app killer.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.080]   You just have an app killer.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.080]   You just have an app killer.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.080]   It's a simple app.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.080]   But I think that's very fun.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.080]   But that's something Apple has learned.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.080]   As John Gruell has said, as Merlin has said, they see that as a negative that you have
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:05.080]   to have an app killer.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.440]   I don't see that as a negative.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.520]   I'm with you on that one, Kiki.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.000]   But I mean, it's sort of like saying, you know, I wish we had more rosaries in the Protestant
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   church.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.040]   It's a totally different outlook on using your device.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.720]   Like I said, if you're a stallman and you want to own the bias, well, then this isn't
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.720]   for you.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.720]   This is never was meant to be.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.720]   It was never was meant to be.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.720]   I mean, that's--
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:29.920]   Yeah, because they showed it in home situations.
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:30.920]   They showed it in sitting around.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.360]   They had the couch on the stage.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.800]   Like they're definitely pitching this not for Andy.
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.640]   But for somebody, you know, laying around the house and then you take your iPhone and it
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.520]   syncs to that with the New York Times app and all that stuff with the whisper sync type
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:45.360]   behavior so that you can take that on the road.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.920]   But it didn't seem to be emphasizing the mobile aspect of the mobile device.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.880]   I might have been imagining it, but there were many stretches during the first part
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.200]   of it where Steve was demonstrating it, where I think he sort of forgot he was on stage.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.000]   He was just reading something on his little toy device.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   It's playing with it.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:05.960]   I'm just wondering though, I mean, is it $4.99 a lot to pay for a giant remote control for
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.120]   my home media center?
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120]   I mean, that's--
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.840]   Oh, yeah, that's all you're doing.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.840]   The thing is, I think that--
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:11.840]   I think that--
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:16.320]   I will say though that I think that this is the first Apple release where I could say
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.080]   this is perfect for my parents.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.840]   This is as close to a laptop as my parents need to get.
[01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:21.840]   You know that they can--
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.280]   Well, I thought that putting it on a dock and having it be a photo frame, people pay
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:30.720]   for a 10-inch photo frame just about the same price.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.280]   There are so many things that got so totally wrong about what this device was like.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:37.800]   There's only one that I can really latch onto and say, "Okay, I think I got that one."
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:42.840]   That's the idea that fundamentally, this is going to be a $500 device.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:48.080]   That's a color touch display and electrons behind it and a connection to a network so
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.440]   that anything you want to do--
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   Sorry.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:53.440]   It's still in the background, don't worry about that.
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.440]   It's not to rush.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.440]   They're motocated.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.440]   Okay.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.160]   So anything that you might want to do that requires a big color display, this will do
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.160]   it for you.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.400]   Be it a photo frame, be it a book reader, be it a document processor.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.600]   I don't think that's why they chose such an absolutely generic name for it so that no
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:11.760]   matter what someone who quacks into the Apple store to buy, they can tell you, "Yes, the
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:12.960]   iPod is one of those.
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.480]   That's exactly-- it was designed exactly for you because it'll be so generic."
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.880]   Was it me or did they seem to underplay the video capability?
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.000]   I mean, they talked about it, but is it because they didn't get deals to--
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.520]   You got to think something like that.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.960]   That was-- the rumor was $30 or $15 a month deal with the networks.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.040]   You'd think they'd at least get Disney on board.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.280]   They always launch with one partner with these things and it's fine, they bring everybody
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.280]   else in later.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.400]   But this time, they didn't have anything new to say about video.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.120]   So maybe that's why they downplayed it.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.200]   I don't know if that was just a rumor that wasn't true or if this is something we'll
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.200]   see down the line.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.360]   I mean, they always like to roll these things out later and with new devices that you have
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:55.520]   to buy and give you an operating system on the old one.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.680]   But it won't work as well.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.840]   I'll tell you a new one next year.
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:58.840]   So maybe that's what--
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:00.440]   That's-- I was also pretty surprised.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.800]   We didn't hear any mention about textbooks because you want-- you think about a market
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:04.800]   that's tailor-made for this.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.800]   And by the way, McGraw Hill, not on that list anywhere.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.920]   Somebody's not wishing we had brief rep CEO a little bit better.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.920]   But yeah, but you talk about the automatic sale.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:17.360]   Kids, you're going to be $130,000 in debt minimum.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.080]   Why don't you kite it up to $130,500 and put all your books on this slide?
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:25.720]   So my kids school, they matriculate, they come in with it, they get a Mac book, a white
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.800]   Mac book when they get in the freshman year.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:33.160]   I can totally see the school saving $500 and giving them this device instead.
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.840]   And it's good for course wear and using it for course wear.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:38.480]   They're dying to put textbooks on this thing.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:39.480]   And you couldn't do it on the Kindle.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:40.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:42.480]   The DX even doesn't do it because it's not color.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.840]   I mean, look at a bar chart in black and white and forget it.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.040]   This is exactly what they're looking for.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.040]   Absolutely is.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.040]   I don't have a big room.
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.040]   I was just going to say.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.040]   Don't you have to speak?
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.040]   Go ahead.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.040]   Go ahead, Kiki.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.040]   No, no, you're the scientist.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.040]   Yeah, I was just going to say.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.720]   This is something that you deal with.
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:03.120]   Yeah, as somebody who's been in the educational system for an entirely too long period of
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:08.560]   time, this is a product that it that's where it's really going to have its huge benefits.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:12.960]   I mean, not having to carry around that stack of textbooks.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:18.120]   It might it might kill the textbook recycling industry where people sell back their textbooks
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:21.000]   at the end of a quarter.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.200]   In that way, and the way that university level professors can use it to develop course supplementation
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:32.960]   and graphic interfaces in different ways for students to be able to interface with the
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:37.320]   information they're taking in it, it's absolutely going to be beneficial right there.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.720]   So that's something I am getting positive.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:44.560]   It's no coincidence that the last release of iTunes added iTunes U to the iTunes interface.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.800]   And Steve mentioned iTunes U as one of the things on here.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.240]   This is an education device, whether they sell it that way or not.
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.520]   I'm excited to just to hear, just think about data visualization tools developed for this.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.480]   Like in a university setting where you can just simply play with it.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:14:59.480]   Here's a pile of numbers.
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.480]   Great.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.480]   We just slipped into this device.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:02.480]   Mathematica times 4000.
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:06.680]   Although it was a 90 minute announcement for one device.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:11.840]   So I can see why they dropped a couple things from the discussion because man, we were looking
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   at our watches by the end.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:13.840]   Like, okay, we get it.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840]   Give us the price.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.840]   Give us the product.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.840]   And now there's one under each of you for your seats.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:19.840]   And we know that they're coming.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:21.840]   And you get one.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.760]   Alex and Kiki and Merlin, how surprised were you by the price point when he showed
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:29.160]   9.99 and said, the pundits say it's under $1,000.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.160]   That's $9.99.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.440]   We're going to sell it for starting at $4.99.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.360]   I tell you, I think we gasped in the auditorium.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.680]   What was the reaction there in the studio?
[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:39.680]   We gasped as well.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:43.360]   I mean, I think in one of the Mac brakes, I think I gave the range of either $4.99 or
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:45.360]   $5.99 up to about $9.99.
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.920]   I thought it was going to be $7.99.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.560]   And the one that I'm going to get is very close to $7.99.
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:54.680]   But the, I think that the $4.99, as I said, I think it's a ruthless, I mean, just really
[01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.800]   well drawn out to make sure that there is, I mean, anybody going below that is really
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.760]   operating on very little margin or very little quality.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.680]   And it's just going to be very, very difficult for them to compete, I think.
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:08.960]   I mean, I think that's going to just take to the point about the price point.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:13.040]   I mean, I really did gasp immediately because, of course, I was leaving off the fact that
[01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.920]   that's the low end.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.240]   Still, I think under $1,000 is good.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.800]   And let's toss out two other price points.
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:26.520]   I'm looking here at the, let's see, the Kindle six inch display, $259.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:33.640]   It's a Kiki's, Dr. Kiki's point, the Logitech, there's a Logitech remote control, this $315.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.640]   That's right.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:37.080]   The Harmony one is three is three, four, nine, that's right.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   It's not a Harmony.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.480]   So I mean, I guess, I guess what I'm saying is if you, if you, if you, if we stop the
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:47.040]   straw man of like, well, will everybody from the first through third world buy two of these
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.680]   to put in every room of their house plus their boat?
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:52.720]   No, but we'll, we'll, we'll gadget nerds buy this.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.600]   I mean, like crazy people, you know, and I, and I think again, once they see this out
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.880]   there, the same way with the iPhone, I scoffed at the iPhone almost because you nerds kept
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.480]   guessing what it was going to be.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:04.920]   But once I held it in my hand and used it, it was a whole different world.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:08.680]   And I think people are going to, I, you know, I think you can't underestimate how important
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.680]   that is.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:10.680]   It does not happen with the blackberry.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:13.720]   And it's not half the iPhone, it's 599 when it first came out.
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.880]   Yeah, 591 first came out.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.800]   But I think that that's biggest effect is impact is that Apple is just establishing an
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:23.320]   electrified fence at the $400 price point that the closer no matter what your device does,
[01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:27.040]   if it's close to $400, you're going to have to explain to this person, this consumer,
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.320]   why do you would not want to spend another $100 and get this?
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.200]   I think we're going to see a lot more sub $200 ebook readers.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200]   Those still make perfect sense.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:38.040]   The $250 Kindle, I think still makes perfect sense because if all you want is an ebook reader,
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.600]   it's a fantastic ebook reader.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.560]   Well, that's the top level price for the iPad.
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.560]   Is it 829?
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560]   Is that right?
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:47.560]   So I was thinking 899 for the top level wasn't that far off.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:50.160]   And I think that's the one that like you were saying earlier, everybody's going to want
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:53.160]   to get they want to get the most storage and the 3G.
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.160]   I disagree.
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.080]   I think there are a lot of people who buy the 499 one.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:00.920]   I think, well, for instance, I'm going to buy one for my mom so that she can get the
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.400]   pictures on the picture frame.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:04.640]   And then if she wants to do some other stuff, she can do it.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.640]   I'm going to get the four.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.280]   I think a lot of people will buy a 16 gig Wi-Fi only.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.280]   I think that's a good.
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:13.720]   Honestly, think that the 16 gig Wi-Fi only is the equivalent of the 4 gig iPhone.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.880]   I think it's the one that makes a lot of logical sense.
[01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:17.360]   But you're going to be in that store.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:23.440]   You're going to say for $139 more, I can have the ability to buy 3G without having to be
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.440]   locked into a contract.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.240]   Well, I think that's going to be an easy $130 for people to spend.
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:31.280]   Yeah, but it's also the thing that's the thing that keeps you from getting divorced.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.840]   That's what it is.
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:34.280]   No, I'm serious.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.680]   Honey, I really want this thing.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:37.680]   It's $900.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.600]   But I'm going to get the one that's $4.99.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.600]   And now you stay married.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.400]   It'd be OK, right?
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.240]   Good logic there, Marlin.
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.280]   You know that thin screen 50 inch TV we were going to get?
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.280]   How about 9.7 inch?
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.280]   What do you think?
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:51.280]   You laugh, Dr. Kiki.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.680]   These are important cognitive things to work on with your mate.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680]   That's right.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:58.280]   You have to have those negotiations to kill the staff.
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.840]   I don't know if it's your sports.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.320]   Save up those fees.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.320]   Come on.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.120]   Like he was going to play football anyway.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.680]   He was just going to get hurt.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.680]   People are making a lie.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:10.960]   I'm going to beat up at CNET for saying that I thought the price was right on.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:11.960]   Because I do.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.960]   I think this is exactly the normal price for Apple.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.000]   It's less than all their MacBooks.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.280]   It's a little bit more than the minis.
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:19.440]   And it's more than the iPhone.
[01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.360]   And that's exactly where it should be.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.320]   And I don't think it's that expensive for the device.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.440]   Is everybody like Marlin was saying?
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.840]   Everybody going to go out and buy one?
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:29.560]   No, not everybody is going to go out and buy one.
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.720]   But no one ever expected everyone to go out and buy one.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.080]   Are people going to look at this and say, yeah, that's worth $500, $600?
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:36.080]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.880]   Like that makes more sense than the $600 iPhone did.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.880]   I'm just going to wrap this up with final thoughts in just a bit.
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:45.640]   Kiki, if you'd hold that thought we're going to come up and each of you will go around
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.200]   the horn and give each of you a chance to kind of sum up what you think this big announcement
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:55.640]   of the iPad means as we continue with our special edition of Mac Break Weekly from in
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:00.400]   front of the rapidly emptying soon to be deserted, Erbobuina Center for the Arts.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.400]   Unless the circus is coming.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.960]   I think the circus might be here.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:06.040]   In which case, we might just stay for the elephants.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:09.280]   Meanwhile, though, I do want to thank our great friends at Citrix who have provided the
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:14.640]   wherewithal to make this incredible setup with our satellite truck, our 15 cameras,
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.000]   our huge suite of interns.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.280]   Thank you for the catering.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.280]   My God.
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.280]   I know.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:20.280]   I'm sorry.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.080]   I'm going to go up on breakfast because wow, I'm filling up a bag.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.080]   Unbelievable.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.200]   And we couldn't have done it without those great folks at Go to Meeting.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:29.640]   Now, the next time you're thinking of business travel, you might want to think about Go to
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.640]   Meeting.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.640]   Save some money.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:36.000]   What's the average cost of a ticket to go visit a client across the country?
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.220]   We got the airplane ticket, the hotel, the taxi cab, the food, not to mention the stress
[01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:43.660]   of sitting in the middle seat, taking off your shoes at the security line.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.980]   That's worth a thousand bucks.
[01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:48.820]   Go to meeting $49 a month for unlimited meetings.
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:49.980]   That's so easy to set up.
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:54.580]   In fact, if you go right now to go to meeting.com/macbreak, you'll have it set up before I'm done
[01:20:54.580 --> 01:20:55.580]   talking.
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:56.580]   It's that quick.
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:20:58.380]   It's just a little tiny little bit of Java that you download.
[01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:02.460]   Now, anytime you want to have a meeting, you can either use Outlook and send them an invitation
[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:03.460]   that they just click.
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:07.920]   Or you can even be on the phone, by the way, Go to Meeting comes with VoiceOver IP free
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.920]   and free teleconferencing.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:10.920]   So you're on the phone.
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.420]   You're saying, "I really want to show you this mockup I did of the iPad or how our new
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.560]   application is going to look on the iPad."
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:19.340]   You say, "Do this.
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:20.340]   Go to GoToMeeting.com.
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.600]   I'm going to start a meeting right now.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.920]   All you have to do is go to GoToMeeting.com, click Join a Meeting.
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:26.720]   Here's the meeting ID.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:30.240]   They're seeing your computer on their screen.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.240]   It's kind of a little miracle.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.020]   You can even collaborate together.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.740]   You can work together on a document.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.660]   You can give them control.
[01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:40.940]   So it's great for training.
[01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:44.900]   They can take control so that they're short, built into that little 200 kilobyte step.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:45.980]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.540]   Go to GoToMeeting.com/MacBreak.
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.540]   Let's have a race.
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:50.540]   Go ahead.
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.540]   You go there right now.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.540]   I'll wait.
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:55.540]   Go toMeeting.com/MacBreak.
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:59.140]   It's all right now.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:00.140]   I promise you're going to love it.
[01:22:00.140 --> 01:22:01.500]   You can try it free for 30 days.
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.380]   No cost, no obligation to you.
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.740]   If you don't like it, send me a note telling me why.
[01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.440]   Maybe we could put that feature in the next one.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:10.920]   GoToMeeting.com/MacBreak.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.260]   Let's start with Merlin Mann.
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:16.460]   Merlin, your final thoughts on this big, big day.
[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:17.460]   It's pretty.
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:18.460]   It's very pretty.
[01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:24.380]   No, I mean, I'm thinking I'll be a business douche because I'm not qualified to do that,
[01:22:24.380 --> 01:22:25.380]   but I'll do it anyway.
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:26.380]   I think this is a continuing--
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:27.380]   Business douche.
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:30.380]   I'll quit Martin production.
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.380]   Back for Epilogue.
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.380]   A street pay.
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:37.380]   I have no car.
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.380]   I'm a little punchy here.
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:40.380]   All right.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:41.380]   So here's my thing.
[01:22:41.380 --> 01:22:42.380]   I'm going to say it one more time.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:43.380]   I said it seven times.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:44.380]   I don't care.
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:45.380]   I'm going to say it again anyway.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:48.300]   This is a company that is not afraid to define its audience.
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:51.780]   This is a device where they are getting clearer and clearer about being really courageous
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:55.700]   about saying what they want to make and for whom, which I got to say I have a lot of respect
[01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:56.700]   for.
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:57.700]   That's something I care about a lot.
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.700]   I think it's going to be really interesting to watch.
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:04.060]   You think about, like I said, the way they push the vars out a few years back, the way
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:07.140]   the retail store people got pushed out.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:10.700]   I just think it's going to be very interesting to watch the response of the people who make
[01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:18.700]   things for and related to all Apple stuff, especially the developers.
[01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:20.060]   I had a gut feeling.
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:26.020]   We mentioned off air, but I had a gut feeling that I wonder if a lot of the problems with
[01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:31.380]   the developers with getting stuff onto the store in a timely manner, getting approved.
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:35.340]   I wonder if some part of that was that they were implementing new stuff and didn't want
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:38.300]   to have to do half measures along the way.
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:41.180]   I think it's going to be really interesting to watch what the developers think of this.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:44.300]   I think it's going to be really interesting to watch who ends up having one of these a
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.500]   year from now.
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:47.500]   It looks great.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:51.100]   I'm not going to buy one, but maybe when it goes down, it's more stuff.
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:53.100]   You said that with the iPhone too.
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:56.740]   And somebody gave me an iPhone.
[01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:57.740]   I know.
[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:01.060]   We're going to clearly have to give you one.
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:03.620]   Merlin Man, where should people go to find you?
[01:24:03.620 --> 01:24:08.300]   Besides the great You Look Nice Today podcast, which we all love and cherish.
[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:11.300]   Oh, gosh, I don't know.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:13.100]   Read a book.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.100]   You don't need to know about me.
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:16.100]   You can Google for me.
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:17.100]   I'm MerlinMan.com.
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:20.060]   You should have me on here again.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.060]   This is a pleasure to be here.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.060]   Thank you very much for having me.
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:24.060]   Dude, we love Merlin.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.540]   I didn't know you wanted to see it.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.940]   I didn't know.
[01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:28.940]   We love you.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:29.940]   We love you.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:30.940]   We love you.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:31.940]   Merlin.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:32.940]   Oh, yes.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:38.260]   Kiki, Dr. Kiki, Kirsten Sanford, your final thoughts on the iPad.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:45.460]   My final thoughts are that I think for Apple's introductory iPad, they're their first out
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:47.020]   of the box tablet.
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:48.020]   It's a good start.
[01:24:48.020 --> 01:24:49.980]   I think it has a lot of room to grow.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:53.260]   But I think it's a good start.
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:57.700]   I think that in terms of its usability and where it's going to go and how it's going
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:02.900]   to be influential is going to have a lot to do again with the app store the same way
[01:25:02.900 --> 01:25:04.500]   that the iPhone has been.
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:11.540]   So in terms of healthcare, in terms of education, in terms of business industry, it all depends
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:17.380]   on what developers are able to do in the app environment and how people are able to implement
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:19.740]   those.
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:23.140]   Right now, though, I personally probably would not get one yet.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:29.860]   I need to see more functionality and more workhorse-ness, but it is pretty and I'll borrow
[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:33.420]   my friends maybe.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.180]   So two people aren't buying it so far.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:38.900]   Alex, Lindsey, you've been, oh, by the way, you could find Kirsten Sanford at this week
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:41.660]   in science at twisttwist.org.
[01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:46.700]   And of course, she hosts Dr. Kiki Science Hour every Thursday at 4 p.m.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:52.460]   I'm sorry, 3 p.m. on the Twit Network Live.Twit.tv and you can listen to that on iTunes feed
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:53.820]   or just go, you know, it's easy.
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:59.500]   All you have to do is go to TWIT.tv/Kiki and you get all the recent episodes.
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.500]   Thank you, Kirsten, for being here.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.500]   I really appreciate it.
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.500]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:06.380]   Alex, Lindsey's been sitting on the ball since like 9, 8 a.m.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.420]   I don't know, a long time.
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.980]   Alex, your final thoughts on the pad that is I?
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:14.740]   Well, I think that it's a lot of what we expected it to be.
[01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:15.740]   And I would have bought one.
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.180]   I would have put my money down two years ago.
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:23.940]   So I'm not, you know, so I think that, you know, and as someone who was going to build
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:27.020]   one of these, I had to do all the business models and I think that this changes everything.
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:30.180]   I think that it is a, you know, and Apple did it.
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:33.380]   Apple's the only company that I think could have done it at the level of doing it with
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.940]   the iTunes integration, with the iPhone already there, with the history of that, with the
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:39.620]   history of all the other pieces that they have.
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:41.380]   There's nobody else that could have done this.
[01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:46.100]   And I think that they put out, you know, as good as a first effort that you could possibly
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:50.660]   put out for a device like this, especially at the price point that you're looking at.
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:54.340]   I think that, you know, obviously, I think it makes a huge difference in eBooks, but
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:58.020]   I think that you're really looking at something that I do think it's going to replace the
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:59.260]   laptop for a lot of people.
[01:26:59.260 --> 01:27:03.220]   I think that there's going to be a lot of people who don't, who, with the keyboard,
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:05.260]   the keyboard, I think is the key piece of this.
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:08.700]   But with that keyboard, I can see myself not going out on long trips, but going out
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:09.700]   in the afternoon, going out.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.620]   I mean, there's so many times where I take my laptop, I don't need it.
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:15.620]   And being able to have one of these, I'm looking at having a big computer at home, a
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:19.620]   Big Mac Pro at home, which I have, and just not taking my, you know, and getting rid of
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:22.300]   my laptops, you know, because I just, you know, when I'm going out, that's, I'm just
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:24.780]   going to take this much lighter little piece.
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.780]   And I do think it's the perfect thing for my parents.
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:30.700]   I think that it, I think that the real issue is, is going to be stuff like Flash is going
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:34.220]   to have a real hard time with, if it's not able to get on this device.
[01:27:34.220 --> 01:27:36.180]   I think that the, and I don't think they're going to need it because I think there's going
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:38.660]   to be a lot of interactivity already built into it.
[01:27:38.660 --> 01:27:43.300]   And I think that it's just going, once people start buying into it, like with the iPhone,
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:47.540]   they're embedded, you know, and, and, and the getting them unembedded after that, I think
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.620]   is going to be very difficult.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:49.620]   So it's, it's, it's exciting.
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:52.900]   I think for Apple and I can't wait to have one.
[01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:53.900]   That's all I can say.
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:56.460]   So far we've only sold one though and that, and that whole crew there in the studio.
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:01.300]   No, no, no, no, actually, I'm going to buy an extra one for Kiki and Merlin, you know,
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.900]   we sold three out of three.
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.100]   Yeah, I'm buying three.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.100]   That's nice.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.740]   Because at Pixelcore.com that's that great core of multimedia artists who are learning
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:13.220]   and then working in the business.
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:17.220]   And it's a great place to go to find out more about all of this wonderful stuff that's happening
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:18.220]   in content creation.
[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:20.140]   Go to Pixelcore.com for a membership.
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:23.140]   Pixelcore.tv of course is where his podcasts live.
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:26.700]   Such great shows as We Get Photography, This Week in Media and More Tea.
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:29.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:31.580]   Pixelcore, P-I-X-E-L-C-O-R-P-S.
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:35.980]   And by the way, Leo, just as someone in the industry and someone for, you know, as me,
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:42.140]   you know, talking about our members, this is a massive goldmine for content producers.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:45.500]   I mean, this is, it's hard to describe how big of a deal this is for us.
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:49.620]   This is the biggest business that we're going to have in the next decade.
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:51.460]   How rarely do you get a new platform like this?
[01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:56.300]   This doesn't happen every day, especially platform so dedicated to content.
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:58.980]   Tom Merritt from BuzzatLoud, CNET TV.
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:01.300]   What do you think iPad and would you buy one?
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.140]   I'll buy one because I buy these things.
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:06.820]   I don't know how much that says about the product because I like to try this stuff.
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:11.580]   But I think it's risky for Apple because when they, when they went into the music player
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.380]   market, there was a market there.
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:17.060]   There was a, there were already MP3 players, maybe not that many, but people wanted one.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:18.220]   So they knew it was a safe bet.
[01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:19.220]   Well, they went into phones.
[01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:21.860]   There definitely was a market there and even a good market for smartphones.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:23.700]   So they knew it wasn't as big of a risk.
[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.340]   They just made a really good one.
[01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:27.020]   This is not a market.
[01:29:27.020 --> 01:29:30.340]   People have been trying to make tablets all the way back since the seven days.
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:35.780]   And unless you argue that PDAs or POMs or something like that is a tablet, nobody's
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:38.780]   really been successful with a tablet PC yet.
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:42.900]   So I think this is a, this is a bigger deal of whether they can convince people that they
[01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:44.620]   need this or not.
[01:29:44.620 --> 01:29:48.580]   It's not something that people immediately go, yeah, that's a whole I've been looking
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:50.100]   to fill in my life.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:53.980]   It's more of an enticement of like, hey, you've been out of realized it, but this would really
[01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:54.980]   be fun for you.
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:56.780]   This would make your life easier.
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:01.460]   And so I think this first round, we'll see it integrated with the Apple fans, the people
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:04.740]   who use the iPhones, the people who use Apple TVs.
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:07.420]   And then a second round, they'll add a few more things.
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:09.260]   Maybe we'll finally get background processes.
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:10.380]   Maybe they'll do a deal with flash.
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:12.180]   I doubt it, but they'll add some more stuff.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:14.940]   And the second round will get a little more and that'll be, it'll be like the iPhone where
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:18.100]   now you see iPhones everywhere because we're in the third generation of them.
[01:30:18.100 --> 01:30:19.500]   So I think it'll build slowly.
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.500]   I just don't know.
[01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:28.660]   It'll ever build to that Christian and somewhere above Apple TV, but below the iPhone.
[01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:31.940]   We can catch you on BuzzatLab.com and see that.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:33.180]   Is it seen at live.tv?
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:36.740]   Live.cenet.com or cenetv.com.
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:38.740]   Okay, got it.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:40.180]   We're so close to the end.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:41.180]   I know.
[01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:42.180]   Okay.
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:43.180]   Hang out.
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:44.180]   Hang out to the end.
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:45.180]   Come on.
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:46.180]   Okay.
[01:30:46.180 --> 01:30:47.180]   Okay.
[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:48.180]   Go for me.
[01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.180]   Okay.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.180]   Just don't move.
[01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:51.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:30:51.180 --> 01:30:52.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:54.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:55.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:58.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:30:59.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:00.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:01.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:02.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:03.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:04.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:05.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:25.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:32.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:39.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:39.180 --> 01:31:46.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:53.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:32:00.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:07.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:14.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:32:14.180 --> 01:32:21.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:28.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:35.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:42.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:49.180]   I'm going to be at the end of the video.
[01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:54.180]   I think the product that Steve Jobs has wanted to make his entire career.
[01:32:54.180 --> 01:32:57.180]   I think this is an incredible cap to an amazing career.
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:02.180]   I believe that they've created a new category and a new product technology that gets out of your way,
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:08.180]   technology that looks good, feels good that you want to use, that you don't think of as technology.
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:11.180]   It just works.
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:15.180]   I think this is a category that is going to explode, to be honest with you.
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:17.180]   I think this is the next big thing.
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:22.180]   Thank you so much for being here for our obsessive compulsory coverage of the iPad announcement.
[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:27.180]   We apologize for the technical ups and downs, the occasions that we got from scratch.
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:29.180]   You know, if you think about it, it's a maintenance.
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:35.180]   I've been live video and audio to 100,000 people based on the same little gizmo that business is still like that.
[01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:40.180]   I'm a little bit of the "it" man out there from their work from their business.
[01:33:40.180 --> 01:33:42.180]   It's really just meant for even.
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:47.180]   Back to work! Break time is over!
