[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.160]   Renee Richie is here.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.640]   I don't know what.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.160]   I've turned into--
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.360]   - I'm on my Mac's headroom.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.880]   - I'm on my Mac's headroom there.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.320]   Renee Richie is here from iMore.com in Montreal.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.120]   Did you guys-- is a great snowstorm of 2017
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.000]   going that far north or no?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.500]   It started.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.800]   Yeah, I went out to lunch, came out,
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   my car was covered in snow.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.720]   So apparently it's going to hit worse tonight.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.640]   Nice.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.200]   Nice.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   Daylight losing time, snowstorms.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.000]   I just want my spring back.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.440]   Also with this from a closet in Atlantic City, don't ask.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.760]   It's my special safe place.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.280]   Outside is the snow that wants to harm me.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.720]   Why in the blizzard of 2017 would you
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.520]   take a train to Atlantic City?
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.840]   I'm giving a talk at this really cool conference of people
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.560]   who own and run summer camps.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.160]   Oh, how fun.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.160]   So I literally finished my talk about half an hour ago,
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.040]   scooped up my stuff, ran into on my way out,
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.800]   trying to run back here, encountered two really lovely
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.160]   Twit listeners.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.160]   I wanted to say hi.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.240]   And I had to-- of course, I was going to stop and say hi
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.120]   and sign their tag.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.240]   But yeah, it was really fun.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.200]   I got to tell them the story about how
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.080]   I got cheated on my ability--
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.600]   my right to take the sailing class one year at camp
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.160]   because the counselor made me stay back and redo
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.000]   all the morning dishes on the morning.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.240]   I was supposed to take my proficiency tests.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.720]   We actually have somebody here with us
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.840]   who works at the best camp in the world.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.440]   App camp for girls.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.200]   Kelly Guimant is also here from Smile Software and Mac
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.600]   Observer.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.760]   Hi, Kelly.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.480]   Hi.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   Wow.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.800]   We got two campers.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.000]   Good ball.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.680]   That's nice.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.440]   Somebody says you look like Joan Qzak and 16 candles.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.960]   Which is hands down the nicest thing anyone said to say.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.440]   Isn't that a sweet thing to say?
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.200]   Kyle Lee.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.240]   Kyle Lee.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.840]   I think she's fantastic.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.360]   Me too.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.120]   Yeah, I'll take it.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.120]   Me too.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.200]   Any era Joan Qsak would really mean to have--
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.680]   I'm with you.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.640]   --which is funny because my shirt is from a John Qsak movie.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.800]   What?
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.520]   Sort of.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.320]   Say anything.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.840]   Ray anything.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   No.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   Oh, great.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.920]   Oh, that's very funny.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.680]   What a great--
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.360]   That's hysterical.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.080]   Little mashup.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.520]   I thought by wearing my presentation clothes,
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.080]   I would win the fashion round today.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.800]   But Kelly, you win.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.600]   You win.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.280]   You win.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.800]   I'm wearing--
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.360]   I'm as old.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.720]   --take off this stupid jacket.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.640]   Not a rough security.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.120]   Nice.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.720]   I don't fit.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.600]   I got nothing.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.160]   I don't wear brands.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.680]   I don't know.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.440]   I've got bonus points for subscribers, Leah.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.840]   I do have--
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.240]   You are a brand, Leah.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.520]   And I am-- I was wearing my plantation hat earlier.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.680]   Because I'm going to make you all feel bad.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.400]   Because where you've got three inch, three feet of snow,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.040]   it's like 80 degrees outside.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.200]   Beautiful.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.560]   Love it.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.240]   Get the elephant.
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.640]   Love it.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.040]   Where's my pith helmet?
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.960]   I can't find it.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.040]   I think I thought you were posing for a rum-ed.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.440]   It really is this kind of weather in Petaluma.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.800]   I feel so bad for you guys.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.280]   Suffering.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.680]   Back in prohibition, they thought they'd
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.360]   stop the rum-ed.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.440]   And he's stripping down.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.160]   That's good.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.680]   That's good.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.440]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.400]   So big news from Mac Rumors.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.440]   I don't know whether to credit it or not, Joe Rossignol writing.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.160]   Apple expected to announce new products as soon as next week.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.120]   This actually comes from a number of analysts, including
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.920]   Ming Chi Quo at KGI Securities, who's
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.440]   very good on the supply chain.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.880]   Barclays analyst Blaine Curtis, Japanese blog
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.960]   Mac O'Katara.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.680]   O'Jakara, I mean.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:26.160]   And so does that seem incredible as soon as next week?
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.720]   We mentioned that April 4th date last week,
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   but that seemed like a made-up date based on--
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.920]   You have no comment something without no commenting it.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.160]   How do you walk that line?
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.160]   I know.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.600]   I think we'll be busy.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.560]   I think we'll be busy.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.520]   I think we'll be busy.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.920]   OK.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.480]   Next week, you think, huh?
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.720]   I think we'll have a hell of a show.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.400]   There won't be, it seems--
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.440]   I mean, maybe it will.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.240]   But as we in sure weigh into March,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.840]   here we are on Pi Day, March 14.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.320]   It seems less and less likely that there'll be an event.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.160]   I guess I could announce it next week.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.840]   Maybe in April.
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.640]   I don't think there's any way they'll have a March event now.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.760]   Maybe in April.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.520]   The--
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:07.800]   If the supply chain says, keep hope alive.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.000]   That's what the supply chain says.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.960]   The supply chain says, look for the analysts.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.880]   Let's see.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   OK.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.640]   According to reputable supply chain analysts
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.920]   that MacRumors spoke to, who wish to remain anonymous,
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:29.880]   new products between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.400]   The analysts say information from their own source
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.440]   is not based on other reports.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.520]   We're expecting perhaps a trio of new iPad pros,
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.280]   including one that I think sounds very intriguing,
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.960]   a 10.5-inch model.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.880]   That would be the same size as the--
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.800]   I don't know if that one will be ready.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   As the current Air, but with smaller bezels.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.720]   You don't think that's the one we're going to see.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.320]   I think we'll see the Mac Pro bumps with the 10X--
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.520]   with the A10 chipset.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.240]   I don't know if the bezel-less one is ready.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.840]   That might be a 90.7-inch--
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.520]   not an Air, though, a Pro.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.120]   Is the Air dead?
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.520]   The iPad Air?
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.720]   It's low cost.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.920]   It's the one that-- because there's always bulk buyers,
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.440]   people in the enterprise or people in schools
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.480]   who just don't need features.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.160]   They just need literally blank pieces of glass
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.720]   and the cheaper and the less specs they can get in them
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.160]   the better, which is why the iPad 2 and the iPad Mini
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.440]   stood around for so long.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.720]   And now the Air is this generation's, too.
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.560]   I think the Air is the new, too.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.640]   That's my stance on it, as well.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.360]   Andy, I don't know if--
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.560]   They're just going to continue to sell it
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.840]   because everything at this point that they
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.080]   make on the OG Air is just gravy.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.320]   They've done all the R&D.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.640]   They've got all the parts, whatever.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.800]   I think they're just going to keep making them.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.520]   Remember, wasn't it like the iPhone 4S that just would not
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.160]   go away?
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.760]   I think that's where we're going to be.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.240]   What about original Air?
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.240]   You disagree, Andy?
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.660]   Well, only that that's a category where
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.280]   Apple's having this butt-handed to them
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.160]   by pretty much everybody else.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.320]   They're having trouble selling the enterprise
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.320]   because, again, you can get Windows Notebooks
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.200]   for a lot less money than that.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.560]   They used to be selling them to schools,
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.160]   but, again, schools overwhelmingly want Chromebooks,
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.200]   not iPads because they're too expensive.
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.600]   And people want a little cheap ebook readers from Kindle,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.440]   but they don't necessarily want a media device that's--
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.000]   I think the iPad Mini has a better chance of hanging
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.800]   around than the iPad Air.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.560]   And we can't omit memories of all of the money
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.640]   that they're spending on ads trying to convince us
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.680]   that the iPad Pro is as good as a laptop, which,
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.040]   by implication, is saying it's better than a laptop
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.120]   than a Mac and a laptop.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.240]   Because if we thought that if we were trying to sell you Macs
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.920]   as laptops, we'd advertise those.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.080]   No, we're going to try to sell you iPads, please.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.000]   We believe in iPads.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.440]   On the other hand, as Kelly says, you've probably
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.120]   got them in stock.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.720]   You might as well just put them on the price list.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.120]   See if anybody bites.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.160]   It doesn't cost you anything to do that, does it?
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.920]   It lowers the price of entry, which
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.520]   is one of the marketing tactics you do to get people to--
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.200]   Yeah, you want to be able to say starting at 195 or whatever.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.960]   Precisely.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.120]   The iPad Mini does a good job of that.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.760]   That's true.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.480]   I hope they keep the Mini around.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.400]   Any chance of pro-fying the Mini?
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.240]   Yeah, sure.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.640]   But what does that do to the price point, too?
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.920]   Because you're putting a lot more technology into it.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.160]   You're putting the pencil, and you're putting the smart connector.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.520]   And I hope the whole price is on it.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.080]   But we did supervise a little bit when
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.040]   they did pro the other models.
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.120]   You pro something?
[00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.480]   Is that a verb?
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   Am I allowed to verb that, Kelly?
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.040]   Proify.
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.480]   I said, "Proify."
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.320]   Proification?
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.400]   Proification.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.920]   I like that.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.760]   Proification is totally of our subjective format.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.720]   That's the new to a pro-spiral.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.640]   Like a shame spiral.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.480]   It's proing everything.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.080]   You get a pro.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.120]   You get a pro.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.840]   I'm getting a pro.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.280]   I really like the idea of doing that,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.440]   because it would be sort of almost like an auxiliary walk-em
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.920]   tablet in some ways.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.720]   It feels notes.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.880]   It's like--
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.640]   That would be a really great way to continue to get mileage out
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.520]   of that form factor.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.040]   It's kind of crazy to me that Apple doesn't just buy
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.960]   duet display and say, this is a feature of the entire iPad
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.880]   line that we can use it as an external--
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.480]   not only just an external screen, but also as an external tablet.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   But they don't need it.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.520]   I really think that's the potential
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.080]   that the touch bar had and didn't really capitalize on.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.360]   If I could just buy a $400 iPad mini
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.560]   and not only have a nice compact movie reader and a book
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.440]   reader and internet device, but also
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.520]   have a second screen for my laptop
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.960]   and also have a really cool 3D input device
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.440]   with contextual buttons and explanations and tooltips,
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.680]   that's interesting.
[00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.120]   But thank you for giving us the No Escape key, not actually
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.520]   centered on the keypad.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.840]   It's an internet--
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.200]   It's an internet device.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.280]   It's a second screen.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.560]   It's an internet communicator.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.240]   Are you getting it?
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.920]   It's a digital thermometer.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.000]   It's Ming-Chi-Quo.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.480]   It's a volume bar.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.000]   The aforementioned Blaine Curtis of Barclays and Mac Oda-Kara
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.280]   all say there will be a new 7.9-inch model
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.200]   to replace the Mini 4.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.320]   Is that the same size as the Mini 4?
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:10.760]   Yes.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.960]   OK, so that's just update for the Mini.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.560]   Oda-Kara said iPad Pro will be announced, but also an iPhone
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.760]   SE with 128 gig storage and new Apple bands.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.560]   You might as well throw in new Apple bands.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.560]   Why not?
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.160]   Well, the Apple Watch bands are seasonal now.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.920]   They do those every spring and every fall,
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.840]   because they always want to have that sort of fashion.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.640]   Yeah, I'm ready for a new band.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.320]   You remember that scene in the paper chase
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.560]   where Professor Houseman wanted to make a really clear point
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.480]   of how annoyed he was with the student, Mr. Hart.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.320]   But he had his hand up to answer a question.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.200]   And he pointedly called on every student
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.720]   sitting in front of them, behind them, to the left of the right
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.600]   of them, and did not call on him.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.040]   I think that maybe Apple's crudeling the inside of the same kind
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.560]   of power trip towards Max.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.520]   Let's see, we updated the iPads, and we're updating the Watch,
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.560]   and we're updating a phone that we didn't seem to care about.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.320]   We're going to introduce new watch bands,
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.840]   and we have a new pen in the Apple Store.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.920]   Let's see, is there any other important product
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.960]   that we have on updated?
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.880]   No, I can't think of it.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.920]   You can't go home, everybody.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.120]   They usually update the MacBook.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.600]   They announced it two years ago in March.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.080]   They updated it one year ago in March.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.720]   We'll probably see the KBLake version of the MacBook
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.840]   Nothing, and maybe the KBLake versions of the iMac
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.920]   and some of the other Macs as well.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.160]   When is the product red?
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.920]   When do the new product reds come out?
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.440]   Is it spring?
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.160]   Those just depend on what Apple's
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.560]   doing with the red marketing campaigns.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.320]   They did a huge product red campaign in the fall.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.880]   But they announced those whenever they think
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.520]   it's a good product match for it.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.800]   So they had a rumor of a product every year?
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.080]   Yeah, red iPhone SE, right?
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.120]   Every Christmas since iPhone 3G,
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.560]   they had a rumor of a product that would be--
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.520]   I would buy a red phone, even if I don't need them.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.600]   I'd buy it so hard.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.080]   I would-- oh, so much.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.360]   Well, here in our focus group--
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.480]   I first of all, I have the red leather case now
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.040]   because I like that the red with the white front basically
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.000]   gives me a Hello Kitty communicator.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.120]   That makes me really happy.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.120]   OK.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.680]   Maybe they're saying that we really, really
[00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.880]   do want to help people in medical need,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.960]   but we're just not satisfied with this shade of red.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.960]   If you want it.
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:20.640]   We'll work on it.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.680]   Come back to us next year.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.360]   We'll have a great new shade of red.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.000]   They've done so many reds.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.200]   I think the Christmas product red rumor
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.880]   gets going every year because they do the big thing
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.120]   in the App Store for World AIDS Day, which is December 1st.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:34.600]   OK.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.520]   So I think that's where the Christmas stuff comes from.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:38.240]   Like, if you're going to do all the product red in the--
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.640]   That's when Bono shows up at the--
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:41.040]   I do not show her in the Mac App Store.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:41.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.720]   Like bonus levels for Monument Valley.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.760]   Like, we got all that stuff as part of World AIDS Day.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:48.800]   And I think that's probably where the hardware stuff happens
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.360]   is because rumors get started.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:50.860]   Right.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:51.880]   That's what I was wondering.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.960]   So maybe not--
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:53.800]   Maybe this spring.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.320]   Who knows?
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.320]   Who knows?
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:01.440]   Well, just throw in spaghetti against the wall here.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.880]   I would very much like to see some new stuff.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.480]   How about--
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.440]   That's all pressurely stuff.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.000]   I mean, like the 120-80-plus-2 iPhone.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.520]   Yeah, SE.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.920]   That's just-- and now available with raw memory.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.880]   How about Macs, though?
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.080]   We have not-- when's the last Mac event?
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.240]   Touchpad-- Touchbar MacBook Pro.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.280]   That was October, yeah.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.440]   But how about iMacs or Mac Pros?
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.560]   I Mac was the previous October.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.720]   Mac Pro was four years ago at WWT.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.480]   Sorry, Nathan.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:28.880]   I didn't--
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.800]   Are we salting a wound right now?
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.160]   Well, I bought one, OK?
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.560]   And I would probably still use it if I had been able to upgrade it
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.560]   a little bit, but I can't.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.240]   So I gave it to Nathan.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:42.920]   Oh, say we all.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.960]   I gave it to our newest employee.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.680]   So there.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.400]   And by the way--
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.280]   Here, have a Mac Pro.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.680]   We're not going to give you a computer, just a Mac Pro.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.760]   It's an object to Arlio.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.440]   It's going to be something that's next to the GPU
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.240]   in a lot of shelves.
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.440]   I know I will regret it because I regretted giving away
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.440]   the cube, too.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.440]   You know, I had the cube.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.440]   I love the cube.
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.520]   If I had that now, I would be, I don't know,
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.960]   on a pedestal somewhere.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.600]   I wouldn't be using it.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.120]   I have mine in my office within reach.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.600]   I've been tempted to use the case and turn it
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.280]   to something else, but I can never do it because it's just
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.720]   one of the most beautiful Macs apples ever made.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.560]   And one of the most beautiful computers,
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.960]   it's up there with the Cray 1, I think.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:24.440]   Well, and I'll be honest, I think the trashcan Mac
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.160]   is the most beautiful Mac I've ever seen.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.240]   It's gorgeous.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.640]   It's just not practical.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.240]   I'm convinced even Hackett runs RealAFM off a bunch of G4
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.080]   cubes.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.080]   I can't poop it.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.720]   Do you all do podcasts for RealAFM?
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.200]   I do not, but I have a ton of respect for them.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.200]   OK, good.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.520]   They're good people.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.400]   It's like, you know, Belichick discovering
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.200]   that Tom Brady's been working for the Jets on the side.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:54.960]   You know, just like--
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.520]   I've been downsizing.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.520]   I find it like--
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.440]   I like doing Mac break.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.600]   I like doing a show on my own.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.440]   And then I feel like I've got other things to say.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:04.000]   No, no, I'm teasing.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.640]   Logs show, the log shows that new iPad models are being used.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.000]   This comes from a mobile marketing term called--
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.720]   kind of an unapp named Fixu.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:28.160]   They're running out of words to patent the trademark Fixu.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.120]   A lot of developers can tell what devices are hitting their apps.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.800]   It's just most of them don't discuss that stuff
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.800]   because it's sort of proprietary information.
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.880]   But some of them--
[00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.000]   There's seen kind of a 10-ish kind of numbers.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:39.600]   They see the numbers.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.200]   So like you'll see whatever like iPad 5, 9, or something.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   You'll say, well, that's not a normal iPad model.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.020]   and then you'll be able to drive by the first number,
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.640]   what the generation is, and why is the common number,
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.520]   whether it's like a LTE skew or a Wi-Fi skew,
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.860]   or one of the other variants.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.100]   - So, about a month ahead of the last iPad pro launches,
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.120]   it saw internal model names,
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.460]   six comma three stroke six comma four,
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.000]   and six comma seven stroke six comma eight,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.900]   this time around it seeing seven comma one,
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.480]   seven comma two, seven comma three, and seven comma four.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.540]   And a comma comma, comma, comma, Camellia.
[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.320]   - And they're probably the most regular,
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.200]   the pro and the new one.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.140]   - Yeah, but very few,
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.020]   fix, fix, says, I gotta say that carefully.
[00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.080]   Fix who says they've only seen five, seven threes,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.520]   ten, seven, fours, 11, seven twos,
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:33.680]   but they've seen the 17, seven ones.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.880]   But that's about what you'd expect.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.240]   Does, but I mean, I would think,
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:40.440]   when you see more as you got closer to the lit ship,
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.640]   or are they just still, you know,
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.960]   like a few of the engineers have them,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.400]   they're good at hiding it.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.600]   So it's probably just once in a while.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.440]   It slips through.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.880]   It's the same, like if you look at your server logs,
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.380]   you'll see iOS 12 or something in there.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:51.220]   - That's right.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.060]   - iOS 11.
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.900]   You'll see those things in there.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.740]   They're just very few.
[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.700]   And they all happen to be in the Cupertino area
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.100]   of California, so that's not so funny.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.580]   (laughing)
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:01.060]   - So what's the one you would guys would buy?
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.740]   What are you holding out for?
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:09.300]   - I'd love to see a smaller iPad that works with pencil.
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.820]   I'm traveling with, I needed my laptop
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.600]   because of the podcast.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:19.240]   So I left my iPad Pro at home and I almost like,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.760]   I almost left the house with my Apple pencil
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.320]   in a case in my pocket,
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.120]   because I'm so used to taking it with me
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.760]   to like make notes on,
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:28.160]   even though I'm just using the iPad Mini,
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.160]   I would use the hell out of an iPad Mini Pro
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.860]   that has Apple Pencil support.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.880]   - Kelly, what would you like to see?
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.000]   - Profied Mini.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.840]   - Profied Mini.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.160]   - I really think that that's the sweet spot
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.520]   for a lot of people.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:43.800]   What I would really like to see,
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.160]   I personally would Jones pretty hard for a Mini
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.660]   that has Pro features,
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.520]   but I also like the idea of there being still a not Pro Mini
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.960]   with some sort of spec bump.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.120]   If for no other reason than,
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.360]   it makes it easier to reel people into the Apple ecosystem
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.160]   like we were talking about earlier with the mobile stuff.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.120]   It's just like my phone, but it's a little bit bigger.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.080]   I can see Candy Crush better or whatever it doesn't wanna do.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.800]   And having that opportunity I think is really great.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.320]   It's part of why I think lots of people have a Kindle,
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.520]   even if they have it in conjunction with other stuff,
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.360]   whether it's a Kindle, straight up ebook Kindle
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.200]   or a Kindle Fire that does a little bit more.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.600]   I think that's how they're reeling people in
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.500]   is helping hook people on that ecosystem.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.680]   - What do you think Renee?
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.600]   What are you Jonesing for these days?
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.000]   - I saw it in the worst because I would love
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.800]   that highly portable, tiny iPad Pro,
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.480]   but I draw and I really want a big canvas for drawing.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.800]   And that's what makes the 12.91 so compelling for me,
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.160]   even though it's much bigger to lug around.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:52.040]   But I'm really waiting for the bezel-less iPad
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.120]   because that solves the same problem that the iPhone does.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.680]   When the right now when the screens get bigger,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.800]   the devices get bigger and that makes them harder
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.160]   to take around, hard to put in a pocket,
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.240]   harder to hold in your hand.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.960]   So if you increase the screen without increasing
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.120]   the casing size, you get the benefits of like,
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.560]   I'll hopefully get the big iPad Pro screen benefits
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.840]   in the 9.7 in size and that'll be super exciting for me.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:13.760]   - How do you know if it doesn't have a bezel?
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:15.200]   - So they're really good at palm rejection.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.880]   They just read the 3D mapping information
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.720]   from the capacitive display and reject anything
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.800]   that doesn't feel like it's an actual input gesture.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.520]   So I'll just hold it, like unabashedly held, Kelly,
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.000]   and then I'll just use it with the bezel.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.200]   - I was concerned when Samsung did their Galaxy S6
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.440]   and then S7 with a curved edge around here.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.600]   You're always holding the screen
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:35.080]   and they managed to make it work.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.000]   - Occasionally you'll get weird effects if you hold it,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.640]   but you can do it.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.600]   And those are even less bezel.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.720]   I mean, those are no bezel, right?
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.480]   They're really going all the way around.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.680]   - I think that if they put more pixels on the screen
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.400]   that it wouldn't cut down on battery life
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.480]   'cause one of the things that makes my iPad so great
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.400]   is that I don't even, if it's 100%
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.960]   I don't even care for the rest of the day.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.800]   - Well, I should do that though.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.560]   I think OLED will mitigate the difference
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.400]   in the pixel counts.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.520]   - Now you're talking about the phone though, not the iPad.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.400]   - No, I think they're, I mean, it's so hard.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.040]   They don't have the same problems.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.720]   The problem with the phone is that 3D touch
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.040]   is dependent on LED so they have to redesign the way
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.320]   that 3D touch works on the phone
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.040]   by using a new film sensor.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.680]   And that greatly complicates the engineering.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.880]   Where with an iPad they don't have to worry about 3D touch.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.360]   So that's a simple sort of swap and replace,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.200]   and nothing is trivial,
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   but it's a simple swap and replace of screen technologies.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.440]   So I'm hoping that if they do that
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.760]   they'll go all that across.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.840]   If they can make enough screens,
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.280]   it's a smaller selling product
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.840]   so it shouldn't be as hard to manufacture.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.440]   Everything's easy when you're just commenting.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.280]   - I'm kind of feel like for me,
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.360]   I bought the big 12.9 inch
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.160]   and it was just too big.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.960]   And then I got the iPad mini, it was just too small.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:43.560]   So I love the idea of an iPad air size,
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.600]   a 9.7 inch, but with a 10.5 inch screen.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.560]   That'll be just right.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.960]   That's the one I want.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.760]   I don't use, ironically, I'm not an artist
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.520]   so I understand why you would want a bigger screen,
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.800]   but I don't need a bigger screen.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.880]   It's mostly for my eyes I want,
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.920]   you're right, Candy Crush should look better, Kelly.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.800]   That's really the only one.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.640]   - That's it.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.480]   It's not just that.
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.320]   - It's not that much space.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.480]   I'm not, it doesn't seem like that would be
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.680]   much smaller than the 12.9,
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.960]   but I was finishing my presentation last night
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.360]   and I just missed the idea of having a split,
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:17.360]   true split screen.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.640]   Not, I just adjusted the margins of the window
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.800]   so they don't really overlap,
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.200]   but oh no, I just tabbed in something else
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.400]   and something's popped in the front.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:24.400]   The ability to simply say,
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.600]   "Here is my presentation app."
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.080]   Over to the right, here is a web browser
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.000]   so I can just double check some data
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.280]   or decide, make sure I have the spelling of something right.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.720]   It just felt so cumbersome having to command tab
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.840]   between apps and between windows all the time.
[00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.600]   When I should just have, I only need,
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.680]   I only need my, I only need the keynote,
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.240]   I only need Chrome and that's what's gonna make things
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:46.080]   happen for me.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   So if they made it smaller, I don't think they'd ruin it,
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.960]   but I really love that screen real estate
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.400]   and I would really love to get another one of the same size.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.680]   Excuse me, same size screen.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.480]   If they remove the, reduce the bezel.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.040]   - Well, you mean get a 12.9 inch screen
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.240]   on a smaller bezel list.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.080]   - Yeah.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.920]   - Yeah.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.000]   - Okay, I could take that.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.440]   - Even if you were just to cut it down to 10.5,
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.800]   I would have to see how, of course,
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.280]   you have to square the dimensions.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.080]   So it might, that might really feel a lot smaller.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.000]   I've used this regular 9.7 inch iPads and split screen mode
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.760]   and it's nice, but it's really like,
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.320]   oh, isn't it great that you're cramming so much
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.640]   into a small screen, rest of 12.9 is, oh, luxury.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.600]   I'm gonna comfy chair.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.000]   - If you don't have to carry it anywhere,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.960]   I feel like, I made it sneeze.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:36.880]   - He was so excited he had a nose orgasm.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.800]   Good job.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.640]   Okay.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.900]   (laughing)
[00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.800]   - I wanna follow up on Andy's point though.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.640]   Like I've spent some time with an iPad Pro, the 12.9
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.160]   and I own myself an original Air and a Mini.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.840]   And I find that when I want to use the Pro,
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.040]   it's sort of, I keep looking over it
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.320]   because it's straight over there.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.080]   I find that I feel like I have to sit down
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.560]   and use it like it's more of an event.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.880]   Like when I sit down to use my computer
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.280]   and even with the Air at 9.7 or the Mini,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.640]   I feel way more comfortable like walking around with those
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.640]   and I don't know if it's a combination of,
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.280]   I know this one's way more expensive
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.440]   or if it's, I don't feel like I can use it
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.600]   unless I'm sitting down and it's on a stable surface,
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.200]   whether that's my lap or a table or whatever
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.120]   or like what it is about it.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.760]   But when I carry around the iPad Pro,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.120]   I don't feel like I can do anything
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.560]   until I'm not like walking around or something.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:35.640]   So like I've done, you know,
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.560]   network troubleshooting and stuff around the house,
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.280]   using network monitors and things.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.800]   And when I'm doing that, I'm way happier doing that kind
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.920]   of stuff on a Mini or on the Air
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.840]   because I can carry it around a lot more easily.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.680]   - Yeah, the 12.9 was just clunky as heck.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.400]   - 9.7 is like a real convertible.
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.120]   You just, like you use it and then you pull off that thing
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.960]   and you're holding it.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:56.840]   - That's why a 10.5 inch screen on that size body
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.600]   would be so cool, so cool.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.440]   So excited. - Yeah, so anyway, we may not say,
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.960]   you say they would announce it with everything else, right?
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.400]   But then say, but it'll be available in June or something.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.320]   - I think if they had it,
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:08.680]   there'd be more impetus to have a March event.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.240]   I think that's something you show off on stage.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.000]   That's something Phil Schiller shows and talks about.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.240]   And, but I think if there's no event in March
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.360]   and I don't think there will be one,
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.400]   that'll be the spec bumps.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.880]   And then maybe if it's ready in April or later,
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.360]   they have an event then. - Sure, that makes sense.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.880]   - They are, somebody's pointed out in the chat room,
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.680]   I think quite astutely that the move
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.320]   into the spaceship campus starts in April.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.800]   So you might wanna get anything done before then,
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.920]   'cause people will be busy packing boxes.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.840]   - And Dub Dub is gonna hit us in June.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:36.960]   - Dub Dub hits us in June.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.920]   And don't you wanna kind of, maybe this is not true,
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.440]   but I would think you would also wanna hit.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.240]   People are gonna start getting tax refunds
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.880]   in the next month or two, right?
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.600]   Isn't that kind of, that's around--
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.080]   - Education for just this. - I had money.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.520]   Yeah, that's kind of, I've had money
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.720]   and education would be later in the year, wouldn't it?
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.400]   But-- - I don't know, people say that,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.840]   but then whenever I've heard them say,
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.560]   "Apple needs to guess about by September,"
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.160]   the response is typically, "Oh, that's way too late.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.880]   We start planning that stuff in the early spring."
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   It's not beginning of the year.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.280]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.800]   The timeline that I'm most familiar with is May,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.240]   that's usually when they try to get purchase orders
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.600]   and they try to-- - Makes sense.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.440]   You wanna do it from the previous school year,
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.720]   not during the summer vacation, that makes sense, yeah.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.280]   - Right. - Yeah.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.720]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.600]   I think we've really chewed the rumor mill
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.760]   as so thoroughly that it's indistinguishable,
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.560]   indistinguishable at this point from an old piece of rawhide.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.000]   So-- - Although Leo and I will both ask Apple
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.440]   for some more bands for the white edition,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   does anything else that goes with that white edition?
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.000]   - I got the original band. - I got the original band,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.840]   which is Rubber.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.360]   I mean, you pay $1,200 bucks for a watch
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.600]   and you get a Rubber Band.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.560]   - So the reason for that is because it color matches,
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.240]   that's the only one that they could accurately match
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.720]   the whites to the next super important.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.960]   Because the leather one is not the same white
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.680]   and some people find that intolerable.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.040]   I put on the single deployment on mine
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.760]   and I found out a lot of watch companies
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.720]   put deployments on ceramic watches now
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.120]   because you never open them,
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.480]   so the much less chance they'll fall off
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.960]   and hit tiles and shatter and things.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.400]   - Ah, I just think it's really--
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.240]   - I'm hoping that Apple--
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.960]   - This is as obnoxious as it gets, isn't it, Andy?
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.400]   - Oh wait, I just think it's adorable
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.240]   that you're trying to turn up this thing,
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.480]   which is clearly the Herb Tarlic Edition watch.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.080]   (laughing)
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.400]   You should have the white belt.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.800]   - It matches my belt. - You should have the white shoes
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.320]   and my hat as the red and orange pledge.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.840]   - I'm just glad Jack didn't dance.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.640]   - I don't know, I think this is a handsome combo.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.240]   I'm gonna stick with it.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.640]   - You know, it's growing on me.
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.600]   You wouldn't think a white watch would be,
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.120]   but it's growing on me and, you know, I don't know.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.600]   I'm ready for some new bands.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.080]   The nice thing about white is you could use it
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.880]   with any other color, right?
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.960]   You just don't wanna, oh, you can't match it with anything
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.040]   but a floral-alastomer band.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.360]   - The woven nylon look really nice
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.280]   because they have colored looks and like the blues
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.120]   and the pinks and the--
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:50.960]   - That's what I use.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.200]   I have a couple of different woven nylon.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.920]   - This though is what I work out in
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   'cause I'm gonna sweat.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.840]   I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, a floral-alastomer.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.960]   - Well, the white-nose is really good for workouts too.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:18.960]   - Which one, the white-n
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.480]   - Oh, he's not man of style and class of distinction.
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:25.160]   And he has money for ceramic watch.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.360]   Isn't he fancy?
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.520]   - He piled upon the belly of the watch.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.120]   - I guess I can't handle it just for a cannon.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.560]   - You heard this part out upon it.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.920]   - This is Cassio's stainless steel watch
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.160]   that I paid $12 for on Amazon
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.760]   that I'm getting the same amount of respect as people
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.000]   who respect from always for a stainless steel.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.760]   - Here's our ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.600]   - Our ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.920]   - Herb Tarlic.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.840]   (laughing)
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.200]   - Apparently with an early iPad prototype.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.720]   - Hey, is that the new iPad?
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.720]   - Yeah.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.560]   - If they're not here, it's Cincinnati.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.000]   Cincinnati, Delicade.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.360]   - I want that hair.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.800]   That hair is back, baby.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.520]   - Oh, it is.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:03.520]   - It's only Hasselhoff.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.080]   - It's a Hasselhoff hair.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.320]   That's from an old TV show.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.360]   Folks wouldn't.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.200]   - Kids. - Probably.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.960]   - Kids go to Wikipedia, but on your Windows phone,
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.080]   not on your Grumbuck.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:12.920]   - Yeah.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.840]   - Thank God for YouTube.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.520]   I'm just saying thank God for YouTube.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.520]   - Thank you so much.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.560]   All this stuff can be brought back and lives on.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.400]   - Awfully licensed music.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.680]   - God is my witness.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.400]   I thought Apple watches the fly.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.880]   - Why?
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.480]   Here's a little more appropriate Herb Tarlic with the white bell.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.640]   I think an Apple, a white Apple watch
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.800]   it goes so well with that outfit.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.480]   - Yeah, that's pretty high fashion for Herb Tarlic
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:36.880]   if I'm not mistaken. - Oh, that looks so good.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.080]   - Yeah. - I mean, maybe I should
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.920]   get a dresser and just say,
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:43.320]   go back, get all of Herb Tarlic's wardrobe.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.160]   (laughing)
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.560]   That's how I wanna dress.
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.240]   It'd be a look.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.360]   - Oh, it would certainly be something.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.080]   - It'd be a look.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.240]   Here's for the, this is the cranberry version of Herb Tarlic.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.680]   I mean, I have to get the, I have to get the--
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.520]   - We just need the chains.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.320]   We need to put Apple watches around our necks.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.160]   - There you go.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.480]   That's the herb, that's the herb I want to get.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.320]   - Yeah, boy.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:09.360]   - I just want the flavor, yeah, I want the flavor of flavor.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.160]   - Collection, that's what I'm looking for.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.960]   (laughing)
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.000]   - I threatened to build a cap for the iPad
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.480]   so that you could put it on a chain around your neck
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.320]   and bring that back.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:20.840]   - My boss, Cranberry Kevin,
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.640]   used to wear a blackberry playbook on a chain
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.480]   around his neck.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.320]   I have footage.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.920]   (laughing)
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.760]   - Really?
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.600]   - On a gold chain.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:28.440]   - Yes.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.080]   - Just like flavor, flavor.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.560]   Just, wait, kid, man, wait.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.400]   - Oh.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.760]   - What's the neck tie doing?
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.160]   That's an interesting--
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.160]   - It's trying to get away.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.000]   It's escaping.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   - It's escaping.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.760]   - He's running for his life.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.920]   He liked the plads, did old herb.
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:44.760]   - Wow.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.120]   - I'm just glad everyone stopped playing Zelda long enough
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.200]   to do the show today.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.040]   That was--
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.200]   - I have to say, I got my Nintendo Switch
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.960]   and it took me a week to pry it away from the kids.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.320]   (laughing)
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.160]   But once I did last night, I got a comfy in bed.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.960]   Got all comfortable for a fire in the fireplace
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.960]   and fired up Zelda.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.760]   That's a fun game.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:07.360]   - I'm not expecting any app updates for the next two weeks
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.800]   because all the developers I see on Twitter
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.640]   are just playing Zelda.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.120]   - It's really fun.
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.960]   I'm not of the Zelda generation.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.440]   I never played it before.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.440]   - Oh, James Thompson.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.440]   - Oh, jeez.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.280]   - I know.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.040]   People are saying you're gonna be spoiled now
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.840]   'cause you can't go back and play older Zelda's.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.960]   This is a--
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.880]   - My little godson, he tried it on the Switch
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.040]   but he doesn't have access to it all the time
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.200]   so now he's playing it on the Game Boy,
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   the original one he started from the beginning.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.840]   And to him it's the same because they're all new.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.760]   - Yeah.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.600]   Right.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.440]   - No.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.280]   - Oh, good.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.960]   - I like the portability.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.920]   It's a little weird.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.040]   I mean, it's like playing a game on a tablet.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.560]   I mean, it's a square.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:47.080]   - And they should be ashamed of their DRM.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.920]   It should be a shame.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.760]   - And the DRM, that's a shame, you're right.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.600]   - Scream.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.600]   - All game companies should though.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.400]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.240]   - I know.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.080]   - Shame.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:55.920]   I wanna walk behind on my Game of Thrones
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.760]   and just yell, "Shame."
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.360]   - Shame on my game, save data.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.760]   Shame on my game, save data.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.200]   - Shame.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.360]   Our show today brought to you by those great folks
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.720]   at Squarespace, the place to make your next move,
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.640]   make your next website, make it beautiful.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.120]   Whether you're a chef and you wanna showcase
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:13.120]   your culinary creations, a photographer
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.520]   and you wanna have a stunning portfolio,
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.040]   maybe you're a band or a musician,
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.600]   you wanna share it and have your fans have calendar access
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.320]   and buy CDs or buy digital downloads.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:25.720]   You could do it all at Squarespace.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.840]   Tell your story, pursue your passion project,
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.040]   make your next move known with Squarespace.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.720]   Squarespace starts with great templates.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.560]   Now they look good because Squarespace has fabulous designers.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.040]   And they're just a starting point.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:39.920]   You're gonna make it your own.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.600]   That's one of the great things about Squarespace.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.040]   Every site looks unique.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.760]   But also there's more to the template
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.600]   than just how it looks.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.280]   The engineering behind it is super sophisticated.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.040]   In effect, if you were gonna build a website,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.360]   you could go out and do as we did,
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.960]   it's been hundreds, well, several hundred thousand dollars
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.880]   getting designers and engineers together.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.800]   And then six months later, everything changes, right?
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.720]   Styles change, technologies change
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.040]   and you gotta do it all over again.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.720]   Or you can go to Squarespace.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.240]   You can use the best designers, the best engineers
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.760]   and it keeps it up to date.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.960]   It keeps it constantly reflecting the latest style,
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.760]   the latest technology.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.200]   Things like, well, for instance,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.920]   they've got templates for news organizations.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.680]   You know the kind of the infinite scroll templates.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.720]   You've got images and galleries and videos and audio.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.520]   RSS is built in.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.440]   You can publish content directly from your blog.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.840]   You can update it once and then share it simultaneously
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:41.120]   across social media platforms.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.480]   I love how you can link in all of your social media platforms,
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.440]   including Yes, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.320]   And every time you publish it automatically goes out
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.280]   to there if you want.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.440]   There on every post you can have, of course,
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.240]   the share buttons, even pin it buttons,
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.640]   pin it Pinterest, pin it buttons.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.360]   So your visitors help you promote your site
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.440]   by sharing your content.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.360]   That's really important.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.320]   Squarespace provides the marketing tools
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.000]   to engage your audience through contact
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.080]   and sign up forms, applications, surveys, email campaigns,
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:09.680]   and newsletters.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.640]   Yes, MailChimp is integrated into Squarespace.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.640]   Actually, a lot of services are indicated in Squarespace.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.520]   So you can promote events with a calendar or a list of events.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.040]   You can let visitors RSVP from your website.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.320]   You can do e-commerce.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.000]   In fact, there's no better e-commerce platform.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.440]   It's the only one that makes your store look
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.360]   like it's part of your site.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.240]   A lot of times the store looks like an afterthought
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:35.040]   or something a third party provided
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.600]   or hanging off of your site, not at Squarespace.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.640]   Commerce is integrated into every platform beautifully.
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:43.440]   No limit on the number of products or services you can sell.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.520]   Squarespace Analytics give you visual reports
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.200]   so you can see immediately page views, conversions,
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.920]   what content's popular.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.080]   You can recover lost sales with automatic emails
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.160]   to customers who abandon checkout.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.840]   I know customers, including my wife, who will do that,
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.280]   by the way, they'll put stuff in the cart
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.240]   and then wait until they get a discount code in the email
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.920]   'cause that's what a lot of vendors do.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.080]   It's what you can do with Squarespace.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.560]   Hey, we noticed you selected some stuff but didn't buy.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.960]   What if we gave you 10% off?
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.000]   You could do that with Squarespace too.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.600]   Squarespace has your next move covered
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.520]   with free unlimited hosting, top of the line security,
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.600]   enterprise grade infrastructure
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.000]   and around the clock support.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.200]   Make your next website, make your next move.
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.080]   Go to squarespace.com and use the offer code Macbreak.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   Get 10% off when you use the offer code Macbreak Squarespace.com.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.160]   That's where my site is, leoloport.com.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.600]   And it's so easy.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.120]   I got to post more.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.360]   I want to post more stuff there.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.080]   One thing I have done on my Squarespace site
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.480]   is I've updated a list of all my audio books
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.320]   that I've ever listened to and an Audible are there,
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.760]   almost 500 titles and I've updated some more.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.360]   You know, I just started just finishing another one
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.200]   that I really love.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.080]   I got to add that to my, I'll blog that,
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.520]   called Linkin' in the Bar-Doh.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.640]   Man was had a good book.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.560]   And it was a, this is not an Audible ad.
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   They didn't buy an ad today, but it has 166 different
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:11.760]   readers, performers, including Ron Swanson,
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.840]   Nick Offerman, who is one of the leads, David Sedaris.
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.680]   It's so good, so good.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.200]   - What are how long it's going to be before they can get DNA
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.400]   information from Linkin, grow a throat
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.880]   and then have him read his own book?
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:27.720]   - I know.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.840]   - That'd be cool.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.000]   - Linkin', this is, it's a beautiful book.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.800]   It's not what you expect.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.440]   It's the first novel from a guy who's renowned
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.200]   as a short story author.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   And it's a little fantasy, not sci-fi, but fantasy.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.480]   Takes place all in one night in 1862.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.520]   That's all I'm gonna say.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.080]   I don't wanna spoil it for you.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   - I don't know how it ends.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.000]   - I am so sad.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.840]   One of the things that I really, every year I would look
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.360]   forward to, Apple Genius is visiting our studio.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.160]   They'd always be kind of coy.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.320]   And I'd say, what do you do?
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.280]   And they'd say, well, you know, I'm in technology.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.680]   - Can we tell?
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.840]   - And then I could always tell.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.520]   You can always, I say, you work for the fruit company,
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.360]   don't you?
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.040]   And they said, yeah, you're out here for training, aren't you?
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.200]   Yeah, they used to do genius training at one infinite loop.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.880]   For years, they did that three weeks or longer.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.320]   Sometimes people would be out here all summer,
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.280]   they're gonna stop doing that.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.960]   They're gonna do it all in store
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.560]   with a self-guided experience using company
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.440]   provided reference materials.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.480]   - It seemed like the same.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.880]   I mean, I had a lot of friends who did this program.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.840]   Like I would just, they would statistically start
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.880]   tweeting or Instagramming from the South Bay area.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.920]   And you kind of know that they were there
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.280]   for intensive training.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.080]   They all seemed to like it and really benefit from it.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.400]   - Oh yeah, it's.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.880]   - I'm sure this is efficient, but it's not the same.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.720]   - It's team building.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.560]   - Yeah.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.680]   - And they get a trip to the mothership.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.720]   What's like, you work for Apple
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.880]   and you get a trip to the mothership.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.160]   What's more, what's a better way of building your love
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.000]   for Apple than that?
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.120]   - And they were all so happy.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.400]   And they would, and a lot of them would take a chance,
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.840]   to take that opportunity to visit other Silicon Valley places
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.680]   and kind of get to know the Bay Area,
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.280]   come up here and see us.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.560]   - And they'd give half their money back to Cafe Max anyway.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.600]   I mean, I'm at the company store.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.520]   - Here's a quote from an Apple retail employee.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.720]   This is from Mac Rumors.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   "Apple's Genius Training Program was for years
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.920]   a rite of passage for Apple retail employees,
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.600]   not only a training opportunity,
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.920]   but a chance to visit one of Apple's corporate campuses."
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.760]   'Cause I guess they also did it in Austin.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.280]   To get questions answered at the source
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.560]   and for those who headed to Cupertino
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.400]   to experience Silicon Valley in the Apple culture.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.560]   The traditional selfie in front of one infinite loop
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:39.400]   was a milestone in the career of every Apple Genius,
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:42.240]   but not any more.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.920]   They're also adding a new retail position
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:49.440]   that is below genius above technical specialists,
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.560]   which has been around for a while,
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.320]   called technical expert.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   - Smarty pants was portrayed more by somebody else.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.360]   - Smarty pants is already taken.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:59.120]   I think Microsoft has that one.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.120]   - You gotta figure out if some people are like,
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.200]   oh, well, at least I'm not gonna think
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:03.320]   I'm gonna Cupertino end up in Austin anymore.
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.280]   - That would be a bummer, right?
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.520]   Or Cork Ireland.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.400]   Actually, I'd take-- - Oh, I thought to Austin.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.120]   - Yeah, I got Austin.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   I was holding that for Cupertino and I got Austin.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.080]   Actually, Austin's a lot more fun than Cupertino.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.920]   There are advantages.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:21.680]   We're seeing more and more apps using the touch bar
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.720]   on the MacBook Pro.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:25.160]   I mentioned last week my pick of the week,
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.600]   last week, Nisys, the nicest writer.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.920]   I forgot to mention that one of the cool things
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.560]   is they'd added touch bar support.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.440]   I don't use it.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:35.960]   - If I could turn off the touch bar, I would.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.280]   It just gets in the way.
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.560]   Apple is selling, in fact, this might be something to look at,
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.760]   a 13 inch MacBook Pro without a touch bar.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.840]   This is from October of last year as a refurb
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.480]   for a pretty good price.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.320]   - I have both.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.600]   I just, like I have review units
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:53.840]   that I have neglected to return back.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.520]   And I end up using the one with the touch bar.
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.480]   What was interesting to me is that I was sitting there,
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   I was writing a Pokemon Go game guide of all things.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.640]   And my eight year old Godson,
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.240]   I was babysitting, came over and said,
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.400]   I want to do that.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.080]   So I gave him my laptop and he started,
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.560]   he pulled open tabs, started doing research.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:09.720]   And he was using the touch bar almost like it had always
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.560]   been there on a Mac.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.640]   He was tapping words.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.720]   He's like, what is this?
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.200]   What does the Macs I've seen have this?
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:15.400]   And he was like, this is great.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.360]   And just tapping going on it.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.920]   And then he sent me the stuff that he wrote.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.680]   And it was like, there were no spelling mistakes.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   There were a bunch of really complete sentences.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.520]   - Wow, that's kind of neat.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.840]   - Yeah, I was super happy with that.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.360]   And then he was like, I'd be a blogger when I grew up.
[00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.760]   So like I was sold.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.080]   Totally sold.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.680]   - So do you, but now you say you gravitate
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.360]   towards a Mac book pro with touch bar,
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.600]   but do you actually use the touch bar?
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.680]   - Yeah, I use it.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.200]   It's one of those things where I'm continuously delighted
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.640]   that like I look at it and I go to press the escape key
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.160]   to exit a video and there's no escape key.
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.360]   There's an actual exit the video button.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.480]   And especially when a new app adds things.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.280]   For me, I've just never been good at remembering
[00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:53.360]   a multitude of shortcuts, especially with apps like Adobe,
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.840]   where how you do something varies from app to app.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.680]   Like even simple things like how the clipboard buffer works,
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.760]   or how you do simple tasks, it varies completely.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.920]   And I don't remember them.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.400]   And if I don't use an app every day, like text expanded
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.200]   right now and one password, all those things,
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.800]   because I use them constantly, but apps that I use weekly,
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.000]   I just never retain them.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.280]   And now I just glance up and the shortcut's there.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.440]   And I don't have to remember that you use command T
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:17.160]   or whatever in garage band and you use command
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.400]   whatever D or whatever.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.880]   I assume forgetting what they are now in Final Cut Pro.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.320]   I just look up, boom, that's the button and it's done.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.840]   I don't have to go through the menu system.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.480]   So for me, it's contextually faster.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.440]   So I've gotten acclimated to it already.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.280]   - Okay.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.240]   And I never got used to it.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.080]   - Me neither.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:36.040]   - I'm glad the people have the individual responses to it.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.360]   I don't think it's objectively bad, but I just always,
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:44.120]   I had kind of like the different ops experience from Renee,
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.600]   in that I think that shortcuts are the things that I learned
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.400]   because I use this feature so much.
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.840]   I don't even want to have to reach up and touch something.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.400]   I can just hit command shift option T
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.640]   and I know what's going to happen right then and there.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.040]   Whereas with the touch bar, things keep shifting
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.760]   so many times that that flat surface for me mentally
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.560]   is always for buttons that are always there.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.560]   I don't have to look.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:08.840]   I can just push where I always push to get the thing
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.680]   that I want.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.280]   If I have to go looking to see,
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.480]   well, let's just see what this app is offering me
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.200]   in terms of shortcuts or help.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.120]   It's that's wasting time.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.640]   But I think that just simply for whatever reason,
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:24.760]   it just never reached me.
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.160]   - Do you find, do you put yours in function key mode
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.880]   so that you don't accidentally hit Siri
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.240]   or the notifications slide out or?
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:40.000]   - Yeah, I keep trying to use it the way that Apple intended
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.920]   to give it a fair shake,
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:44.760]   but I really do want to keep it in function key mode.
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.040]   I really do want, I like the consistency
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.200]   of this is a row of keys that will always be,
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:51.520]   that will always be the volume control,
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:53.760]   that will always be the screen brightness.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.920]   That's just will always be for to mute things
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.000]   and hit playback.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.760]   That's just where I want to go.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.280]   That's really what I want it to be.
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.920]   I also really want the escape key to be right there.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.600]   And I know, as much time as I spend making fun
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:13.880]   of design wonks, it really bothers me so much
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.280]   that those keys do not extend all the way
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.640]   to the same edge as the physical keyboard.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:25.200]   It's like, oh, the Apple that I know,
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.720]   that I like to make fun of is the Apple
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.920]   that would have delayed this machine another three years
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.440]   just to make sure that they have the same vertical line
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.440]   matching the keyboard.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.080]   - For those 10 pixels.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.280]   - There was a rejection that I just wish
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.240]   there was better rejection,
[00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:41.120]   'cause I hit it so, I hit it so much.
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.120]   - That's the only thing that bugs me.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.280]   - And I don't realize it.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.960]   Like I'll be lightly touching it
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.400]   and everything else will stop working
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.000]   and it takes me like two seconds to realize
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.920]   that I'm lightly touching it with my other hand.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.760]   And then I remove that and everything goes back to working,
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.440]   but every time that happens to me.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.280]   - Yeah.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:55.120]   - I mean, I--
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.720]   - So I just want to complain about the touch bar for a minute.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.560]   - Okay.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.280]   - So I don't have a machine that has it.
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.520]   What I have is a machine that has a force touch trackpad.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.040]   And I seem to be the only person who thought
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.480]   that that was going to be amazing
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.080]   because nobody's using it,
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.640]   nobody's doing anything neat with it.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.640]   It doesn't give me any kind of awesome feedback.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.040]   Like they told me it was going to,
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.280]   when they debuted this like two years ago or whatever it was.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.160]   And I don't know why.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.840]   And I want it to be great,
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.520]   but I feel like they sort of went,
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.320]   well, we're not going to do anything with it.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.680]   So we don't think anyone else is going to.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.840]   So we're going to give you a new bar at the top
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:33.120]   because F keys are for Andy and nobody else, I guess.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:34.520]   I don't know.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.880]   But that's the thing that's frustrating to me about it
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.160]   is because I'm like Andy,
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.360]   I started on a power book in the olden days
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:44.000]   when they were still only three digit numbers
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:44.880]   in the model.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.000]   And my hands are only this big.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.760]   And so it was too far to go back and forth
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.120]   to the track ball.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.560]   Yes, it was a ball in the olden days kids.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.280]   And so I started learning keyboard commands
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.080]   in order to be able to do things faster.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.320]   So I'm still pretty good with a lot of keyboard commands
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.280]   for stuff.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:05.240]   So now that we have a track pad
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:08.280]   and it's much more proportional to the size of the screen
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.920]   and it's a lot closer to the keyboard,
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:11.520]   it's a lot easier to use.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.680]   And I really like that.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.280]   And I really want the force touch to do something cool
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.040]   and it still doesn't do anything cool
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.200]   and it doesn't seem like anybody's embraced it.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.520]   So it was kind of weird to me to see everybody go,
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.800]   ooh, touch bar, touch bar, touch bar.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.360]   When there's already something awesome
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.200]   that's on every single Mac and on the new Magic Trackpad,
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:30.960]   it's also got the force touch feedback
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.360]   even though nobody's using it.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.600]   And I want that to become a bigger deal.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:35.800]   And so far it hasn't.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.880]   And so that's my rant about the touch bar.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.320]   It's way more people have this other technology
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:43.960]   that nobody's actually getting any mileage out of.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.520]   - So I mean, like the big deal with that
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.000]   was they originally wanted to decouple the physical apparatus
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.760]   so that they could move it out from underneath it.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.680]   If you had the traditional touch bar,
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:54.280]   first it would only lever one direction
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.120]   so you couldn't use it as effectively at the top
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:57.960]   as you could at the bar.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.440]   But also it had the sensors underneath it
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.440]   as a physical stack which limited how thin
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:02.920]   they could make the front of the computer.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.000]   So with force touch technology,
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.480]   they can just put the digital switch anywhere
[00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:09.280]   and you can press anywhere on the track pad.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.320]   And so that was like I think the big driver
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.840]   and everything else was like an afterthought
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.520]   and it really shows.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.160]   - Yeah, and that's where I'm disappointed
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:18.720]   because I wanted people to adopt it.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.800]   And so far I have literally found one thing
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.720]   and it's if you're in keynote
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.840]   and you're dragging an element around like an image
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.360]   or a text box or something and you get to the center,
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.640]   it will sort of buzz you and let you know
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.560]   that you've dragged it like perfectly centered on your slide.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.360]   And that's like it.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:36.320]   That's literally the only time it's ever done anything
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:39.040]   which maybe go what's wrong with my computer?
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.040]   Why is my track pad buzzing at me?
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:41.920]   Do I have to take it in?
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.240]   And then I'm like, oh,
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.640]   'cause then I can see all the lines.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.760]   Oh, that's what it's doing.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   Okay, so one person cares
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.400]   and that one person works on the keynote.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.240]   - For text expander, could you make it
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.840]   that when I push really hard out of anger
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.440]   it automatically autocaps everything?
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.280]   - Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:57.240]   - So that way if I hit the tweet button hard
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.240]   because I'm angry it just autocaps my Twitter.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.760]   (laughing)
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.600]   - You need the Hulk smash button.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.600]   - Yeah, it would be great because I am so angry.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:08.440]   I'm using aggressive force on this button.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.560]   - I'm using the physical click on the track pad.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.400]   I'm using it.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.320]   I'll talk to the developers.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.920]   I'll see what, when I get back to work
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.840]   I'll see what I can do.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:19.680]   How's that?
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.520]   - Awesome.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.360]   - Do you, I mean Kelly,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.600]   do you like 3D touch on the phone?
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.720]   - I do, I use it constantly.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.560]   I think it's great.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.640]   And that's part of why I'm even more disappointed
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.320]   in the force touch on the track pad
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.360]   because lots of people are doing all kinds of cool stuff
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.880]   with it on my phone.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.000]   And my computer feels abandoned
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.040]   in a weird way, I guess.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.680]   Like it started there because that came out in March
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:43.920]   and then it wasn't until that fall
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.960]   that we got 3D touch on anything.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.840]   So I really want for it to turn into something cool
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.200]   and give me some sort of feedback on something
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.320]   when I am using the track pad
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.680]   and so far that hasn't happened.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.960]   And I feel like it's underappreciated
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:01.280]   and that like the right, when the right app comes along
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:04.040]   and shows what you can do with that
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.400]   then people will start adopting it
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.800]   but nobody's done that yet.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.960]   This seems to be a problem actually in Denmark
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.080]   to the computer industry.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.160]   You see it happen with Apple
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:14.240]   but I see it happen with Android and Windows 2
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.560]   where you get the big announcement,
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.520]   the splashy announcement, the new technology,
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.640]   this is gonna be great.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.080]   And then for some reason,
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:23.800]   there's a disconnect between that and developers,
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.000]   maybe developers just, you know,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.200]   hey, we gotta get our job done.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.600]   We don't have time to be doing frippery
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.640]   but for whatever reason,
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.400]   they don't take advantage of these new features
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.720]   and they just die in the vine
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.800]   and I can think of a dozen of them on the Mac
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:38.120]   and the same thing on Google.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:42.560]   You know that they have this Google Now tap where,
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.520]   I mean, it just, nothing seems to take advantage of these.
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.760]   The speech recognition assistance,
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.760]   the echo, the slo-mo and the okay goggle.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.320]   None of those, I don't know if that will trigger
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:56.520]   a Google thing or not.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.640]   I don't know.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.760]   Actually, I should try it.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.400]   Okay, goggle.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.560]   No, it doesn't, good news.
[00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:03.120]   (laughing)
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:03.960]   You're done.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.280]   Bullitt Todd.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.560]   It just went what?
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.440]   Are you crazy?
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.400]   Are you drunk or home?
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.560]   (laughing)
[00:49:09.560 --> 00:49:11.080]   Yeah, I'm gonna work with you again.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.640]   Why is that?
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.320]   Does the company need to put more force behind these products?
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.160]   Is there--
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.920]   There's a marketing term that says
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:21.720]   you paint the target around the arrow.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.800]   So like you shoot,
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.680]   Michael Gartemurg is great at explaining this
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.400]   but basically you shoot a bunch of arrows
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.640]   and the ones that stick, you quickly paint a target around.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:29.960]   And so these companies announce things
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.800]   and sometimes they really believe they're gonna be great
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.960]   and they just don't get any uptake
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.160]   and it's whether developers are like,
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.800]   do that's the last thing on our list.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.160]   We're gonna support, we have eight, nine or 10 other things
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.440]   and it's not like that,
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.320]   the drug track fads are not ubiquitous.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.680]   We don't see a lot of utility in it.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.280]   You made an API who two thumbs up for you
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.160]   but I have a list this long to get to.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.880]   And then the company doesn't invest back in it
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:49.880]   because they don't see adoption
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.120]   and it becomes a vicious cycle.
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:52.520]   And there's only so many hours in the day
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.360]   and so many days in the week to get product out.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.040]   And I think exactly what you said,
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.840]   they're not consciously abandoned.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.320]   It was sort of like someone had a neat idea
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:01.000]   and it shipped and it just didn't go anywhere.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.600]   So you hear a little bit of a thud.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.000]   - No, no, I know exactly.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.800]   - First touch is one of them I think.
[00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.680]   - Yeah, well, I think the touch bar particularly,
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.480]   you're taking something that if you were to put it
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:16.360]   on the screen really wouldn't be that different
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:19.400]   from having your own little OLED screen separate.
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.940]   But if you had put it on the screen,
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:24.000]   you could have made this a system wide resource.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.560]   But no, you didn't, you just put it onto a couple
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.640]   of really expensive Macs.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.400]   You've also not made it an emphatic feature by doing so.
[00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:37.040]   So I think that if you support this,
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.520]   it means that you didn't come up with,
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.000]   it's not gonna be a user interface element
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.200]   that you could not have implemented
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.840]   some other more simple and direct way.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.360]   So it's not as though this is necessarily gonna inspire you
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.800]   to do something new and different.
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.160]   And it also means that you have to accommodate
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.320]   under the same code base users of computers
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.000]   that don't have that user interface element at all.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   And then I guess my frustration using the MacBook
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.800]   is that it really doesn't seem like they had a brilliant idea
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.360]   for moving the platform forward.
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:17.600]   It seemed like it was a cool thing to have this OLED screen.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.720]   And yeah, we could do some things with it.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:19.960]   Great, let's do that.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.320]   They made the trackpad really, really huge
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.920]   and they're selling that with the idea that,
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:26.480]   "Hey, look, and see, this is why we keep insisting.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.880]   You don't need a touch screen for a Mac.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.760]   See, 'cause we're taking all the great things
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.560]   about having an iPad and putting it there in the Mac.
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.560]   And well, no, it's like you've taken a horse and buggy
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.040]   and you've basically put a two-wheeled motor
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:43.480]   in place of the horse.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.240]   You have not made the step forward
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.680]   of building a really great car.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.000]   You have made something that is as unreliable
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.480]   and slow as a car.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.920]   And is as big and bulky and ungainly and slow as a horse.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:01.280]   So why not just actually take the next step forward
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.640]   and evolve the system instead of just saying,
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.080]   look, we basically grafted two things
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.600]   that have the word touch in them onto this thing.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.240]   And that's how we made our Mac smarter now.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.240]   Okay.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.320]   There is, I mean, I understand it's also difficult
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:22.720]   because we're at peak technology in both computers
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.240]   and phones and so finding something new
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:28.240]   to get people excited about is a challenge.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.960]   I mean, all the obvious stuff is taken now.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.280]   So you got to-- - Look, blowing logo
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.240]   on the back, people buy billions.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.840]   - Or a red freakin' phone.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.280]   You know, it doesn't have to be a technology feature.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.600]   - Scratch our surface, what do you find?
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.440]   More surface.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:45.360]   - But in a way that explains apples turning
[00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:47.240]   towards fashion a little bit
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.720]   because one of the advantages of fashion
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:51.120]   is you get something new every year
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.440]   and that's enough to drive people to the market.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.880]   It's hard to get some new exciting technology every year.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.800]   - And they're all good enough.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:00.560]   I think our iPads are good enough
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:02.160]   or Macs are good enough for most of you.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.000]   - Yeah, I actually just bought that refurbished
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.520]   2016 13-inch without a touch bar.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.840]   'Cause I thought, you know, actually,
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.120]   that's what I really want.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.600]   I don't want the touch bar.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.400]   And we have lots of staff.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:14.560]   - Is there anything you can't do on it?
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:16.960]   No, you can do everything you can do on any other computer.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.560]   - And it's also, the 15, I think it was too big for me.
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.440]   I wanted something a little bit smaller.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.200]   So I ordered that for tomorrow
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.360]   and I'll just take my 15, we'll go to probably to Lisa
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.200]   who will then pass her computer on to.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.720]   - I've told this before, but we got my mom an iPad,
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.000]   an iPad Air when it came out
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.240]   and she already had an iPad too.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.240]   And she didn't stop using it.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.000]   She just had high capacity iPad.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.440]   She'd use one until it ran out of battery
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:38.880]   then she was supposed to the other one.
[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:40.680]   And it didn't matter that one had a retina display
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.160]   or was faster to her.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:43.240]   It was just day and night.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.720]   And then we got her the iPad Pro
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:46.240]   and she reluctantly gave away her too.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:48.520]   But now she uses the Air and the Pro.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.320]   And again, it doesn't, like the all everything that she needs.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.640]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.960]   That's kind of telling, isn't it?
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.800]   That's kind of telling.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.880]   - We do, like we're like, oh my God,
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.080]   he's got this density display
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.120]   and we can't even look at it in spec sheets.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.560]   We're not looking at real world.
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:02.800]   We're looking at, she's just like,
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.360]   I pulled up the newspaper site.
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:05.800]   I pulled up the museum site.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.640]   - Right.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:10.400]   Well, I'll let you know how that refurb works out.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.360]   You know, you don't save so much in Apple refurbs.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:15.200]   It's a few hundred dollars.
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.160]   But. - You get apples.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:20.480]   - That's almost enough for new pair of Apple headphones.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.720]   (laughing)
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.520]   - Kelly, do you use the AirPods?
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:27.680]   Because you're not here all the time.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.520]   It's nice to get some fresh perspective.
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.320]   Do you use this?
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:34.800]   - I don't because I have a pair of Bluetooth headphones
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.040]   that I already use in like,
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.880]   I have the, oh gosh, what are they called?
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.840]   - It's okay.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.200]   - They're right here.
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.560]   - I can never remember.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.840]   I bought the ones.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.800]   I just say the ones Andy recommended.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.760]   - Well, full disclosure,
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.000]   I entered a contest from the wire cutter
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.040]   and they sent me a pair.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.360]   And they are JLab, Bluetooth headphones.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.120]   - That's the one Andy recommends.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.200]   - Sport model and they don't fall out
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:09.320]   and they last forever and they are suitable
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.280]   when I'm doing yard work
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:13.600]   or if I'm out mowing the lawn and stuff.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.160]   They're super useful and I don't have to worry
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.520]   about cables or batteries or anything.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.680]   So for me, they're pretty great.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.840]   - That's, I use the Epic too
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.360]   because Andy recommended them.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.000]   - Yes, that's the Epic.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.560]   - You know, one of my favorite features of that is actually,
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:30.560]   they of course they're wired together
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:33.360]   but like the controls for volume and mute,
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:35.160]   they happen to, or at least I've adjusted them
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.440]   so that they fit, they fall right on
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.440]   like the bone behind my ear.
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.120]   So I feel, and when I click them,
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.880]   I can sort of like feel the click on a very,
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.720]   like on a skeletal level.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:50.040]   And it feels like I had these controls
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.600]   like sub-continuously surgically installed
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:56.520]   and I'm actually pushing on a button that's in my head
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.160]   and I enjoy that a little bit.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:01.200]   - And now a little insight into Andy's brain.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.840]   - You know, mostly bible.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   - You had mentioned the Sugru hack
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.960]   where you put Sugru on the inside of that butt
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.920]   and then you form it to your, I did that
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.120]   but I kind of like just the soft butt instead.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:14.840]   So I threw out the Sugru, I hope you don't mind.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.800]   - Like a sergeant was putting a tape on his AirPods this week.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.480]   He has a black tape to make a panda pods
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:22.240]   and then he used a colored tape to make six colored pods.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.320]   - Oh see, that's cheaper than getting that paint job
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:26.160]   that you were talking about.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.000]   Let's take a break.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.600]   Andy, we're gonna call you back or something.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.920]   There's some clicking coming in again through your system.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:32.880]   I don't think it's Skype.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.600]   I think there's an electrical issue going on
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.440]   with your connection.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.280]   Maybe you could plug it on.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.480]   - Again, I'm surrounded by a lot of heat
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.680]   and insulation cooling things so I'm not doubting that.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.880]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.240]   Well, he's in Atlantic City for reasons unknown.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.840]   No, he's because he's speaking to the summer campus association.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.120]   - Did you see that Reddit Twitter joke
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.560]   on the internet yesterday, Leo?
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:53.840]   I think it was the day before yesterday where it said,
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.160]   I was joking about the CIA listening to everything I said
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.720]   and my eye laughed and my wife laughed
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.880]   and Amazon Echo laughed so I shot the echo.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:02.320]   (laughing)
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:04.520]   - 'Cause you can't shoot anything else, right.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:08.960]   I thought you were gonna mention Pete Sousa's post
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:13.400]   on Instagram of Obama in a microwave oven
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:14.520]   but that's another one.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:17.600]   - Just don't take the door off.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.960]   (laughing)
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.440]   - I was sure today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:28.360]   Actually, maybe it was Colbert who did that.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:30.320]   Anyway, he's trying to talk to the president
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   through a microwave.
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.680]   I was sure today brought to you by FreshBooks,
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:37.520]   the ridiculously easy cloud accounting system
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.920]   we love so very much.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:42.480]   In fact, I personally have a personal deep love
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.760]   for FreshBooks 'cause they saved my keister.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.800]   Starting when they first started out in 2004,
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.600]   that's when I was going up to Canada,
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.200]   doing call for help.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.600]   And I had to, I was invoicing Rogers,
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.160]   the producers for my time and for my expenses.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:00.640]   They paid the hotel and the airfare
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.600]   but I had to bill them for it.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.840]   And I hated it, that was the worst thing.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:05.880]   You don't get into business.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.520]   If you're an individual or freelancer,
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:08.880]   a small business person,
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.600]   you don't get into business 'cause you like invoicing
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.520]   'cause you like accounting,
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.680]   unless you're business is accounting.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.840]   You get into business to do what you love to do.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:19.000]   In my case, I love to do call for help
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.880]   with Amber MacArthur and that was fun.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.360]   But I would just every time.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.920]   And I used to tell Amber, I can't,
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:26.840]   I got an invoice, I haven't done it in months.
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:27.880]   Oh, I hate doing this.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.080]   She told me about FreshBooks.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.360]   They had just started in Toronto.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:36.280]   And they made it so easy for me to send invoices.
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.120]   You get paid faster,
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:40.840]   you get because you're doing your expenses and invoices
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.520]   right through the FreshBooks interface,
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.000]   you really get cloud accounting.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.920]   In fact, the newest FreshBooks dashboard, I love.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.680]   I'm so in love with this.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:51.960]   I wish I were invoicing people.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.760]   It provides quick access to spending,
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.240]   outstanding balances.
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:57.200]   You even know your total profit,
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.440]   which for a lot of people, certainly for me,
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:02.240]   I didn't know that until the end of the year till tax time.
[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:03.600]   You get accounting reports,
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.400]   would make tax times easier too,
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.000]   like sales tax, summaries, profit and loss.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.560]   And because your clients are getting these invoices
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.640]   and the invoice built in has a pay me button,
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.840]   you get paid faster,
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.040]   an average of 11 days faster.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:21.680]   So that is awesome.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:22.600]   With FreshBooks payment,
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:25.320]   you can enable your clients to pay you online by credit card.
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.360]   There's no setup required for you or them.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.040]   Your customer just pays right from the invoice.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:32.200]   And it turns out clients hate paying bills
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.240]   as much as you hate sending bills.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.160]   They just want to get it over with, make it easy for them.
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:39.200]   See what invoices have been sent, viewed and paid?
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.560]   You can see what's over, yes, viewed.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:42.560]   Did you hear that?
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.480]   They'll tell you, so your client can no longer say,
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.320]   "Oh, I didn't get your invoice."
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.160]   No, you did.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:47.360]   I saw you look at it.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.520]   Oh, you can also set auto payment reminders,
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.560]   automatic late fees.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.520]   FreshBooks will do time tracking for you.
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.840]   So that means both in the website and in the app,
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.120]   you can build for time and hours automatically,
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.040]   even by client and specific projects.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.440]   So you can track your time right down to the minute.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.880]   Team time sheets even.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.960]   When it comes to creating an invoice,
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.560]   you'll know what you did when you did it
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.920]   and when it was paid or not.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   FreshBooks is awesome.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.040]   And it integrates with everything you may already use,
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.120]   like Stripe Shopify, Gusto,
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.480]   Accuity, Scheduling and on and on and on.
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.000]   Ensure a smooth tax season and save.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.400]   Here's another stat, 192 hours a year,
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.600]   just by using FreshBooks.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.000]   You also save some Ajita.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.240]   I was always worried about,
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.960]   "Oh, gotta get to bills."
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.880]   Try it free for 30 days right now, free for 30 days.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.560]   FreshBooks.com/MacBreak,
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.160]   just put MacBreak Weekly in the,
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.600]   how did you hear about a section?
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.960]   FreshBooks.com/MacBreak.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.740]   Gotta warn you though, you try it free for 30 days,
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.880]   you may never stop using it.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.120]   All right, let's see, did Andy get all fixed up?
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.880]   Oh, he's down.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:04.720]   He's down.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:06.240]   - Oh, no, Ajita, for Leo, no, Ajita.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.920]   - No, Ajita.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.760]   - Is he the boss?
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.200]   - The boss, yeah, I decided I could go either way.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.360]   I could go with the Yiddish or I could go with the Italian
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.720]   and I kinda like to alternate.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.040]   I got a little-- - I'm lucky, no.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.440]   (laughing)
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.280]   - Ajita.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.680]   - Oh, it was a sore-ess?
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.120]   Were you down to sore-ess or Ajita?
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.200]   Was I big- - It was sore-ess
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.040]   or a spilcus.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040]   (laughing)
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.360]   - Don't get something like a lag because of my toy.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:31.760]   - Ajita, I did, I did, I did, I did, I did, I did flies.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.240]   So, here's an interesting story.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.080]   Are you there, Andy?
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:38.840]   Let's see if, I don't wanna do it before I can get Andy back.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.360]   Now we don't hear Andy.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.360]   - Sadly no.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:43.200]   - Sadly?
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.400]   That is not my fault, Sis Carsten.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.320]   Yes, Andy.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.160]   (laughing)
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.000]   - There, I'm sorry, I was--
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.960]   I missed lunch so I had a new to-
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.680]   - A new to-grain bar from the speakers.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.800]   - So I'm so sorry, Andy.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.800]   If I could send you a nice hot pie, pizza pie, I'd do so.
[01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.920]   - That's okay, I will handle the opinion.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:06.520]   - I'm being nourished by the nutrition,
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.800]   the caloric content of good fellowship.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   - That's all that matters, isn't it?
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.640]   (laughing)
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.200]   Like a Tibetan-- - You complete nothing.
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:17.400]   - You live on air and you poop little balls of dust.
[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.320]   - Fire.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.680]   - Fire.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:20.520]   - Fire.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.760]   - You know, I don't know if you've been watching
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.280]   the show Billions on the show test,
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.800]   really good, really good show about hedge fudge manager,
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.640]   hedge fudge.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.000]   - Now you got me the hedge fudge man.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:30.840]   - A Freudian slap.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.440]   - Yeah, a hedge fund manager and the New York State
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:38.480]   federal attorney that's wonderful.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.720]   It's got, it's great, lots of intrigue.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.480]   But this hedge fund manager came from
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.440]   good New Jersey stock and he keeps going back
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.200]   to the pizzeria that he grew up with
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.440]   and they keep showing these pizza pies and I'm going,
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.880]   - I want, I want.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.560]   - Canadians only know American geography
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:56.400]   based on TV shows.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.560]   So I know New Jersey as house,
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.200]   Jersey Shore and Sopranos.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.000]   And that's sort of like the three cities.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.840]   (laughing)
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.560]   - Oh and if you watch "Boardwalk Empire"
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.880]   you know where Andy is, so.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.960]   - Oh, okay, I got a, I got a, I got a--
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.320]   - Jersey's very popular for TV shows actually.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.160]   My son and his gang, all his roommates
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.360]   are watching Jersey Shore for the first time.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.280]   So they're all talking like this.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:21.680]   - Jeff Hamandry, they're doing Mantan.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.720]   It's like, come on guys.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.720]   They're mocking it.
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.160]   They're not, they don't want to be in Jersey.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.920]   - Better the Mantan than they jump off the roof.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.240]   Let's just go for small victories.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   - Whatever happened to Snooki they're saying, I don't know.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.800]   I don't know.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.640]   So let's get to our security portion
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.720]   and I'll start with a big hire.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.040]   This is from Mac Rumors, Jonathan Zadarski
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.720]   who we really look to and look up to
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.240]   as a great Mac security expert.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:52.440]   Apple has hired him.
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.280]   - It's not great.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:56.000]   - He's accepted a position with Apple Security Engineering
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.160]   and Architecture Team.
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.000]   You couldn't hire somebody better than Zadarski.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   That is fantastic.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.200]   - So remarkable about this.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.440]   So that group, it's run by Yvonne Kerstik
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:09.840]   and he's the one who did Bitfrost and Gatekeeper
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.600]   and well his team, System Integrity Protection
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.280]   and Differential Privacy, all that stuff.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.720]   Fantastic team is part of Craig Federikis,
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.320]   Software Engineering Organization.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.280]   I cannot say enough good things about them.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.040]   They're absolutely fantastic.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.040]   But when you've been watching Jonathan on Twitter
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:27.000]   and on his blog lately, he started off making forensic tools
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.880]   and forensic code that's now widely used
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:32.240]   both by law enforcement and by people who are trying to just
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.040]   pull data like Celebrate, pull data off of iPhones.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.720]   And he was sort of getting more and more away from forensics
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.040]   and more and more into privacy.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.880]   And recently he was blogging about things like
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.040]   defending your data when you're crossing borders,
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.080]   protecting yourself from phishing attacks.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.120]   And it seemed like he'd sort of come to a crossroads
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.680]   and didn't know what he wanted to do next.
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:50.400]   And Apple, when you talk to people on the security team
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.360]   at Apple, it's not a small thing.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:53.720]   Like they're super passionate.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.320]   They're like, you'll have to drag our bodies
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.080]   out of the server room to get our customer data,
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.800]   you know, the little that we store of it.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.800]   And that just seems to be a really good fit for him right now.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.200]   And it's sad that he's not on Twitter anymore and sad
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.600]   that he's a little bit weaker.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.040]   His Twitter account's gone, which is very sad.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.280]   But he was doing that before Apple.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.720]   So some people thought that was an Apple thing.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:12.720]   But if you'd watched him on Twitter,
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.720]   he's a couple of weeks ago or a month ago,
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.600]   he was getting really concerned about things
[01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.200]   like government intrusion into social media.
[01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:20.000]   And he started deleting his tweets like 20 minutes.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.160]   Maybe it was more related to that than anything else.
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.680]   You know, if you want to travel out of the country,
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:30.040]   you probably do want to kind of slow down your tweet,
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:31.200]   not your tweet.
[01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:33.360]   And he was getting spam that he was really upset about it.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.080]   So I think that part was a long time coming.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.840]   And this was just a good time to pull that trigger.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:40.080]   It's interesting though, because he was a jailbreak guy
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.320]   originally, right?
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.360]   Yeah, I'll wear almost all the security guys.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.920]   That's a very common story.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.120]   I mean, nobody knows the internal guts of iOS better
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.200]   than jailbreak people, because the way you jailbreak
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.120]   is by finding an exploit.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.480]   Will chronic, he did the chronic dev team
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.040]   and they did the green poison jailbreak.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.640]   And now he's doing tools that help you find malicious frameworks
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:01.360]   in iOS.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   I mean, there's been a huge transformation there.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.520]   When Zadarski was on the chronic dev team,
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.640]   he was known as nerve gas.
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:12.000]   Just like a zero somewhere.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.800]   Amazing.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:17.640]   So good hire in a way a loss to the community at large,
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.240]   because it was always--
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:20.840]   and this is something Apple should keep in mind.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.360]   It was great to have a non-Apple guy talking about these issues,
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.440]   especially during the San Bernardino phone issues.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.560]   You had a guy who was an independent voice who had
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.640]   owed Apple nothing, who was talking.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.880]   And that was really, really valuable to have.
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.520]   And I hope some others step up.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.360]   At chronic is really good for that now, too.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.760]   Over the last few weeks, he's been debunking
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:44.040]   a lot of the hysteria over things like the CIA leaks.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.120]   Yeah, so I think we should talk about that.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.360]   That's vault seven.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.920]   It broke last week at this time.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:59.240]   So not only do we not talk about it on the show last week,
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:02.280]   quite wisely, I think Steve Gibson deferred.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.720]   He said, I am going to have a chance to read through all 8,000
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.240]   pages.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:06.880]   So let's talk about it next week.
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:11.240]   And I think Steve's been staying up late to do that.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.400]   So I imagine-- I don't know, but the next insecurity now next,
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.560]   we'll probably spend some time talking about this.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.640]   But you look at it at first, it's
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.240]   very reminiscent of the Snowden dump.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.640]   There's some big differences.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.920]   Snowden gave it to the press, who slowly leaked it out
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.400]   after vetting it.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.080]   This is just a WikiLeaks massive dump of stuff.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.480]   The headlines were horrible.
[01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.560]   The first day there was a headline
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.320]   of saying they could penetrate signal and imestage--
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:40.960]   And that was wrong.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.880]   That was through a misreading of the WikiLeaks press release,
[01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.040]   which kind of implied that signal--
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:50.320]   Well, yeah, they also-- their tweet actually
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.840]   mentioned compromising signal, compromising WhatsApp.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.800]   And you really did have to read the doc, Mr. Realize that--
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.800]   That's not a response.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.000]   It was compromised if a key logger was installed
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.280]   on an injury device.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:05.480]   But otherwise, no, they have not broken and end encryption.
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.840]   And we've been at great pains--
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.560]   That's on WikiLeaks, I think.
[01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:12.120]   Yeah, we've been at great pains to correct that.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.720]   We never said that, but at great pains to correct that.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.200]   So the people, at least, who have the sense
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.520]   to get their tech information from technologists know
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:24.320]   that this didn't know way compromise signal or WhatsApp.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.600]   In fact, Open Whisper Systems tweeted,
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.240]   they're the creators of the protocol used in both programs.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:32.920]   That in fact, if you look at the Vault 7,
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.840]   it validated that strong crypto does work,
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.400]   and in fact has forced the CIA and others
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:45.120]   to create expensive, targeted attacks,
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:48.480]   like commandeering somebody's phone,
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:51.280]   because they can't intercept the communications
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.960]   and understand them.
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:53.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:58.920]   It's a success of Open Whisper Systems, really.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.160]   And that's sort of what you want.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.480]   You want them to have to go after a person,
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.520]   not just sit there with a huge sieve at the open end
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.160]   of an internet thing collecting all the information
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.520]   they can to set through.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.800]   Most of the hacks, as far as I can tell,
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.600]   and again, I'll defer to Steve when he does the show next,
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.760]   but most of the hacks are, in fact, that kind of hack.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:20.480]   They're hacks targeted attacks on specific persons of interest.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:23.040]   The kinds of things, frankly, you'd expect
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.160]   government spy agencies to develop.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.960]   Nothing really surprising.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.200]   People who own Samsung TVs were perturbed
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.880]   by the weeping angel attack,
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:36.840]   which allowed people to take over
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.240]   Samsung TVs and use them as surreptitious bugging devices.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.240]   What's not clear from this is if it is a remote attack.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.440]   In other words, if you could somehow talk to the Samsung TV
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:53.040]   over the internet and install this,
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.000]   it looked more like you had actually be in the premises
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.360]   and have physical access.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.560]   In which case, it's no different than putting a bug
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:02.320]   in the wall and the phone, isn't it like?
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.920]   It's just one more place to put a bug.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:07.000]   Yeah, it's a very little, it was a physical access.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.160]   And most of these are like that.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.400]   They're targeted attacks where I know we want to find out
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.200]   what the meat tree is up to.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.320]   And so let's use these hacks.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.640]   Now, as an Apple show, Apple says that the hacks
[01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   that they've seen on the iPhone in this material,
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.160]   most of those have been patched.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.000]   These are all three years old, these attacks, right?
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.040]   Yeah, this really was a documentation
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.920]   of their entire bag of tricks.
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.400]   And so they're kind of like drive savers
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.320]   in that they have to have a Bernoulli drive
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.680]   because what if someone comes in with a Bernoulli drive
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.960]   that needs to be data rescued?
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.080]   So they really, if they have a technique
[01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:47.320]   that will work for something,
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.520]   then they've got that documented,
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:49.680]   they've got that tool ready.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.720]   So it doesn't mean that, oh, what were the chances
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.920]   that someone's gonna have a BlackBerry 3
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.920]   that has some data audits.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.640]   And oh, here's how you get into a BlackBerry 3,
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.920]   it's ready, it's on the shelf in case we need it.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.600]   And it's also the fact that so many of this stuff
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.040]   was really well known, well documented.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.700]   So many of these hacks were just
[01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.320]   or even commercial products that they had bought
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.040]   from security firms.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.160]   It really is, again, let's make sure we have
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.560]   every single trick we can get.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:18.560]   And you're right, it really is significant
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.400]   that none of these include something that was
[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.960]   hitherto considered to be impossible
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.040]   such as breaking end-to-end encryption.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.720]   - Right.
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:30.920]   - Kelly?
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:33.920]   - Well, I think one of the things that I think
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.920]   is sort of lost in this is that when you talk to,
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:43.080]   when regular folks talk to their family tech support person
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:45.200]   or the neighbor's nephew that comes over
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.120]   and reboots the router or whatever it is,
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.280]   like when they talk to that person,
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.640]   that person is always lecturing them
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.920]   about making sure that they're up to date
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.280]   with the latest version of macOS or iOS or Android OS
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.240]   or whatever it is.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.240]   And the reason for that is because
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:00.000]   of exactly this kind of thing.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.080]   If you are still using a phone that runs iOS 8,
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.120]   it's going to be a lot easier for somebody to get into it
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.160]   if they decide that they want to
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.000]   and have some way to do so.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   And if you're running iOS 10,
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.640]   all of the ways that people could get into iOS 8
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:19.680]   are eliminated.
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.760]   So you have to do something different
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.600]   if you're using iOS 9 or iOS 10.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.760]   And I think that's one of the things
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.440]   that people aren't necessarily getting the message out
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.000]   about to regular folks, which is when we tell you,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.600]   when we try to beat it into you,
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.400]   this is why you need to update,
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.960]   this is why you need to update.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.360]   This is why, because all of the stuff
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.400]   that they were able to do to those older versions
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.800]   of operating systems, they can't do in the newer ones.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.280]   And that's why we continue to tell you to upgrade.
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.960]   And maybe the new thing
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.880]   isn't looks a little different
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:55.440]   or isn't quite as nice as what you want.
[01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:59.840]   But I also am really glad that Apple's being upfront
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.000]   and come out about this and said,
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.920]   "Yeah, all that stuff, it's all been fixed."
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.320]   And is talking very openly about it
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:10.840]   because one of the things that makes security work
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.040]   is sort of taking all comers,
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.400]   letting anybody who wants to try to pick that lock
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.240]   and anybody who does and anybody who finds an exploit
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.640]   and turns that in makes it so that that lock
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.000]   is now better for everybody.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   And I feel like that's something that is where
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.680]   a lot of security conversations come from
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.440]   and we really need to continue doing that.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.400]   >> They had code names for the various operating systems.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.560]   Windows was called Bartender,
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.960]   the Mac OS was called Jukebox,
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.480]   and Linux is called Dance Floor.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.760]   So we know the CIA likes to party.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.160]   >> They were way worse than code names than NSA.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.600]   >> Oh, the code names, I thought they were better in some ways.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.960]   I mean, weeping angel, Ricky Bobby,
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:53.800]   there were some fun--
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.840]   >> I found them are a little on the chin.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:56.920]   It's like shoulder surfer, I wonder how that works.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:57.760]   >> Yeah. (laughs)
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.840]   >> Mostly though, tell me if I'm wrong,
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.000]   mostly my takeaway from this is
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.200]   it's more embarrassing for the CIA that this leaked out
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:07.840]   than surprising that these things exist.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.960]   And it's no reason to set your hair on fire
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.880]   because many of these are exploits that,
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.280]   as you say, we're in the wild,
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.000]   we're purchased from companies that specialize in this.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.400]   We know there are plenty of third parties like Celebright
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.800]   that spend lots of time doing this.
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.520]   Yeah, everybody's doing it.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.800]   On top of that, these were secret,
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.680]   but they weren't really secret because they're real, real secret.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.960]   They're all kinds of degrees of secrecy.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.400]   These were of a level where they could let contractors have them.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.920]   And right now, the common wisdom is that it wasn't stolen
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.440]   from the CIA, it was a lazy contractor,
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.400]   or maybe even someone within that contractor said,
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.520]   "Hey, this looks like a cool thing to hand over
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.880]   "to my friend Julian who would need something to read
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.880]   "because he's cooped up in that building."
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.240]   It only has, what's your name to visit him?
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.640]   Yeah, it must be tough.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.040]   The part where it's really hard,
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.160]   I was working on an article about how to encrypt backups.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.000]   So I talked to a bunch of info sec people,
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.600]   I talked to a bunch of backup companies.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.440]   Sorry, I couldn't remember.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.560]   And the hard thing is that they gave me different answers.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.920]   Like for example, the info sec people say,
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.960]   encrypt everything, if you have a backup encrypt that.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.720]   The backup people say, don't encrypt your backups
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.040]   because for most people, data theft is not an issue,
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.080]   but data recovery is.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.520]   And once you encrypt, you can no longer pay a data recovery
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.960]   company if you wanna restore your family photos,
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:21.880]   for example.
[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.560]   And then this creates this dynamic for people
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:25.240]   because they understand they need encryption,
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.080]   but oh, if anything ever happens to this drive,
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:28.440]   I'm literally getting a divorce.
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:31.560]   So to me it's getting incredibly confusing
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.960]   and difficult people sort of figure out
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.400]   because we have such an invasion of privacy now,
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.160]   it's getting difficult to do even basic tasks
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.120]   like data backup.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.840]   It's really hard.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.880]   I'm really am thinking about the next time
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.360]   that I have to cross a border
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:48.640]   and pretty sure that if I need to take,
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.320]   if I need to do real work while I'm on the road,
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.480]   I will probably buy one of those cool retro new Nokia phones
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.960]   for 50 or 60 bucks.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:59.200]   I will probably take a Chromebook with me,
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.640]   maybe even buy a brand new one,
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:03.280]   simply on the basis that if they ask for my phone,
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:04.320]   if they ask for my laptop,
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.120]   I can simply hand both of them over
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.760]   because neither of them is going to have anything personal
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.880]   on it and there's nothing that they can really grab from it.
[01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:14.280]   And that really does feel like that's the only way
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:17.240]   that you can not be put on some sort of a watch list,
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.480]   but not feel like you're being racked up
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:22.520]   for and given, forced to give up your rights
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:24.480]   that you're not supposed to be able to have to give up.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.480]   Let me ask this, actually,
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:27.400]   this is a very german question.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.720]   If you're traveling overseas and you're using an iPhone,
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.400]   and of course, we know Customs and Border Patrol
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:36.320]   is legally allowed to look at your stuff,
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:38.880]   they can do all sorts of stuff as you cross the border,
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.680]   but let's say they get your iPhone,
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.360]   they persuade you to unlock it
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.480]   and they disappear with it for half an hour.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.080]   Do we know, can they take everything off that iPhone,
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.640]   read everything once you've unlocked it?
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.680]   Is it all unencrypted?
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.880]   Is it now available to them?
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.680]   - Speaking of Zadarski, you had a great post on this
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.920]   and things you could do, for example,
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:01.280]   you could use the enterprise management tools
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.600]   to remove the key pairing so that you can't just plug it
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.480]   into iTunes and start pulling things off.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:06.600]   I don't know how well that affects
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.360]   like their Celebrate machines or anything,
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:09.320]   but there are things you could do.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:11.080]   But again, this is to me like the backup thing,
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.000]   is it's a moral thing.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.640]   The EFF just updated their border crossing document
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.400]   last weekend and I read through it
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.320]   and you can see that like the helplessness,
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:21.240]   you can read the helplessness in their words
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.120]   because you can do things like getting a second phone,
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.880]   but you cannot lie to customs
[01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:26.760]   and they have incredible powers at a border,
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.720]   powers far beyond any policing agency.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:31.320]   And anything you do, like you can refuse
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.640]   to give them information, but then they can detain you,
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:34.960]   especially if you're a foreign national,
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.240]   they can just detain you.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.360]   Well, for you to make a choice.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.440]   - And just to make a choice, if you're coming
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.160]   into the United States and we've seen it happen many times
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:44.280]   to a number of Canadians, you could be just turned back.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.680]   - Muhammad Ali's son was detained in his US citizen.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.520]   - Yeah. - I mean twice.
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.360]   He was the same old citizen.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.440]   - If you were a citizen, that's the fire
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.280]   about being detained.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.520]   - They can't prevent you from entering
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:53.240]   and they can't force you to lock your phone,
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:56.240]   but they can keep you cool in your heels there for hours.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:58.560]   And that's enough of a penalty for many people,
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.840]   including myself, I'd probably just say,
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.200]   "Well, unlock the damn thing."
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.400]   So the question is, if, okay, so I get there,
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:08.800]   I'm coming back from Cuba in next December.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:11.880]   I guess I shouldn't bring my iPhone
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.320]   because they can say, "Well, please unlock this
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.360]   "and I can unlock it."
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.880]   - That's such a lot of convenience.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.680]   - And they do all my work right.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.320]   - They could get, but it's more than that.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.640]   I've got passwords on here.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.520]   I've got all sorts of stuff on here.
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:25.960]   - You can get into your online accounts,
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.960]   your social media accounts.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:29.640]   - You basically would give them access to everything?
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.480]   - Yep.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.720]   - And it's persistent access too.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.200]   And some people say immediately afterwards,
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.200]   change your passwords, like revoke your tokens,
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.200]   go through and eliminate, and like Alex Lindsey,
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.240]   if you were here, he would say that
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.480]   if someone takes your device,
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:41.760]   you just never take that device back.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.720]   You just leave it and walk on.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.560]   - Yeah.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.200]   You can't assume that there isn't some sort
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.480]   of a piece of malware or spyware on there.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.720]   I mean, my difficulty is that,
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.640]   and it may give a moment, I might have signed documents
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.680]   promising that I'm going to keep certain
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.240]   very valuable secrets.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.880]   And if that secret gets out,
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.440]   there are legal consequences that I have to suffer.
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:06.880]   And so on that basis alone, even beyond principle,
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:11.120]   it's like I cannot let this phone number out of my control.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.960]   I can't let this PDF file out of my control.
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.800]   So yes, Mr. Rames Inspector,
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.360]   that's why I did factory reset my Android device
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.400]   or my iPhone while I was getting off the plane
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:26.720]   because I am not legally entitled to let anybody else see this.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:27.560]   So.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.520]   - So, especially if you guys are reporters,
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:34.200]   there's even more to that because you may have sources
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:37.320]   in there and you have an obligation to protect sources,
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.840]   for instance.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.840]   - The FF covered that too.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.720]   And they said, like all you could be working for a company
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:44.200]   that you have, like you might have the next version of iOS
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.600]   or the next Hollywood movie.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.640]   You might have a final cut of the next Avengers movie
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.200]   on your phone and you're going through
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.040]   and you cannot give it to them.
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.040]   And they said, tell them.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:51.880]   And some of them might say,
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.720]   we understand, keep going,
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:54.600]   other than might say you're now under detention
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:55.960]   and please go into this room.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:19:57.840]   And it varies depending on the custom agent you get,
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.280]   which is I think where the helplessness comes from.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:01.120]   - And I should point out this can also happen
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.760]   to you going into other countries.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.920]   It could happen to you going into Canada, for instance.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:06.760]   - Yeah, I mean, liberal and conservative,
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.480]   this is not an ideological or political thing.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.920]   This is rampant government invasions into privacy
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.760]   and almost every--
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.480]   - Well, governments feel at this point,
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:15.960]   it's sad because it tells me the terrorists have won,
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:17.920]   but most governments feel at this point
[01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.880]   that they really have to protect their borders
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.200]   against incoming terrorists.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:24.000]   And so that's what this is all about.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.800]   - Except that the NBC News investigation,
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:31.240]   'cause I saw a piece about this on the news last night on TV.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.880]   And one of the things that they said
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.640]   was that the reason they were doing this
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.160]   for people coming into the United States
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.160]   was because they had been sort of called on the carpet
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:45.080]   about domestic terrorism.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:48.200]   So this isn't even about Renee coming here from Canada.
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.880]   This is about me coming back from someplace else,
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.920]   which is a very different situation because I'm--
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:54.760]   - Well, that's why I'm worried.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:55.600]   - I'm from the best.
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.440]   - That's why I'm worried with,
[01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:58.080]   I'm going back into the US from Cuba,
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.920]   which I will be doing in December.
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.720]   That is like a red flag, right?
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.720]   And if they look at the stamps on my passport,
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.520]   I've been to Egypt, I've been to China,
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.160]   I've been to Russia, I mean, I'm in deep due due to.
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.000]   So--
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.320]   - You need to leave your phone at home, Leo.
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.600]   - I can't leave my passport at home,
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.600]   but at home, I can't leave my phone.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.880]   - Elementary schools that go to Washington DC every year,
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:15.920]   and this year they're not doing that,
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.880]   they're gonna Toronto instead
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.040]   because they don't wanna have the students
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   have to pop up or which I think is incredibly sad.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:23.040]   - What's so important is that kids get to see other countries
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.240]   so that some of this fear goes down
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.880]   because they have an exposure to the other
[01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:31.280]   instead of being the unknown scary people in turbines.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.120]   - Zenophobia.
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:34.920]   - Yeah, the xenophobia is just enhanced by this
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.720]   because people are afraid to travel.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.720]   - Well, that's part of what makes this so dark.
[01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:44.720]   There are actually, when these new policy was set up
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:48.960]   during the waning days of the Bush administration
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:52.200]   and was continued through both terms of Obama,
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.800]   there are rules, there are guidelines.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.040]   It says that you cannot randomly select somebody,
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.560]   you cannot just basically say,
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:00.440]   we're gonna take all the brown people out of line
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:03.640]   and subject them to a deeper investigation.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:07.720]   You have to have a reason why a certain individual called,
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:11.200]   it called for, let's examine the contents of their phones.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:15.160]   And unfortunately, now we're seeing a tide turning
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:18.520]   where it's being done, what was the statistic I read
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:22.160]   that there were 5,000 people pulled aside
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.320]   for this kind of screening in 2015
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:29.000]   and 5,000 were pulled aside in February of this year.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.800]   And most of them are brown people
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.760]   or people with what might be concerned
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:36.520]   weird last names, not an APCO, not rich enough.
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.480]   - I though, an APCO says a little Russian.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.280]   - Well, no, again, we're cool, we're good.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.760]   That's an APCO. - Oh, the Russians are good again,
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.160]   I'm sorry. - I could bring 10 pounds
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.560]   of Coke through the border if I go to the fire.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:47.640]   - I'm with Russia.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:50.520]   - I'm with Putin, let me in.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.840]   - All I'm saying is that there's,
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:56.480]   I have a really, really good friend whose last name
[01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.080]   is I won't say it 'cause of their privacy,
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.760]   but it's an Italian last name,
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   but it spelled like a Middle Eastern name
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:10.320]   and this person has to travel internationally a lot
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.320]   because of their job and I'm really concerned
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:16.040]   about what will happen to them the next time they travel.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.320]   - Yeah, that's very...
[01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:24.320]   - I would be upset enough if they were just basically
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:27.040]   saying that anybody who looks a little bit shabby
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.680]   or anybody who looks one way or another,
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:32.160]   they're pulling aside, it's even worse the idea
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.760]   that no, we are just basically saying anybody
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.480]   who looks brown is...
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.320]   - It's what Melissa McCarthy said, you're blonde,
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:41.880]   you're okay, blonde, wait, stop, clear you.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:42.720]   - Yeah. - To find a reason
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.160]   in your Facebook post and I'll leave you in.
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:47.600]   - So, okay, so Andy, you think your advice would be
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:51.520]   maybe take the iPhone, cross the border out of the country,
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.220]   then on the plane coming home, wipe it.
[01:23:54.220 --> 01:23:59.200]   I would, if I'm worried that that's a red flag,
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.080]   but I guess...
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.960]   - Well, there's nothing they can do about it.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.640]   And again, as a citizen, they can detain me
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.360]   for about three hours, I think.
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:10.120]   I know that they can take my computer,
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.960]   they can take my phone, but they have to return it
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.040]   within five days.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.720]   It's essentially being polite, saying,
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.360]   "Sir and Madam, complying," and simply saying,
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:23.320]   "It's one thing to say while I refuse to give you
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:25.680]   the passcode that leads to a lot of trouble,
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.800]   you certainly have your right to say,
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.360]   "I'm not gonna give you my passcode
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.760]   and see how well that works out."
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.640]   But you can say, "Yes, the answer to the question,
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.520]   why did you erase your phone, sir?"
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.800]   Is because I chose to do so.
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.640]   And you don't have to really point it further than that.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.480]   They will take it behind.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:43.000]   They will handle it, you will hand it over happily.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.880]   They can look into, welcome to iPhone screen,
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.640]   they can connect it to their slippers all they want.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.000]   They will see there's nothing on it.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.080]   At some point, maybe they'll flag you for let's make sure
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:57.520]   we take a look at this person again next time,
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.560]   but there's really nothing they can do at that point.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.200]   My concern is that I've heard a lot of stories
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:06.960]   of really disappointing unprofessionalism
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.960]   of not simply saying, again,
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:10.760]   call the person, sir and Madam,
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:13.160]   and saying, "Well, we just require your phone
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.400]   and you have the right to not do that,
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:18.440]   but of course we can detain the phone for a certain number
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.200]   of time, we will return it to you at our expense."
[01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:22.880]   But there are people who are saying,
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.080]   "Are you looking to be funny?
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.400]   Why are you carrying all this stuff?"
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.000]   A children's book author saying,
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.320]   "Well, I'm just, I write books."
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.600]   And then that person snapping back at them,
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.720]   "You think I have time to read books?"
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:35.280]   Like, oh, that is.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.960]   Somebody in the chat room, Jay says,
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.560]   "Always pretend to respect the bureaucrat.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.880]   They have the power to make your life hell."
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:46.840]   And you should not absolutely not lie to law enforcement ever.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.880]   That's gonna be a crime at that point.
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.840]   Especially at a border, if you lie to a border as an agent,
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.960]   now they have a reason to hold on to you for much longer than that.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.280]   - Right, right.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.360]   - But like I said, the EFF has an excellent guide,
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.960]   digital privacy at the US border,
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:05.120]   protecting the data on your devices,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:07.160]   and in the cloud, Adam Schwartz.
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.200]   Thank you, Renee, for that link.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.200]   If people wanna read that before they travel,
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.760]   it's probably a good idea.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.080]   I'm still-- - No easy answers.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.160]   - I'm not going out of the country until June,
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.920]   but I am conflicted.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:21.000]   I mean, I really depend on my smartphone
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.600]   and my computer and my tablet as I travel.
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.800]   And I'm very conflicted.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.200]   - How much could you get away with if you were to like,
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.640]   like a caveman, if you were to plug your phone
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:36.560]   into your laptop, make the encrypted backup,
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.760]   and then nuke your phone?
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.360]   And then you can-- - Yeah, that's what I would do.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.600]   That's what Andy's proposed to. - While you're gone
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.560]   or whatever, and come back and have like your regular phone.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:46.360]   When you get back that way, there's no--
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.000]   - Or nuke it on the way back.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.920]   - Or you can just, or the on your way to the airport,
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.840]   you stop by Federal Express,
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.320]   package up your laptop and your phone,
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.160]   and just-- - Okay, they're like--
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.400]   - So that's an interesting idea.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.280]   - Yeah, they inspect customer's packages though too.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.600]   I mean, like-- - Yeah.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.080]   - And also when you ship it internationally,
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.840]   it's manufactured in China, which means that they will
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.440]   charge charging you duty, which is way more expensive
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.480]   than just shipping when you're in cross US.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.320]   - We just can't wait.
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.160]   - So we've looked into all this stuff
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.640]   because we ship a lot of mobile nations
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.920]   as offices in both Canada and the US,
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:14.920]   and every time we ship they're like,
[01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.480]   ooh, manufactured in China,
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.280]   that's full duty on this, please sir.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.400]   Well, and I wonder how much you would have to do
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:27.480]   on a basic level, like your iPhone is tied to your iCloud account,
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.760]   your Apple ID, and your Android phone
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.040]   is tied to your Gmail address.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.880]   So if you just signed out of those things
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:36.600]   and restarted your phone, is that enough to do the job?
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.240]   Or like, if you sign out and then you reset all your settings,
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:41.560]   is that enough to do the job?
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:43.960]   Like maybe you delete a few apps, you know?
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:47.360]   Well, how much is obstruction and how much is security?
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:50.920]   Because like, I'm not, I mean, I'll just go on record
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.520]   and say it, I'm not a security risk.
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.920]   I don't know a bunch of secret stuff,
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.520]   and I'm certainly not ferrying it to other countries.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:59.800]   So like my mom is on a trip right now,
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:02.520]   and it's international, they're going to a bunch of countries,
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.760]   and then they're gonna come back.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.480]   And when they come back, are they gonna go rifle through her phone
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:11.200]   to see like, what do they think that they're going to find?
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.200]   And this is really my question for all of this is,
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.880]   what is it that they're, what is it that they think
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:19.080]   they're going to find if they go through my phone,
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:22.280]   or Andy's Chromebook, or whatever it is
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.520]   that they're rifling through.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:25.400]   Like, I wanna know what it is that they think
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.320]   they're getting out of this, because some of the other stuff,
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:28.440]   it's very obvious.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.520]   I know why you make me take my shoes off at the airport.
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:33.040]   It's dumb, but I know why.
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:37.360]   And I wanna know what it is that's happening with phones
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:39.960]   or with Chromebooks or laptops or whatever,
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:43.200]   that they think they're getting something out of this.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.640]   Like, I wanna know what the reward is,
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.880]   what it is that they think they're gonna get by doing so.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.320]   >> I think the purpose of all this isn't so much
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:54.360]   to sift through your laptop and look for documents
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.400]   or look for like incriminating text messages on your phone.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.280]   It is something as simple as, I want your address book.
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:01.920]   I wanna know who you know,
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:06.440]   because the connections between one person or another,
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:09.480]   it's a trivially simple piece of information,
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:12.560]   but once you put down here are 10,000 people
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.440]   and their connections to one another,
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.520]   you start to get a really clear map
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:19.200]   of where relationships are flowing
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.400]   with the velocity of this stuff is.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:24.240]   So if you're trying to understand,
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:26.720]   how a certain community is operating
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:28.960]   and where they are and who they're communicating with,
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.280]   that's a lot of data you can grind.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:33.520]   So even if all they're doing is just getting your contacts,
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:34.760]   even if all they're doing is finding out
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:37.360]   who you follow on Twitter, who follows you,
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.080]   that's pretty good stuff.
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.360]   It's not great stuff when you just take a look at my phone,
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.200]   but if you take a look at my phone
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.400]   and 10,000 other people,
[01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.000]   it's the reason why they operate stingrays at protests
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.240]   and other public places.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:54.880]   It's the fact that they have a piece of information that,
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:58.120]   okay, Andy was at the same place,
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:00.800]   this demonstration that had 200 people,
[01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:05.040]   Andy, Subject B and Subject C were all in the same place.
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.800]   And then two minutes later,
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:09.880]   at a shopping mall, Andy and Subject C
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:12.240]   were in the same place together.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.520]   And now Subject C happens to Dr. Darrin with Subject E,
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.760]   now E gets tied to me somehow,
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:19.960]   if they're trying to figure out,
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.680]   is this a group of people that are doing bad things?
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:27.680]   So it's the idea of them doing this as a matter of course
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:33.480]   and not because somebody was trailing a wad of toilet paper
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.160]   from their shoe when they came out of the bathroom
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.760]   that smelled of kerosene,
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.720]   that perhaps we should take a closer look at this person
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:43.000]   and maybe find out who he was desperately trying to,
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:46.360]   trying to sell a watch to just before he was trying
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:47.800]   to bought an airplane.
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:50.200]   It's like, no, if you're coming through our border,
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.520]   we have the right to have this information
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.840]   because we think that at some point in the future
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:57.640]   that will give us some information by correlation
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.200]   that we will find valuable.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.080]   That's just not appropriate.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.280]   - And of course, it's not only the federal government
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.760]   and the CIA, we have to worry about bad guys too,
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.120]   have tools, this is a new Mac Trojan.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.680]   With code signed signatures,
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:14.680]   just to make you feel better called Proton,
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:16.720]   50 grand, that's all it takes,
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.600]   the only complete Mac OS solution
[01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:21.080]   for remote control and surveillance.
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:25.560]   It's a remote access Trojan, a rat aimed at Mac OS.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.880]   This is from a security firm called Six-Gill.
[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.760]   It's written in Objective-C, doesn't need any libraries.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:36.680]   It's marketed by the creator as a quote professional FUD
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:38.960]   surveillance and control solution
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.280]   with which you can do almost everything
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.200]   with a target's Mac.
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:46.400]   Has root access, key logging, uploading
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.960]   and downloading a file screenshots, webcam access,
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.520]   SSH and VNC connectivity.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.000]   Wow, this sounds like it might've been written
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.840]   by a government, it's really good.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.680]   It also claimed the malware could present victims
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:31:58.320]   with a custom window, which could be used
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:01.880]   to request extra information like credit card numbers.
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:06.520]   It's the newest and the onlyest Mac rat in the market.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.400]   It's a mere $50,000 get yours today.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:14.120]   What's scary is that it has Apple's, it's signed.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.600]   So. - Yeah, and they can develop ID
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.400]   for something else and then use it to sign it.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:20.240]   - Right, that's what the Turkish ID was used to.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:21.080]   - Yeah.
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:25.720]   - The price is cut, it used to be 100 Bitcoins
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.080]   for unlimited installations,
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.960]   but now they've reduced it to 40 Bitcoins.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:31.240]   Two Bitcoins for just months.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.760]   - Not related to this, but Apple started cracking down
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.720]   on apps that load code after they've gone through
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:36.560]   the review process.
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:39.560]   - Yeah, and I saw Michael Sigh complaining about that, right?
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.680]   But I think that's a good thing.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.600]   - And they had that problem early on
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.240]   where there was apps that would go through review
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:46.480]   and then suddenly turn into porn apps
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.840]   because they changed the source of their RSS feed
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.160]   and Apple sort of blocking those,
[01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.040]   but now it's far more,
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:55.280]   it's a far more, it's far closer examination.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:59.080]   - The hot code push SDKs will be blocked
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:01.040]   and it's not, you know, the porn apps one thing.
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.600]   The other thing is of course it turns a benign app
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.000]   into a hacking tool, that's another.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:05.840]   - Yeah.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.920]   - So I think that's reasonable.
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:10.000]   I guess, however--
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:10.840]   - If you're a game company,
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.040]   it was probably still safe for you to use scripting engines,
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.360]   but if you're not a gaming company,
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.200]   you have to be--
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:17.600]   - Michael Sigh, the creator of SpamAssassin
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:21.000]   has a long blog post about,
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.840]   and quotes from a variety of developers
[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:28.840]   on what this means and how you can be compliant.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.480]   So you can push executable code to your app.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.960]   If the code is run by Apple's built-in WebKit framework
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.280]   or JavaScript core and it does not provide, unlock,
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:41.600]   or enable additional features or functionality.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.600]   So maybe for patches, you still have that capability.
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:49.600]   Anyway, yeah, yeah, but I think that's reasonable.
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.600]   I don't think that's unreasonable,
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.680]   but it does it, are developers upset
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:56.280]   because it limits what they can do to fix their code?
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.920]   - Sometimes, I mean, like there's always
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.240]   a legitimate use for everything a legitimate use for,
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:01.600]   and sometimes legitimate uses get hurt
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.520]   by carving down on the, on the low-digit use.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.360]   - Yeah.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:07.040]   Pandora's getting the music business.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.360]   Watch out, Apple Music.
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.760]   Here comes Pandora Music.
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:13.600]   $10, it'll be a streaming solution,
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.520]   much like Apple Music or Spotify.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:18.800]   You remember that Pandora bought the really nice,
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:22.960]   I thought, RDO, which had a really great Mac client.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:26.360]   How does Pandora plan to differentiate from Apple Music
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.920]   or Spotify or Google Music or Amazon Music?
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.240]   It's gonna be easy to use,
[01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:33.240]   and if you're a Pandora Premium customer,
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:36.360]   you're gonna get six months free out of the box.
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:40.320]   The idea that Pandora has kind of decided
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:44.280]   to focus on Tim Westergren says,
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.960]   today, you know, music streaming apps
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:49.520]   are 30 million songs in a search box.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.040]   He says, I think it can be appealing
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:52.600]   to a small segment of the population,
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.240]   but for most people, that's just overwhelming.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:56.360]   It's hard work, so he wanted to make an app
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:59.640]   that'll be easier just to get some music and play it.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.400]   So we'll see, the Verge did have,
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:07.320]   it looks like a beta copy, it's not available yet,
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.520]   but they made simplicity very much the key focus.
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.680]   It looks a lot like RDO.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.200]   You got your daily mix, your playlists,
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:17.880]   your stations, your songs.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.560]   Away, man, is this Spotify?
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:22.800]   I'm looking at it.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.080]   - I think that's Apple Music, isn't it?
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:26.000]   - Or is this, no, this is Apple Music on the right,
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.200]   Spotify on the left.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.960]   Oh, I guess the middle, I'm sorry,
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:32.200]   the middle is Pandora.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.680]   So it is kind of nice, looks kind of nice and clean.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:40.840]   Same song catalog as Apple Music and Spotify.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.760]   Pandora says, we're gonna curate a little bit though
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:46.640]   to get rid of karaoke,
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:49.800]   and this is one that bugs me tribute bands
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.880]   and duplicate tracks that,
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.520]   oh, I always get like a Beatles tribute band.
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:54.360]   I never get the Beatles.
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.920]   - I have friends who buy stuff on iTunes
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.080]   and get a cover version of the song,
[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:58.600]   and they don't know it, they're like happily
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.920]   boogying down and like, that's not the original artist.
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:03.120]   - That really is embarrassing, yeah.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.320]   - Oh, that's not how it goes.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.520]   - I just wish they were more international.
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:09.080]   I mean, I've been going to Pandora's website every month
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:10.600]   for three, four years, and it still says,
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.280]   hey, sorry, not for you, Luke's America, thanks.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:17.440]   - And then the algorithm will work kind of like Pandora does
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.400]   because it's based on the music genome project.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:22.280]   If you listen to or thumbs up a couple of songs,
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:25.560]   it'll be smart about picking new songs for you.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.280]   Pandora does a decent job of that,
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:29.360]   although every time I listen to a Pandora station
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:32.060]   for any length of time, it starts to drift.
[01:36:32.060 --> 01:36:35.760]   Maybe that's my fault, I don't know.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:38.600]   This is the interface, yeah, like it's clean, simple.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.240]   Anyway, I don't know if anybody is even in the market,
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.200]   by now, hasn't everybody chosen their music system?
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.280]   Aren't they all locked in with the playlists and everything?
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.360]   Maybe not. - I'm not doing
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:52.960]   anything different either to make it seem attractive.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.480]   - Yeah, you know.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:00.720]   Is there anything about importing data from someplace else?
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:02.440]   'Cause I know that was one thing when beats
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.040]   sort of turned into Apple music,
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:08.160]   that was one thing that they did was made it
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:11.000]   so that you could convert all that stuff to Apple music.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.260]   - Let's see, that's a good question.
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:18.020]   I don't see anything about that.
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:22.720]   I do see that they're gonna not focus on exclusives.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:25.000]   That's been the thing that's driving Apple
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.040]   and some of the Apple competitors like Tidal.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:30.760]   They're not gonna play that game.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.680]   So they're really focusing on, hey,
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.000]   you launch it and you get music.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.520]   And that makes sense 'cause that's really
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:38.080]   what the Pandora install base wants.
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.800]   I mean, I look at how people use Pandora.
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.560]   They launch a station and that's it.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.120]   They don't mess around with it.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.640]   Existing users of Pandora's free service
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:49.240]   will be able to test out Pandora Premium free
[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:52.840]   for two months, invites begin to roll out March 15th.
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:53.900]   That's tomorrow.
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:58.460]   Pandora plus users will get six months for free.
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:01.980]   And if you're not a Pandora user now,
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:03.900]   you can access the two month free trial.
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:08.420]   So, I welcome competition.
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:10.620]   I think this is a crowded field now
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:13.460]   and I worry that these companies are really struggling.
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:16.780]   There's so much in the, I look at SoundCloud.
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:18.420]   The latest from SoundCloud is that
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:19.740]   they may not survive the year.
[01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:20.860]   They're really struggling.
[01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:22.820]   - It's like value added from Apple, Google and Amazon
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:23.740]   who can afford to do it.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:24.580]   - Exactly.
[01:38:24.580 --> 01:38:25.420]   - But it's part of the individual business.
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:26.260]   - Exactly.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:27.140]   - Right.
[01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:29.700]   - FBI says we're not gonna release the iPhone hacking tool.
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.780]   We might still, we might wanna use it.
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:34.340]   - 13 year old, works out of his garage.
[01:38:34.340 --> 01:38:35.980]   He's Aces, but we wanna give you the name.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:36.820]   - Hey, my wife.
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:37.660]   - Yeah, right.
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:38.580]   - She's busy, she's busy.
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:39.420]   Leave her alone.
[01:38:39.420 --> 01:38:40.660]   - Joey's busy.
[01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:42.060]   Sorry.
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:44.380]   We're not gonna tell you where or who.
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:45.620]   - Dad, I'll jailbreak that for you.
[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:47.620]   - It wasn't a five, it was a five C.
[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:51.540]   So, it may still not, you know, be very dangerous.
[01:38:51.540 --> 01:38:53.580]   - You know, Hot's got a lot on his plate.
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:54.420]   - Yeah.
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:58.020]   - Carpool karaoke is gonna launch
[01:38:58.020 --> 01:39:01.980]   with Sophie Turner, don't know who that is.
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.540]   Huh?
[01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:07.220]   That's Sanser Stark.
[01:39:07.220 --> 01:39:08.300]   - That sounds stark.
[01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:10.340]   - And Maisie Williams, who I know who Maisie is.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:11.180]   That's Arya, right?
[01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:12.020]   - Yeah, Arya.
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:12.860]   - It's Star Trek.
[01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:14.780]   - So it's the sisters.
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:16.380]   - Isn't that, is she dark Phoenix as well?
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:17.820]   - Yes.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:18.660]   - She's who?
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:19.500]   - From the X-Men movie.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.340]   - Maybe.
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:21.180]   - Phoenix.
[01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:22.020]   - Yeah.
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:22.860]   - They're calling it Stark pool.
[01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:23.700]   - It's so amazing.
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:24.540]   - All Maisie and Sophie.
[01:39:24.540 --> 01:39:26.020]   - And we're at South Park South West.
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:29.140]   - And we're about to do Carpool karaoke for Apple Music.
[01:39:29.140 --> 01:39:30.340]   - Hey, Sophie and Maisie.
[01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:31.340]   - All Maisie and Sophie.
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.260]   - Sophie and Maisie.
[01:39:32.260 --> 01:39:34.620]   - Yeah, you speak in the X-Men, Leo.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.580]   - I wouldn't know that.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:36.460]   - Jean Grey.
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:37.300]   - Okay.
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:40.260]   - She's also on Doctor Who.
[01:39:40.260 --> 01:39:43.180]   - There will be 16 half hour episodes.
[01:39:43.180 --> 01:39:47.300]   So these are the latest, they'll also include James Corden,
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.660]   who created Carpool karaoke Will Smith,
[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:51.900]   Billy Eichner Metallica.
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.540]   - No, I wanna get in a van with Metallica.
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:55.180]   - Yeah, dude.
[01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:57.540]   - Alicia Keys, John Legend, Ariana Grande,
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.220]   Seth MacFarlane, that'll be fun.
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:00.340]   Chelsea Handler.
[01:40:00.340 --> 01:40:02.620]   - I can't even imagine Seth MacFarlane.
[01:40:02.620 --> 01:40:04.580]   - Oh, that'd be awesome.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:06.340]   He likes the big band tunes though,
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:07.180]   I'm worried about that.
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:08.700]   - He likes all kinds of stuff though,
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:11.060]   that's why you don't know where that's gonna end up.
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:13.380]   - He's the creator family, of course.
[01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:14.500]   And does many of the voices
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:17.180]   and is actually quite a talented singer in before, I think.
[01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:18.700]   - And it's a very talented singer.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:19.540]   - Yeah.
[01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:20.540]   - Like Shelton. - Can I come up with the
[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:22.860]   Michael Strahan, John Saina,
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:24.060]   and Shaquille O'Neal,
[01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:27.380]   I think they'll have to get a specially made van for that one.
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:28.900]   - Betshe Tarnaria Boschian.
[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:31.860]   (laughing)
[01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:33.580]   - I think Kelly's Giggle.
[01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:35.300]   You guys are getting her, that's great.
[01:40:35.300 --> 01:40:38.060]   (laughing)
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:43.060]   (humming)
[01:40:43.060 --> 01:40:44.620]   Oh, this is funny.
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:47.300]   Apparently, we were talking about the Nintendo Switch.
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:51.540]   Somehow, it's hackable using Apple's WebKit browser engine,
[01:40:51.540 --> 01:40:54.700]   not even the most modern one, an old version.
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:56.700]   Is it using WebKit?
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:40:58.380]   - I mean, thank God we can't get our user data off,
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.540]   but people can get in using an old version of WebKit.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.340]   (laughing)
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:05.180]   CRM once again, best friend of the casual user.
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:06.180]   - Nothing to worry about,
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:08.020]   somebody didn't have that physical access to your,
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:08.860]   Nintendo Switch.
[01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:09.700]   - I mean, you might need it
[01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:10.980]   because you can't recover your data.
[01:41:10.980 --> 01:41:11.820]   - Right.
[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:17.820]   I accidentally erased Anthony Nielsen's wife's Zelda save.
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:20.260]   I hope she's not mad at me for that.
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:21.660]   - I'm gonna get you to the Hyrule Sword.
[01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:22.500]   - Oh no.
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:23.940]   (grunting)
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.740]   - I haven't gotten very far, I'm just kind of wondering,
[01:41:25.740 --> 01:41:28.140]   I got to that old church, I got a few shards,
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:30.220]   some old screws.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:32.620]   I'm sure something exciting is gonna happen.
[01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.740]   (knocking)
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:35.940]   Ladies and gentlemen, let's take a break,
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:37.780]   when we come back, you, my friends,
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:39.860]   you can do your picks of the week.
[01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.380]   How about that?
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:43.020]   Hey, joining us from Mac Observer,
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.580]   Kelly Glimont, she's also at Smile software
[01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.340]   where she's in charge of social media.
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:50.740]   Do you tweet for Smile?
[01:41:50.740 --> 01:41:51.580]   - I do.
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:53.900]   - That's a great, that should just be your on your card.
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:41:55.740]   Tweets for smiles.
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:57.220]   (laughing)
[01:41:57.220 --> 01:42:00.020]   Also Andy Inako, he's joining us from Atlantic City,
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:02.500]   where he's speaking to the Summer Camp Association,
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:05.740]   blogs@inocco.com, tweets@inocco.
[01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.340]   Flickers at Andy Eye,
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:11.180]   writes for this thing called the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:42:11.180 --> 01:42:14.980]   And Renee Richie. - That will be barely be.
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:18.340]   - Renee Richie's also here from imore.com.
[01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:19.860]   Our show today brought to you by Zipper Cruder.
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:21.820]   If you're in business,
[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:24.660]   and you're responsible for hiring,
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:26.620]   you know the worst, that's like kind of the worst,
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:28.620]   like you, can you get filled this position?
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.780]   Oh, especially if you're a sole proprietor,
[01:42:30.780 --> 01:42:33.500]   because it's while you're down a person,
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.980]   now you gotta go find somebody to replace them.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:39.740]   But I wanna encourage you to do the right thing,
[01:42:39.740 --> 01:42:42.740]   because that person you're hiring can transform your company,
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:45.820]   could bring it down, but it can also lift it to the moon.
[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:47.500]   A company is made of people,
[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:49.300]   just like Soylent Green,
[01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:52.020]   and the right people make all the difference.
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:54.660]   Here's a tool that'll make it so much easier,
[01:42:54.660 --> 01:42:56.180]   so much faster,
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:59.900]   and I think this is the most important thing,
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:03.900]   will help you find the best candidate possible.
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:05.780]   'Cause you don't know where that perfect person is,
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:07.580]   or what job boards they're lurking on,
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.140]   or what social media they read.
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:11.500]   So wouldn't it be cool if you could post once,
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:13.220]   and you can, to zippercruder.com,
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:17.260]   and then that post goes to over 200 job boards,
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:21.740]   automatically plus Twitter and Facebook and everywhere,
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:24.940]   automatically with one click of the mouse,
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:28.060]   and then, so you're reaching the most people, right?
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:30.140]   And then, all of those applicants
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.060]   pour it not into your phone and your inbox,
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:33.980]   but to the zippercruder interface,
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:36.220]   they beautifully format the resume,
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:38.020]   so they're consistent and easy for you to read.
[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:40.500]   You can actually have screening questions,
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.620]   multiple choice, essay, yes, no questions.
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:45.980]   You can rank, you know, screen out the ones,
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:47.820]   they're just, you know, nope, nope, nope, nope,
[01:43:47.820 --> 01:43:51.300]   rank the rest and hire the right person almost instantly.

[01:44:17.500 --> 01:44:21.300]   Kelly Guimot, a pick of the week for all of ya.
[01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:22.780]   - Yeah.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:25.700]   - All right, so this is my pick.
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:26.540]   - This is my pick.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.660]   - I know it's not very exciting, but it's very cool.
[01:44:28.660 --> 01:44:29.580]   - It's mine. - There are many like it,
[01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:30.740]   but this is mine. - This is mine,
[01:44:30.740 --> 01:44:31.660]   so I'm yup.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:32.500]   What is that?
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:33.340]   It's an Aussie.
[01:44:33.340 --> 01:44:38.940]   - It's an Aussie, it's a wall charger, so it folds up.
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.860]   - Oh. - So if you light,
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:43.900]   and it's the size of a regular iPhone,
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.460]   little tiny white brick.
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:50.820]   But the prongs fold down, number one, awesome thing.
[01:44:50.820 --> 01:44:54.260]   And number two, awesome thing is that it's got two USB ports
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:56.100]   and they're high power.
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:59.180]   So you get 2.4 amps per port.
[01:44:59.180 --> 01:45:03.900]   So instead of having to carry around the giant iPad charger,
[01:45:03.900 --> 01:45:05.740]   you can carry this one instead.
[01:45:05.740 --> 01:45:08.500]   And it's super lightweight,
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:12.180]   it fits in like all my regular travel gear stuff.
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:14.620]   It's really awesome, it comes in black or white,
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:16.340]   depending what you want.
[01:45:16.340 --> 01:45:19.100]   If you watch, they will occasionally drop in price.
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.580]   It's usually about $10,
[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:24.220]   and sometimes you can get them for about seven or maybe eight.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:28.580]   They're commonly available, it's super durable.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:30.060]   (laughs)
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:31.260]   Ask me how I know.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:33.100]   I've dropped it a bunch of times
[01:45:33.100 --> 01:45:34.780]   and it has held up like a champ.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:38.420]   And it's not one of those where it matters
[01:45:38.420 --> 01:45:40.460]   where you plug it in.
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:44.140]   So it doesn't have the one iPad port
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:45.460]   and the one iPhone port.
[01:45:45.460 --> 01:45:49.580]   So if you ever need to just sort of replicate ports,
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:52.300]   like you can just put two USB cables straight in here
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:53.820]   and have this one unit,
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:55.300]   and it'll charge your iPad,
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:57.780]   whichever one you have, it'll charge your phone,
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:45:59.100]   whichever one you have,
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:01.700]   and or your battery pack,
[01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.020]   if you're a person who charges the phone
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.940]   on a battery every night when you're on a trip, like I do.
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:08.460]   So this, I really like this one for that reason.
[01:46:08.460 --> 01:46:12.260]   It's super durable and inexpensive
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:16.940]   and makes it a lot easier to keep all your stuff powered up
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:17.940]   as necessary.
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:19.500]   - You know what I like it?
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:21.300]   It's small enough that you could put two
[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:23.500]   in a standard plug socket.
[01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.700]   So you could actually have four USB ports
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:28.260]   from one wall socket.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:31.340]   - Yeah, the other bonus to it is that it doesn't,
[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:33.620]   it doesn't block the other port when you plug it in.
[01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:36.020]   And sometimes if you take like your iPad charger with you,
[01:46:36.020 --> 01:46:38.220]   it can get fiddly in that way.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:39.340]   And this one doesn't do that.
[01:46:39.340 --> 01:46:40.820]   - That's nice.
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:41.660]   That's good.
[01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:42.500]   I'm gonna order two.
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:44.100]   Good.
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:46.620]   These, these pics are always expensive.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:47.740]   - That's funny.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:49.860]   - Well, they're only 10 bucks on Amazon.
[01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.420]   That's not bad.
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:52.260]   Right, if I have.
[01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.100]   - And.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:53.940]   - And you gotta buy the device.
[01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:54.780]   - Super reliable.
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:56.940]   Like I said, like I've never had a problem with it.
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:58.580]   I really like it and.
[01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.300]   - Yeah, I've used hockey stuff for years.
[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:01.140]   They're good.
[01:47:01.140 --> 01:47:01.980]   - Yeah.
[01:47:01.980 --> 01:47:02.820]   - Yeah.
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:03.660]   - The battery packs are great too.
[01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:05.700]   - Yeah, they have like a 20,000 million
[01:47:05.700 --> 01:47:06.980]   about a backpack or something.
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:08.940]   It's just like massive.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:09.980]   - It's backpackable.
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:11.460]   - Pack-packable.
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:12.860]   Andy, your pick of the week.
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:17.500]   My pick of the week is kind of a gift I bought for myself.
[01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:20.420]   I tested so many really super great phone cameras
[01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:22.660]   last year, including the iPhone 7 Plus
[01:47:22.660 --> 01:47:24.580]   that it kind of reminded me.
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:27.220]   It kind of made me understand that
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:30.340]   I really wanted to have a really good camera,
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:31.700]   like a pocket camera,
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:33.140]   that I could always have on me
[01:47:33.140 --> 01:47:34.540]   and always take really great pictures.
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:36.100]   So I was taking great pictures with pretty much
[01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:39.620]   every good camera that came out last year.
[01:47:39.620 --> 01:47:42.660]   But there's still limitations to having a phone camera.
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:44.980]   So I bought after a lot of investigation,
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:47.780]   the Panasonic LX10,
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:51.780]   which is about the size of a deck of cards.
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.500]   It doesn't have,
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.340]   the footprint is much smaller
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:57.780]   than even like a compact phone here.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:47:59.380]   So that's pretty good.
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:00.860]   It's, of course, it's a lot thicker,
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:03.300]   but it has a really big, like for compact camera,
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:05.540]   Sony, one inch sensor that you find
[01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:07.700]   in all kinds of really good pocket cameras.
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:10.580]   And it has such a great combination of features,
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:11.660]   built really great.
[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:14.060]   It's all made out of metal,
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:16.660]   has a flip, doesn't have a fully articulating screen,
[01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:19.980]   but it flips up so that you can change your angle
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.460]   when you're shooting
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:24.780]   and you can also do the selfie thing if you want.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:27.060]   It shoots a 4K video,
[01:48:27.060 --> 01:48:29.500]   but this is the thing that really, really got me.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:32.180]   They're doing, not only does it shoot really good 4K video,
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:36.180]   but it has this really, really cool photo modes
[01:48:36.180 --> 01:48:38.300]   that take advantage of the 4K.
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:41.580]   So for instance, you can use it as,
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:44.140]   in 4K photo modes,
[01:48:44.140 --> 01:48:45.940]   you can have it do things like,
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:47.980]   I will just treat this like it can,
[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:50.020]   it's shooting 30 frames per second,
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:52.060]   it eight megapixels forever.
[01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:54.420]   So essentially you'll get the same sort of features,
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:57.380]   you get the high speed shutter of the iPhone.
[01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:58.500]   Or you can say,
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:00.940]   I want you to always be recording the,
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:03.420]   save the last two seconds of 4K video,
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:08.020]   because I'm waiting for my kid to do her gymnastics routine.
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:10.740]   And so when I see her actually like leap off the board,
[01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:12.380]   that's when I'll press the shutter button,
[01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:15.500]   then it'll actually save the previous two seconds
[01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:18.980]   of 4K eight megapixels, still pictures,
[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:20.100]   and then keep taking more.
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:22.700]   So you'll always, you'll never miss the moment.
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:24.020]   The really cool thing is,
[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:26.140]   remember that the, that LITRA camera,
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:27.620]   LITRA camera, the light field camera,
[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:28.620]   where you can just take the picture
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:31.020]   and then keep changing the focus whenever you want,
[01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:33.660]   because it has this magical new type of sensor.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:35.900]   Well, they, again, with a 4K feature,
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:38.260]   they did something super, super clever.
[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:41.140]   It's a synthetic depth of field,
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:42.980]   where if you press the button,
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:45.580]   and it will simply shoot 4K video
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:48.740]   that racks the focus from nearest to forest,
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:50.620]   and then after you take the picture,
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:52.420]   it asks you, well, how much,
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:53.940]   what do you want to have in focus,
[01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:55.740]   or do you want to have everything in focus?
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:57.420]   And then when you, when you say, yeah,
[01:49:57.420 --> 01:49:58.620]   please put everything in focus,
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:02.180]   it will do focus stacking of all of those frames,
[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:05.140]   and basically create a synthetic image
[01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:07.980]   where everything is in lockdown focus.
[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:11.340]   Or you can say, I want just the person in the foreground,
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:12.900]   all the way back to the fence,
[01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:14.620]   but not beyond the fence to be in focus,
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:16.860]   and we'll just keep that range in focus.
[01:50:16.860 --> 01:50:19.900]   And then just as a camera, it's a fantastic camera.
[01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:22.260]   It really is everything that I wanted it to be.
[01:50:22.260 --> 01:50:25.460]   Again, something I can just keep up with me at all times.
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:27.620]   It has a built-in lens cover,
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:29.740]   so I don't have to worry about having a lens cap
[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:30.860]   and gonna lose on it.
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:32.220]   Another thing, last thing,
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:34.580]   oh, I could, I'm not gonna talk for 80 minutes about this.
[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:37.020]   I'll just mention one last thing.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:39.660]   And the other thing I really loved about it is that
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:44.660]   the pot, it has a standard micro USB connector
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:45.620]   on the back there.
[01:50:45.620 --> 01:50:46.460]   - For the power.
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:48.260]   - For data and power.
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:51.260]   So you can just charge it just with your regular,
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:55.260]   like a USB, excuse me, a micro USB phone charger.
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:59.380]   You can just, so I don't have to take a battery charger,
[01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:01.780]   I don't have to take an extra AC cord.
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:03.740]   And the other thing is that if I've been carrying this
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:05.900]   around for like three weeks and the batteries are dead,
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:07.900]   and oh my God, there's something really great happening,
[01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:09.420]   I can just take out my phone,
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:12.300]   I can just take out my phone battery charger,
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:15.020]   plug this in for a good 20 or 30 minutes,
[01:51:15.020 --> 01:51:17.460]   and I'll have enough that I can actually take pictures with it.
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:20.540]   So it's not super cheap, it's cheaper than Sony's equivalent
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:23.460]   of this, Sony has their version of this sort of camera
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:27.460]   for a thousand bucks, this costs 670 something.
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:30.140]   But if you're looking for something that is as,
[01:51:30.140 --> 01:51:33.420]   I'm almost as easy to carry around as a phone,
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:34.980]   as easy to use as a phone, I mean,
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:36.660]   there are all kinds of manual features on it,
[01:51:36.660 --> 01:51:40.700]   but if I want to, I can just keep it on full automatic mode.
[01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:43.140]   It even has like touch to focus, touch to exposure,
[01:51:43.140 --> 01:51:44.540]   there's a full touch screen.
[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:47.100]   It'll be just as easy to use, but it will take pictures
[01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.700]   that are so much better than what your phone can take
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:52.220]   because it has a real pop-up flash,
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:55.060]   it has a real actual zoom lens,
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:57.220]   and that lens is like super, super bright.
[01:51:57.220 --> 01:51:59.300]   So again, I could not be happier with this,
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:00.140]   it really is doing anything I wanted to do.
[01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.860]   - It's the most important feature,
[01:52:01.860 --> 01:52:06.660]   it has a pop-up selfie LCD.
[01:52:06.660 --> 01:52:09.500]   So you can, I'm tilting selfie display,
[01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:12.860]   so you never again missed that great selfie.
[01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:13.900]   Look at that.
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:16.260]   - You know, this is a really nice travel camera, Andy,
[01:52:16.260 --> 01:52:17.180]   good find.
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:18.020]   - Yeah.
[01:52:18.020 --> 01:52:18.940]   - Good find.
[01:52:18.940 --> 01:52:21.700]   I mean, I presume you're still shooting with your OMB
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:24.020]   when you want this super stuff.
[01:52:24.020 --> 01:52:25.700]   - I have to, there's something really special
[01:52:25.700 --> 01:52:28.860]   I wanted to, I wanted to shoot tomorrow while I'm here.
[01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.420]   A statue that of course is only one of this
[01:52:31.420 --> 01:52:32.740]   in the whole world.
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:35.100]   So I did take the full camera with me,
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:37.420]   but that was another thing that really got me,
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:39.660]   reminded me that I really wanted to get a camera like this.
[01:52:39.660 --> 01:52:41.980]   The number of times I'm just in New York for one day
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.900]   or overnight, I'm not gonna have six hours or seven hours
[01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:46.420]   to walk around taking pictures,
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:50.660]   but A, you never know, and B, even if I take one picture
[01:52:50.660 --> 01:52:52.940]   that's really nice, I want it to be better
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:55.060]   than something taken with a phone sensor.
[01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.420]   So again, I couldn't be happy with this.
[01:52:57.420 --> 01:52:59.060]   - Yeah, this looks really great.
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:01.860]   Panasonic's, the LX's are fantastic.
[01:53:01.860 --> 01:53:04.300]   I think they're as good as the more expensive Sony's,
[01:53:04.300 --> 01:53:05.620]   frankly.
[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:08.220]   - I think the pictures this takes are even,
[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:09.540]   are just as good.
[01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:11.540]   I don't really see much of where,
[01:53:11.540 --> 01:53:15.020]   you're spending 300 extra dollars for the Sony has
[01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:16.460]   like an electronic viewfinder.
[01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:19.300]   This has a viewfinder where you will have to actually
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:20.140]   just use this.
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:23.060]   You can't go through any kind of a viewfinder.
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:24.260]   That's not a big deal to me.
[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:26.780]   The construction is just as good.
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:28.900]   The Sony doesn't have a touchscreen,
[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:30.260]   that would have been a huge bummer for me.
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:33.900]   The Sony also doesn't have the really cool 4K photo features.
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:35.940]   As I said, I've not, I did spend a lot of time
[01:53:35.940 --> 01:53:38.580]   looking at all the cameras in this category,
[01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:40.180]   including all the ones that are supposed
[01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:41.940]   to be coming out shortly.
[01:53:41.940 --> 01:53:43.500]   And it just was no contest.
[01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:46.420]   At least for me, I think this is exactly in the sweet spot.
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:48.700]   I just want a travel camera that takes great pictures.
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:51.980]   That's can be, I could be as fussy with it as with my big
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:54.220]   Olympus, or I could just keep it on automatic
[01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:55.740]   and it'll be as easy to use as my phone.
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:57.180]   - Yeah, and it does shoot Roth.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:58.100]   You're curious. - Oh.
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:59.620]   - Yeah.
[01:53:59.620 --> 01:54:01.060]   Very impressive.
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:04.300]   - All right, and this is gonna be a very expensive show for me.
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.700]   Let's see what Renee Richie,
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:08.220]   now let's see what I have to buy you the Renee mentions.
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:10.060]   - I'm gonna save you some money, look.
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:11.460]   I'm gonna tell you about Pi Day,
[01:54:11.460 --> 01:54:13.940]   because Pi Day is not just for delicious cherry pie
[01:54:13.940 --> 01:54:15.100]   and apple pie and things that you can get
[01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:18.820]   at your favorite diner, but it's also a pie like isn't math.
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:21.100]   And in honor of Pi Day, there's a bunch of science
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:24.260]   and math apps that are on sale, up to 50% off right now.
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:26.620]   It's called Pi Fest, which is in my mind,
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:28.100]   a hell of a promotional name.
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:30.020]   And there's great apps there, there's findings,
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:32.300]   there's Devan Agent Pro, there's Text Expander,
[01:54:32.300 --> 01:54:35.180]   you can get 30% off a one year subscription,
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:37.500]   there's Wizard Manuscripts, there's Pekkout.
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:39.900]   And it turns out that Pekkout does not just a handy note
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.540]   taking out for a single string of numbers,
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:44.020]   it can actually do like math, which blew my mind,
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:46.380]   but it's really good at it.
[01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:48.140]   And you can get a bunch of apps together,
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:53.140]   the discounts range from like 25% off to 50% off.
[01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:56.340]   But if you wanna celebrate Pi Day,
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:54:58.420]   get some great apps, save yourself a few dollars
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:01.580]   that you can put towards your Aaki charger
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:04.660]   or your camera, your Lemia camera,
[01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:06.020]   you can pick these up.
[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:07.700]   I think it's a 10 day sale,
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:11.140]   it lasts from March 14th to March 24th.
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:12.980]   And these are all great indie apps
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:15.100]   that most of us should be buying anyway.
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:17.700]   So again, take a look at Pi Fest.
[01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:18.740]   - Pi Fest. - And then have yourself
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:20.060]   a nice slice of the mode.
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:22.740]   - Yeah, and look Text Expander's in there too.
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:23.580]   - Yep.
[01:55:23.580 --> 01:55:26.020]   - Nice, very nice.
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:28.340]   - And App Camp for Girls, please go support App Camp for Girls.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:29.180]   That's my problem. - Yeah Kelly,
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:30.540]   you forgot to plug it.
[01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:32.380]   I'm doing it for App Camp for Girls.
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:36.140]   - When does signups begin for App Camp for Girls?
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:37.980]   - Signups are open now.
[01:55:37.980 --> 01:55:41.500]   And we are in Chicago this year for the first time.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:42.820]   - Yay.
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:47.180]   So Portland, Chicago, where else?
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:48.460]   - Phoenix. - Phoenix.
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:49.660]   - Phoenix and Seattle.
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:51.180]   - And Seattle.
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:52.940]   Very, very nice.
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:55.140]   All over the place.
[01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:57.720]   And this is aimed at Girls What Ages.
[01:55:57.720 --> 01:56:03.180]   - Right now, they would be in seventh grade or eighth grade.
[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:04.020]   - Okay.
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:07.500]   - And we'll be going into grade eight and nine
[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:09.260]   this coming fall, this September.
[01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:11.060]   - And when Girls go to this,
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:12.860]   they learn how to write an app?
[01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:14.020]   What do they learn?
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:18.140]   - Yeah, they learn iOS development from end to end.
[01:56:18.140 --> 01:56:20.660]   We give them a framework for an app that they build.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:25.180]   You can purchase last year's apps in the iOS App Store.
[01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:28.740]   And they get to build a quiz.
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:30.660]   And then they have to draw all the artwork.
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:32.300]   They have to come up with an icon.
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:33.820]   They have to figure out what all the questions
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:35.540]   are going to be, what all the responses
[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:37.860]   to each of the questions are going to be
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:40.900]   with giving you which results.
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:42.260]   And then at the end of the week,
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:44.620]   they have to pitch their app to a panel of investors
[01:56:44.620 --> 01:56:46.780]   and answer some questions about their app
[01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:48.740]   and the development process.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:50.740]   And so by the end of the summer,
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:53.140]   they end up with an app in the App Store.
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:56.140]   - And thanks, of course, to our old friend, Gene McDonald
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:59.580]   for getting this kick into gear.
[01:56:59.580 --> 01:57:01.460]   And now there's a bunch of people doing it.
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:03.580]   It's a wonderful thing.
[01:57:03.580 --> 01:57:07.860]   And it really is a great step towards empowerment
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:09.940]   to get more women into tech.
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:10.780]   So I love it.
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:12.740]   - Laura Savino, Eileen Sims also Aces.
[01:57:12.740 --> 01:57:13.940]   - Yeah, yeah, great.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:16.820]   - Yeah, it's super fun.
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:19.020]   And for me, one of the best things about it
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:21.660]   is the people that I get to work with on this stuff,
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:25.420]   like Aline and Laura Savino and Gene McDonald's.
[01:57:25.420 --> 01:57:27.060]   I see a lot more of Gene now that we do app
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:31.820]   and stuff together, like all of that stuff,
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:33.140]   there's so much great about it.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:35.580]   I'm one of the people who volunteers for Portland Camp.
[01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:37.540]   This is our fifth year in Portland.
[01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:41.940]   And I'm super excited how the program has grown and changed.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:45.140]   And if you're a person who's headed to Dub Dub this year,
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:48.820]   there will still be an app camp for a girls party
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:50.820]   near WWDC this year.
[01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:54.620]   So keep that in mind when you're looking to make plans.
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:59.580]   And like I said, it's one of the best things
[01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:01.820]   that I actually get to spend my time on.
[01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:04.420]   And it's super fun.
[01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:09.100]   And the moment when a girl looks at Xcode
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:10.740]   for the first time and really likes it,
[01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:14.100]   or finds the bug in the app and finds out
[01:58:14.100 --> 01:58:16.500]   that breaking stuff is like a whole job.
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.180]   And they really like that.
[01:58:18.180 --> 01:58:23.060]   Or finding out that artwork is really important
[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:28.460]   and how you interact with an app, the shapes that you use
[01:58:28.460 --> 01:58:31.300]   and what the user experience is like is really important.
[01:58:31.300 --> 01:58:34.900]   And finding out that you get to be the cheerleader for your app
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:38.460]   and develop a slideshow presentation
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:42.020]   that you're going to present in front of a bunch of people
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.540]   is always really exciting for somebody.
[01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:48.740]   And so I love getting to help all of those opportunities
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:50.380]   happen.
[01:58:50.380 --> 01:58:52.900]   Well, I'm really glad Renee kept us from forgetting
[01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:53.740]   to mention that.
[01:58:53.740 --> 01:58:55.180]   I think that's great.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:59.180]   Everybody should go to appcamp, the number four girls.com.
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:01.660]   Appcampforgirls.com.
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:04.420]   And sign up now.
[01:59:04.420 --> 01:59:05.500]   Sponsor, sponsor, sponsor.
[01:59:05.500 --> 01:59:05.860]   Thanks, Renee.
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.500]   If you can't go to the camp, sponsor it.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:08.020]   That's true.
[01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:10.660]   You can help out because, in fact, on the page
[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:12.660]   there's a contribute button.
[01:59:12.660 --> 01:59:19.620]   You can actually help support a girl to go to appcamp, even better.
[01:59:19.620 --> 01:59:20.780]   Kelly, so glad to have you.
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:21.460]   Welcome.
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:23.460]   Thank you for being here.
[01:59:23.460 --> 01:59:24.740]   Thanks for having me back on the show.
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:27.580]   Kelly Guimont, Macbrake.
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:30.900]   Veteran now, Macobserver.com.
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:36.420]   And Smile Software, makers of TextExpander and PDF pen,
[01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:37.300]   some great stuff.
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.060]   It's great to have you.
[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:40.020]   Andy and Aco, enjoy the rest of your day
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:43.380]   with the campers in Atlantic City.
[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:44.500]   I will.
[01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:48.740]   I nominate that we just make it final and just let Kelly
[01:59:48.740 --> 01:59:54.260]   have the parking pass and the gun permit as a member of the family.
[01:59:54.260 --> 01:59:56.740]   OK, deal.
[01:59:56.740 --> 02:00:00.220]   Your gun permit is in the mail, Kelly.
[02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:00.740]   Hooray.
[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:02.740]   You'll find more of Andy at the Chicago Sun times
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:04.340]   and, of course, in Aco.
[02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:07.660]   I notice you post now at IHNA-TKO.com.
[02:00:07.660 --> 02:00:09.020]   Should I plug that?
[02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:10.580]   CWB is a welcome page.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:13.180]   It's easier for people just saying it.
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:14.820]   You're spelling it phonetically.
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:16.620]   It's easier to find that an Aco-Dock.com.
[02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:18.700]   CWB.com.
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:21.420]   And take it from there.
[02:00:21.420 --> 02:00:25.060]   And thank you so much, Renee Ritchie, Imore.com.
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:30.100]   And the Fabulous Apple Talk podcast and my personal guru.
[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:31.460]   Whenever I don't know how something works,
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:33.340]   I say I'll ask Renee.
[02:00:33.340 --> 02:00:38.700]   He'll know how to take my watch band off.
[02:00:38.700 --> 02:00:39.100]   We do this--
[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:40.700]   Anything I learned, I learned.
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:45.300]   We do this show every Tuesday, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern time.
[02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:47.820]   That's now I have to change it because we've
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.420]   gone into summer time here.
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:52.060]   So that's 1,800 UTC.
[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.540]   I hope we haven't-- didn't throw somebody.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:55.060]   If you got here late, that's what happened.
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:56.860]   We set our clocks forward.
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:00:58.860]   But we'll be back the same time next week.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:01:00.060]   And I hope you will, too.
[02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:04.140]   If you can't make it live, you can always watch on demand.
[02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:07.980]   We have audio and video at twit.tv/mbw.
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:10.420]   And wherever you get your favorite podcasts.
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:13.180]   But now my friends, I am sad to say it's time to get back
[02:01:13.180 --> 02:01:16.180]   to work because you know what, break time is over.
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:19.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:22.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:24.760]   (upbeat music)
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:28.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
