[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   So Doc Rock joins us, YouTube star, along with Andy Inako, Lori Gill.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000]   And of course, we just got off the big Apple announcement.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   So there's lots to talk about. A new Apple Watch, a new SE Apple Watch.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   That's pretty cool. New iPad and a new Apple bundle, Apple One.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   We'll break it all down for you in just a bit on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we get down and talk about Apple.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And there's a lot to talk about. We're just coming off of the Apple.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   First event for Apple in the fall, I think there's going to be at least one more, maybe even two more.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Joining us now, Laurie Gill, who is on Twitch on Sunday was so nice having you.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   It was great.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   And editor at iMore, and it's great to see you.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   You didn't have to transcribe Tim Cook's remarks this time.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   No, I would not be here right now if I had to transcribe anything.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Believe me.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It was really intense, though. My heart is pounding.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   I'm feeling a little discombobulated.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   All right.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   My heart's pounding because of the--
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I'm not yet calmed down.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   The breathtaking amount of money this is going to cost me is my my heart's pounding.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Also here, Andy and I go from WGBH in Boston.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Hey, who?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Unaccountably, Renee Richie is not with us right now.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yeah, they're doing like streaming briefings right after the event.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Oh, I get it. So he's getting a briefing. I got it.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I'm only halfway important. I didn't get to participate in the briefings this time.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I got an invite, but it was by mistake.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yes, yes, me too.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Also with his Doc Rock of YouTube.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   fame. YouTube.com/docrock.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   He's hanging loose in Honolulu.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Nice to see you. Aloha. Great to have you.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I did the best I could to get the Renee beard look going.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You look pretty good. I like it.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I work on my Canadian accent.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Okay. It's all about that.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Sorry. Sorry. I love that. Sorry.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Sorry. All right. We all watch the event.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Right? Obviously.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I'll tell you the one thing that really stood out for me,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   and it's going to be an issue for Apple,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   is we knew where they were going to ask a new watch.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   We knew they were going to ask a new iPad Air.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   They added some things in there.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   They did not mention tags.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   They did not mention speakers.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   They did not mention iPhone.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So we know there's more to come, obviously.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   There's more than one more thing.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   But they did surprise me still when they talked about the new iPad Air
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   because it has a new Apple Silicon, a 14 chip in it.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So it is now faster than the high priced iPad Pro.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Does this mean?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Well, everybody was saying on Twitter,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   well, I guess nobody's going to buy an iPad 11 inch iPad Pro anymore.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   There are very few differences.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You could still get the 120 Hertz on the iPad Pro.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   They didn't mention that, at least for the iPad Air.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   You get Face ID.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I'm glad to see Face ID go.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I think the on-off button fingerprint reader sounds like a much improved solution.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Yeah, it remains to be seen how well it's going to work.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   But I think that the Face ID was less essential on a big screen device
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   than it is on a handheld device.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I would like to think that this means that that gives us reason
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   to wonder exactly how far ahead the new iPad Pro is going to come
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   with Synosys release.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I thought maybe they'd announce it today, but they did not.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   They had just updated the iPad Pros with the new cameras, the LiDAR.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   I think one of the things that's going to happen in this might be crazy,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   but this is a good beta test for Touch ID on a button because then the iPhone
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   will get two biometric factor identification.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Right.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So you can do like, if you want to buy an app, you can use either finger or face.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Right.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   But if you want to make a transaction, like a money purchase,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   you're going to have to put finger and face.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And then there's almost no way to beat that.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I never thought of that, but you're right.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   That's brilliant.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Factor biometrics.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Two factor biometrics.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Oh, well, is Apple willing to make the statement that actually we,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   when we said that there's no better, no more secure way to authenticate
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   on this device than Face ID.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Actually, maybe you do want to do both of these at the same.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   I could really see it.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I could really see them doing it as a belt and suspender sort of situation
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   because as we have seen, there are times when you maybe Face ID is not very,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   very convenient.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   And there are times when taking a glove off a hand is not very,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   very convenient.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   But that's for the normal course events.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I think what Doc Ruck is saying is normal course events, one or the other,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   but in those special times, like you're buying something where you really want to be secure,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   you might say, I want both or like you're logging into your bank.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Even like now with wearing mask and stuff, like the ability to keep back right now.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I've always loved Face ID until I had the rock the mask 24/7.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I went to school in Japan, so I wore a mask all the time.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Oh, it's interesting.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   But having to wear, I mean, having to unlock my phone when I want to use Apple pay,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I don't want to touch the punchy thing, what you call the little display.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   So I like to tap with my phone.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And so, yeah, it's great to not to be able to have to take that off there.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Yeah, I don't mind losing face ID to be honest with you.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And I should mention that that on/off switch fingerprint is used by a lot of companies.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   It's used on PCs.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   It's used, I think Google uses it on some of their devices.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Samsung uses it.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's on a lot of phones.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Every time I've used it, it's very reliable.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   It's actually on the Surface Duo, the Microsoft thing.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   It's fast, it's accurate, it's very easy to use.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And you see, it really is a little, and Apple showed this in the event.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It's a little scanner.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And you could put that on the on/off switch, and it works very quickly and well.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I think it's just a logical place to put it.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   What was it at OnePlus?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Something I had had that, and I liked it a lot.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And the whole thing about this is your printer with the screen.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I know it does, doesn't it?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   But I think it's still good.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   But if it works, it works.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   That's great.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I like to hear that there's already products that have success with using it so that we
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   know it's an existing technology.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   It's not going to fail every third time necessarily.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   It's good.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I'm thrilled.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I am thrilled.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   But I am worried about the 811 and Chipphead Pro.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   I mean, I guess it's 150, somebody in the chat room did the numbers.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   150 bucks more for the 11-inch iPad Pro versus the Air.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   You get better, you get additional camera lenses, you get LiDAR, and you get 120 Hertz.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   So there's some benefits, but not many.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   They could go, they could make sure that the screen size is always going to be an advantage.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   They could make sure that the top storage is always going to be an advantage.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   They're ways to differentiate.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Well, the 12.99-inch iPad Pro I could see, right?
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   By the way, this is the iPad Air.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   That is a LiD.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   You can even see it is not an all-screen design.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   There's bezels.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   I definitely see bezels.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Am I wrong?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Let's actually hold it without buying something accidentally.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Can we please?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Okay, you're right.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   You do need a bezel on a tablet, I agree.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   But let's not call it an all-screen design.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   But bezels are like the smash mouth of industrial design.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   It's like, what did they ever do to get everybody so mad at it and telling everybody that,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   "Oh, this has bezels, it must be a piece of crap."
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Bezels are fine, they're wonderful.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   I know, but when you see them and you've been using, it's mostly on phones, Andy,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   but when you see a big bezel and you've been using bezel, you suddenly go,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   "Oh, that's disappointing."
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I'll give you that on the duo.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   I'll also give you that on the eighth generation iPad, which we'll be talking about later,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I'm sure.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Because now that does seem a little bit weird to have all that headroom and footroom,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   but I really do think that having some air, so to speak, between the live screen
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   and the actual display is a good thing.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   You need to be able to hold it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   With a phone, you can hold it by the edges.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   But a tablet, you need to hold like you're holding a steering wheel.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I think you're exactly right on that.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   So, Neil, it's an iPad and the bezels are okay.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Thank you, Smash Mouth Doc Rock.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Now I know why you got that name.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   So it is this new 5 nanometer chip, which basically is saying,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   "You see, this is why we're not using you anymore."
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   These are the TS, I presume, the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturer TSMC chips.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   That was a huge rub in the face.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   And I can't wait for all of the nerds to zoom in and see what was happening with all of that stuff
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   on the back wall.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   It was very, very nice.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Oh, they already did.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   On Twitter, there are a lot of people with close ups.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Yeah, I think Lance, you'll enough did the first one I saw on me pull his up.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Because, yeah, it's nice to be able to analyze.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   They do this.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   They do this every time.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   They have the quick slide with all of this stuff you can't possibly read in enough time.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And then, oh, oh, wait a minute, get that, get that, get that.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Here's the...
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   You and I were joking on BTM about all of the pro displays that Apple had in that ad right there.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And they were like, that's because that was the overstock for what they didn't sell.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   So, this is really an interesting processor.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I think, by the way, this is the first salvo in what is going to be in a...
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I predict 2021 is the year of Apple Silicon.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   They are just going to literally lap.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Well, not literally.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I guess it's not a...
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   There's no track involved.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   But they are going to lap Intel and AMD with these processes.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   These...
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I mean, this is on a tablet, a six core CPU, a quad core GPU.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I mean, 11.8 billion transistors in this thing, a 16 core neural engine.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   That's what you get when you get the process down to five nanometers.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   You notice that when they started talking about the Apple Watch,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I think it's the first time that during a product introduction for the Apple Watch,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   they spent a moment to talk about Apple Silicon to make sure that this is the brand
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   that is going to extend to the entire line.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   They've always been very, very proud of their in-house fabrication in-house chip design.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   But now it's an additional asset.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   It's an additional signature for Apple to say, look, this is how well we do when we make all these things.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   They were making so many direct comparisons between the iPad 8th generation
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and its performance to low priced Chromebooks, low priced Windows notebooks
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   is definitely telling.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   They got something they can flex about now.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I have to say that I had my BS macro ready to go before they announced the price of the 8th gen
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   because like, okay, so fine.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   So it's like, it's three times, six times faster than the top selling Chromebook.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Well, maybe the top selling Chromebook is like $189 or, okay, it's legitimate for them to say,
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   this is a $300 tablet for education.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   It's legitimate for them to compare that to $300, $200 Chromebooks for education
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   or a sub $500 notebook from Windows.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And that's something that people can't really compare against.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   They're doing such a good job on it.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   So this will be the iPad will be out Friday, September 18th.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   You can order it now.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   The 8th generation, this is the base model, big bezels and yes, a home button with fingerprint on it.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   But this, I think you're right, Andy.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I think it's 300 for education, 329 for everybody else.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   I'm really glad they're preserving that price point because that I can very safely say when somebody's saying,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   what should I get instead of saying, well, you know, there's these Android tablets or, you know,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   I can say, look, there's no reason not to get an iPad at 329.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   That's just, there's, you, it would be a foolish economy to spend less for it and get a crappy tablet.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   So I think that's pretty good.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   This is now, they've upgraded the chip, the A12 bionic, which is the iPhone XS processor.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   So a pretty, pretty powerful processor in there as well.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Yeah, once again, underscoring that, hey, it's the iPhone processor.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   But of course we made our own customizations on our own changes for the iPad.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Again, underscoring that we, just like we can design new watch bands, we can just as easily design new CPUs
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   for whenever purpose we need.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Lori, they did say with the Apple Watch, no adapter, no power adapter.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   That was the rumor.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   People were a little upset that maybe the new iPhone wouldn't have the wall wart.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   And obviously you'll have to have the cable, but wouldn't have the wall wart.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   The watch, I think, is the precursor to this.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Is that a problem or is that a good thing?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Well, there's going to be a lot of people who already have some version of a USB charging port somewhere,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   including, including your computer.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   So if you own a computer, you own a way to charge.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   They do sell the phone.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   If you own an Apple Watch, would you have to own an Apple Watch to use, I'm sorry, if you have an iPhone,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   because you need an iPhone to use an Apple Watch, you've got a charger.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   But then you've only got one, so you can't charge them both at the same time.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   So on the one hand, this is a step in the direction of eliminating waste,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   which I've got at least a dozen wall chargers.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I think by now, everybody has a USB Type A wall charger.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And even if you're not, even if you're not in the everybody camp, even if you don't,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   you can buy one for pretty cheap.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Yeah, Apple sells the five watt for nothing.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So it's not going to be that big of an impact.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   There's going to be people that are complaining that, you know, for the same price, you get less,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   you know, in that idea, you know, but I think for the most part,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   this is just the first in a series of a lot of devices that are just not going to come
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   with a wall adapter.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And that happens all the time.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Lots of other phones and headphones and all the different kinds of things don't come with the wall adapter.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   They come with the charging cable and then you're on your own in terms of what you plug it into to charge it.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   I think the lack of wall adapter is a very good nod in a direction of like useless waste, right?
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I know for a while, I had a drawer with like at least 20 non-descript wall adapters.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   I've never used them.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   When I had to remodel the house like three years ago because we had a pipe burst.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And the first thing on my list of things to change was I changed every single socket to one of those new tech sockets.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   They sell on OWC where it has the two USB ports plus, you know, the regular AC outlets.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   And then so I'd never use those adapters anymore.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I have those all over.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Now at Costco, you can buy a two pack of replacement sockets that come with USB ports,
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   one with a 1.2 amp and one with the regular, you know, a 2.1 amp and a regular amp.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   So a twin pack of those plugs are like 12 bucks at Costco.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   So like I know many people receding not to have to have that stuff.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I don't want to say anything.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   But just so you know Doc Rock, Darth Vader sneaking up on you.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   No, he's back there and it's funny.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   He's actually, it's hard to tell, but he's wearing kakui nuts because we have the famous Jupyha on a mokku statue.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Yes.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   And if you look, he is, is the Duke.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Oh my God.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Yeah, that's what he is.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   So it's the Duke statue.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   It's the Duke statue.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   That's right there.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   That's exactly what he's doing back here.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   That's too big to be fair though.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   There's a good, I think that this is, this sort of choice is redeemed by Apple selling dirt cheap,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   but very, very good quality, meaning safe chargers in the Apple store to be, I mean, we're not,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.280]   we're not exactly the typical users because yeah, I mean, I, if my equivalent of giving
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:52.000]   out apples at Halloween is here, have a five watt no name Chinese chargers.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Whatever it was testing.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Oh, thank you.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Last time.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Mr. and I cow.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.520]   So it's sometimes, but it's, it's might be even worth it just to say that, look, we know that
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.480]   you probably, you might have gone for one of those like Black Friday deals on Amazon and
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.640]   gotten this really, really cheap, horrible and exploding sort of charger.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.960]   We want to make sure that you have one that's actually Apple made and actually Apple certified,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:23.160]   but the other part is the other argument is, and this is quite legitimate is that as Apple
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:29.240]   is talking all talking so much about the environment and college and how they're doing
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.720]   all the right things, the EU and others have made the point that there's so much e-waste
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:39.120]   associated with chargers that maybe we should not be just simply carpet bombing everybody
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:44.440]   with extra chargers and unless they actually want one and need one because those things
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.680]   do those things really do add up in the waste pile.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.780]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.120]   They did say what do they say?
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.520]   50,000 is the equivalent of 50,000 taking 50,000 cars off the road.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   Really?
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.520]   Wow.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.960]   I mean, I don't know if that's for 10 years or I don't know what that is.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.720]   Yeah, like how long for a day?
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.520]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:10.520]   I don't know if that's clear, but you know, when I got the 16, the first thing that happened
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.200]   is that charger actually never came out of the box because I'm using a gallium nitride
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.960]   charger that has two 100s.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   Love those 10s.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960]   Oh my goodness.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.960]   They're great.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.480]   The hyper disk or whatever one, it's amazing.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.880]   So I never have taken my Apple charger out of the box.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:40.320]   So the new iPad Air has a Type C charger, which means you probably could use Type C PD to
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.880]   charge it, I would think, which means that you'll be glad to have that GAN charger because
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.040]   you could have a Type C to Type C and charge it extra fast.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.480]   Did they say the iPad Air won't come with a charger?
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.200]   They didn't, which means it will.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.000]   You see what's in the box.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.200]   It's in the box.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.600]   It's in the box.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.200]   You can actually verify this.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:05.680]   It says iPad Air USB-C charger cable one meter and 20 watt USB-C power charger.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.920]   Type C, 20 watt too, which is nice.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.920]   That's great.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.640]   So in theory, what happens on that 20 watt too, you can actually charge our 16-inch really,
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:20.760]   really slowly because we forgot the GAN one day and I stole the one from my iPad.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760]   Yes.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.760]   It's just pro.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.040]   And overnight it did recharge the 16, but it takes like eight hours.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.560]   Right.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:32.480]   This is by the way one of the problems with Type C. It's all over the place.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.040]   And in fact, you got apparently, I thought, oh, for sure, anything that charges via Type
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:44.000]   C will have some sort of governor on it so that it doesn't break it when you plug it
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.240]   into a 100 watt charger.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.520]   Apparently, that's not the case.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.880]   I'm not going to name names.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.880]   Well, all name names.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:58.160]   I bought an IFI hip deck, it's called, which is a really nice solid state headphone amplifier
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.640]   and digital analog converter.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.160]   So you plug it into the Type C port of your laptop and it would give you a headphone jack,
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.240]   but it's got a better deck than the one in the laptop.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.240]   It's really good.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   I like it.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.120]   It's got battery and you charge it because it has a battery.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.400]   And mine died and I contacted them.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.920]   They said, oh, did you not?
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.680]   You got to use the cable that came with it.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.680]   I said, what?
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:25.160]   I said, yeah, you probably were getting people frying them with the high-wattage chargers.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.680]   So that's a problem.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.600]   Type C is a mess.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.400]   It's just a mess.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.080]   But so maybe that's why they're bundling.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.240]   So you can say, use our charger.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.400]   You don't want to use more than 20 watts or something.
[00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.760]   I mean, I'm sure Apple's putting limiter in there.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.080]   But that's guaranteed.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.240]   Yeah, Apple wouldn't.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:51.840]   But this is a fancy, fairly fancy device.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.920]   Here's the chat rooms giving me this link to a 1-0 on Medium.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.560]   USB-C was supposed to simplify our lives.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.960]   Instead, it's a total mess.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.480]   Why is Apple going all in on C?
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.360]   Is this the beginning or the end of the lightning cable, or do you think?
[00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:16.200]   Well, there was the mandate from Europe that all devices had to have to support USB-C.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.360]   So I'm sure that has something to do with it.
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:20.880]   I'm wording this wrong.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.600]   I don't think that it's literally-- it has to be a USB-C port.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:30.640]   But I think that you have to be able to use USB-C somehow with it, because that's their
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.640]   the mandate.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.320]   So I'm sure that that has something to do with it.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.800]   And USB-4 is coming, which will also use that style connector.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.840]   I don't suppose this is a USB-4 device, but nevertheless makes sense to move everything
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.880]   to the same connector eventually.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   Let's see.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.880]   All right.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.600]   So I completely got out of order here.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   I'm all over the place.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.800]   There's just so many exciting things to talk about.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.280]   Yeah, usually what I try to go chronologically, but I just got-- I did.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   I got over excited.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.160]   I got way over excited.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   Let's take a break over.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   I love the colors of the camera.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   I want to talk about that.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   I love the colors.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.800]   In fact, my initial reaction when Mike and I were watching the stream, we were covering
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.280]   it, is, oh boy, this is a problem.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:20.280]   And they're pushing the colors and the new bands and the new colors of the watches and
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.640]   the new colors of the iPads.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.160]   That means they don't have much inside to show off.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:30.240]   That's what Detroit did once cars got to be as good as cars are going to be for a while.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.880]   They started making every model year look different so that you'd look at it and go,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.960]   oh, I have the old one.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.280]   But I was wrong.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.280]   I was wrong.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.880]   So we're going to get to the watch.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.120]   What's new in the watch?
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.600]   They did announce an Apple One bundle.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:48.360]   I'm very curious what you all think about that, especially about the pricing and the
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:51.520]   new fitness plus app.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.960]   We'll get to that in just a little bit.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.720]   Our show today-- by the way, great to have you.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:00.760]   Doc Rock visiting us from Hawaii where he is quarantining on the beach.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:04.680]   She's right near the beach, boy.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.200]   Actually, it's probably a little frustrating because you can't go to the beach.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.680]   No.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.240]   What would Duke say, right?
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   Yes.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.480]   You could go, well, you could bring your boy down to the beach and surf.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.480]   You're allowed to do that, right?
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.680]   And I just bought brand new like Enne Anaco Speedos.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.720]   I had him custom printed.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.360]   Oh, nice.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.360]   Nice.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.280]   You got the Chris Evans model, I hope.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.960]   Yes, yes.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.240]   Enne Anaco is also-- I'm not going to say anymore.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:39.480]   Enne Anaco is also here, WGBH commentator at IHNAITKO.com.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.480]   I'm going to see you.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.800]   And the wonderful Lori Gill Sr. managing editor at-- I just added this senior there.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   Managing editor.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.320]   There's nothing to do with your age, Lori.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.320]   I'm just saying it.
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   Not that you know how old I am.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.440]   No, I just-- it has nothing to do with that.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:01.440]   Managing editor at imore.com or show today brought to you by World Wide Technology, WWT
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.640]   there in St. Louis.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.920]   What a great company.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.680]   I am so proud to be partnered with them.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.440]   We went out to see them in St. Louis.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.000]   It was the last trip I'll ever make back in March.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.400]   And it was an amazing experience to see that advanced technology center that they've built.
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.280]   They're an enterprise technology company.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:27.440]   They help big business, government, hospitals, install new technology, integrate technology,
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.840]   use, cloud, everything, you know, those kinds of things.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:34.480]   And they are one of the things that they did that I thought was so smart.
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.000]   And they started doing this 10 years ago.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.800]   They started building something they called the ATC, the Advanced Technology Center.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:45.080]   Because they realize if we're going to recommend and sell this stuff, we need to know it.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.040]   We need to be able to build pilots and proofs of concept.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.040]   So we better get all this gear.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.680]   So they've basically been accumulating the latest, greatest enterprise technology in the
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.240]   Advanced Technology Center.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.920]   The lab contains more than half a billion dollars in equipment.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:05.480]   From hundreds of OEMs, keep partners ranging from heavyweights like NetApp and Cisco, to
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.520]   emerging disruptors like Equinix.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.280]   This is why WWT is a trusted partner.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.080]   People stay with forever.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.160]   The customers have been with them for more than a decade because they know that's where
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.800]   they can go to get the answers they need to make sure their business runs right.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:26.280]   And the commitment the WWT engineers have to really understand how this stuff works so
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.640]   that they can recommend it and configure it and make it work.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.600]   This is what they use the ATC for.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   They spin up proofs of concept and pilots using the ATC sandbox.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.960]   It helps customers confidently select the best solutions and reduces the concept time
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.920]   for months down to weeks, increasing, of course, the speed to market.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:53.880]   On-demand and schedulable labs like NetApp Cloud Volumes on Tapper, NetApp Storage Critter,
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:59.360]   NetApp Disaster Recovery as a Service, DRAS, along with hundreds of other labs representing
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:06.120]   the newest advances in every area of enterprise technology, flash storage, multi-cloud, hyper-converged
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.760]   infrastructure, cloud data management and more.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.280]   There's the DRAS solution.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:17.320]   And the thing is you can right now use that lab yourself.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.400]   They offer lab as a service.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.880]   I'm going to call it LAS.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.040]   A dedicated lab space inside the ATC where you can perform programmatic testing using
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.640]   their massive ecosystem of tech that they've put together.
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.200]   And because it's virtual, you don't have to go to St. Louis to do it.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.440]   You can use it anywhere in the world anytime 24/7.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.960]   Join the WWT engineers working in these labs every day, beta testing new equipment, building
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.520]   reference architectures and custom integrations.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.040]   This new digital platform they launched at last summer creates a multiplier effect of
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.720]   knowledge, speed and agility anytime, anywhere around the world for their customers.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.960]   Not just the labs, by the way.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:03.040]   Look at all the articles, case studies, all sorts of tools to help you understand technologies
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.880]   better to make the right choices for your business.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:12.520]   Look, enterprise technology is moving really fast right now, faster than ever.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.400]   And that's what WWT can make such a difference for you because they understand it and they
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.440]   can help you integrate it.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:24.320]   To learn more and discover why organizations across every industry turn a WWT to guide
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:29.520]   them on their journey of digital transformation, visit www.t.com/twit.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:34.880]   While you're there, create that My WWT account so that you can get to the ATC ecosystem and
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:56.480]   start using it for yourself.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.440]   Let's start from the very beginning.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.400]   It's the very best place to start.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:07.800]   Tim Cook comes out on where does he looks like he's in the hall of the spaceship campus.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:13.960]   Beautiful, painless glass curve looking out over the beautiful.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:20.080]   And then I'm realizing, first of all, these shots, as Tim says, now let's take a look,
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.560]   are droning through the glass and out into the world.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.680]   Then I'm looking a little closely and it looks like Tim's teeth are a little blue.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.000]   I don't know, did you notice that?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.160]   Like he's been eating gummy bears.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.040]   And I realized it's a green screen.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.400]   Oh, tricked.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.120]   Now Scooter X says Tim was there and it's not green screen, but if that's the case, he
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.000]   needs to go see a dentist.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.200]   Because his teeth were blue.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.960]   You know what it could be?
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:58.720]   I live in a very predominantly glass building and the lighting that the coating that they
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.200]   have on the glass in order to make it strong and protected.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:07.680]   It does cast a bluish, purplish type 10, you know what I mean?
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.320]   But there's no actual 10 on the glass.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.240]   It's just the way the glass is built.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:12.480]   So that could be part of it.
[00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.560]   But I think what happened at the very beginning is a normal shot.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.520]   I think a lot of the rest of it is green screen.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.600]   We have this conversation, you know, over.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.480]   This is what you do for a living.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.920]   You're video production guys.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:29.080]   So and clearly, you know, I mean, when you, first of all, I have to say it's nice they're
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:34.560]   not live because they were really able to do some Hollywood great production effects.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.880]   When it started off, you're going into that animated graphic and like it was going into
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.400]   intestines and then it turned the intestines turned into a heart and they're going and
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:48.680]   you're zooming and suddenly you come out.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:55.160]   So the elementary canal into the hall and there's Tim coming your way.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.360]   And then and there's drawn beautiful drone shots.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.360]   I love the shot.
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.560]   They're demonstrating the altimeter in the watch that shot up to that.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:10.360]   I don't know what if it was a fire watch station or something 8,000 feet above sea level and
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.880]   the woman was working up the stairs.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.880]   That was beautiful.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.440]   Wasn't that a beautiful shot, man?
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.120]   So we came up with a dropped her up there by helicopter because they paid her and told
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.040]   her to walk up 9,000 steps to get to the top.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.360]   She wouldn't look so sprightly and fresh at the top.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.000]   And number two, soon have been pissed.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.960]   She's like, how much did my agent charge for this?
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.600]   So we came to the conclusion they dropped her halfway up.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.360]   She only had to crawl maybe like 30, 40 steps.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.520]   So maybe it wasn't a drum.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.040]   Maybe it was a helicopter shot.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   It was beautiful though.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:48.840]   But we did come up to the conclusion that they did the floor levels based on rank until
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.040]   Tim came down to have lunch with Lisa towards the end.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.480]   He was down at the bottom.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.120]   So we just got Tim.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:32:01.240]   Tim was on the top floor and Elhefe, Tim, number two, probably, was on like the second
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.640]   from the top floor.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.640]   And then they worked their way down.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.640]   Lisa was at the bottom.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   Look at Lisa.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.840]   She's down in the ground floor for crying out.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   She was near Nate's.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.840]   Oh, trees.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.840]   Oh trees.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   Trees and trees.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.840]   She wanted to be there.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.560]   But then the other dude, the new guy, they still came in the outhouse.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:24.800]   Like he was in the middle, you know, and then he came through Medina, Rara, Madderina,
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.760]   whatever his name was, the new guy.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   And then yeah.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.680]   Yeah, he was in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.440]   So yeah, he didn't have the greatest locale.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   So they were lining people up.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.640]   But you can't tell me.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.160]   Now look at this.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   Look at his teeth.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   They're blue.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.080]   You can't tell me that this is not a green screen.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.080]   That's a green screen.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.240]   No, no, no.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.080]   I see reflections behind him.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.080]   Oh, I know.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.080]   I realize it is.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.320]   You can see his head reflection.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   That's just a really good green screen.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   It could be.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   You're right.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   It could be.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:05.160]   I think it might just be just bad lighting, not blue because I don't see blue the way you're
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:09.800]   talking, but I see darkness in his mouth, which could just be bad lighting.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.800]   All right.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   It's a silly thing to worry about.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.240]   Laurie, I see darkness in his mouth.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.040]   That seems like a projection.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.000]   I see darkness in your mouth.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.560]   One of my aunts used to say that if you tell a lie, your teeth and tongue turn black.
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:28.600]   So maybe because he is doing a lot of marketing talk during this, during the show.
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:29.600]   All right.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.600]   All right.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.600]   I'm sorry, Tim.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:32.600]   I don't want to focus on your.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   He's running.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   He's actually lying about it.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.600]   He's not just saying.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   I'm just saying.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   It's just, you know, I'm just saying.
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.280]   So Tim's last one or he got some more in him before he goes.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.280]   You know what?
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   Oh, he's got lots more.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:44.280]   You know what?
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.280]   Tim is a God.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.920]   He deserves every penny he gets.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.880]   He's close to being a billionaire, which is unusual for a non-founder CEO.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.880]   And he deserves it.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.040]   He's tired soon.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.040]   I think so.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.400]   He's got a couple more years.
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   He's my age.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.080]   He's got a couple more years.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.080]   Oh, man.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:09.480]   No, I don't be retired because he's old just because he wanted to let somebody else do
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   it.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   He's younger than me.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.480]   He's 59.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   So he's not.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.480]   He's got a few years left.
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   He could stay as long as he wants.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.280]   The board's never going to kick him out.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.280]   Oh, God.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:24.360]   You know what I was surprised because Jazoyak had tweeted, can't wait to see you.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.360]   Our events coming up.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:31.400]   I thought for sure he would take Phil Schiller's traditional role in these announcements and
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.160]   they never showed Greg Jazoyak, never got on stage, which is fine.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.200]   I mean, they had other people doing a great job, but I was a little surprised.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.800]   I thought this was going to be his debut.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.760]   No, no slight on the people who did present, but these are sort of, if this were the iPhone
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.400]   event, those are the tier two products.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   So they're saving Jaz.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.400]   Yeah, they're saving Jaz for later.
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.000]   They did have Jeff Williams, the COO.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.360]   Oh, I mean, that is Tim Cook's, you know, that's Tim Cook's old job.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.560]   That's how Tim got to be CEO.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:03.560]   It's an important job.
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:07.480]   And he was, he was given the job of showing off the new S6 chip.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.200]   So that takes us to the Apple watch.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:17.640]   The S6, he says, is the equivalent of what the chip, the A11, I think he said chip, except
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:22.400]   it's specially, you know, smaller and specially designed to be a low powered chip for the watch.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.840]   He says, the chip is so power efficient that we can double the brightness of the always
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.280]   on watch screen.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.280]   That's great news.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:36.840]   Here's, here's the, by the way, here's the, let me just show you real quickly the drone
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:43.640]   shot as we go into, we go through Silicon Valley faster and faster and faster.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:47.120]   I would like to know where this is, Doc Rock.
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.120]   That's where I want to go.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.120]   Look at that.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:52.400]   I thought it was the Great Wall of China at first, but it didn't look that far.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.400]   And you're right.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.280]   There's no way she was, she's a little sweaty.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.000]   There's no way to say this is Spanish Alps.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Is that where it is?
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Okay.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.320]   Don't ask, I told this to me.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.320]   Okay.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.320]   It's pretty wherever it is.
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.720]   Feel like it's a fire watch station, right?
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.720]   That that's gorgeous.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.680]   It looks like, it looks like Minecraft.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.680]   It does.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.680]   It's a Minecraft.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.000]   It also looks like it must have been filmed like after the fire started in California.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   There's no smoke.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Oh, is it?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   It's Luke Skywalker's hideout.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   That's right.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Luke was up there.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.160]   Where's those weird birds?
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.000]   Where's those weird puffins?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Look at that.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   That is gorgeous.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.280]   I don't know where that is too though.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.600]   Well, it was in a porgs.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.360]   That's what we need more porgs.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   I never thought I'd say that.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.360]   I got it.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.360]   Look at it.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   Oh, look.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.960]   It's it's it's I.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.360]   Oh.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:56.320]   So our chat room who's always amazing has pinpointed that as the Sierra Buttes fire lookout.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:03.040]   It's a historic fire lookout in Northern California in, I guess, Sierra County.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.040]   I'm not sure.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.040]   You could see Mount Lassen.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.880]   Yeah, it's a lot clearer in this picture than it was when she was there.
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.200]   So you might be right.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.200]   8,000.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.200]   I found camping in the buttes.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.200]   So that is a really beautiful area.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   Oh, gorgeous.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.800]   Intense stairs at the end.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.480]   If you're afraid of heights, make sure you get Tim Cook's helicopter.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.680]   I don't I don't doubt that she climbed the whole thing.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:31.920]   I don't think that I would not assume that until, you know, don't tell what there was.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.960]   If it was see if it were me, yes, I would insist upon.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.680]   I would actually I would probably insist upon the green screen just because of the altitude.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.000]   Oh, I'm going there though.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   This looks beautiful.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.680]   They said it came to the Marco Poulouse stairs over here.
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   They do have porgs.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.680]   Look at that.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.200]   That's a marmet.
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.640]   Look at that.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.640]   She climbed that.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.640]   You think, Andy?
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.640]   Wow.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.640]   Wow.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.640]   This is fairly doubted.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   All right.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.120]   Well, actually look at that view.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.160]   That's actually not that big of a line.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.720]   It's only 180 steps.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.720]   That's not too bad.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.520]   Also, do you think it's with your eyes closed?
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.800]   Do you think it's less dangerous to your health to climb all those stairs or to do a helicopter
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   drop?
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Yeah, no good point.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800]   Good point.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.040]   No, you're absolutely right.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   Unless she's an ex-seal.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.040]   Oh, okay.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.040]   Don't keep scrolling Leo because you're going to come to a teddy bear where somebody fell
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.840]   off in 1985.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.840]   No.
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.840]   No.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.840]   Do not fall off, okay?
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.600]   See, it is more dangerous than we thought.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.600]   All right.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   Are you surprised?
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.920]   There's so much processor in the...
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.840]   I think Andy, was it Andy?
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.840]   You nailed it.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.840]   This is their...
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   This is...
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.000]   We're silicone, baby.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.080]   Get ready because everything we make is suddenly going to be supercharged.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.840]   Take that until.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.800]   It makes you wonder how much processing power is required for that of blood-o-2 sensor.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:01.280]   That it's not like they have another system on a chip that's doing the O2 sensing.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.280]   It really is just, let's get a whole bunch of light readings and do a whole bunch of
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.280]   processing on that.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:12.880]   When you see that much power inside a series six, particularly how much power is at a premium
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.480]   on one of these watches, it's...
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:20.000]   I wonder what that discussion is like time after time where do we do things like give
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.120]   people a brighter display or do we give people an extra day of battery life?
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   Right.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:34.040]   Now, when Samsung announced new features in their Samsung watch, like a blood oximeter
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.400]   and a VO-2 Max and stuff, we got all excited and they said pending FDA approval.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.720]   I didn't hear any of that language from Apple.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.120]   I didn't see any of it on the site, so I presume they got...
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.120]   Yeah, they've got...
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.120]   They've got...
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   They've got...
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.120]   They've got...
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.640]   They've listed about half dozen countries in which they've have approval for it so far.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.640]   That's great.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   That's really great.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.080]   I think that's why it wasn't...
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.360]   This technology has been around for at least two years at this point.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:06.040]   It's appeared in other devices, but those devices launched without support for it.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.440]   It said pending FDA approval.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:14.840]   So I think Apple purposefully postponed including this sensor till this version, the series
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:19.040]   six, specifically because they want it to be available out the gate.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:24.080]   I want to have to wait six months before they wanted to make sure that this was something
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.000]   that people had right away instead of talking about how great it is and then telling people
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.080]   you don't get it yet.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.640]   Although some countries don't get it yet.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.520]   Actually most countries don't get it yet, really.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:37.320]   No, US, Canada and Australia, right?
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   New Zealand, maybe.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.840]   What were you saying, Doc Rock?
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.000]   No, I was saying one of the cool things and probably why they get their certifications
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.560]   quicker than say others is they do so much with sending information to the research partners.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:55.000]   They talk about it a little bit today, but that stuff is big.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.480]   That's quite amazing what you can do and the stuff that it comes up with.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.760]   I think it's very helpful.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:08.800]   I did trigger a noise alert once and it kind of freaked me out because I forgot it did that.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.840]   It's like, listen, you're somewhere that's pretty loud for long.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.840]   You should stick your...
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   I think that's great.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.680]   Yeah, I just took my AirPods in.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.160]   I don't hear anything.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.360]   No, I really appreciate that.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:24.080]   I think that they've done...
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.080]   There's no...
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.880]   Initially the Apple Watch to me seemed like, yeah, kind of candy, but now I don't leave
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:31.880]   home without it.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.280]   I really do think.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:39.600]   One of our staffers who has sleep apnea bought his first Apple Watch today because the
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:44.080]   oximeter will... you wear it while you're sleeping and you'll have a record of if you
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.960]   had any issues breathing at night.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.120]   I think this could be...
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.120]   They've talked a lot.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:53.600]   They always talk about saving lives and how...
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.920]   I kind of don't like that too much because I don't want...
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.720]   I think it's a mistake to imply that it's...
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.280]   But it does, Leo, it does save lives.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.600]   I know it does, but those are anecdotal, handful of examples.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.720]   Of course it does, but it shouldn't be treated as a medical device.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.720]   It's not...
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.160]   Oh, I don't have to go to the doctor.
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.440]   I got an ECG on my wrist.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.040]   It's not the case.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.040]   No.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.160]   But you have to really give Apple credit that, like Lori said, that these sensors have been
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:25.400]   around for a while, but Apple's Real Match is not only packaging it in such a good watch,
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.400]   but also expressing those features so well.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.880]   Like no, it's not just push a button and 15 seconds later on demand, you get a saturation
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:34.880]   level.
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.440]   It's a periodic background readings throughout the entire course of the day.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:45.120]   The real advantage of all this data that's collecting is not so much its ability to...
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.320]   You take your watch out of the box for the first time.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:51.360]   You own one of these watches in four years and then sort of brace yourself for what it
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.320]   tells you after the first half hour of having it on your wrist.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:59.840]   It's more like after it taking so much data about what is your normal, it can tell you
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.840]   that something is not necessarily normal.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:06.840]   I mean, the times where maybe you exerted yourself a little bit too much and you were
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:11.760]   wondering, am I having an episode or an issue right now or is it just okay, it's because
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:15.440]   you're climbing those stairs with like 30 pounds of groceries and you just made like
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.640]   four flights of stairs.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.840]   It has the ability to tell you that, well, this is an hour later, you're still normal.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:23.840]   You've come back to normal.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.920]   That's where the blood oximeter is so handy.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.720]   Not so much that it's telling you that your blood saturation is down to 88%.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:36.040]   Sometimes it's just handy to know that I don't know why I'm feeling so weird right now.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.200]   I'm going to take this on, nope, at 98%.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.560]   That's your normal stuff.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:45.200]   Really, and I think that the last two things for the Apple Watch to figure out now is blood
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.520]   pressure and blood sugar levels.
[00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.280]   Once they manage to figure out a way to do both of those things, boy...
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.600]   Absolutely, you must have.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.600]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:44:00.120]   It will almost be a crime against humanity to limit it to iPhone users at that point.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:06.480]   I may be incorrect on this, but it's my understanding that a blood oxygen monitor requires you to
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:12.880]   be completely relaxed and not moving a bunch in order to actually do the monitor, which
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.040]   is why it's a during the daytime.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.120]   So Apple has two different things.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.520]   They say you can test your blood oxygen level in six seconds.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.600]   That's where you're manually doing it in the middle of the day.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:29.400]   And then it has the secondary thing where it records your blood oxygen level through
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.760]   the night while you're sleeping.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:35.840]   So I don't think necessarily it's something that's going to alert you if you've just climbed
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.240]   up and down the stairs.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   I think that you have to actually manually do it during the daytime where it's going
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:47.160]   to recommend that you sit down, relax, don't move, and then hold your button, hold the
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.160]   sensor.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:50.240]   Again, I might be wrong, but it is...
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.920]   I believe that that's part of the process of the blood oxygen monitor.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.880]   Because of COVID, I bought a blood oximeter because that's an important diagnostic tool.
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:04.560]   If you do get COVID, if your blood oxygen starts to dip, that's when you call the hospital
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.760]   real quick.
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.560]   And it just goes on my thumb.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.480]   It's pretty much the same kind of sensor Apple has.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.960]   It's just beaming light into your blood vessels.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.760]   And it doesn't say stand still or anything.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.760]   It doesn't.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.120]   It gives you a continuous reading.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.520]   And I'm able to...
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.520]   And it's good.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.040]   I mean, it's great to have that.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:26.600]   And I figured if something goes wrong, if I get COVID, I'll have that.
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.840]   But now it'll be in the watch.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.160]   And I think that's really fantastic.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.080]   And that reminds me of the...
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:33.080]   And that reminds me of the...
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.080]   Your old test.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.000]   When you go for your 50 year old test, they put the thing in your mouth, the oximeter
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.400]   on your finger, and you walk in a treadmill.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.400]   That's a stress test.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.960]   You're definitely not stationary.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.960]   So you're moving by.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   Yeah, okay.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:50.040]   And you'll see a lot of the elite athletes wearing one while they're setting themselves
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.520]   up for Olympic trials or whatever.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.120]   So yeah, you don't have to be still.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.040]   You know, my doctor, I'm well past 50.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.040]   My doctor never did that.
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.560]   I think he's afraid it'll kill me.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.920]   Those stress tests look stressful.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   Was it hard?
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.800]   No, yeah, it was kind of hard because I got bad knees.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   But it wasn't super hard.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.960]   But I was more worried about my colonoscopy.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.960]   Oh, God.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.960]   Yeah, let's not talk about that.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.960]   That's not...
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.960]   Literally, that's not...
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:23.280]   I told him, whatever you do, don't leave your apple watching.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.720]   He does not put his hand anywhere in there.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.560]   I just want to say right now...
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.480]   Oh, I'll put a trade in value right now.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:36.200]   So as somebody Evil John said in our chatroom, the Apple Watch improves more lives than it
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.400]   saves directly.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   And that's okay.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.800]   And I think that's exactly right.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:40.960]   There's no question.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.440]   It's improved my life.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:46.720]   And I think the addition of this new fitness plots thing, this is the thing that has long
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:53.120]   been rumored as projects seem more, I think this is going to be very interesting.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:57.560]   You're taking a book, a Patreon Peloton's book.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:58.560]   What is that?
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.440]   There are a couple of mirrors that you have a screen that's...
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.440]   Trainers were...
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:05.560]   You're looking at the trainer while you're working out.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.000]   There are a number of startups doing this.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.600]   I think they all have to feel like they were a little bit sure locked by Seymour because
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.960]   this is going to be really...
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.680]   I'm very excited about fitness plus.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:24.000]   J Blonick, who's of course a kind of celebrity trainer, demonstrated it.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   It looks like there are spin classes, there's yoga, there's dancing.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.840]   I wouldn't mind taking a dance class.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.440]   It could be on your Apple TV.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:39.360]   If you've got the watch on and you're on your Apple TV, it's getting your heart rate
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:44.000]   and stats from the watch and displaying them on the Apple TV.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.320]   So you know if you're working or working harder.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.760]   I think this is a really, really interesting product.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.400]   I'm very excited about this.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:56.000]   When you do the dance class, I really want you to stream that.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   I'll stream it.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.800]   I'll do it on the Doc Rock channel if you want to...
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.800]   Pay per view.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.640]   I want to send them to a cut-off.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.200]   I'm a good dancer.
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.200]   It's Sunday.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.200]   It's Sunday.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   We're on the point.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.880]   Where is the guy talent?
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:14.000]   Well, I didn't say I have talent.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.200]   So Fitness Plus isn't out yet.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.200]   It won't be out.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.640]   In fact, they said to late 2020, you'll get three months free when you buy the Apple Watch.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:28.360]   And then after that, it'll be $9.99 a month or $80 a year, which I think is one month
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.360]   free for current Apple Watch owners.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.480]   And that I think is a fairly good price given that you get a family membership.
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.360]   So Lisa and I and Michael can all use it for that $10 a month.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:45.120]   I think that's actually... Peloton, just the app is $13 a month.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:50.240]   So I think that that's actually a very competitive price, even more competitive when you add it
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:55.160]   to the new Apple One bundle.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:59.600]   So let's... before we move on to Apple One, any thoughts about Fitness Plus?
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.920]   Oh, I think you're so good.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.720]   Are you excited?
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.720]   Do you?
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:10.240]   At the time, I'm being myself, I've been slacking on the fitness.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.240]   Me too.
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.240]   Get that...
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.240]   I got...
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.240]   I'm a whole lady fine stuff.
[00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.240]   Oh, my COVID-10 is COVID-20.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.000]   Hawaii has excellent food.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.520]   Macaroni salad, some poi, a little spam.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   Suddenly...
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.520]   It starts to swell.
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.080]   It was really funny too.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.360]   We were just recently talking about that breakfast place that was across from the college.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.560]   Was it Halis or Halenas?
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.960]   Halis, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.960]   Halis, oh my goodness.
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.960]   We were just talking about that.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.960]   That was good.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.960]   Off the cheek.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.960]   But the...
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:47.280]   Just the idea of the doing this, and I've been doing a lot of searching to find workouts,
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:51.160]   both for the Oleity and for my niece, because my niece, she's getting into competitive swimming,
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.000]   and now she's not able to go into the pool.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.240]   So we've been finding her at things, where she lays on the piano bench and practice her
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.000]   strokes and everything.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.840]   And this virtual class situation has already been growing, and the peloton thing is...
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.640]   Oh, I do peloton three or four times a week.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.840]   It's very expensive.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:12.840]   I got it years ago.
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:17.800]   The bike is thousands of dollars, and I think I pay like $30 a month for the classes.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:21.880]   But you know, it like Apple Fitness Plus, because you can watch classes on demand, but
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:26.160]   they're also live classes, and you can see the other people in the classes, and the instructors
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.600]   talk to the people in the classes.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.280]   It's really more like taking a real spin class.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.760]   And I actually love it.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.720]   So I think Fitness Plus is going to be huge.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:41.160]   I think this is exactly what we should have had.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.960]   I think I'm going to reserve my judgment.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:49.280]   I like what it sounds like it has to offer, but I think this...
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.080]   And I think I speak for a lot of people in this world is that we think it's going to
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:57.120]   be great until we try it, and then we find out that we're not dedicating ourselves to
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.120]   it enough.
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.720]   So that's every gym membership in the world, right?
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.800]   That was the X-Plex Fitness for sure.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   Well, that's what I was saying, Doc Rock.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:11.240]   Microsoft did this with the Connect, and the Connect saw your heart rate.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.920]   It actually had a very similar product.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.080]   I used like twice.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.080]   Right?
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:18.720]   Then I got back to Destiny, and it was all over.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.240]   Well, remember where their team is now, right?
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.240]   Their team is in Cupertino.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.200]   So it does live on.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:33.040]   But think about the Xbox version, any of the classes that were paid or oriented was ridiculously
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.040]   expensive.
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.040]   That's right.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:41.280]   So it became a non-starter, but at 79 bucks a year, that was actually the cost of one
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.520]   of the Julian Michaels program.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.520]   Right.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.520]   So that's right.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.520]   And you get it for the whole family.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.520]   Everybody can use it.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.720]   And you get more than one style.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:53.840]   The Julian Michaels stuff was just playing off at a TV show, but the yoga stuff would
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:58.240]   be like another hundred, you know, and then the dance lesson was you bought the game,
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.240]   Dance Dance Revolution over the heck it was.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.240]   Yeah, that's what I did.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.240]   Just dance 2020.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.240]   Right.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.240]   And that was another 80 bucks.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.240]   Right.
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.880]   So already this is cheaper.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.520]   Strength, yoga, treadmill, rowing.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.960]   I have a rowing machine too.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.200]   I'm telling you, I'm going to, this is, you're not going to believe, I'm going to look like
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.280]   J Blonick next year, including the, uh, body of white has a rowing machine.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.160]   This is, you put it in the actual water.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.160]   So both.
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:28.840]   Hey, if I could do an outrigger, I would do that in a heartbeat.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.640]   Oh man, on Waikiki beach, I'd be there, man.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.640]   Me and Duke.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.720]   By the way, they got a name for your Darth Vader.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   It's Duke Vader.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.720]   Duke Vader.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:39.720]   I'm going to change his name.
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:40.720]   Duke Vader for sure.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:46.160]   So they've got a, but it looks like they hired trainers specifically to do this.
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.360]   They've got a bunch of workouts.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.960]   Here's an example on the Apple page.
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:53.680]   We're looking at yoga classes, five minutes to 45 minutes.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.760]   You choose the music as it comes from Apple music and they even point out you can download
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.720]   those, those playlists yourself.
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.880]   I don't think doing yoga to country music.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.920]   It's my cup of tea, but I'm sure somebody will want to do that.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:11.600]   There's a yoga place in my neighborhood that does heavy metal yoga.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   Oh man.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   That doesn't sound relaxing.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   It gives me a little warrior pose.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.520]   I don't have to say that.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:23.680]   I think this is really interesting.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:29.480]   And I think that Apple is, if nothing else, Apple is going to make a huge difference in
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.840]   the overall fitness of the world.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:33.360]   And that's something to be proud of.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:35.360]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:41.240]   It's interesting to see them expanding their fitness brand now beyond the Apple Watch.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:45.480]   And yes, this service helps to sell more Apple watches or helps to justify the purpose
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.840]   of Apple watches.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:51.720]   But it makes you wonder what other pieces of hardware, what other kind of services they
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:54.000]   they've either considered and rejected.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.360]   Like wouldn't be interesting if they had if they were developing instead of doing the
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.320]   entire sleep tracking through the watch, here is a device you can slip between your
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:07.920]   mattress and your box spring that would add much better sensors than that.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.880]   This really does underscore that whereas other people have other companies have fitness
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:17.000]   watches that happen to have health features for Apple.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.840]   Health really is an entire product category in and of itself.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:24.200]   So I can't wait to see what they're doing in the next couple of years.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:26.200]   Really, really interesting.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.640]   I wonder how the mindfulness one is going to be because I use calm like right now.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:30.640]   Love it.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.640]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:32.640]   I need to.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:33.640]   I'm way too high strong.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:37.160]   So I do the calm session in the morning and I do the other one when I'm trying to lay
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.640]   down and go to sleep.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:45.120]   And they've had incredible guest speakers and stuff that come on to calm.
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.120]   Then LeBron James story and calm was pretty good.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.120]   I love those.
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   That was so good.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:54.040]   So I talk in was MQ was saying like I wonder how the mindfulness sensors are.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.840]   I'm curious about that as well.
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:00.640]   Calm I should mention is a sponsor, but I also should mention that I'm a Kaiser member
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.520]   here in California and they offer calm for free.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.520]   I don't know.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.640]   Given how much you're paying for insurance that you're not using.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   I think that's pretty good.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.840]   That's nice of them.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.840]   Thank you.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.840]   I appreciate it.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:20.320]   So fitness plus will be part of the what is the what is the Apple one toe top bundle
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:26.000]   like the Apple one Supreme premier premier premier premier premier or premium for the
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   money.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   Oh, premier.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Because you need to you get.
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.920]   So yeah, I didn't I couldn't do the math fast enough.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:39.280]   I already do cloud and music at 10 bucks a pop.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.280]   Right.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.400]   And when the end of the year runs out and my Apple TV plus runs out, that'll be another
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   five.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.400]   So that's the 25 right there.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   So I'm already covered.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.640]   So to get fitness and news, I don't use plus out here.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.400]   I can't go arcade.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:57.280]   I count as kind of goofy.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.720]   So I think it's going to come out.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.520]   It's a come up like amazing.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.800]   I'm already going to save automatically.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.040]   Though I'm I'm not a fan of Apple news.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:10.600]   I'm not a fan of Apple arcade, but I cloud already used it to to terrify plan.
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:14.280]   So yeah, I'm going to come out big, but you also get family with premium or premier,
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.280]   I believe.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:17.000]   So you're actually getting more.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   $30 a month for premier.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.840]   You get Apple music, Apple TV plus.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.480]   So what is Apple music now?
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.320]   Is it eight, 10 a month?
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.640]   10, 10, but it's it's 15 if you have it on the family.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.480]   So we should only do the family plane because this is a family plan.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.800]   So 15 and then Apple TV plus is how much is that five?
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.800]   Five.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.800]   It's 20.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   Okay.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:40.800]   It is a 25.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.200]   Apple news plus is another 10, 35 fitness.
[00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:50.440]   They said is 10, 45 and two terabytes of cloud storage, which is how much a month for
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.080]   10, 10.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:58.680]   So that's $55 and and you get the family version for $30 and it could be shared among
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:56:59.680]   six people.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:00.680]   That's so it is a deal.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.680]   I especially liked it.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:07.520]   They took the two things that are maybe the least value ads for the most people.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.240]   News plus and fitness plus and they made that part of the premier package.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:16.360]   It's not as though, gee, I really, really want a TV plus, but I have to go to premier in order
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.880]   to get that as part of the bundle.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.200]   I think that this is a very, very nicely laid out plan.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:28.480]   Although I will still say that 15 for the individual plan, $15 a month and you get 50
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.480]   gigabytes.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.480]   That's the much.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.480]   Zero.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.800]   It really is at this point like a phone with 32 gigs of storage.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:37.960]   It's like, okay.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.120]   It's a number.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.960]   It's just not a very useful number.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.200]   So it's frustratingly low.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:48.760]   In the US, 50 gigabytes of Apple storage is normally a buck a month.
[00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:51.000]   So that's not really a lot of value.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:53.680]   But two terabytes would be 10 bucks a month.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:59.040]   So I mean, I think that the $30 if you have a family and you're going to use enough of
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:02.320]   these, you have to do the maths yourself to make it worthwhile.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:03.320]   You're right.
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.040]   I probably wouldn't pay for Apple News Plus.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.160]   I will definitely play for fitness plus music.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:11.520]   I guess, you know, this is a great way to get somebody on Spotify to go, well, if we
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:17.720]   cancel the Spotify and, you know, our Apple TV in November 1st, right, Laurie is going
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:22.400]   to start costing money and start adding it up.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:23.840]   Arcade I lived with that for a while.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:25.240]   I don't really need arcade.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.560]   I think you'd have to do the math.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.640]   San Mateo mentioned something that I did not know.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:35.520]   He said, Leo, you should find news plus a value because you get the UK Linux mag, which
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.160]   is 10 blocks on a new stand.
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:40.440]   I forgot about the magazines and news.
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:41.840]   Yeah, that's the point of news.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.960]   I just ordered for news, but I forgot about the magazines.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:50.200]   So that actually might make it even better.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:53.560]   If I were Spotify, I might be a little worried.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.600]   In fact, they are.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:59:01.080]   They sent out statements to the press to crying Apple's anti-competitive behavior and calling
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:07.440]   on competition authorities to stop Apple before it's able to cause irreparable harm to developers.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:12.600]   Once again, they wrote, "Apple's using its dominant position in unfair practices to
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:18.400]   disadvantaged competitors and deprive consumers by favoring its own services."
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:22.160]   We call on competition authorities to act urgently to restrict Apple's anti-competitive
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.040]   behavior which is left unchecked will cause irreparable harm to the developer community.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:31.240]   Now, I have to say, all this means is, "Sorry, EU, you're not going to get Apple one."
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.240]   Right?
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:38.280]   Because I don't think in the US, you're going to see an antitrust action over this.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.680]   I can see why Spotify is hopping mad.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.280]   Yeah, also is fitness plus available worldwide yet?
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.120]   I think it was just limited to.
[00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.080]   So they couldn't even do that.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.080]   I don't know.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:54.720]   In fact, let me look and see where Apple one is available because it might not be available
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:58.920]   worldwide, which would be kind of interesting, wouldn't it?
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:06.320]   We don't know because it's coming later this year and I don't see a available where starting
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:11.840]   this fall-- Oh, premier plan Australia, Canada, the UK, and US.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.680]   So stick it, competition authorities.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.760]   Well, is it-- so is Spotify-- I mean, let's be fair.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.320]   I guess their position is what?
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:31.840]   Apple by manufacturing the iPhone and now offering this plan is taking advantage of us
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:36.120]   because we can't compete, because we don't own the platform.
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:46.960]   Doesn't that-- If all these companies got together and said we should set a price for
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:54.440]   services like music services, isn't that anti-competitive behavior because you're demanding that everybody
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:57.000]   stay at one high price?
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.720]   So it seems to go the exact opposite of what I understand anti-competitive behavior to be.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.440]   Well, but bundling like this has historically been a problem.
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.760]   Remember, that's what got Microsoft in trouble with the EU and the Department of Justice
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.760]   because they bundled the browser in with Windows.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.600]   This is like that, I guess.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:22.400]   Spotify could easily link up with another manufacturer and be like, hey, can't let's
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.040]   generate some sort of a bundle.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:33.440]   I mean, TV, terrestrial TV that became cable have been doing this for decades, right?
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:38.800]   Like the only way to get HBO was to have this cable bundle.
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:44.040]   So Spotify got a little skinny argument that they're leaning on and they're trying to
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:49.160]   be Swedish house mafia, but unfortunately, Spotify is just not going to work.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:53.960]   And I know you're a little angry because you gave Joe Rogan way too much cake, but figure
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.960]   it out.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:59.680]   By the way, Joe Rogan is looking for somebody to debate Donald Trump.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.680]   Maybe you'd do that, Doc Rock.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:06.680]   I don't know if Biden's can take four hours of debating four hours with Joe Rogan.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680]   How do you just for Joe?
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.680]   Just for Joe.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.800]   I thought that was kind of an interesting--
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.880]   --play on Joe Rogan's part.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:21.160]   He said, look, let's have a debate between Biden and Trump.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:27.760]   And then he threw in the four hours, which I mean, these guys are in their late 70s.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.800]   Will there be P-breaks, Joe?
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:39.880]   Anyway, I can understand why Spotify is miffed.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.040]   Maybe in the EU.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:46.960]   Now, I'm no expert in antitrust law, but I have heard it said many times, the EU's antitrust
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.920]   law is designed to protect consumers.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:53.560]   In the United States, antitrust law is more designed to protect competitors.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:55.160]   Or no, it's the other way around.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.160]   Right.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.880]   In the US, we're trying to protect companies in the EU, they're trying to protect consumers.
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.560]   I think it would be hard to justify how consumers are hurt by this.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:10.840]   Unless Spotify goes out of business.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:13.880]   But Apple only owns a small portion of the overall market.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.080]   It's not dominant, what do you mean?
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.400]   You look at Verizon.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:23.960]   Verizon has been bundling Netflix and Spotify and Hulu free forever.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:27.040]   So they're doing it themselves right now.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.600]   They're just mad because Apple has it.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.160]   But imagine if there is no quote unquote Android.
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:38.520]   There's a bunch of things that make up the nebulous nature of Android.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:42.720]   But if they were a single company Android and they said they were going to put Spotify
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.280]   as their de facto dude, this wouldn't be a conversation.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.800]   You know what Apple should just do is they should say, "Okay, you have a choice.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.720]   You could have Apple Music or Spotify for the same price."
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:56.160]   And see how many people just choose Apple Music.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.440]   That would be one way to handle it.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.800]   I just don't understand where the argument comes from.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.280]   If the government is going to be interested in stuff like that, they should be more interested
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.280]   in AT&T offering subscribers free access to HBO Max.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.680]   That's another reality issue.
[01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:17.760]   The entire company owns the entire bundle.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.440]   That's the sort of stuff that they should be working on.
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:20.440]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.240]   Well, we'll see Spotify hopping mad.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:33.640]   But as a consumer, I can't remember whether the EU protects me or the US protects markets.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.200]   No, no, it doesn't.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.200]   Where's Alex?
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.680]   No, no, no, no.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   Explain this to me.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.800]   I think it was Amy Webb.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.040]   But anyway, it mocks Nick's because there's no any trust regulation in the United States
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.880]   unless you own social media networks and Apple doesn't.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:50.880]   They were wise.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:51.880]   Stay out of that.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:52.880]   That's for sure.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:59.440]   The Apple One individual plan offers savings of over $6 a month.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.320]   Family plan offers savings of over $8 a month.
[01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.920]   Premier plan offers a savings of over $25 a month compared to the individual bundle.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:10.800]   So in every respect, you save a considerable amount of money.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:16.840]   And there's all sorts of little details like if you already subscribed to any of these services.
[01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.360]   They will be free during your trial.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.680]   You won't be billed for them.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.720]   There's no sorts of interesting little things.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:25.320]   I think I would wish Apple would push this out now.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:26.320]   I'm signing up.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.320]   I'm ready.
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.280]   Just to clarify, I've got the FTC.gov page on anti-trust laws.
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:36.240]   Free and open markets are the foundation of a vibrant economy.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.240]   Okay.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.640]   Aggressive competition amongst others gives consumers both individuals and businesses
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.840]   the benefits of lower prices, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.840]   So laws promoting vigorous competition.
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.640]   That makes sense.
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.200]   US protects companies.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.360]   EU protects consumers.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.360]   So I don't know.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:55.720]   It's hard to show how consumers would be hurt by this unless, as I said, all the other companies
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:58.760]   go out of business, but that's another matter.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.480]   All right.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:04.880]   So have we covered the watch in every bit of detail?
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.720]   Well, the series is six.
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.320]   Well, we've talked about-- Oh, the SE.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320]   We've got the SE.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.320]   We've got the SE.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:11.320]   Oh, and the colors.
[01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:12.320]   And the colors of the series.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.480]   All the colors of the rainbow.
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.880]   They're beautiful.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.880]   What color did you get?
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.880]   What did you order one?
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:21.040]   Did you get around to ordering one before the show started?
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.320]   Yeah, I did.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:29.920]   And it turns out, because John ordered the band and the watch, but the band is coming
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.080]   on the 18th.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:33.320]   The watch isn't coming to the 25th.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:39.280]   So I think the 25th might be, unless you were really quick on the draw, the default.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:45.000]   And I've seen some other watches, some other combinations of watch and band that are delayed
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.040]   till October at this point.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.040]   So--
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040]   So maybe even--
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:51.840]   So I admit the site got really slow.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.720]   I think that's a good sign for Apple, right?
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.400]   Well, on the one hand, yes, that's definitely good.
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.520]   But there's also going to be a little bit more of a supplier slowdown just because of
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.320]   the COVID in 2020.
[01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:05.840]   So I think that has something to do with it too.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.840]   I did not--
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.840]   I'm not the site slowing down, but the delay in shipping already.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:10.280]   I did what Doc Rock suggested.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.480]   I just bought one of any kind.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:15.280]   And then I'll change it later, right?
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.280]   Figure it out.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:19.160]   So what color case did you end up getting?
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:25.280]   Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to get if I don't change it, which is the gold stainless.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.680]   Because I thought the aluminum stainless looked cheap.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:31.440]   The gold stainless-- I'm sorry, this is ridiculous.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.240]   This is going to be such an expensive month.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.640]   This is irresponsible as hell for me.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.280]   The gold stainless with the leather loop, because I wasn't convinced that my measurements
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.280]   were accurate.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.200]   But I'm going to go-- because I think I would like to try that.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:50.480]   So the two new bands they announced that don't have any clasp, one's a rubber band.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.280]   I'm sorry, silicone rubber band.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.880]   But I guess I gather stretches over your hand and then snaps into place.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.480]   You have to measure yourself to get that one.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.480]   Right.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.480]   And then there's--
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.040]   So that it's not too loose or too tight, yeah.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.840]   Yeah, that's the solo loop.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:08.800]   And then there's a solo weave, which--
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.800]   Braided loop.
[01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:10.800]   Braided loop, yeah.
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:11.800]   Yeah, braided silica.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.800]   That looks pretty good.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:13.800]   That looks pretty good.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.800]   I think so too.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.800]   That's the one that the band I bought.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   Is that what you got?
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.800]   How about that one?
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.080]   And which color did you get the blue one or the red one?
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:25.640]   So I ordered the blue aluminum, because I think the blue aluminum does look good.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.960]   It's like the gray aluminum.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.320]   I think that's a good looking color.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.640]   I like it.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:34.080]   I've been using the stainless steel apple watch, and I think I actually prefer having
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.080]   the color.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.800]   It's just a little more swatch watch fun for me.
[01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:40.360]   That's just my jam.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.840]   And I thought-- I agree with you.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:45.840]   I thought the product red was a little too chintzy looking.
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.840]   It's a little too red.
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:48.840]   Yeah, so I didn't get that one.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.840]   I got the blue.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.840]   I think blue looks nice.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.840]   Pink.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.840]   You got blue and pink.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.840]   Oh, that's so pretty.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:09:00.480]   I only picked pink and black band, because I couldn't seem to get the red band to produce
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:04.440]   a buy button almost as if it wasn't available yet.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.840]   So I can get the product red band later, because I'm all about the product red.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.040]   The product red band is not available.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.640]   Oh, that's it.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.360]   That's why I couldn't order it.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.360]   That's why.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.360]   OK.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.360]   Did you use the studio?
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:18.600]   Because I think the studio is kind of cool, where you go--
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.320]   I didn't want to waste my time.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.320]   I ran.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.360]   I went as fast as I could and picked whatever band I could.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.240]   And are you getting your watch when?
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.240]   The 25th of November.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.040]   So were you and I are on the same page.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.040]   September.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.040]   Yeah, I think September 25th is soon.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.040]   September, sorry.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.440]   So you choose the size.
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.560]   And so Doc Rock, you like the product red, you wanted to get the red one too.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.080]   Yes.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:42.680]   No ceramic anymore, just titanium steel.
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.280]   No, they don't have titanium.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:45.600]   Oh, they do have titanium.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600]   Titanium is still available.
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.600]   It is OK.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.160]   It's the addition for 849 Schmakers.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.880]   Take 100 bucks off if you're going to get stainless steel.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.200]   Take 400 bucks off if you're going to-- you really pay a lot for the material.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.520]   And I don't think that's really how much it costs to make.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:06.320]   But honestly, given that you're going to be upgrading this every year from now on, it
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:11.520]   looks like you'd be a nut to buy anything but the aluminum.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.080]   Some people have that money.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.320]   You know, I don't upgrade every year.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.520]   I would have-- I would not have upgraded this year for work for the color.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.120]   I really like the color because I'm very happy with the Series 4.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.120]   I think it works great.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   I don't need an always on screen.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.720]   That was not to me last year from when the Series 5 came out.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.120]   It wasn't something that was an insta-buy though.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:32.800]   I know it was for a lot of people for me.
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.640]   I don't care one way or another.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.280]   But I really enjoyed that there was new colors.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.920]   So I think there's going to be some of us who buy things regularly every year, every
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.920]   two years.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.800]   But I would have easily kept this watch the Series 4 at least two more years before upgrading.
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.200]   Had it not been for the fact that there's this beautiful new color that I wanted.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.200]   Aww.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.480]   Isn't that pretty?
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:56.560]   So let me just show everybody what you got.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.240]   So I'll do this in the picker.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:01.440]   So we'll go back to the blue.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.880]   There's the blue.
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.000]   And then we're going to get a nice braided pink.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.400]   Look at that.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.480]   It's pretty, right?
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.480]   It's girly.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.280]   Does it show you the side?
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:12.800]   Does it show you the side?
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:13.800]   Side view.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.800]   Ah, side view.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.800]   Yes, it does.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.800]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.800]   Do you look at that?
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.800]   Look at those colors side by side.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:19.800]   That's so 80s.
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.800]   I like the braid.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.800]   It is 80s.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.800]   And I do like the braid.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.800]   I really do.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.560]   This one, I wonder if this one, so the silicon loop actually looks a little bit more like almost
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.360]   like a slap wrist kind of thing.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.320]   But the braid looks more like it's stretchy.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.400]   Like you would stretch it on.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.480]   I feel like this is like the boat shoe of watch bands.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.760]   Like you should wear it on your yacht.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:48.880]   Well Renee calls the sport loop.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.960]   He calls it the yoga pants of watch bands.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960]   Yes, and he's right.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960]   I'm wearing it right now.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:53.960]   It's great comfy.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.960]   And honestly, I don't mind it.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.200]   Look at that new cream color.
[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.880]   Oh, isn't that pretty?
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.880]   Back up.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880]   Back up.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.680]   I'm going to get that one.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.320]   I'm definitely going to be ordering that one.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.320]   Yes, see, look at that.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.680]   That looks like a cream circle.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.560]   Oh, but I don't really like the blue on the other side though.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.920]   That's not going to match the blue.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.920]   It's kind of weird.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:13.920]   So maybe I won't get that one.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920]   You think they'd make it match.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.600]   It's just speaking of matching.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.800]   It's that they're two different things in the Apple watch announcements where they gave
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:26.160]   me almost something that I've always wanted.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.320]   And one of them, when they were talking so much about watch faces and you saw so much
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.440]   diversity in watch faces, I thought that, oh, they're finally going to let developers
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.080]   create their own watch faces.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:36.080]   But they did.
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.840]   But they did something that was kind of interesting too.
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.440]   Things like the stripes face that's brand new where you have stripes of colors and you
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:46.640]   can adjust what all those colors are going to be.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.440]   To match your clothes.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:51.160]   To match your clothes, to match your watch band.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:57.320]   The way that they have now an analog face with numbers that you can change the typography,
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:58.800]   you can change the colors of.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:06.160]   It's still not as nice as being able to have an unlicensed illegal Pokemon watch face.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.240]   Like you can have on Android Wear.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.920]   But at least it gives you enough flexibility that you don't feel like, oh, well, I'm just
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:17.480]   another person who has just another copy of the same Apple watch.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.040]   I was really excited about the artist collaboration because to me that means there's going to
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.040]   be more of those.
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:28.000]   So I can't wait to see more artist collaboration faces.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.200]   This is with the departure of Johnny Ive and the ascension of Hanky and who's the guy
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.200]   we saw on stage.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.680]   I can't remember his name.
[01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:44.160]   But the new guys in charge of design, I think there's some changes coming along.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.560]   Like a little bit more openness of faces.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:51.040]   They didn't say anything like this is the thinnest iPad we've ever made.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:55.400]   It was discernibly thicker than the iPad era of previous years.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.560]   I don't mind that.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:58.400]   I think that's a load of these bezels.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:02.840]   Can we have a special video telling you exactly about this bezel angle?
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.640]   A lot of that's the preciousness is gone.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.880]   I was a little distracted when they were announcing the iPad 4 because I was in the middle of
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:14.680]   writing something, the iPad Air 4.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:22.160]   Can you just tell me at a glance, is it the 2016 iPad Pro casing?
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160]   Looks similar.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.160]   Looks really similar.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.320]   Because it supports the Magic Keyboard.
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.320]   It supports the Magic Keyboard.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:34.480]   So that'll be the question is if you need a new Magic Keyboard or if the Magic Keyboard,
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.480]   I wonder if the Magic Keyboard with your 11-inch Pro would work with this.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.480]   I don't know.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.480]   That's what I was.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.480]   I bet not.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.480]   That's what it sounded like.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.440]   It didn't sound like they were making a special one for iPad Air 4.
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.160]   It sounds like it just supports it.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:55.360]   Which makes me think it's the 2016 iPad Air Pro case just with some things that are different.
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.360]   That's what Apple does.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:04.080]   They move devices into cases from previous models to keep the price down but give new
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:05.080]   features.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:10.440]   So that seems like it's down the right pathway at least a little bit.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.800]   Well, SE, let's talk about the SE.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:18.720]   So I thought really interesting new market for Apple.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.400]   They talked about a family system where you don't have the kids don't have to have an
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.400]   iPhone.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:29.720]   Mom or Dad has the iPhone, comparing multiple watches for the kids and now you can give
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:34.960]   a kid a less expensive Apple Watch SE.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.520]   If it's got cellular, you can talk to the kid.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.520]   You know where the kid is.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.680]   I thought that was a really interesting market.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.760]   Still an upscale market.
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.200]   It's not cheap but it is less expensive.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.920]   This is not the Apple Watch SE.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.680]   Is it basically a series 4?
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.480]   What do you think it is?
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:55.000]   It's got the S5.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000]   S5.
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.040]   So it's a slower processor or yes or no.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.040]   S5.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.440]   No, that's the Apple Watch.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.360]   That's the series 5 version.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.360]   Okay.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.360]   That's the one I'm wearing right now.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:08.360]   So that's not bad.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.360]   Does it have the always on display?
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.960]   Did it mention always on display for the SE?
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.040]   Because I think the series 4 also has the S5 chip.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.720]   I might have some specials.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:25.080]   Watch faces for kids, which is kind of cool, for schools specifically.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.440]   So that's kind of neat.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.320]   It's not just for kids, obviously.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.640]   You know, the pitching fitness plus and all the health features.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.840]   Apparently, somebody in the chatroom says it does not have ECG.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.840]   So they're saving on some sensors.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.840]   It does have obviously.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.840]   Right.
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:45.200]   Jiro, the fall detection, same as on the S6.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.200]   Hand-washing.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.280]   I was trying.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:53.640]   I just have my notes here that I was sticking down during the prezo.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.120]   But I have a note here that says that family setup is only compatible with cellular model
[01:16:58.120 --> 01:16:59.120]   watches.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.120]   That makes sense.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.280]   That makes sense because so you go out of the house and now you're disconnected because
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:06.920]   you don't have cellular.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:10.440]   So you're going to be buying a more expensive watch.
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:11.600]   You're going to have to pay for this anyway.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:16.840]   But if you have an older, I think I heard them mention that this is going to be supported
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:19.520]   on Series 4 and newer.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:27.000]   So I could hand down my Series 4 to someone in my family because I'm going to get the
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   new one anyway.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.560]   So now I have a Series 4 that someone else in my family can use.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.120]   They didn't have to go buy a new one.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:39.480]   So I think the idea is less about you going and buying a new Apple Watch for your family
[01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:44.040]   setup plan and more about you handing down your Apple Watch to somebody in your family
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.760]   that doesn't also have a life without having to also buy the life.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.760]   That's a good point.
[01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.480]   There's something called Apple Cash Family.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:56.960]   You can send money to your kids over the watch for doing chores.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.800]   You could have allowances come in there.
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.800]   It's really interesting.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.760]   You know, special kid faces, for instance, the activity rings, track movements instead
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.600]   of active calories, running, walking, and cycling workouts also calculate metrics like
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:12.040]   distance and pace more accurately for smaller people.
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:16.720]   And look, there's a little jump rope activity, which is awesome.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.960]   You approve the contacts.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:19.400]   You approve the apps.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.480]   And you could schedule a school time mode.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.440]   This is the school time mode.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.080]   That means the kid can't do anything, but it's a watch.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.200]   It's not anything else.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.200]   This is the school time mode.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.760]   I think it's really clever.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:35.720]   And all the new watches will now have me emoji faces.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.720]   And the kids can design their own-- there's no camera, obviously, but they can design
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:45.760]   their own emoji using settings to pick the different features.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.440]   Family members can share their location and define my app.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:52.480]   That's another reason you want cellular plus GPS, right?
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:53.920]   That's kind of the point of this.
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.360]   I think for me, anyway, you know where my kids are.
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.040]   And also to be able to call them without having to give them a smartphone, I think it's great.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:10.080]   Actually, I'll probably use this more for is I have-- my mother is doing a dementia thing.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.080]   They mentioned that also.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.080]   Yeah, older folks.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:18.280]   So like just to-- like we used to strap her in with the phone, make sure the GPS was working
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:21.360]   so we can see her when she would walk about.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.200]   Luckily she's out of that phase now.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:28.800]   But just even for them to have it on and can tell if they fell or, you know, I don't know
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:33.520]   if it will let you see what their vitals are, but I think that would be also handy
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.920]   or if they're sleeping well.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:39.200]   So I wonder how much info transfers, but it'd be cool to be able to give my mom this watch
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:41.520]   and be like, hey, lady, don't take this off.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.320]   Yeah, this is going to be really interesting, isn't it?
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:56.160]   I think a fall detection is probably-- again, I think it does save lives.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:00.120]   And I think fall detection is an example of where that can help.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:06.600]   So I have the perfect scenario for this exact situation, which is that my partner's mom,
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:08.640]   she's older, she falls.
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:10.720]   This is something that she's doing now that she's getting older.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:11.720]   She falls a lot.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.520]   She's broken a couple of phones.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:17.240]   So if she's wearing-- and she also has an Android phone.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.840]   She doesn't have an iPhone.
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:22.400]   And I can't tell her to buy an Apple watch and an iPhone.
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.200]   That's too much money to spend all at once.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.760]   I can't buy that for her as a gift.
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.480]   It's too much for me to spend.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:30.480]   So in this way, I can hand down my series four to her.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.440]   She doesn't have to buy an iPhone for it.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:40.320]   We can set up our family set up with her on it so that if she falls, I'll get the notification.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.320]   She's got fall detection on the phone.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:46.480]   We can set up location tracking so that if for some reason she's out somewhere where
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:50.640]   she's lost, there's location tracking where we can find her and get in touch with her.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.880]   So it's a step in the right direction.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:57.760]   I still really do think that an Apple watch needs to be platform agnostic.
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:02.240]   But this is definitely a step in the right direction of opening it up to people who don't
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:07.840]   have an iPhone to be able to also have the technology that the Apple watch has.
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:12.000]   You guys have inspired me, Doc Rock and Laurie.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.600]   My mom's 87 and I worry about her falling.
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.320]   I want to make sure she's always in touch.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.560]   She has an iPhone.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:23.720]   I think I'm going to have to give her an Apple watch or give her my own watch.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.600]   If she has an iPhone, you should have been giving her your old Apple watch a long time.
[01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:30.400]   I strongly feel that way.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.560]   It's a success.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.520]   Will it work with a success?
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.520]   I can remember.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:39.200]   The series four works all the way back to the...
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.200]   Four.
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.200]   Six.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.160]   No, I don't think it goes back all the way to the four.
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.240]   I think it goes back to the six.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:48.760]   Maybe someone in the chat room knows better, but I think it's the six.
[01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:52.240]   You know what I would like to see and I'm not sure if it's in there yet.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:59.680]   Okay, so we got Sally making her way over to Florida.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.720]   After Sally makes landfall, just like we got a couple, you say a little more than a year
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:09.320]   back, we got the thing that popped up to say North Korea was going to bomb Hawaii because
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:13.320]   someone in Hawaii did something stupid.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.520]   It would have been cool.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.440]   Like I just noticed that you fell down.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.720]   I'm okay to come up.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:23.640]   It would have been cool for the watch to pop up after that alert to then go, "I'm okay,"
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:28.200]   because every person in my entire family called, it asked me if I was right.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:32.920]   And I was like, "No," but I did just accidentally crack and open a bottle of Yama's hockey
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:33.920]   21.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:40.640]   But as well drinking that, yeah, drinking that way to go.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:44.000]   Oh, that's because Facebook has that, that I'm okay thing.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.120]   Yeah, that's Apple should do that totally.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:48.000]   It should be put into the watch.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   Brilliant.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.280]   Tim, Doc Rocks kind of like her.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:55.680]   We get Hurricane and tsunami scare every year.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.640]   So just to be able to eliminate the thousand phone calls from home, because they think
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:01.280]   like we're in a different planet.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:07.120]   Yeah, it's not just a little, little California man.
[01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:11.680]   Not just that, but there's, I don't know if it's a pixel exclusive on Google Android,
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:18.240]   but they have a feature in their safety and security app that says that it's kind of,
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:22.440]   it's a feature where if you aren't terribly sure about what your safety is going to be
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.560]   in the next three or four hours, you can say, "If I don't check back in with this app within
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:30.000]   the next three or four hours, please send the following message to the following people
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.400]   along with my current location based on this device."
[01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:37.520]   That seems like a natural thing for the Apple Watch to do.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:42.240]   I mean, I hate to think that a safety app is part of health, but a safety app is part
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:43.760]   of health these days.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:50.600]   According to Apple, the family setup is actually coming out very soon.
[01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:52.480]   So this is really good news.
[01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:57.760]   It does require an Apple Watch was cellular, which I'm going to give this to my mom.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.000]   It works with a 6s or later and the iOS 14.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   I'm giving this to my mom.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   This is great.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.080]   Yeah, that's fantastic.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:14.240]   I really do believe that the little things about Apple Watch that have those caring for
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:18.080]   someone else features on it, I think that's going to be great.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.840]   I think you're going to feel really good knowing that she's got that on her wrist.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:27.320]   Make sure she sets up you as a contact because if she falls, it'll contact you immediately
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.120]   and it will call emergency services.
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:33.080]   So that way, you're right on top of that.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.080]   You'll know what's going on.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:39.880]   So this in their press release optimization for older adults, WatchOS 7, which is, I guess,
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:46.600]   for Watch 4 or later, optimized feature for older adults, including fall detection and
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.280]   a regular rhythm notification.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:55.480]   There's also an extra large face that shows the time and a single rich complication, and
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:59.440]   there's an onboarding and configuration process designed with accessibility in mind.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:01.720]   I think this is fantastic.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:05.160]   There's a new health checklist in the health app.
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:09.160]   And I think I'm going to get my mom Fitness Plus because she did have somebody come over
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.840]   a couple of times a week to work out with her.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.520]   But of course, after COVID, she's really reluctant to do that.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:20.200]   So if I got her Fitness Plus and an Apple TV, she could also do that.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.880]   That's really great.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:22.880]   That's really great.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.880]   Available tomorrow.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:26.680]   There's upload, upload, update everything tomorrow.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.400]   Yeah, WatchOS 7 as well as we should mention iOS 14 and iPadOS 14.
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.120]   I'll come out September 16th.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.240]   So much to do this week.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.240]   Busy, busy, busy.
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.600]   All right.
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.120]   So that's the watch.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.680]   That's the watch SE.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.720]   That's WatchOS 7.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.960]   That's Apple 1.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:49.440]   Is there, have we done every?
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:50.960]   Have we covered everything?
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:54.120]   iPad 2020, the standard.
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.120]   All right.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.120]   Let's go.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.120]   Not that big of a deal, but that's next.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:02.560]   We'll do a little iPad stuff also coming up our picks of the week.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.560]   I don't know.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.560]   We warn you, Doc Rock.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.560]   I do.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.560]   I always ready.
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:07.560]   You got you got something for us.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.560]   Always ready.
[01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.560]   It involves spam at all.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:10.560]   Any kind of spam.
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.560]   Those spam, those spam.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.560]   Is that it?
[01:26:13.560 --> 01:26:18.960]   Is do you eat spam or is that just kind of a thing that we always think about Hawaiians?
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:19.960]   I love spam.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.560]   I was eating spam before I moved out here from the East Coast.
[01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:25.360]   Because ham was one of my favorite foods.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.040]   Back then, ham was expensive.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.040]   So the spam was good.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.720]   But I'm a military brat, so I think I was just on and ahead of the game.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:33.720]   I'll tell you.
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.960]   I'll tell you, when I smoke pork, but I feel like I'm making my own spam.
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:38.960]   Mmm.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.960]   It's so good right there.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.120]   Hey, I've been using that.
[01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:43.000]   I've been using that Traeger a lot, by the way.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.200]   I made a brisket.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.840]   Actually, I haven't used it in three weeks because of the fires.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.280]   Well, okay, so that was...
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.280]   We should mention...
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.880]   Well, we're on a little break.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   I should mention that Laurie talked me into buying this Traeger a few Mac break weeklies
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:01.440]   ago.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.760]   And I'm very glad I did.
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.560]   So I've made a couple of pork shoulders, pork butts for the pulled pork.
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.040]   Love that.
[01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.680]   That's going to kill me.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.160]   But I love it.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.480]   And I have made a couple of briskets.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:15.720]   I think I got brisket down.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.800]   I made brisket that John had some a couple of days ago.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.520]   Got up at three in the morning, smoked it all day.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.920]   It was incredible.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:30.520]   I followed the Aaron Franklin recipe, which evolves basically just salt and pepper.
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:31.520]   And it was incredible.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.560]   So I think I've got the brisket down.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:38.040]   And the problem is my next brisket is 16 pounds.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:43.040]   So Laurie, if you and your friend will come down and John and we're going to have the
[01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.440]   pruits, we'll all be social distanced, barbeque.
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.760]   It'll be so much fun.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.760]   Doc Rock, if you want to fly out, please.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.760]   Be my guest.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:53.120]   Oh, barbecue is my specialty.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.840]   The Traeger is kind of the kind of lazy guys barbecue because it's a pellet.
[01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.480]   So you don't have to sit there feeding the fire or anything.
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.640]   I mean, literally I got up at three and put it on and went to bed.
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   It's so pretty great.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:07.640]   It's so good.
[01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   Oh my God.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.640]   That brisket.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.840]   My barbecue required you to dig a hole in the ground.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.040]   Oh, you do that kind.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.040]   You do a whole pig.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:15.040]   That's how you do it.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:19.840]   You got to dig a hole in the ground throw some banana leaves.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:22.240]   Love that.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:32.360]   Actually, before another thing I forgot that we should cover is the iPod update yesterday.
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:34.200]   They got their update a little earlier.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:37.760]   We're all getting updated tomorrow with spatial audio.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:38.760]   Have you used it?
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:39.760]   Anybody?
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:42.640]   The new iPod Pro update.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.160]   I have it's in the beta though, right?
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.640]   It's not available to the public.
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:48.640]   Oh, it's in the beta.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:51.800]   I finally appeared in the beta so everyone will get it tomorrow.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.120]   So I didn't, I wasn't really sure.
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:01.480]   So the main phone that I use is not on the beta and I didn't want to update it on the
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.800]   beta phone and then have it work weird on the non-beta phone.
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:08.240]   So I decided not to mess with it because it's coming out tomorrow.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.080]   I think it's official.
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.080]   I think it's a...
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.080]   Yeah, it might be wrong.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:24.200]   Yeah, I think this is the version 3A283 firmware and it supposedly turns on spatial audio.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.200]   So there's a...
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:31.360]   You'll have to go into your settings to turn it on and then if you're watching Ted Lasso
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:35.920]   or something with a surround sound it'll do that.
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:36.920]   They do work...
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:37.920]   Oh, okay.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.400]   Here's the deal.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.320]   You're right.
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:46.320]   Even though they maybe pushed it out, you will need iOS 14 and watch iOS 7 and all of
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.560]   the new stuff first.
[01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:49.840]   To actually get the full effect of it, okay.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:50.840]   Yes.
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:54.640]   So the EarPods firmware update is rolling out, rolled out yesterday.
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.320]   You pair it to your phone or iPad, open the settings app, choose Bluetooth, look for your
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.320]   earpud connection.
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.320]   All right.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.880]   So it's not clear if that's a beta but it does require the next generation of iOS.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:10.240]   So even if it's not, you have to wait till tomorrow to play with it.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:14.800]   The new iPad nothing.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:22.080]   I think we mentioned 329, 299 for education, new chip, the new iPad Pro which is going to
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.840]   I think eat away.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.840]   I think...
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:33.480]   Really, when Apple said I was kind of stunned that the new iPad Air will have the 5 nanometer
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:39.960]   A14 chip, I thought that was a little bit of a strutting around saying take that.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:47.120]   Intel, because Intel's kind of still having trouble with 10 nanometers.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:49.000]   This is half as big.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:54.720]   So more efficient, less battery, more cores, more capabilities.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:31:00.840]   I mean, nobody's saying I don't think that the iPad is slow, any iPad is slow, but you
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.000]   can do more now.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.240]   I think that's the idea.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:11.520]   Do you think the Nvidia acquisition of ARM will make a difference to Apple?
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:12.520]   No.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:19.520]   It's not as though they have any strategic reason to limit their current agreement with Apple.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.400]   It works so well for them right now.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:25.240]   And there's nothing they can do really to stop Apple what Apple's doing.
[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.680]   So no, they're good.
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:33.720]   In fact, Apple's chips are just, they license the ARM architecture, but they're very, very
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.080]   custom.
[01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:38.640]   So there's no reason why that license would be terminated.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:42.320]   In fact, ARM, an Nvidia said, oh, no, we're going to keep everybody in England.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:45.880]   We're going to keep all the existing partnerships and licenses.
[01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:47.600]   So yeah, this wouldn't affect Apple.
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:54.360]   And honestly, I'm sure Apple has contingency plans and probably doesn't need ARM.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:32:01.400]   It's nice to say it's ARM compatible, but I doubt they need ARM at this point.
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:04.640]   What else?
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:05.960]   We mentioned family setup.
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:09.000]   I think we've covered everything, right?
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.920]   We mentioned the bundle.
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:16.560]   We haven't mentioned TikTok.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:21.280]   Looks like Oracle and Walmart apparently will be tech partners for TikTok.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:26.400]   If the US government allows it, Microsoft out of the deal that broke on Sunday.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:28.600]   So are grapes.
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:39.640]   How about the, how about all the, how about the customs seizing a whole bunch of perfectly
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.640]   legal earbuds?
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:41.640]   Yes.
[01:32:41.640 --> 01:32:45.600]   One plus buds because they, not only did they say, oh, because they thought that they were
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.880]   knockoffs of the, of the, of the AirPod pro.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:51.560]   But then after pointing out that, well, no, they are counterfeit.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.480]   They were stuck there.
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:56.600]   They stuck by their guns and doubled downs and well, doesn't matter that these are a third
[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:57.600]   part.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.600]   Oh, you're kidding.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.600]   It still looks the way too much about it.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:00.600]   They're down.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.440]   They are not backing down.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:05.120]   Oh my God.
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.200]   These are not counterfeit.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:10.920]   They don't, they don't look like airpods at all.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.960]   And I'm sure apples not asking them to do.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:16.960]   I hope, I would hope apples not asking them to do that.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.720]   I think they're trying, I think they're trying to save face here.
[01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:27.120]   I mean, as, and these, and these weren't like these, it's not as though these were like
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:30.280]   thrown into a vacuum, just vacuum pack and a bulk display.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:34.240]   This was properly packaged properly, properly tagged.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.880]   You can see the one plus logo on them.
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.920]   This was, this was just a clowny sort of behavior.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:52.240]   One plus this tweet in response to the border patrol was, Hey, give those back.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.720]   A spokesperson provided tech crunch with this statement upon examining the shipment in
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:02.360]   question, a customs and border patrol import specialist determined that the subject earbuds
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.400]   appear to violate apples configuration trademark.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:10.600]   Apples configuration trademarks on their brands of earbuds and has recorded those trademarks
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:16.080]   with a CPB CBP based on that determination.
[01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:22.600]   Officers have seized the shipment under 19 USC 1526E unrelated to images or language in
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:27.240]   the box a company does not have to put an Apple word market design to violate those trademarks.
[01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:33.720]   In other words, they don't have to be impersonating earpods to be considered counterfeit.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.640]   The importer will have many opportunities through the adjudication process to provide
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:43.760]   evidence that their product does not violate the relevant recorded trademarks.
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:49.440]   And now I have apples thinking, God, where were you guys when we were trying to sue Samsung
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.440]   about the iPhone?
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.800]   I don't know.
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:56.000]   And what weight does this look like in air pods?
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.640]   They're white?
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:00.600]   The part that sticks in here.
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:01.600]   That's it.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.600]   They're white and I was dim.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.760]   But it's silly.
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:07.760]   What plus?
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:14.280]   What one plus seems to have made sure that we're going to put extra markings and extra decorations
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.880]   on part of the stem to distinguish it from it.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.280]   The case doesn't look the same.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:24.440]   I mean, it's it's no joke that if air pods had never existed, I don't think that one
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.680]   plus would have come up with this design.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:27.680]   Well, that's true.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:33.000]   But it's just but it's distinct enough that you kind of have to say, well, whatever.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.720]   It looks like those roman therapy things that you were supposed to like take a hit to make
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:38.720]   you not hungry.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:39.720]   I don't remember.
[01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:40.720]   I don't.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:41.720]   Did it work?
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:42.720]   Well, no, honey, anymore.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:43.720]   I don't know.
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:44.720]   I'm going to work.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:47.960]   Well, actually the the air.
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.000]   The air pods do smell like blueberries.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.640]   So maybe maybe there is something to that about the snow.
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:59.840]   You've got to be apparently Apple one may also be available on Android.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:00.840]   That's interesting.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:01.840]   Huh.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:02.920]   That is interesting.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:06.360]   Well, we'll keep an eye on that one.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.360]   All right.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.360]   Next.
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.560]   No, let's just say that that's that's the first time I ever thought of that that there
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:16.560]   are and having an Android phone does not preclude you from having an Apple TV.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:18.440]   It doesn't preclude you from having Apple TV.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.960]   Plus you can have Apple music on the device.
[01:36:21.960 --> 01:36:27.280]   I don't think they said that Apple fitness necessarily requires you to have it's enhanced
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:30.800]   by having a having an Apple watch, but it doesn't require it.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:31.800]   That's interesting.
[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:35.240]   Yeah, it would have to be a different bundle, obviously, because you're not going to want
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.240]   iCloud storage.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.000]   There's, you know, but interesting.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:40.000]   All right.
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.520]   It's time next for our picks of the week.
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:45.720]   Doc Rock, our guest today.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.320]   I think you should start the picks of the week this week.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.800]   What do you got for us?
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:50.800]   Okay.
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:54.560]   So I bought the new 27 inch iMac.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.560]   Nice.
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:00.600]   The configuration of choice, just because of the way Apple does things is to get it with
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:03.400]   a 512 drive, which is kind of insane.
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:11.800]   It seems kind of small, but going back to USB C being a world of hurt, I often have to
[01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:18.320]   remind people those USB C shaped things on the side of your MacBooks and your MacBook
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:20.720]   Pros are Thunderbolt ports.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.520]   They are better and faster.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:23.520]   Yes.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:24.680]   And that confuses folks.
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:30.680]   So when you go to look for something like an external, this is a Sabron Extreme New Drive
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.680]   Game Q.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:32.680]   Nice.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:39.200]   This guy on the Thunderbolt side of things will actually push almost 3000 megabytes per
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:44.000]   second data transfer rate, which is actually faster than the internal drive that comes
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.000]   with the Apple.
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000]   Wow.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.560]   This two terabyte monster here is 350, 320 on set.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:57.880]   If you were to do the one terabyte bump inside, Apple's configurator, it would have cost you
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:37:59.520]   like 200 bucks.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:07.400]   So it was, you get an extra 512 for 200 or you get an extra 1.5 for 250.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:09.600]   I mean, you know, this is a better deal.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.600]   Okay.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:16.920]   So when you are forced to use it in USB C mode, it's still almost 1000 megabytes per
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:19.920]   second, which is again, insanely quick.
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.840]   It's like, you know, a T5 level, you know, quick.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:30.560]   So for portable drive, that's fast as all get comes with great heat management built
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.560]   in in order to maintain those three, those speeds, because that's how MV and E drives
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.720]   work.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:43.240]   It comes in a case, a metal case and they give you a rubber silicon, not to be confused
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:46.200]   with silicon protector.
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:49.920]   So you can turn it into like a LSE drive and make it safe.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:56.300]   So for a travel drive or just a desktop drive of speed, if you can feel comfortable buying
[01:38:56.300 --> 01:39:02.520]   your match with less built in hard drive and get the Sabarin extreme cue to give it that
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.120]   space that you really require.
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:05.240]   And it doesn't weigh anything.
[01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.520]   So it's super nice.
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:08.520]   I think that's excellent advice.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.760]   Thunderbolt 3 is so fast.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.920]   It is just like an internal drive.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:15.040]   There's also an advantage because it's not internal.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:20.600]   So if it fails or something, you can get another one or have multiple drives externally.
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:26.920]   Anybody would say like an IMAC 2 2017 or or something, whatever it 20, yeah, 2015 came
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:27.920]   with Thunderbolt 3.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:32.720]   So any IMAC with a Thunderbolt 3 connector that say maybe has that failing fusion drives
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:38.000]   because they just do that, just get a really fast external one of these.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.840]   Don't think about cracking up in your screen because it's a pain in the back.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.640]   Oh, no, no, I did it once.
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:44.280]   You're a giant suction cup.
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.680]   You definitely don't want to get in there.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:48.680]   I did the same thing.
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:54.200]   I bought an external drive from other world computing to put SSDs in it.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:58.000]   So it is absolutely as fast as the internal drive probably faster and it's bigger.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   It's four terabytes.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000]   It's nice.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.600]   It's really nice to have that.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:07.680]   Plus, when I do, I'm actually going to probably when a big sur comes out, start over, I think
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:12.120]   we were talking about this Lorry on Sunday and wipe everything, but that all my data,
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:14.400]   my home folder in fact, is on an external drive.
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:17.280]   So I just done, you know, it would be completely separate.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:24.640]   I'll actually unplug it during the install, wipe the drive install and then move my, it's
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:27.680]   easy to do by the way in the users and groups section.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:30.920]   You right click on your name, you select advanced and you can make your home directory
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.760]   be anywhere, including that external drive.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.760]   So that's what I do.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:35.760]   Well, one tip.
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:37.280]   Here's a tip I learned.
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:41.560]   If you're going to do that, don't just copy the contents of your home folder over.
[01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:47.000]   You'll be missing a lot of stuff, including your entire local library, which means all
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.960]   your settings will have to be reset and everything.
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:54.560]   So do an R-Sync or, you know, some sort of high quality copy to make sure that you've
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.320]   actually duplicated your home folder instead of just what doing what I did, which was
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:01.080]   dumb, which is drag it over.
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:03.280]   I got all the data, but I didn't get the library folder.
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.040]   I didn't get a lot of the settings stuff that I needed.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.960]   So I had to go back to scratch and start all over.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:10.240]   Do you have an affiliate link?
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:13.800]   Arthur wants to know Doc Rock if he can support you.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800]   Kit.co/docrock.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.800]   K-I-T.
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:20.000]   Yes, you know, I put everything there and also amazon.com/shop/docrock.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.000]   Nice.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:29.240]   I'm going to be streaming these.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:30.240]   Just kind of things.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:34.520]   Amazon just created a new thing, Amazon Creator Live, where you can actually do your unboxings
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:39.280]   and your explainers and stuff directly on Amazon because, you know, YouTube can be wishy-washy
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.000]   about links at times.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.520]   So I think that's a cool new setup.
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.160]   I just did get that going.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:46.920]   So I will be doing an Amazon show of products.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:54.320]   And to answer the other question, this is a combination of QLC and SLC.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:57.120]   I know the caveats of QLC.
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.120]   I went into that with that in mind.
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:04.880]   But yeah, you can get them as MLC, but just going to cost you a lot.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:05.880]   Right.
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:09.480]   That's actually why I got the other world computing enclosure because it's enclosure only.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.640]   And then you could put your own M.2 cards in it.
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:14.200]   And I just bought a bunch of Samsung EVOs.
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:18.240]   It's a little more pricey that way, but at least I know that they're high quality.
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:23.680]   There is a new OWC coming out called an OWC Envoy Plus.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.680]   It wasn't ready.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:26.480]   Otherwise, that's what I would have got.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:29.800]   Because I prefer everything OWC when possible.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:36.480]   And with that Envoy Plus, it will be, I think, MLC or SLC drive.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.560]   So yeah, it'll be a little bit more pricey, but that'll be the more Garren's, Ball Barren's
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:41.560]   Wood.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.960]   As we say, bingo, bingo, pickle, bingo.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.120]   Now you're making me hungry.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:49.800]   I've never seen this kit thing.
[01:42:49.800 --> 01:42:50.800]   This is kind of cool.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.800]   Kit.co.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:54.000]   You said a long time ago, Leo.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.280]   This is right up your alley, brother.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:57.160]   I could have made some money, man.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:58.160]   Geez.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.520]   So this is an affiliate link, basically.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:03.440]   You create your own page as a creator.
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:06.200]   And then they give you a cutter.
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.840]   You just link through to Amazon.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:08.840]   It's just linked through to Amazon.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:12.800]   I don't know how Kit plans on making money yet, but you know how to start up.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.280]   They don't care about that right away.
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:16.480]   Yeah, they need users, not money.
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.640]   Kit.co/docrock.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:23.120]   And yes, you're that very nice.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:28.200]   Sam Rhett is right there, the XTRM-Q.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:31.520]   From DocRoc's kit, man.
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:33.440]   Laurie Gill, what should I buy this week?
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.920]   I already got a grill.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:35.920]   Don't get me going.
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.720]   Don't get me starting.
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:45.760]   You actually, you inspired me to put my request this week is the YouTube channel.
[01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:46.760]   Hey, grill.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.520]   Hey, they actually have a website too.
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:52.640]   So it's hey grill, hey.com if you just want to read their recipes.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:59.680]   But this YouTube channel, it is just all about grilling recipes and smoking recipes.
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:04.240]   And what I love about them is they're very easy to understand.
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:09.840]   I use these videos all the time to help me if I'm grilling something or if I'm smoking
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:14.120]   something, I don't understand exactly how I'm supposed to do it.
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.440]   They're really easy, really fun, really great videos.
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:20.440]   And every recipe I've used from hey grill, hey, has been delicious.
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:21.440]   So.
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.440]   Ooh, look at that.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:23.440]   Look at that.
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.440]   That is a nice brisket.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:27.720]   That is a sweet, sweet brisket.
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:30.720]   Hey grill, hey, on YouTube.
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:32.480]   Okay, Doki.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.960]   That, this is good.
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:35.280]   This didn't cost me anything.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.280]   Right.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:37.280]   You're good.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.520]   It's to support the thing that did cost you a fortune.
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:42.280]   Yeah, you know.
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:45.600]   Then this way I get to kill myself faster by eating a lot of barbecue.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.480]   So it's a win all around.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:51.400]   Andy and I go here pick of the week.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:56.160]   The mine is a Bluetooth adapter that I bought for my stereo system.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:45:04.480]   I've been disheartened by how weirdly all these different like high end sort of here's
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.480]   here's air plate.
[01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:06.480]   Here's how that works.
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.680]   Here's Chromecast, here's how that works.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.840]   A lot of them are really conditional.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:14.600]   I really just want to be able to just I want high fidelity, high resolution, really easy
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:20.400]   to connect Bluetooth to like the really good stereo that's in my living room.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:24.160]   And when I first started looking, there's like a thousand really cheap pieces of junk,
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:29.240]   like $20 things that barely work and they don't have any really good inputs.
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:33.680]   But I did find this device by company I'd never heard of.
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.760]   So there was a certain amount of trepidation, blue Dental.
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:42.400]   And I bought the their model, the BLT dash HD because it had all the features that I
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:50.240]   was looking for, including Bluetooth 5.0, aptX HD with so it can actually handle like
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:54.160]   HD audio from from my server.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:01.200]   It has a bit rates up to excuse me data resolution up to 32 bits.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:05.680]   The other cool thing is that it has a little bit of a little stubby external antenna.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:08.040]   So it works throughout the entire house.
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:09.760]   Also the not a connectors that it has.
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:14.680]   So it will work with analog RCA jacks, but it also has two different kinds of digital
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:17.360]   input digital ports also.
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:21.080]   So no matter what you want to connect to it, you can no matter how you want to connect
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:25.800]   it to your receiver, you can find a way to do that.
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:27.480]   And I'm very, very happy with the sound quality.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:32.960]   I will recognize that Bluetooth no matter even if this is again, the latest chipset,
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:35.280]   the latest features, all the things that you want to see.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:39.280]   It will never be as good as electrons through copper wire, but it for everything that I
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:42.880]   want to do, which is simply I've got something or an app on my phone.
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.560]   I want to pump it through this really, this really, really good receiver.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:52.320]   In my case, this is the receiver that I bought like in 1990, 1991, not a college that for
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.880]   some reason I've got a bug in my ear to set it up again.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:59.640]   Anyway, it really does the job without any of the confusion about, oh, what Wi-Fi network
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.640]   am I on right now?
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:05.560]   Oh, am I abusing this throughout a different sort of device?
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:06.560]   Works great.
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:12.040]   Now the only weird thing that I should point out is that the prices on this are so variable.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:19.040]   If you go to Amazon right now, it's 120 bucks, I think is and you're buying it directly from
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.760]   sold by Blue Dental.
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:25.040]   If you go to their eBay store, it's 80 bucks.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.240]   You do have to wait for it to ship from China.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:34.760]   But when I bought it, there was also a 80 bucks or make an offer and they accepted an offer
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:35.760]   of $65.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:36.760]   Oh, geez.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:43.880]   So that's what I have to say, there was a certain amount of trepidation about, wow, $118, but
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:46.360]   we'll take $65, really?
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:50.200]   For a brand new unit that doesn't have spyware built into it.
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:54.760]   It only took like two weeks to ship from China, so I was willing to save all that money.
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:56.680]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:58.800]   It powers from micro USB.
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:04.640]   Obviously, you don't get the micro USB charger with a darn.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:11.200]   The next level above this are like $200, $300, and there's no way I was interested in spending
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:12.400]   anywhere near that money.
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:17.720]   I was looking for something better than cheap piece of crap, but something less than.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:24.840]   Let me tell you about how I'm using interconnects to isolate my cable runs from the carpet.
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:28.880]   Like, no, I just really, I just want to be able to stream things for my phone without
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:32.360]   having to again go through intermediaries.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:33.360]   Do you think, Fred?
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:38.800]   So this is app to XHD, which is the latest Bluetooth, you know, hi-fi codec.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.720]   Do you think that's as good as AirPlay 2?
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:46.120]   You're getting into the, I think that you're getting into this situation where I can't
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:50.800]   tell the difference unless I do a really intense AB sort of comparison.
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:56.240]   And it depends, and also it's going to depend on how was this original file mastered?
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.560]   Like was it, is it, like if you're, if you're trying to compare like the original version
[01:49:00.560 --> 01:49:03.920]   of the Beatles, Abbey Road album, you're probably not going to tell the difference.
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:09.680]   If you compare it to the recently completely remixed and remastered version from a couple
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:12.680]   of years ago, maybe you can.
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:17.200]   But for me, I think that it's, at this point, so long as you're getting a high resolution
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:23.000]   source, the difference is so slim that it might just come down to what kind of speakers
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.960]   do you have, where you have them placed in the room.
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:29.840]   And as always, it comes down to how much fuss you're willing to put up with, how much money
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:31.120]   are you willing to spend?
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.120]   I can say that this solved a very good problem for me because every other solution for how
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:41.880]   do I get Bluetooth going on this receiver, given that my actual like modern receiver,
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:43.960]   quote, modern is like eight years old.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:48.640]   So it doesn't have like the modern HD Bluetooth, Bluetooth codecs.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:51.240]   It's the best, it's a really good, comfortable solution.
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:54.120]   It's a little bit of, a little bit of money, but not too much money.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:57.400]   You can, the amount of convenience that it adds, the amount of quality that it adds for
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:02.640]   me is worth the 60 to 80, maybe even the $120.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:04.960]   And it was more, it was more like an act.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:09.800]   I will also say that at least 3% of this purchase was an active defiance after saying, wait a
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:14.520]   minute, are you saying there's absolutely, there's such a little desire to like add Bluetooth
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:19.400]   to your, to an arbitrary receiver, an arbitrary source that all I can get are stuff that was
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:24.040]   made like eight or nine years ago by the same OEM and just keeps getting re-stickered.
[01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:27.360]   And for 20 to $21 damn you, I will spend more money.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:30.640]   To get something that actually works, ha ha, and take that.
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:33.840]   The reason I'm asking is, I finally gave up on Sonos.
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:39.080]   You know, I have older Sonos and newer Sonos, which means I had to have the original Sonos
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:41.720]   app and the new Sonos app on my phone.
[01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:46.040]   And I could only play to, basically I had two Sonos networks.
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:51.240]   So I finally took all the old Sonos play fives out, which is about five of them plus
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:54.680]   two Sonos connects that go into my stereo system.
[01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:58.360]   So now I only need to use one app with all the modern Sonos stuff because I have some
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:50:59.560]   modern stuff.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:03.680]   But I want, and I want to replace the Sonos connect on my stereo.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:08.480]   The Sonos charge is like 300 bucks for their connect, which is insane.
[01:51:08.480 --> 01:51:13.360]   So I want some way to play music to the stereo.
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:15.960]   And so I'm looking at different solutions around that.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:17.440]   So this might be a good one.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:24.120]   Yeah, again, one of the big stop gaps for me was the fact that whenever I tried to use
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:29.560]   a more sophisticated solution like AirPlay or like Chromecast, even have a nice little
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:35.800]   dongle that works that a Chromecast audio that's just for audio, that should be exactly
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:36.800]   the thing.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:40.360]   But the number of times where I would just like to light up my phone or light up my tablet
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:46.560]   and it can't find it on the network because my AV setup is on a different network than
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:49.440]   I've got my mobile devices on.
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:53.400]   Or for some reason, it just wouldn't, everything seems to be going okay, but it just won't
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:54.400]   show up.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:52:00.840]   If this is a lot more reliable for me, it gives me line level inputs and it solves the
[01:52:00.840 --> 01:52:01.840]   problem.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:06.840]   Sometimes I don't, the biggest, the biggest annoyance of technology for me is that I'm
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:11.960]   always just sort of like a little gun shy every time I try to do anything because, is
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:14.760]   this going to be one of those things where I push a button and it works?
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:18.840]   Or is it the thing where I push the button and get enough data that can start troubleshooting?
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:22.560]   Because I really just want to continue to listen to this podcast that I was listening
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:27.880]   to without having to switch to the audio server, without having to switch to my TV box.
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:33.880]   I just want to simply say I came in, I put away the groceries, I want to disconnect from
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:38.040]   my Bluetooth headphones and connect to these speakers and continue to listen to the story.
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:41.600]   And it's the simplest, for me, it was the simplest solution to solve that particular
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:42.600]   problem.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:48.000]   My only question is whether I'm so nervous about Bluetooth, but at least it's reliable
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.520]   and it doesn't drop and it doesn't do all those things that brightens your buds do.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.120]   But I want to make sure the quality is good.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:58.080]   Bluetooth seems a little compressed to me, but I haven't listened to Appdex HD the latest.
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:01.240]   So you'll enjoy the difference.
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:07.920]   But I should mention that my speakers are your basic $400 pair of Elac books, bookshelves
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.920]   and things are good.
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:09.920]   Those are good speakers.
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:11.600]   Oh, they're great.
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:17.280]   And I keep thinking about replacing them, but every time I see something that, every time
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:22.000]   I look for something that might be sound better than those, we're talking $8,000 and $1,000
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.760]   and that's more money that I want to spend for a little bit better sound.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:27.320]   Now those are really excellent.
[01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:35.200]   There's a bunch of good app deck Bluetooth sort of contraptions you can get on Amazon.
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:38.000]   And so yeah, I think that might be the next big play.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.880]   Because that's always been the problem for me, especially when you jump from Audible.
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:46.640]   Like Audible on my iPhone, when I say, okay, I'm done, I go in a house and then I tell
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.120]   the hey lady, hey, hey girl, can you play my book?
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:53.680]   And she backs up and I was like, that's not where I was at.
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:56.120]   Like, give it a chance to link up.
[01:53:56.120 --> 01:54:00.440]   And right now Audible Plus or whatever they came on with this thing, they give it to all
[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:04.960]   of us subscribers and they added a bunch of really cool content.
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:05.960]   I know.
[01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:06.960]   I know.
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.360]   And it's so killer.
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:13.600]   And but it never finds my spot when I tell A-Lady to put it where S-Lady was listening.
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:14.600]   A-Lady, that's dumb.
[01:54:14.600 --> 01:54:16.600]   You got to catch up A-Lady.
[01:54:16.600 --> 01:54:18.000]   Yeah, it's your product.
[01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000]   You owe it.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:20.000]   You should know it a time.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.960]   I do that all the time because I have a bunch of Echo speakers and I listen to that all
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:24.960]   the time.
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:28.840]   The reason I don't feel like I need Sonos anymore is everything does good quality multi-room
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:31.880]   sound now, which used to be the only Sonos did it.
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:32.880]   Now everything does it.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.920]   I don't, you know, A-Lady does it.
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:35.920]   G-Guy does it.
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:36.920]   G-Boy.
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:43.520]   If you get a chance to go check audio quests, back where my family had our store, we used
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:48.520]   to sell audio quests equipment.
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:53.520]   They make a really cool deck called the Dragonfly.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:55.520]   Dragonflies are excellent decks.
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:58.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:54:59.520]   So see the gray box right there?
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:00.520]   I have to get the name of it.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:01.520]   That's the one that goes through your receiver.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:02.520]   Oh, okay.
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:03.520]   It's right underneath the big picture.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:04.520]   Yeah, the Niagara.
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:05.520]   Niagara fall.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:07.760]   Oh, no, that's a power conditioner.
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:08.760]   That's not it.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:10.960]   Oh, no, but they do have a box.
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:12.960]   You can plug it.
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:17.480]   We used to sell audio quest cables and all that, you know, for the higher profile stuff.
[01:55:17.480 --> 01:55:19.280]   But there's so much good budget.
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:20.280]   Fine.
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.360]   Now is what I call it because, you know, like I sold Maranson, BMW speakers, my dad builds
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:26.360]   custom two bags.
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:27.360]   My meat.
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:29.400]   Like I saw high audio forever.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.240]   My brother and I.
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:33.920]   So I don't like a lot of the off the shelf, best buy stuff.
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:36.040]   So I was always looking for cool things.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:41.240]   Like probably the first deck I ever owned, my dad built it, you know, so looking for this
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:46.440]   budget five stuff that's coming out, including these really cheap $20 in your monitors that
[01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:50.160]   I got that sound quite incredible.
[01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:51.160]   It's amazing.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:53.200]   So I talk a lot about budget five stuff on my channel.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:55.800]   Oh, I'm going to watch more Doc Rock now.
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.440]   You're going to get me to spend more money.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:01.360]   Those blue dents do have a burr Brown deck in it, which is nice.
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:05.640]   Although it's since you're most of the time you'll be taking analog out here.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:06.880]   I mean digital audio out.
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:08.200]   You won't be using the burr Brown.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:11.960]   But I guess if you take analog out, if you powered some speakers with it, that would
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.720]   actually be a good way to do it.
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:18.560]   My pick of the week is something new from Zapier, longtime sponsor on the network.
[01:56:18.560 --> 01:56:20.760]   But they didn't tell me about this.
[01:56:20.760 --> 01:56:26.480]   And actually, I think they developed this in house because they were looking for ways
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:31.400]   to developers who are working remotely to share screenshots and screen captures, things
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:32.400]   like that.
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.400]   It's free.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:34.800]   It's called Zappy.
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:43.240]   It's a screen capture, both stills and movies app that sits in your menu bar.
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:50.000]   And it lets you share screenshots, but also do animated GIFs and movie recordings of
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:51.640]   whatever's going on your screen.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:54.400]   You pick this part of the screen you want.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:55.840]   You can annotate it.
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:58.600]   You can record what's going on.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:04.960]   And as I said, I think they developed this as an in-house tool because they're giving
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:05.960]   it away.
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:11.680]   Ultimately, it'll probably be part of the paid Zapier account.
[01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:14.840]   I already have a paid Zapier account, so I'll get this.
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:19.320]   It will actually store your captures in their cloud and give you a shareable URL on your
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:22.000]   clipboard, which really makes it easy.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.080]   So if it ever comes up, I'm sure it does for a lot of you that you want to share a screenshot
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:32.000]   or even more useful, a video of here's here, mom.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000]   Here's the menu.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.920]   You click this, you do that, you press that button and just send that video along.
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:38.520]   I think that's really cool.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.760]   So I thought I mentioned this is free right now from Zapier.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:44.720]   It's zappy-er-z-a-p-i-e-r.com/zappy.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:51.320]   And I actually have been using it for all my screenshots because it's a nice, easy,
[01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:52.320]   simple solution.
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:54.640]   What are you laughing at?
[01:57:54.640 --> 01:57:59.440]   The last one, they said, "Don't recommend this to Chris Evans, though."
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:06.720]   Screenshots, they can reach out and bite you and that could hurt.
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.920]   Sorry, I just got it.
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:13.600]   That was really funny coming.
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:14.600]   That is Doc Rock.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:20.160]   My friends follow them on YouTube, youtube.com/doc/rock.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.680]   Where was your family's store?
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:22.680]   Was it in Boston?
[01:58:22.680 --> 01:58:23.680]   No, no, I hear.
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:24.680]   Oh, it's in the White.
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:25.680]   Oh, it's in the White.
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.680]   Oh, okay.
[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:30.160]   When I moved to Hawaii, I was adopted by a family because that's what people do.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:33.760]   And I basically did with them for the last 30 plus years.
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:34.760]   Oh, nice.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:35.760]   Oh, nice.
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:36.760]   I didn't realize it was in Hawaii.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:37.760]   That's great.
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.960]   We're in the East Coast, where are you from originally?
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:42.480]   You're going to laugh.
[01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.480]   DC in New York, which is wise for what you're doing.
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:46.080]   Why you wear Red Sox hat, of course.
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:47.880]   That makes perfect sense.
[01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:48.880]   Stanny Yankees.
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:49.880]   Whatsoever can't.
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:50.880]   Stanny Yankees.
[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:51.880]   Medsock.
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:53.680]   You are definitely a Red Sox.
[01:58:53.680 --> 01:58:55.320]   You're in the Red Sox family.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:56.320]   This show.
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:57.320]   I was in the Red Sox nation.
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:58:58.320]   Carcary and Wim.
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:00.800]   Somebody said this show has way too many Red Sox fans on it.
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:01.880]   I grew up in Providence.
[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:03.800]   And of course, Andy is a local.
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:08.680]   So I figure the Bose Sox, they got our hearts.
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:09.680]   I almost.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:11.200]   There's a picture of Big Poppy staring at me.
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:12.200]   He's really great.
[01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:13.880]   He looks at me all day every day.
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.120]   Poppy is the greatest.
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:16.800]   Although I'm a Carl Jostremsky guy.
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:19.080]   I go back a few years.
[01:59:19.080 --> 01:59:21.080]   There you go.
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:22.080]   Long before.
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:23.080]   S-T-R-Z-E-M-S-K-I.
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:24.080]   That is the.
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:25.080]   No, it's not a spell.
[01:59:25.080 --> 01:59:26.080]   Maybe.
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:28.080]   You know what I'm going to spell?
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:29.080]   Carl Jostremsky.
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:30.080]   You're in the club.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:31.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:32.080]   My surname is Boyd.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:35.280]   And so Uncle Dennis probably had a lot to do it in as well.
[01:59:35.280 --> 01:59:36.280]   Nice.
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:37.880]   Very nice.
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:38.880]   That's Andy Naco.
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:41.360]   When are you going to be on GBH?
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:47.400]   Friday at one tune in online stream at Live or Later at WGBH News.org or if you've got
[01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:50.480]   your if you've got your terrestrial FM radio ready.
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:53.080]   So FM 89.7 on your dial.
[01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:54.600]   Yes, you say it like that.
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:56.040]   That's beautiful.
[01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.040]   And Lori Gill who was fabulous.
[01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:59.880]   If you haven't listened to Twit yet, really great on Twitter.
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:00.880]   It was so nice to have you.
[02:00:00.880 --> 02:00:01.880]   Oh, thank you.
[02:00:01.880 --> 02:00:02.880]   Please come back.
[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.280]   And of course, I know you're going to be back next week.
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:05.800]   You better be back next week.
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:11.280]   I'm hoping Renee will also come back and share with us the benefits of his great learnings
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:14.760]   from the briefings that I was not invited to.
[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:18.000]   So you got the invite to Andy?
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:23.160]   I received an invite and then I emailed back and say, okay, great.
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:26.000]   I'll be there and then got like within an hour later.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.720]   Oh, please just regard that invite.
[02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:29.720]   Please disregard.
[02:00:29.720 --> 02:00:30.720]   You're not that important.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:31.720]   It happened.
[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:33.720]   You're not invited.
[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:36.880]   Well, no hard feelings.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:37.880]   It happened.
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:38.880]   It wasn't a real invite.
[02:00:38.880 --> 02:00:39.880]   So that's the thing.
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:40.880]   And Lori, you got one.
[02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:41.880]   Did you get one too?
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:42.880]   I did.
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:43.880]   I did.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:44.880]   I immediately.
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:47.960]   So the invite said, come join us for your.
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:48.960]   Apple briefing.
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:49.960]   Briefing.
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:53.840]   But that exact wording, which makes you think this is more important.
[02:00:53.840 --> 02:00:54.840]   Yeah.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:58.880]   And then the link below the briefing was just the link to the stream and the time of the
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:01.680]   stream.
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:02.680]   But I didn't see that.
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:07.560]   All I saw was the email saying, please disregard the earlier message.
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:10.400]   At which point I went back to my mailbox and started looking through it.
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:15.800]   And I did in fact get an invitation to watch the stream as well as a non-existent briefing.
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:16.960]   I guess a lot of people.
[02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:18.720]   I sent an email to Renee.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:24.120]   Renee, this seems like I'm still on Apple's poop list, right?
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:25.840]   This doesn't seem like a real invite.
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:30.680]   And he said, no, everybody got that.
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:33.360]   Don't get your hopes up, La Porte.
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:37.280]   They decided to be me to everybody this year.
[02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:38.280]   It was actually pretty funny.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:41.240]   We all got the invitation to a non-existent briefing.
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:43.080]   Except we got the briefing.
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:45.800]   Here you go.
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:49.320]   If I buy this $1,500 trigger.
[02:01:49.320 --> 02:01:51.400]   Oh, no.
[02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.240]   Your name is going to be Lori Grill.
[02:01:53.240 --> 02:01:54.240]   Oh, no.
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:57.000]   I'm going to just change it.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.160]   Make sure to use Lori's kit.co link.
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:01.240]   Yeah, I wish I had one.
[02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:03.440]   I'd be making so much money off these triggers.
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:09.200]   So Lori told me, and I think she's right, if you're going to get a doc, get the Wi-Fi
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:16.200]   wire version.
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:20.200]   So you can turn on the grill, set the temperature.
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:25.400]   It starts itself because it's pellet, and you just go back to sleep.
[02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:29.280]   The only thing that you can't do is to have the meat put on for you.
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:35.840]   You actually have to go out and eat on the coffee for yourself.
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:42.360]   And then it has a probe, which you put in, and it beeps you on your phone when it's done.
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:43.360]   It's like--
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:46.600]   You can go grocery shopping while your meat is smoking.
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:47.600]   It's so amazing.
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:48.600]   It's so awesome.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:49.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:50.600]   It is so awesome.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:51.600]   You guys stop.
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.600]   Just stop.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:55.080]   You don't have to-- just, what did I get?
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:57.120]   The 750 Pro, I think, is what you got, Lori.
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:02:58.120]   Right?
[02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:59.120]   That's the one we got.
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:02.800]   Which I think is-- was that when 900 or 1000?
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:04.480]   Yeah, it wasn't 15.
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:05.480]   I think they're all in.
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:11.880]   It was a little more than an apple watch.
[02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:14.480]   I was looking at the 850 Timberline pellet.
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:16.600]   Oh, the Timberline's nice.
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:18.400]   With Wifry.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:19.400]   Wifire.
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:20.400]   I know.
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:21.400]   It looks like--
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:26.240]   Now, the Timberline has the super smoker.
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:29.640]   But I've read around and said, you don't need the super smoke.
[02:03:29.640 --> 02:03:30.640]   OK.
[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:32.800]   It makes it really smoky at the beginning.
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:35.440]   What's weird is it's not super smoky, is it, Lori?
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:41.680]   No, I haven't tried any recipes that-- where you use the really reduced smoke, though.
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:44.080]   So everything I've done has been 250.
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:45.080]   Yeah.
[02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:48.560]   So I'm thinking maybe if I did it closer to 150, maybe I'd get a little more smoke out
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:49.560]   of it.
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:03:50.560]   But I haven't seen it really, really smoky.
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:53.440]   And you have to order the pellets because they don't come with the grill.
[02:03:53.440 --> 02:03:55.680]   If you get that, Doc, you've got to get the pellets, too.
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:58.760]   Otherwise, you'll be sitting looking at a grill and you can't do anything with it.
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:03:59.760]   That's frustrating.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:01.000]   I can make my own pellets.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:02.840]   No, not that kind of pellets.
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:03.840]   You really don't want to--
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:06.080]   You really don't want to use those.
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:07.840]   You don't want to smoke your meat with those pellets.
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:11.280]   In fact, they very clear, don't use the pellets for a pellet stove.
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:14.920]   You've got to use the special pellets that are non-toxic.
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:19.360]   But Lori, it's funny that you said you didn't want to do any smoking during the fires.
[02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:21.240]   At first, I thought, oh, yeah, it's too smoky.
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:23.880]   I don't want to do any-- and then I thought, well, wait a minute.
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:24.960]   I'm smoking the meat.
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:27.400]   A little extra smoke isn't going to hurt.
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:28.400]   Yeah.
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:30.640]   No, I just mean-- I just don't want to go outside.
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:32.640]   It's just gross out there.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:35.000]   Even though you're not babysitting the grill or anything.
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:36.000]   I don't want to sit with it.
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:40.240]   But I just think of it as being something that you do as part of your outdoor activity
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.240]   of you.
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.640]   You're supposed to sit there and tend to fire and drink beer and--
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:44.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:45.640]   Yeah.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:49.120]   Aaron Franklin even says, be careful, because if you pass out, you might miss the point
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:50.120]   of perfection.
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:52.560]   So careful on the beer.
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:57.360]   He says, you might want to switch to water after the first 10 or 15 hours.
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:01.640]   I want to thank all of you because I was going to have a very, very sensible dinner
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:02.640]   out of my fridge tonight.
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:06.720]   But now I have to go out and get a takeout burger for the good place that makes the good
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:07.720]   grilled burgers.
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:11.360]   Oh, and this is just-- this is just-- I can't deal with this.
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:16.920]   I can't wait till quarantine is over and I can come out, visit my mom, and go to a diner
[02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:17.920]   with you.
[02:05:17.920 --> 02:05:18.920]   Yes.
[02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:20.920]   You prefer breakfast, lunch, or dinner in the diner?
[02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:22.360]   What do you-- what do you--
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:24.120]   Diners are breakfast.
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:25.120]   Yeah.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:30.560]   There are other places you can get good meat and good burgers, especially-- my neighborhood
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:33.800]   has no fewer than four restaurants that make their own clam chowder.
[02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:34.800]   Oh.
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:37.240]   So we could do it like a sort of a chowder fest.
[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:38.240]   I love chowder.
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:39.240]   You know.
[02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:46.720]   My mom, the last time I visited her, there's a clam-- what do you call them?
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:47.720]   Clam fritters.
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:48.720]   Clam cakes.
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:53.360]   There's a clam cake place in Providence that's kind of new veil clam cakes.
[02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:56.760]   It's the clam cakes I ever had in my life.
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:57.760]   Oh.
[02:05:57.760 --> 02:06:03.200]   Why load yourself up with fats and oils when you can also load yourself up on carbs?
[02:06:03.200 --> 02:06:05.400]   Yeah, you get all food.
[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:07.200]   Let's don't even pretend.
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:10.080]   I think it's called-- what was it called?
[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:11.080]   Diggies or Auggies?
[02:06:11.080 --> 02:06:12.080]   Oh, yep.
[02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:13.080]   Yup.
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:14.080]   Diggies.
[02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:15.080]   Diggies.
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:16.080]   Is that it?
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.080]   You know it?
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:18.080]   I think that's it.
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:19.080]   Yup.
[02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:20.080]   I know of it.
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.080]   Oh, man.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:22.080]   That was so good.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:23.080]   Or was it the dune break up for last time?
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:24.080]   We will make up for last time.
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:25.080]   It might have been the dune brothers.
[02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:26.080]   They're also very good.
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:27.080]   Yeah.
[02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:31.680]   Best clam cakes and chate you ever had.
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:35.400]   Are we making you hungry?
[02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:36.400]   It's dark.
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:38.440]   It must be lunchtime.
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:39.440]   Thank you.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:42.680]   Remember that fitness app that Apple's doing is not available yet.
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:44.080]   You've got plenty of time.
[02:06:44.080 --> 02:06:45.880]   I'm going to start now.
[02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:48.200]   I'm going to start now.
[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:51.360]   We do this show every Tuesday, right after iOS today.
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:55.760]   That's usually around 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC.
[02:06:55.760 --> 02:07:01.000]   Because with all of our shows, you can watch us make it live through the streams.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:02.000]   There are a number of them.
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:07.000]   But the best thing to do is go to twit.tv/live and pick your stream audio or video.
[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.120]   If you are watching live, chat live.
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:10.760]   We've got a great chatroom.
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:15.800]   Everybody else watching lives in there at IRC.twit.tv.rock was in there too.
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:17.200]   Having a good time.
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:21.000]   And of course, you can get on to man versions of everything we do after the fact.
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.120]   So you can listen at your convenience.
[02:07:23.120 --> 02:07:27.520]   The website has the show twit.tv/mbw.
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:30.200]   There's a YouTube channel for Mac Break Weekly.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:34.400]   The general YouTube channel is twit.tv or sorry, youtube.com/twit.
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:36.400]   Then you can find links there to all the show channels.
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:38.640]   Each show has its own channel.
[02:07:38.640 --> 02:07:41.440]   You can also subscribe in your favorite podcast app.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.560]   Just look for Mac Break Weekly.

[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:45.560]   That's convenient.
[02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:51.520]   And if you are an Amazon A-Lady listener, don't forget you can add Twit to your flash
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:52.520]   briefing.

[02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:57.560]   So you can get a little dose of Twit in your daily flash briefing.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:01.520]   Make sure you add that in your A-word app.
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:02.520]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:06.760]   Now it's time to get back to work because break time is over.
[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:07.760]   Bye bye.
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:12.440]   I'm Jason Howell, host of Tech News Weekly here on Twit.tv along with my co-host Micah
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:13.440]   Sargent.
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:17.240]   Each and every week we talk to people who are making and breaking the tech news.
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:19.960]   It could be journalists writing amazing tech stories.
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:21.360]   It could be experts.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:24.640]   It could be the sources of the stories themselves.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:26.160]   Developers, you name it.
[02:08:26.160 --> 02:08:30.840]   We bring them onto the show and we talk to them about why their story is resonating with
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:32.000]   the world.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:36.800]   You can watch and subscribe by going to twit.tv/tnw.
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:39.160]   Make sure you do that and you won't miss a single episode.
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:40.560]   We'll see you there.
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:44.240]   Okay, delivers the best I could do is September 25th.
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:45.240]   Oh well.
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:51.200]   I don't even know if I want this **** brown loop.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:52.420]   (laughs)
