[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Number 80 are Octogenarian Episode.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So if any of you are Octogenarian's show hands.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   I'm getting there.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Scott Bourn.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   You know, Scott, you keep saying that, but you and I are the same age.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   So can you not do that? Because it makes me feel old.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I'm just a tad older than you.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   A tad is right. Like what, a year?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Two years, not much older.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yeah, enough.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   You'll see in the next 12 months what I mean.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   When your hair starts to get gray.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Okay, and instead of having four girls on your arms, you only have two.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Of course, Hugh Heffner is in his 80s and he's got four.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Yeah, well, Scott Bourn is, of course, from Padango.com, the Apple Phone Show,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   girlsgongeek.tv, and iLifeZone, and...
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   This weekend photography.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Oh, I forgot Twip.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   You and Alex do Twip.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   We got knocked down to the number one spot by that lousy Apple company.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   But other than that, did you get to number one on iTunes?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   No, no, no, in the tech area. We're still floating around the top 20 in the iTunes.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   You think the highest we got was like seven?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I really have to emphasize this.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Congratulations on that.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And nobody stays up there because it's just like a billboard chart.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It's what it's what have you done for me lately.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's only today's heavily weighted and then the rest of the week.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And after that, subscriptions don't matter.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   So it's not a total subscription count or a total listener count.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And that's not clear in iTunes.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   But it's ballistic.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And so, of course, you didn't stay there.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   But you got there.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   And that's the point.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Right.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And we've been in this...
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   And the number of new people that have been joining or continuing to watch.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Well, that's what it shows.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   If you stay in the top 10 or 20, it means lots of new people all the time.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I don't know what...
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   No one knows exactly what it means.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   But a thousand a day or 5,000...
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Nobody knows.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Apple doesn't say.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Right.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   But it's been a very successful show.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We're having a lot of fun with it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I listen and watch, I should say, and watch because you're doing something interesting.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   You're doing both audio and video.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Yeah, we can...
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And it's free-cast.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, it's the...
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I think we're going to end up doing shooting video.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   The idea was that a lot of people are going to want both pieces of information.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Especially for a photography show.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Visual show.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Exactly.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   It seems odd to be doing audio show, but there's a lot of people that like to listen to it.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And we've learned mostly from your example, actually, that the audio shows often times do much better.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Sometimes do much better than the video shows.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So the idea is to have the audio shows the main drive, but also to be adding these video additions to it as we move forward.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah, I think that makes sense.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   No, but I don't know of anybody else who's combining audio and video on the same RSS feed.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I'll be very curious as to how people react to that as I move into the video.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Hey, let me introduce Andy before we get into that discussion.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Let me introduce Andy Anako because he's just sitting there quietly pretending he's not there until we say his name.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Oh, he's a little leprechaun mouse, actually.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Andy Anako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   And the celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   The celestial waste of bandwidth.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Folks, there's a hole in your life.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   A player in your life you've been ignoring.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I have absolutely no intentions of filling that lie that hole in your life.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Totally still kill 15 minutes of work.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's all it really.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   That's all it really is.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I'm promising that I'll entertain myself.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I will put off doing the work I'm supposed to be doing while I'm writing about buying pants on the internet.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   If you guys enjoy it, good.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Unfortunately, I don't have enough of an audience that can start exploiting you yet, but that'll come in four, five, six, seven months.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   But for now, just enjoy it.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I'm going to be a little bit more careful about it.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's funny.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   People seem to like it.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I don't think I asked any stupid questions of Steve Jobs that actually got asked there.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'll put that in the wind column.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   My friend, maybe not Scott's friend, Brian Block from Engadget took a little heat for his question.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   We'll get to that in a second.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   There are several big stories in the Mac world this week.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Of course, the biggest one is the Apple SDK announcement.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Of course, it happened last Thursday.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   We thought we might do a special, but we figured, "Hey, give us some time to look at it, play with it.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   We'll probably have something more intelligent to say the following week."
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   That's one subject.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Of course, the Beatles on iTunes.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Another subject.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   A big subject.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I guess there's a few other stories, but I think those are two are pretty big.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Let's start with the SDK announcement.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Scott, you were there.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   No, I didn't go.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You didn't go.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I had to go to Seattle.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I did not make it, but I was able to participate through any number of live blogs as were many
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   people.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   It did dawn on me that I'm not so sure why I do go when I do go since I don't know that
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I get any information being in the crowd that I can't get from sitting there looking at the
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   40 or 50 blogs that are pointed at the thing.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Did you stick with one or did you watch a couple of different ones or how did you do that?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   I actually had two different computers.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I had my desktop and my laptop fired up, and I had two different blogs open at once, and
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   gadget was not one of them.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   That's who I was.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   I got some interesting information.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I think I got the ambiance of what was going on, and I came away from it very, very excited.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I was expecting a lot less than what we got, frankly.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.120]   I've said this on a couple other shows, but I think the really big news was the Kleiner
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.120]   Birken's announcement.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.200]   As a business guy, a $100 million fund being out there legitimizes the iPhone as a platform
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.160]   the way nothing else Steve Jobs could have done that day did.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.400]   To have John Dower come up and say, "We think this is a big deal."
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:20.040]   Let me tell you, that might have something to do with the fact that Apple today announced
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.040]   that they've got more than 100,000 downloads to the SDK.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.040]   I downloaded it immediately.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.040]   I paid my $99.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.640]   I'm still waiting for my ... You have to be approved to get your certificate so that you
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.880]   can actually deliver applications.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.040]   You are correct, sir, and they said that's going to take them a while to catch up.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.560]   So there was a big deal.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.320]   There were three separate announcements really.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.560]   There was the SDK, and for developers and users, that might be the one that we're paying
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.880]   a lot of attention to, but for business users, I think a huge announcement that they support
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.760]   exchange and they've licensed active sync.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:55.600]   So if you're using Windows and you have an exchange server at work, this is a strong
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.240]   competitor to the BlackBerry.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.240]   And some people have said it might even deliver the information in a way that supersedes
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.240]   the way the BlackBerry does because of some of the server side requirements in the IT
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.080]   configuration for BlackBerry users.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   I don't know.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.360]   Oh, you don't have to run a BlackBerry server for one thing.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.080]   Many people running exchange and don't want to put the BIS on there.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.360]   I think the ... or BES, what camera would it ...
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:24.000]   The other issue is Steve Jobs brought up spreading a little fud is do you really want your all
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.760]   your mail sent through Waterloo, Canada?
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.640]   It goes to Canada, you know.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.680]   The other big announcement, as you said, was the big announcement that of a $100 million
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.720]   venture fund to support iPhone applications.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.840]   But I have to say, just looking at people like Electronic Arts and the Glee with which
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.760]   they greeted the three-axis accelerometer in there, they see another Wii.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.040]   And now people will be throwing their iPhones to the movies.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.360]   Well, the iPhone, and by the way, everything we say applies to the touch as well.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.120]   The iPhone and the touch don't have any other controls.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.040]   They have one button.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.800]   So for gaming, it has to be touch or accelerometer.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.320]   Well, not necessarily.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.440]   That's kind of what makes it so cool.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.880]   Just to show you how exciting the world has gotten from the SDK, I went out to dinner with
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.680]   a developer friend of mine and their kid.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.800]   And the kid who's 10 years old was already mapping out the great aerial combat game he
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.360]   wanted to make for the iPhone.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.200]   And of course, fortunately, he's only like nine.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.640]   So he's going to be 10 and a half before his programming skills are way better than mine.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.040]   So I could still be the indulgent tutor.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.080]   I'm going to hold it in my hands, figure out how you'd like the controls to go.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.120]   And then I realized, wait a minute, this is awesome.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:47.880]   With no physical buttons on the iPhone, I could just decide that, OK, the top left corner of
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   the screen is going to be one button, the top right corner of the screen, as I hold,
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.000]   is going to be another button.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.600]   I can basically tilt it one way to jank left, tilt it the other way to go right.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.080]   The idea that you can basically build a gamepad that's suited specifically toward the game
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.080]   you want to make.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.440]   It'd be like the control pads and Star Trek.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.440]   Right.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.040]   Except that your screen is moving at the same time as you're moving the controller, which
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   could be.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.680]   I mean, well, for something that's not going to be any good, but for many things, for monkey
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.680]   ball, it's perfect.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.600]   For a fight simulator, it's going to work just fine because you're kind of, you know,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:24.200]   you'll get a little bit of torso, like you'll get ripped abs because you're sort of moving
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.000]   your body from side to side in the seat as you're shifting from left to right.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.160]   So you know, you spot like someone who has like 250 pounds, but with killer abs, you'll
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.240]   be spotting an iPhone gamer, definitely.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.240]   I can't wait.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.280]   When I saw Spore, I practically spored my pants.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.800]   I mean, I was very excited about that.
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.400]   But didn't it really surprise you that Apple pushed that button so hard because traditionally
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.640]   they haven't, they've made a lot of noise about caring about games, but they've never
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:57.800]   gotten dropped down to their knees and begged, please develop games for iPhone.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.400]   We really, really, really want this to be a gaming platform.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.640]   I would never have predicted that of all the things that could have, I could have said,
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.920]   we're going to come out of that announcement that Apple would really, really push that
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.720]   button that hard.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.720]   I don't know.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.920]   I've been saying that the touch in the iPhone arc are the ultimate gaming platforms for
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   some time.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.920]   Oh, they are.
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.920]   But the fact that Apple would actually realize this.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:18.920]   You know, shock.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.800]   And some like, hey, you know, that big bag of money that we've been stepping over for
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.920]   the past 30 years, maybe you just been down to pick it up.
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920]   Let's go.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.720]   Well, I think that one of the things about games, I think that really works for Apple,
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.960]   is that they fit inside of the sandbox created by the SDK really, really well.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.360]   They're running when you're actually playing them.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.160]   They don't really need to get a lot of resources.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.840]   Now, Doom, evidently, would not run under the current SDK, I guess, because of some
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.920]   of the scripting that's, you know, so they have scripting in them.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.640]   It's more problematic, but straightforward games are really, you know, they don't push
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.600]   the envelope of what you want to do with your phone.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.800]   I mean, that's the issue that some people are having, of course, is the SDK has certain
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.440]   limitations, which I think are totally reasonable, but they limit where you could go in business
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.040]   or production or other things that you might want to do, whereas games, I don't think
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.040]   too.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   So I think it's a really good--
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   Well, what are the limits?
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.040]   One, we know you can't do VoIP on Edge.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.240]   You have to use Wi-Fi.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.640]   Also, the program will stop running when you go to another program.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.880]   No multitasking allowed.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:21.200]   Now, I think you can make a strong case for multitasking being the source of, of course,
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.560]   instability, but also critical security problems.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.000]   And while, you know, and the platforms that allow multitasking, which is Windows Mobile
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.080]   and somewhat BlackBerry, they really cause problems.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.080]   They run out of memory.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.840]   You know, on the BlackBerry, you can accidentally leave the GPS going and kill the battery in,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   you know, in an hour.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.200]   Let me ask you.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.920]   What's-- there's-- I've heard a few of the developers criticize that, but, you know,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.200]   I've had my iPhone since June, and as far as I know, I've only been able to enjoy one
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:52.480]   application on it at a time, and it hasn't seemed like any problem to me.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.880]   Here's the-- here's a good example.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.000]   Let's say you want to do a name client, a chat.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.960]   I am client.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.360]   Every time the phone rings, you're logged off of instant messenger, and every time you're
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.640]   in the phone call, then you can rerun the application, but you've missed whatever's happened.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.760]   Now, of course, you could save state online.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.360]   I mean, if you're using AMAOL, could save your chats while you're on the phone and then
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.480]   pump them down to you, but that's a significant back-end change.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:20.320]   I'm not saying that there would be any utility in being able to do it, Leo, but I'm just
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.120]   saying right now, Apple doesn't let even Apple do it.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   So--
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.440]   Well, but Apple doesn't have significant-- Apple doesn't have Apple.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.040]   This Apple has no chat application.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.040]   Right.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.920]   And I think what we're going to need to see in some of these applications is people giving
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   you a choice.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.120]   Do you want the phone to interrupt your application?
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.120]   Would you like the phone to automatically--
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   Well, they don't have the choice, though.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.160]   Right now, the SDK requires it.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.560]   Yeah, I know.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:50.040]   And what I'm getting at is the apparent willingness of Apple to give and take a little so far
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.920]   might move that direction just a bit.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.320]   I do think that there's reason to consider some of the changes that developers want,
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.960]   and that's half the reason for putting out a beta SDK.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   Sure.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.560]   And there are real security issues by keeping applications running in the background.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:10.720]   I mean, as I said, you could make a good case that that's good for stability and security.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.640]   Now, let's take a guess here.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.520]   What do you think to Apple is the bigger consideration?
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.840]   Which one is more important?
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.040]   The security of the device and the network it runs on or the stability of that one phone
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.280]   in that one user's pocket?
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:27.240]   Well, both.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.400]   But security number one, wouldn't you say?
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.400]   I don't know.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.320]   The Apple I know will be thinking the first time that this user has to restart in the
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.720]   middle of something, the first time that I thumb the power button and I get a black
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.360]   screen or I get an Apple logo and I thought that was going to be getting back to my email.
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.600]   If that becomes a regular occurrence, because that was always the biggest frustration on
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   my Windows mobile phone.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.440]   And I like Windows mobile phones, but I was always, it seemed like once a day, I would
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.680]   have to delete stuff out of memory because it didn't recognize it.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.440]   Well, geez, you've got a one gigabyte micro SD card in there, but I need to play in the
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.280]   64K playpen.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.040]   64 megs felt like 64K playpen.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.440]   Yeah, I mean, that crash is bad.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.680]   But Apple also doesn't want to be the first phone to support spyware and viruses and have
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.920]   a widespread problem with that.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.240]   That would be a bad announcement as well.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:19.600]   But it's interesting to sort of consider what limitations are they willing to put on the
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.560]   device and why are they willing to put those limitations on there.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.640]   And I think that when we're talking about how flexible a platform becomes when you have
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:31.520]   lots and lots of apps that can run simultaneously and do things and enhance the user experience
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.880]   all at once to remove that, I think that sort of demonstrates that they want the iPhone
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:43.520]   number one to be a very, very stable and very, very predictable, reliable tool for people.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.400]   I think maybe one point behind that is the security of people's contact information and
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.680]   stuff and the security of the network.
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.160]   And 60 points behind that is what the developers want.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.160]   Right.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.200]   Oh, it's like that scene of the Blues Brothers.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.760]   We have this list of requests from developers.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   Well, these are what matter.
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   They're just requests.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.760]   Play regular.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.260]   What other things other things that are limited, by the way, are you know, some of your
[00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:09.360]   program planners, the, you know, you can't do things like interpret code programs within
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.360]   programs.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   You can't launch another application.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.600]   You know, those are the things that obviously create a lot more stability, I think, and
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.440]   a lot more security, but they make certain things like Java and everything else not in
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.720]   the current structure work.
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.120]   Speaking of Java, have you listened to all the noise sun is making about Java and hey,
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.120]   we'll play, you know, you know, we aren't getting along.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.400]   And then it turns out that the, the, the, you look, might prevent the, where the agreement
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.160]   in the SDK might prevent them from playing, right?
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.600]   Which I thought was also funny.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.600]   That's true.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.000]   I mean, you could write a flash plug in now.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   You could write anything.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   You could write.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.460]   Hey, you want to, I'll tell you right now what the problem is with flash.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:55.560]   I found out it's all about Apple want to be able to use its own version of like preview
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.160]   or something to read the PDFs as opposed to Adobe's.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.320]   Well, I don't blame them.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.780]   I hate that the Adobe Acrobat keeps a stalling.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.960]   It's ugly ass on my Mac.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.440]   What I'm saying though is that's the, that's the hold up.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   Good.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.200]   That's the only reason why flash isn't on the iPhone in my opinion.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.200]   That's the hold up.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:18.400]   And if Adobe will, will grant Apple that argument, I think we'll see flash on the phone and, and
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:20.320]   they'll, they'll change things around.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.320]   But I did think it was very interesting to see sun making all that noise.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.320]   And I just thought that was kind of funny.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.320]   I don't know if I want Jeff on the iPhone to be honest with you.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.320]   Oh boy.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   I'm right there with you man.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   On the other hand, it does open a world of applications.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.440]   Like, hello, my name is Igor.
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.560]   I was, I was a fellas from your payback.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:49.480]   I would, I would much rather see at this point, silver light, flash and air.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   How about you Alex?
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.120]   Now you must, you must have some people thinking about developing for the iPhone.
[00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.960]   Oh, oh yeah.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.520]   We've been having almost daily discussions about kind of the wish list.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.080]   Now we're really, because the market is so big, we're really looking at our little niche
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.800]   around production and so on and so forth is where we should kind of keep what we know.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.720]   And so we're definitely looking at all the different options that we can get into with
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.720]   developing for the iPhone.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.400]   But we expect when, when things start to open up, we'll have a bunch of products related
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.680]   to that because I thought we're super excited about it.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.400]   There's all kinds of things we could do on a set in production, you know, so on and so
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.280]   forth that would be, we think a lot of fun and very useful.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.760]   I think that that's going to be the key though for developers is to find the niche that they
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.480]   do well, that they know well.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.160]   It's going to, you know, there's a lot of, there's a hundred thousand people who have
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:45.800]   downloaded the SDK and everyone going towards building a Twitter client, for instance.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.600]   You know, how many, how many hundred Twitter clients are there going to be?
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.960]   So that's probably not, you know, I'm not going to, I'm going to try not to go towards
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.560]   the field that everyone seems to be running for.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.840]   I'm going to look for a field that I can, a little, a little field that I can, that I
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   can live in.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.240]   If you've ever done any Xcode development work, you're going to be very at home.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   This is Xcode.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.680]   It even has, it uses interface builder.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.800]   It uses all the tools you're used to, uses Objective-C.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.680]   It looks like it's almost, you know, well, I love what they did at the, at the roll out
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.840]   where they said, well, if you had two days, what would you do?
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.840]   If you had two weeks, what would you do?
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.320]   I mean, I thought that was really effective in saying, look how quickly you can do stuff.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.280]   Didn't AOL say that they needed two weeks to get the AIM client working?
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:34.880]   That's pretty, that's pretty impressive two weeks to get that kind of application, right?
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.960]   Well, the bigger issue is, as I said earlier, if you got, if you've got AIM, what happens
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.640]   when you leave AIM and then log back in, are you going to have lost all of those?
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.120]   Or is it easy enough on their back end for them to preserve that and then push them down
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.120]   to you?
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.400]   Because it's no good to have a chat client where every time your phone rings, you miss
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.520]   four or five or six messages.
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.600]   Well, it's also, it's also got to be kind of annoying that Apple is not simply shipping
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.680]   the iChat on the iPhone as part of the regular 2.0.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.960]   There has to be something in contract with AT&T, the Fergbism, because that's just such
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.120]   a natural, don't you think?
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.240]   Yeah, and I guess the reason AT&T wouldn't like it, it would under our mind text messaging,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.240]   yes?
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.720]   Yeah, that's the only possible reason for them not simply saying, look, we've got iChat
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.640]   for the iPhone, we've got Safari for the iPhone, we've got Mail for the iPhone, we've got
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.640]   the whole Troika.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.840]   Yeah, makes sense.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:29.240]   Did you see one of the first little iPhone apps that was shown as an example?
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.200]   This was, I guess, especially for, this is on the unofficial Apple web blog.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.760]   It was especially from from Merlin.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.040]   GTD app?
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.800]   It is a to-do app.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.800]   Yay.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.600]   Well, you figure that's the first thing, you're going to have a notes application that finally
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   syncs, you're going to have a to-do app that finally syncs.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:55.040]   And app that rolls seven-sided die, that's a tip calculator.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.200]   We're going to see, it seems like every time there's a brand new platform dating back to
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.640]   the Apple II, the first 10 applications are always the same.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.480]   I think there should be like a $30 outback stakeouts gift card for the first person to
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.760]   make a recipe, a recipe organizer for the iPhone, just to make it a fit.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:16.160]   I just like to say that right now I would like to get first dibs on being Merlin's agent
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.760]   for negotiating how much he gets paid, but his blessing on the, you know, the once in
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.560]   a lifetime GTD app for the iPhone.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.480]   It's just like, there's like on the PlayStation, this John Madden football, yeah, on the iPhone
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.280]   the Merlin man GTD.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:34.360]   It'll be getting things done, the iPhone edition with Merlin man.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.280]   Well, I know he would want to point out that it's Dave Allen, of course, who created
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   getting the balance.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.000]   He'd be like, what happened?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.160]   But also I have to say in Merlin's credit and to defend him, he's, he always avoids those
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   opportunities.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.680]   I've never, I've never seen a man more anxious not to receive money.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.520]   I know and he and I need to have a very long time.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.960]   You know, we get our advertising checks.
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.440]   I divvy it up.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.480]   I said, okay, give me your social Merlin.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.480]   I'm going to send you a check.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.640]   He said, oh, no, keep it.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.920]   He said Merlin, I had to talk him into taking the money.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.160]   Well, that's because he makes like a hundred million dollars a year.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.240]   He must be so wealthy.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.160]   He's secretly got a submarine in his basement.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.840]   It's yellow too.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:16.120]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.400]   There is, of course, assumed name.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.720]   He has no working social security.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.040]   But I find out the truth about himself.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   He's cagey.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.040]   Really?
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.640]   He's, he's metal in Putin.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.120]   So, uh, more than bad enough.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.740]   So, uh, at least when the announcement came out, I think it's died down a little bit,
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.640]   but developers, especially on Twitter were saying 30% Apple says, first of all, apps
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.680]   can only be sold through the app store, which will be part of iPhone 2.0.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.080]   That's pretty nice, because it gets right there on the iPhone and you click it and you
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.120]   download it and you got it.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.640]   But they said no other way to put apps, third party apps on the iPhone, which keeps the
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.920]   cracking community alive.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:01.120]   They also said, uh, we will charge a modest 30% just to cover our expenses.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.360]   A few developers said, whoa, is that too much?
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.560]   No, Amazon charges 50.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   50.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.040]   And if you were to look at the cost of district, I mean, in the real world, I'm not talking
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.000]   about in the online world where counterculture rules, but in the real world of business where
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.800]   you look at distribution channel costs, 30% to get yourself in front of this many eyeballs.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.520]   The big advantage I think is that what because there's only going to be one outlet for a
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.360]   developer, if you can make it through the gauntlet of getting it on to the, on to the,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.880]   you know, getting it approved and getting it on to iTunes, it means that everybody is
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.400]   looking in one place for those applications.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.360]   When you build your niche app, people who are looking for that are going to come to that
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.360]   one location.
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.520]   I think that I think that as someone who's going to be a developer for the iPhone, I
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.400]   think that's beneficial to us.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.760]   I'd kill for that kind of opportunity and all the other businesses I have.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.400]   I was going to say, particularly if this, if it lends the same sort of iTunes browsing
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.680]   tools where there are going to be 52 do list managers, but if it gives me that big bar
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.160]   that says, well, look, 80,000 people have bought this one and liked it.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:12.160]   Here are 85 star reviews of it as opposed to the thing that some kid did in one day
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.560]   and then totally forgot about it.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.280]   But, I mean, I talked about, I talked to a lot of independent Mac developers, people
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:22.040]   who support themselves with one or two famous programs and surprisingly, I was expecting
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.640]   a lot of pushback, but surprisingly, they're, they're all pretty much cool with it.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.920]   One of them said that, well, I mean, obviously I don't like giving away any money, but the
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.360]   thing is I was prepared to give as much as 40.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.400]   And I think that if Apple gave, if Apple took less than 20%, they couldn't do this.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.280]   So I think the 30% is really quite reasonable.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   That's just a cross thing.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.880]   And that's what Apple's saying is this, this is our cost.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.560]   They use Akamai, which is very expensive.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.120]   You don't pay any bandwidth costs.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.640]   You do get great exposure.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:52.000]   However, Apple controls absolutely what apps can and cannot be on the phone.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.600]   So if you've got an app that Apple decides they don't like, let's say Skype, it's too
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.320]   bad.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.520]   Also, Apple will probably wield the same kind of power there that they wield, say, for
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.680]   podcasts where they feature the ones they like.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.080]   They don't feature the ones they don't like.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.360]   It may not be an equal playing field for all developers.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.760]   Well, that's okay because developers still have the responsibility to promote and sell
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.760]   their own work.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.560]   It's just that now they have that this extra tool, this extra engine that's supporting
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:21.560]   you.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:27.120]   I mean, I've had a couple of podcasts and was featured once, my test podcast, which unexpectedly
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:29.440]   sort of got more popular than I wanted to get.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.560]   But I mean, it was still my responsibility after it fell off those lists to tell people
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.560]   about it and promote it.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.480]   So I don't see that as a big deal.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   All right.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.480]   Just raising those issues.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.280]   Well, we'll have to wait and see how heavy handed Apple is with it.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.760]   I think they could be handed.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:47.200]   My bare concern is like when they're, if they're doing things that are not security related
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:52.280]   and not safety related, not stability related, when they simply say, look, we don't want
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.440]   like animated interactive stripper games on the iPhone.
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.480]   We just don't want to be associated with that.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.480]   So we're not going to allow that.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:03.200]   And that was one of the specific things that they, they nixed during the event.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.200]   What?
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   No strip poker?
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:08.360]   Well, you can play strip poker, just not with your iPhone.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.320]   It'll be interesting the first time that this is the example I keep coming up with.
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.760]   The first time that partypoker.com or one of these online poker games wants to say,
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.880]   look, we know it's illegal to do.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.520]   It's kind of legally dodgy to do real online poker in the United States.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.480]   But we're just going to give the free game that we have on our site.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.600]   And if they nixed that one, that's going to be an interesting.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.920]   I predict that the message boards on various pro and anti-apple form, they're going to
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:39.280]   be reasonable, rational, and very, very calm when they talk about what that means for
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   the Republic.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.280]   But you know what?
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   Who cares?
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.280]   Those Apple discussion forums are cesspools anyway.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.440]   And they go nuts and say all these crazy things and Apple continues to gain market share.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:56.760]   I have to tell you, coming from the perspective of someone, I hate to keep bringing this
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:02.640]   up, Leo, but me, you and Scoble standing out in front of the restaurant at the Jaiku
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.600]   party, you guys both showing off your N95s, both of you having them crash while you're
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.680]   showing them to me, most likely because of third party apps.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.600]   I don't want that experience on the iPhone and I'm okay with Apple making sure I don't
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.600]   get it.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   I realize that may not be the most popular position to take.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:21.040]   I understand the concerns about the monopoly stuff and I hope we get competition from other
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.560]   products that keep them honest.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.240]   But you know, it's like when you go into Denny's, they got a sign that says, no, no,
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.760]   shoes, no service, you can choose to eat there or not.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   Right.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.960]   Does the iPhone not crash?
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.920]   My name isn't crashed hardly at all.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.560]   I've had two lockups in a year that I can remember.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.560]   I had three or four.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.040]   Probably the same for me.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.560]   That's a lot better than any other phone out there, I think.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.280]   It's more stable than my laptop.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   Well, certainly you want to keep that.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:53.680]   A phone is no good unless it's reliable, especially a phone.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.840]   I don't mind Apple doing that.
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:59.040]   I think that if they do it for those reasons, nobody's going to complain.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:07.160]   If they do it for moral reasons or for worse yet anti-competitive reasons, people are
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.160]   going to complain.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.280]   And if they do it for any competitive reasons, they're going to get their buttoned court.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.600]   Well, this is the example.
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.280]   We talked about this on Twitch.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.840]   This is the obvious freight train coming right out of Amazon.com.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.640]   It's going to want to put a music store on there.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.880]   A simple thing to do, they're probably developing it right now.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   Does Apple allow them to?
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:30.200]   And if they don't, how long before they get, you know, go to court?
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.280]   I guess Apple could respond with, "Hey, that's not a problem.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:37.040]   Let us just put iTunes up on Amazon.com."
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.400]   Yeah, but that's not quite as appropriate.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.240]   That's not quite as appropriate.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.840]   I can't think of an offline Amazon store that would be of any usefulness unless it was
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.840]   doing something really cool, like let you scan a barcode from a friend's book and store
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.800]   it away so that I can look it up later on.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.400]   They just sold their music.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.120]   Well, you know, I'm thinking Apple would want that deal myself.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.280]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.760]   The problem with that is you could buy the music online through the iPhone, but what are
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.560]   you going to do with it once it's there?
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.240]   Unless you have a good group, because you have to ship it with a music player, but I'm
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.600]   not sure that's a good thing to compete with.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   I think that Amazon would be more likely to build an order app that uses the phone camera
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.200]   before they try to do a music now.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.720]   That would be a great app, too.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.920]   Now, I don't see Apple stopping them from doing that.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:32.240]   I think where they would stop them is where they, if they did a music store, direct head
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.200]   to head competitor to iTunes.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.640]   Well, here's the real bomb.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.680]   There's always been rumors that Apple wants to add books to the iTunes store.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:45.400]   There's always been rumors about how publishers have this deal with Apple where they just keep
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.240]   sending shovels, fools, and shovels, fools of books to gooportino for scanning.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.640]   What if that rumor is actually true that they're actually planning on doing that at some point?
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.040]   Now Amazon is saying, "Hey, guess what, Apple, we're going to give you something really great.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.040]   The iPhone is going to be the only other device other than the Kindle that can buy electronic
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.160]   books from the Amazon store and read them."
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   Interesting.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.160]   Well, Apple did that.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.360]   Yeah, I think Apple would have to take that deal.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:16.520]   Anything that Apple does that's anti-competitive is also anti-Apple shareholder in some way.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:20.440]   I think the shareholders would eventually revolt if they got too crazy because they don't want
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.640]   to deal with the kind of lawsuits Microsoft's facing.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.080]   It's not good for business.
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.400]   They should make it as open as they can.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.160]   Keep in mind that 30% that Apple makes, they say it's just to break even.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.680]   I don't believe that.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.000]   Whether it is or not true, that's a big incentive to let stuff on the phone.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Everybody's talking about what if they don't let stuff on the phone?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.320]   Well, they get paid to let stuff on the phone.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.920]   Believe me, it's in their interest.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.200]   Well, I think the other thing is that I think Apple could allow Amazon, for instance, to
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:55.000]   do the Kindle type stuff and they could still launch it on iTunes and they would still eat
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.640]   up 80 to 90% of the market because it, for me, would be just easier to deal with iTunes
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.440]   than to go out somewhere, to do something else just because it's so integrated with
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.000]   the iPhone.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.080]   I think that that's a lot for a lot of people.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.560]   That's the problem people have is that, "Ah, it's just easy to do it this way.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:09.560]   I'm not going to buy it."
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.240]   Well, that's why it would be undercutting their business model.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.360]   If all of a sudden there were an easy way to do it with Amazon.com.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.360]   I just don't think it would never be as easy because...
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:17.360]   Why not?
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.240]   You could exactly duplicate the experience.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.600]   Because Amazon wouldn't have access to my interface.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:30.040]   You have to get things on into a place that I can see them when it's audiobooks or the
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.000]   other stuff within my iPhone.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.240]   I guess with print stuff it might be...
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.320]   Well, you mean the SDK doesn't give you parity in that regard?
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:42.800]   Well, no, I mean, if you're downloading MP3s through something else, you still can't get
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.000]   them into your playlist without iTunes.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.360]   That's the way it works right now.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.280]   That's what I'm asking.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:50.920]   Doesn't the SDK give you that capability?
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.160]   I doubt it.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   I don't know.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.120]   I don't think they'll call.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.160]   I don't think that they would do it any other way.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   I mean, I don't...
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.680]   Well, that's anti-competitive right there.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.480]   It's the way the system works.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.880]   It's not like they've changed it.
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.680]   The consensus on Twitter was kind of interesting.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   This is...
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.880]   I mean, Jason Calicanis, who certainly has business expertise, is...
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.560]   Amazon would just go ahead and do it.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.880]   They make enough money while they're being sued.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.680]   I mean, that...
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.080]   But the campaign would go ahead and do it and just say no, sorry.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.840]   Well, here's the problem Amazon would face using your example, Leo.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   If Amazon is selling the Kindle and you can buy books on the Kindle, which is a portable
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.120]   device, and then Amazon says we want to be able to put them on the iPhone too, making
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.320]   the argument that they have a stranglehold on the market would bounce back to Amazon
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.320]   because you...
[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.720]   You can only get to Amazon stuff on the Kindle.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   I don't think that's gonna fly.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:48.440]   Does the fact that it's a phone make it different?
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.160]   I think that doesn't have as much to do with it as many people think.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.760]   I think it mostly has to do with the fact that it's a platform, just like the Kindle
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.520]   is, just like the Mac is.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.320]   Well, I think that also, in some ways, if Amazon actually wants to make a product out
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:06.320]   of the Kindle, I don't think necessarily the issue that they have.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.640]   I mean, maybe they just want to sell that.
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.560]   Maybe they want to use the Kindle and they're only worried about making money on the content,
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.640]   which is totally viable and quite possible.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:21.480]   But if Apple does follow the rumors and make the twice as large iPhone that's out there...
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.040]   That's a pretty good reader right there.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.000]   Yeah, you're not gonna buy a Kindle.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   No, you're not.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   It's like game over.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.200]   You know, and so now they better be making money on that media because that's all they're
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.200]   gonna get.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.640]   Well, you wouldn't buy the Kindle if you can get the books easily and put them on the iPhone.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640]   And this is...
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.640]   It's kind of a flip-flop.
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:42.840]   Others have that kind of power in books compared to Apple, which has that power in music.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.960]   Amazon has the interface for books.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.920]   So yeah, you could put all that together.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.920]   But unless you have...
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.960]   I mean, the thing about the Kindle is you're browsing the Amazon store and you buy the
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.880]   book and there it is.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.880]   How would Apple do that?
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.080]   Several antitrust suits have failed against Amazon in that regard.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:02.840]   Several antitrust suits back and forth between the iPod and various MP3 makers have failed.
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:08.640]   So I don't think there's as many concerns there as folks might want to make out that
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.640]   there are.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.000]   I don't think there's any reason to believe that Apple's necessarily gonna, once again,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.920]   gonna be anti-competitive because once again, they get paid.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.280]   I think there's a reason to believe that they're gonna try to default as much as they can
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.440]   to let and stuff on the phone.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   But think about it from every...
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.920]   Well, wait, you said they get paid just to break even them out though.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.440]   No, they said they did.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   I said I didn't leave.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.920]   Oh, you think they're making more money than that?
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   Absolutely.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.480]   30% I think they are.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:39.120]   I think that if they were to let a porn application on the phone, every group in the world that
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.040]   was against that stuff would sue them for that.
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.840]   No, I don't particularly want them to do that.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.720]   I think porn is a bad example.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   I think the Amazon...
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.960]   Or gambling or anything else.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.800]   I think the Amazon example is a better example because there's no moral turpitude involved.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   It's simply commerce.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.560]   It does illustrate with something that might be even bigger that if Apple is acting as
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:03.360]   the gatekeeper for software, doesn't that on some legal basis imply that they have
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.560]   certified, they have examined and they have underscored this app?
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.560]   Yeah, it does.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   They've...
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.560]   Absolutely.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.560]   They're a little liable now.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.440]   And because of that, they need to be careful.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.520]   Could they waive that though in a Yula?
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.520]   I don't think so.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.000]   Well, they would certainly put something in...
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.120]   There are already software publishers who can say, "Look, if you use our contact manager
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.920]   and we lose all your porn contacts right now, we're big meat.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.920]   Sorry, you're on your own."
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:31.760]   But the thing is, there's going to be the first person with a law degree who gets burned,
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.240]   is going to be the first person to say, "Look, you vouch for this app and it really hoes
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.240]   me.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   You're on my...
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.400]   You've got to buy me this house that I wasn't able to buy."
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   And that's all there is to it.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.200]   I'll be very interested to see what the software, the App Store Yula is.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   I bet you it disclaims all responsibility for anything that might happen to you in every
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.120]   form or fashion.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.920]   You can disclaim anything you want and people can agree that.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.920]   You can disclaim it as the meat is going to hold up in court.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.480]   Still, it can be sued, absolutely.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:05.820]   Well, I think the absolute consensus is this is a great thing, better even than anybody
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:11.200]   expected a much more thorough API, probably worth waiting for.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.720]   It's hard to develop an API like this.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.000]   They did a good job, it seems to be.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Yes.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   We all agree.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   I agree.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I think that as a developer...
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.480]   I was just going to say, of all the developers I've spoken to, not one of them has said, "Gee,
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:28.480]   I wish they had done this.
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.040]   Gee, I wish they had added this."
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.360]   There's something that this is not the rich, wonderful, supportive experience.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.720]   The feedback I'm getting is not, "I don't know if I want to develop apps for this."
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.400]   The thing again is, "I don't know which app I want to develop first for this."
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   And you can bet.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.400]   Now, here we are, almost a week in.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:45.400]   You can bet.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.600]   There's apps already to go.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.480]   People are going to be chomping at the bit for iPhone 2.0.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.080]   It's still a ways out, right?
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.080]   June.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.080]   June.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.180]   That's too long for me.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.480]   I think when they launch it, it's just...
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.520]   I mean, a store is going to have just thousands of apps.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.680]   Does this kill the iPhone jailbreaking?
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.360]   No, the jailbreakers are going to jailbreak forever.
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.160]   There's going to be fewer people that care.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   I won't care.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.160]   I won't care.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.160]   I think that...
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:21.320]   I always kept an un-jailbroken phone, missed those apps, but I think this is enough to
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.320]   make everybody happy.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.920]   Well, remember, one of the biggest reasons for the jailbreak isn't to get third-party
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.160]   apps, it's to make the phone work in other countries.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.520]   So if Apple gets the phone working in other countries and then comes out with 2.0 and
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.680]   the SDKs rocking a bunch of apps, I think you'll just hear all the news about jailbreaking
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   die way down.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.600]   Are you talking about jailbreaking or unlocking?
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:47.440]   Well, I'm talking about there's a lot of unlocks that are done in conjunction with jailbreak.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.440]   Okay.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.440]   Right.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   I learned something.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.280]   Go ahead.
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.280]   Does anybody know if localization...
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.080]   I know localization is part of SDK, but do you think there's going to have to be an international
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.120]   iTunes store so you can get a French edition of this app and Arabic edition of this app?
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120]   Great question.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.120]   Great question.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:06.120]   That's the way the music works.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.720]   Yeah, I would say yes.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:11.360]   And that's mostly not just because of language as much as it is licensing.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.360]   Yep.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.200]   But that's all kinds of licensing issues with these different countries.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   And sometimes it's...
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.720]   Like, for instance, I got information that the reason that the iPhone isn't going to Canada
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.680]   is a regulatory one like I've said, but the regulators aren't worried about FCC style
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.680]   regulations.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.280]   They're worried about a trademark dispute with a Canadian company that has a Canadian
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.280]   mark for iPhones.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.760]   So there's all kinds of legal minutiae to work through when you move this stuff to other
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.760]   countries.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.160]   So Andy, that's a great point.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.360]   Yeah, every Yula would have to be localized as well.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.880]   I learned something today that the TSA has a blog.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880]   Oh boy.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   Who knew?
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.680]   Yeah, I'm going to start reading it every day.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.800]   They've had nine moderators in eight days.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.560]   Each of them had to get lobotomies.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.280]   It's called the evolution of security.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.000]   TSA.gov/blog.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.720]   It's a WordPress blog it looks like.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:09.120]   And a lot of comments.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:17.520]   It became a parent that they had a blog when it turned out the Macbook Air looked like
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.600]   a bomb.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.600]   I don't know.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   Geez Louise.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.360]   These are the folks protecting us.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.120]   It looks like a movie prop.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.720]   I guess the story that I read was that someone who is not really that smooth on the uptake
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:35.080]   and frankly has to deal with lots and lots of stuff and be familiar with everything that
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.760]   everybody's ever apt to carry.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.600]   So let's cut them a little bit slack.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.520]   Saw something that looked like a computer.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:44.800]   Saw none of the saw that clearly this is way too slim to be a real computer.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.000]   It doesn't even have a DVD drive for God's sakes.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.800]   It doesn't even have any actual ports or a replaceable battery.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:54.440]   This can't possibly be a computer thus proving that the TSA agrees with at least 11% of all
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.080]   the message borders opinions about the Macbook Air.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.720]   I'll read the post from Michael Nygaard's blog, Michael Nygaard.com.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.720]   It's called Wideaway Developers.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.880]   He's going to on a flight.
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   He's ready to go.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.400]   Today, something's different.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.840]   Instead of my bags trundling through the X-ray machine, she stops the belt, calls over another
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.840]   agent, a plavar.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.680]   Another agent flocks the screen, a gabble, a conference, some consternation.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:20.160]   They pull my laptop.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.280]   One takes me aside to a partition cubicle.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.840]   Another of the endless supply of TSA agents takes the rest of my bags to a different cubicle.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.960]   No yellow brick road here.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.600]   Just a pair of yellow painted feet on the floor and my flight is boarding.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.720]   I may understand that I should stand and wait.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.640]   My laptop is on the table in front of me just beyond reach.
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:42.440]   I'm standing watching my laptop on the table listening to security, clucking just behind
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.440]   me.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.240]   There's no drive, one says.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.360]   And no ports on the back.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.000]   It has a couple of lines where the drive should be.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   She continues.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   A younger agent.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.400]   You're making this all good, Dr. Seuss, but you can do audiobooks.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:57.000]   I see no drives.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   You see no CD.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.920]   This certainly does not look like a computer to me.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.960]   Fortunately, a younger guy comes up and says, no, that's a MacBook Air.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.960]   Too late.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.200]   The guy missed his flight.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   Sorry, Michael.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.880]   However, the TSA blog now says, well, we're making sure everybody knows what an air looks
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.640]   like.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:21.400]   This message brought to you by Apple.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.920]   It turns out that a gentleman was trapped.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.960]   This is from the TSA blog.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:31.040]   TSOs, the transportation safe security officers gave some special attention to his new MacBook.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:37.080]   Fans would say the TSOs couldn't resist getting a closer look at a fine piece of machinery.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:41.120]   I could tell you, TSOs are trained to look for anomalies.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.480]   Each operator sees hundreds of laptops a day.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.280]   Some have been doing this for six years.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.680]   You do the math.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.520]   They know what laptops are supposed to look like.
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.600]   I think in a way, this is an ad for the air.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.320]   Yeah, this one's saying I'm going to get an air.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.000]   It's a TSA guy is getting a free MacBook from Apple.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.040]   As soon as this has been certified, as soon as it's been affidavit, as soon as the commercial
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.480]   is filmed, and then you're just going to keep.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.640]   And then Stephen Levy writes an article in the Newsweek.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.640]   Sorry.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.280]   I know what's going to go.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.680]   You tell us.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:18.080]   Apparently, people are losing their heirs because they're.
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   Well, no, this is really well written and really entertaining column that Steve wrote
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:28.200]   on Newsweek about how he has a loaner Macbook air from Apple.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.920]   A loaner air.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.440]   And so one day he goes to go pick it up off the sofa when he realized that it's not on
[00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.720]   the sofa and said, geez, what did I do with it?
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.720]   It's so with that.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:38.720]   I leave it back in the office phone call.
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.720]   No, it's not the office.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.320]   Gee, did I leave it back at the last press conference?
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.920]   No, I didn't leave it back at the press conference.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.320]   And the weird thing is that the charger is there.
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.520]   The end of it is hanging right there.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.920]   He's trying to figure out what happened to it.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:54.440]   And by sure locking in logic, he realized that gee, sometimes I kind of like are I set
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.240]   down my computer on the coffee table.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.240]   It was Sunday.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.720]   It was on the New York Times Sunday section.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   Oh, no.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.280]   I think I might have dumped the it was so like.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.120]   I think he got his wife did it.
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:08.160]   He said his wife cleans up.
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:11.200]   Whose clutter tolerance is well below my own as a corny.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.200]   Swoop in.
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:17.080]   She swoops in gathers it up goes to the trash compactor room dumps it into a plastic recycling
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.080]   bin.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.000]   You know, I've done stuff like that, but I'm very, I'm very sure that was an episode
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.760]   of everybody loves Raymond.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.000]   Honey, where's my air?
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   I think that's funny.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   I have a loaner air too.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.280]   In fact, I've got to figure out where my is.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.520]   It's time to send it back.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.360]   I'm going to mail it back right in that same inter office envelope.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.920]   They shipped it to me and they have a lot of faith in that envelope.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.000]   Did they ship it in the internet in the office envelope?
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.400]   Do you know what I was being humorous?
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.920]   It would be funny if they did.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.560]   I should just, you know, put it.
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.200]   I'll upgrade it by putting in one of those FedEx bubble pouches.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.880]   You know what I'm going to do is I'm going to get one of those envelopes.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.240]   I'm going to write my name on it and then across my name out and write Steve Jobs, Apple
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.320]   Computer and put it and then put it in there and I'm going to give it to send it back to
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.320]   them.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:59.800]   Well, actually, I didn't want to bring it up because it doesn't make me look very good,
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.960]   but I had to wait a couple of weeks for mine and when I got mine, my envelope said Steve
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.880]   Levy, Crossout, some dude with a porn blog.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.480]   It was black with them.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   I'm glad I got it.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.480]   I'm thankful.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.160]   I'm grateful that people don't get to borrow these things, but still it was sort of a
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.160]   punch in the gun.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.960]   You and I are in the same boat on the one Andy and I go.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:25.080]   In fact, I complain and I'm being very petty on this, but did any of us get invitations
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.080]   to the SDK event?
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.080]   No.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.080]   No.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.360]   I didn't, but then again, they only usually invite me if there's going to be a briefing
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.920]   that they can give me later on because I've already told them that I've said no so many
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   times that I've...
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   Well, they invite me.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.840]   I missed the last one because I was in Canada, but they have been inviting me.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:48.760]   So I had to point out that the circulation for this show is actually slightly larger
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.040]   than the largest magazine in existence.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.600]   If you were to add the circulation for the other podcast that all of us are involved
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.920]   with where we talk about the iPhone, it's even bigger.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.920]   But that's okay.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:05.680]   We only have like 100,000 people at applephoneshow.com listening to the show every month.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:11.840]   And of course, they're just there for the iPhone, but I guess 10,000 readers of some
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:13.440]   obscure blog are more important.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.520]   A quarter of a million people listen to this show every month.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.520]   It's okay.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   Oh, then I'm bitter anything.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.720]   It's a 500,000 on my blog, by the way.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   I'm pointing that out at applephone.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.720]   It's so petty.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.720]   So now we've got...
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:29.160]   We're up to 1.75 million now or something.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.720]   Guys, guys, let me tell all of you.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:32.720]   I love you.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.520]   I value all the work you do.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.720]   And in my eyes, there is no more important...
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.720]   All right.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.720]   What's your circulation?
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:44.400]   I don't count my circulation, Leo, because all I care about is serving however many readers
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.280]   I have, be it 3,000 or 3,000.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.280]   Chicago's.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:53.080]   One time.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.160]   We're now up to 5 million.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:59.640]   I think, frankly, everybody who has a Macintosh listens to one of our products.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   But that's...
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   Oh, no.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   It is okay.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.600]   I don't take those things.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.880]   You'll go nuts trying to figure out, well, geez.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:09.640]   I get private briefings like at Mac world Expo.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.640]   It seems pretty.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.920]   And I try to figure out how come I got the 2 p.m. slot instead of the 1 p.m. slot?
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.200]   How come I'm seeing this guy instead of this guy?
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.720]   Well, it's not how these things work.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.040]   They're just trying to manage a major event and they're trying to do things for themselves
[00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   and for everybody else.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.560]   I would just point out that it's not for me that I mention this.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.360]   It's for our listeners.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.360]   It's correct.
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:30.360]   Exactly.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.360]   It's them whom...
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.560]   The fact that we were uninformed, we were forced over the past hour to make up everything
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:38.240]   we've just told you because we couldn't bother to read anything online and we're still bitter
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.720]   about not being there live.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.200]   I refuse to read anything online.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.200]   That kills me.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   That kills me.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.160]   I refuse to because if I'm not invited to the primary source, I'm not going to be able
[00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:47.480]   to read secondary sources.
[00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:48.480]   I don't think so.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:49.480]   That's just good journalism.
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:52.400]   What may as well go to Wikipedia for God's sakes.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   Microsoft's just face.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:55.400]   Which I've just faced.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   Have you?
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.400]   Thank you.
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:02.600]   Could you modify my entry to say that I dated Cheryl Ladd in the 70s?
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.160]   Just I'd like to have that on there.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.800]   You're gonna lie for God's sakes lie big.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   No, it's the little lies that people believe.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:16.120]   When my Wikipedia page came up and I found it and it's just identified me as a writer.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.760]   I was living as American journalist living person.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.480]   I thought, you know, I could put that in my business card and still be very, very proud.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.480]   They bad.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   And you're not a living person American.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.840]   You can't put it on your tombstone, however.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:30.640]   We'll just we'll we'll use those rub off letters.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:35.160]   Microsoft said on Tuesday that would be yesterday that it released its first update to Office
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:40.760]   2008 for Mac fixes that should boost stability and performance in some arenas while closing
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.240]   some security holes.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.960]   You know, this is why I didn't install Office 2008.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   I installed it.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.960]   I never had any problems.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.960]   Hi.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.840]   Do you why'd you install it for review purposes?
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.280]   Scott, do you really need it?
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   For review purposes, I do a case is it?
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.240]   I mean, it's convenient to have.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   And I mean, it's nothing.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.240]   Nothing I rely on.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.360]   I do most of my real creative work and pages.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.240]   That's my preferred, you know, document creation product.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:10.680]   But I have to admit once in a while, especially when I get a file from one of my PC friends
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.200]   that it's very nice to be able to just quickly open it and word.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.520]   And I have to say it all works pretty well, even before the update.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.600]   You know, it's funny because I get a doc files too.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.840]   And they don't look as good in Word as they do in pages.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.440]   I actually open them in pages, believe it or not.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.240]   Well, and you know, this depends on the functionality that you want to preserve.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.640]   If you're getting these files where, you know, 50 people have marked them up, they sure
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.640]   work a lot better.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   The revision tracker doesn't work, of course.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.200]   Yeah, that doesn't work in pages.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.000]   I agree with you just to read a document pages is way more beautiful.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.200]   But you know, for, I do a lot of work back and forth on books and such.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:50.160]   I've somehow found my way technical editing about five books right now.
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.280]   Well, you need work then.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:52.280]   You're right.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.280]   Absolutely.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:56.360]   You know, you have 15 different revisions to every sentence and you lose track pretty
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.520]   quick if you don't have word.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.680]   No, you have no choice in that regard.
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.640]   You know, I only put on one machine for review purposes.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.920]   I'm not going to put on anything else.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:09.080]   I don't think it's a particularly nice, attractive product.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.960]   I've moved to, I've moved to I work for just about everything.
[00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.280]   The first has one thing that drives me crazy.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:18.920]   You cannot lock, you know, like at the title so that as you scroll down, you can see what
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   those columns are.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.000]   Just that drives me, I don't understand why they would leave that out.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   It's like kind of fundamental.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   You just didn't think about it.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   They'll fix it.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   They'll put it in, I know.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.520]   But that's the, like it's one of those, they're like three of those that mean you have to use
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   Excel after.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.000]   Well, you know, here's the thing though.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.520]   I mean, for most people, I mean numbers is something they can actually use.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.520]   Oh, I agree.
[00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:39.520]   There's a lot.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:40.520]   I mean, I tell a lot of people use numbers.
[00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:41.520]   Why use an Excel?
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:42.520]   Well, and the other thing is crazy.
[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.440]   A lot of people are building forms with Excel, you know, like, well, it's crazy.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:52.240]   When we're managing stuff, a lot of production forms are all built in that you fill out while
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.480]   you're on set or that you're planning or all these layouts of stuff.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.880]   You're not using any of the calculations.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.520]   And they're building them in Excel and that's just a painful way to go.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.040]   I mean, numbers is so much better for laying that kind of stuff.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.440]   I can say unequivocally though, if you're into linear algebra, you prefer Excel.
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.120]   I would agree with you.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.480]   All, all six of you.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.360]   Are you into linear algebra there, Scott?
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:13.360]   I am.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.360]   It's sort of a hobby.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:19.720]   I use it to create linear synthesis tools for synthesizers and music.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:20.720]   Really?
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.720]   Just, you know, in my spare time.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:27.240]   When I solve quadratic equations, I do it with Excel.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:33.800]   Finally, the Beatles rumor on off on Paul McCartney says, yeah, we're going to sell on iTunes,
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.200]   but not until after I get my money out of that bitch.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.800]   Oh, he's waiting till the divorce decree is final because he doesn't want what's your
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   name?
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.640]   Celebrity Voices impersonated by the old, the point badly.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.360]   We Apple people have our yoko.
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:50.360]   We do.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.240]   You're the people who broke up the Beatles and I do.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.200]   We have our yoko.
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:51:01.120]   It's so she's getting like $30 million for her two year marriage to Paul, Sir Paul, but
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.720]   he wants to keep that 400 million.
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.880]   I consider marrying him for $30 million.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.040]   I do it for 10% of that, depending on.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.000]   Yes, got him underbidding you.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   I don't care.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.240]   Now, the question is, is this true?
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:20.800]   Because Michael Jackson says, no, it's not true.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.200]   Does Michael Jackson own anything anymore?
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.000]   He owns the Beatles catalog.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.760]   He's leveraged that thing 52 times.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.760]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.920]   I mean, he doesn't own it in the clear.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:39.160]   I mean, his name might be buried down there like 52 owners ago, but somebody, some bank
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.160]   owns it.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.920]   Well, Sony ATV Music Publishing, it's called.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:51.240]   It's a joint venture between Sony and MJ, says that the Beatles catalog reports are untrue.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:53.040]   Now this is where it's confusing.
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.040]   Who owns the rights?
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.840]   EMI owns the recording rights to the Beatles catalog.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.200]   The publishing rights are owned by Michael.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.760]   Yeah, and that's all that matters when it comes to iTunes.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.360]   And of course, they would have been informed how the deal been done.
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.360]   Yep.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.520]   I tend to believe it's not happening yet.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.520]   So maybe it's not true, but I can't.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.240]   I mean, it's not happening goes to Michael.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.880]   Do you think Paul was listening to our show?
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.960]   Do you think maybe he's hoping a yellow submarine eye puddle come out?
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.480]   Give you a bloody good deal.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.960]   Oh, I think he should do it.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:26.960]   Well, I don't know.
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.960]   I'm sad.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:30.680]   We have a Beatles related rumor on this show nearly every week.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.680]   I just want to point that.
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.680]   Part of the deal.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   Part of the deal.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.880]   We should call this Mac break and Beatles weekly.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.360]   Yeah, the yellow submarine show.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:45.240]   So a thin white line going from the lapel of John's coat to his pocket on the Abbey Road
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   album.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:50.560]   Now it's about the same gauge, not as a modern iPod, but as a first generation iPod.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:54.200]   See listening to headphones earbuds, early earbuds.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.120]   I'm not saying I'm just saying get out and don't know.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:00.800]   You can't see it on the CD art, but if you get out like the old LP art, it's there.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:08.760]   I'm saying we found the answer to who was on the grassy note.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.280]   I will be really sad.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:17.160]   Somebody some young person pined who cares who would want to buy the Beatles.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:21.360]   I care if they offered that same $99 deal they did for the Led Zeppelin for the entire
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   Beatles collection.
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.360]   Wouldn't you?
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.240]   I mean, yeah, bought every album and every eight track and every CD, but I still would
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.520]   buy this.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:30.640]   It would totally be a bit torn.
[00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:35.800]   I own every Beatles CD available and I have already ported each and every one to my eye.
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.200]   So you don't need it.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.960]   I don't need it, but I might be tempted as you would buy it just to support it, especially
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:44.000]   if it came with a yellow submarine.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   We're going to do our picks in just a second.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.200]   Our selections for software, but before we do that, ladies and germs, it's time to remind
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.880]   you about audible.com.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:59.760]   Audible.com, the great place to get all your books recorded by professional voice talent,
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:06.760]   not like us, by people who actually sound good, who make the book sound good, who bring
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.760]   it to life.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.560]   I'm listening to a book.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.560]   Oh my gosh.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.520]   This is a funniest book called the dog of the south.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.560]   Have you ever heard of this book?
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.120]   Oh my gosh, it's funny.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.080]   But the guy who reads it is just given.
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:24.400]   Charles Portis just gives it brings it to life because it's a comic novel, but the Ray
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:30.560]   Midge, who's the hero of the comic novel is tracking his wife Norma down, Norma ran off
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:37.000]   with her first husband and he's gone to San Miguel de Allende, ends up driving a doctor
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.880]   down to British Honduras, as they call it.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.520]   It's just the wildest, funniest novel by Charles Portis.
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.520]   I mean, read by Charles Portis.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.680]   No, I meant written by Charles Portis, read by Edward Lewis.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.680]   Let me get that straight.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:54.040]   And it is such a good read.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.480]   Did you have a book recommendation to?
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.640]   I just I don't want to.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.600]   Oh no, I've just I took a few weeks off.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.400]   So I've had like audible books sort of like sort of stacking up.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.840]   How many a week do you do?
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.640]   I usually get through one a week.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:12.000]   Not I should say not all the audible picks started off as audible books.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.600]   They're usually they use most of them to start off as books that I just really liked in analog,
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:21.840]   old fashioned, you know, dead tree where and then just you flip over to the audio book
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:22.840]   at some point.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.840]   Sometimes it goes the other way.
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:30.000]   I listened to John Adams on audible.com and David McCullough reads his incredible biography
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.200]   of John Adams.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.200]   And at the time, they only had the abridged version.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.680]   They now have the unembridged.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.680]   So I bought the book.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.080]   I mean, I just had to have the book.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.080]   It was so good.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.160]   You can't you can't have the snack pack on McCullough.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.560]   It's a cool thing.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:46.800]   But that actually is exactly one of the reasons why I picked this book for for for this particular
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:47.800]   week.
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:54.520]   My favorite favorite novelists that I have that I have the most interesting relationship
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.720]   with is Neil Gaiman.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.720]   Oh, I love Neil.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:01.000]   Yeah, I mean, he's he's at any given time.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.920]   I will have five or six Neil Gaiman novels on the shelf of which one of which I've reread
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:08.520]   and reread and reread to death.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:12.360]   The second one I've read once or twice and we're probably going to read again and three
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:17.000]   that I was just sort of banked that I bought when it first came out because he's he's on
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.280]   that list of I buy it as soon as it comes out.
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:24.360]   The only difficulty I find with him is that there he writes a lot of novels where they
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.120]   really do require and demand your full attention.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:30.120]   You can't have that's why either in the bank.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.640]   They're waiting for that week I have off and I'm going to be vacationing where I can
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:36.760]   just simply spend three or four hours doing nothing but reading and not checking my email
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:38.200]   and not worrying about a deadline tomorrow.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.440]   We're just doing stuff like that.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:45.280]   And one of the most interesting things for him as an audiobook author is that he his style
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.000]   of storytelling truly is storytelling not really reading.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:56.240]   It is sitting with a fire in proximity hopefully within a fireplace while Neil Gaiman tells
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:01.280]   you this story he's come up with and you spend the whatever time it is to hear this story
[00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:06.400]   whether you're reading it or hearing it alternating between being totally captivated by the story
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:10.900]   totally captivated by the storyteller and wondering if this guy is not just completely
[00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:15.520]   barking mad and his smile is concealing an intent to leap over the fire and pull you
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:18.140]   down someplace where you don't want to be.
[00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.220]   You've been reading American Gods again I think.
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:29.100]   So my pick is actually my pick is actually a fragile things which is read by Neil he
[00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:34.060]   retends to narrate nearly all nearly all of his audiobooks that I've come across.
[00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:37.100]   So you're getting it right from the source right from the intention from the original
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.100]   intent.
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:41.740]   The first thing about fragile things is that it's a collection of short stories so that
[00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:45.220]   if you're one of these folks who likes to listen to these stories and listen to audiobooks
[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:52.020]   in the car or on flights not just you don't want to make that big like 500 page 5 CD commitment
[00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:53.220]   of listening through.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:57.220]   These are stories you can get through very relatively quickly you can really immerse yourself
[00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:00.420]   in and he is an absolute master storyteller.
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:05.820]   It also includes some of the some of my absolute favorite things that he's ever written including
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:10.480]   one of them is sort of a sequel a camera where it's a sequel or no it's a sequel to American
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:15.340]   Gods is a short story involving shadow in a Scottish mansion.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:16.340]   Oh great.
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.340]   Oh I have read this I'm going to have to get this.
[00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:19.340]   This sounds great.
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:25.740]   It's probably my best my favorite individual book that he's that he's written.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:29.540]   It says there's a short story set in the world of the Matrix.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.620]   Yeah, it's it's a it's a really wide ranging collection.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.620]   He's got a new one coming out I've been reading his blog.
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:38.620]   He's got a new book called the graveyard book that's coming out this fall that I just want
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.780]   I kneel I want to be your friend.
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:44.420]   I want to be one of those people that suddenly just receives one of these like pre-release
[00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:49.580]   galleys in a black and white cover just anonymously and it gets to read it too much in advance
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:51.500]   because I cannot wait to read this book.
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:55.500]   This is going to be one of those books graveyard book see it's see me makes it sound so interesting
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:56.700]   in his blog at Neil.
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:59:00.340]   Game and dot com that I just know that I'm not going to bank this one.
[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:03.860]   I'm going to cancel stuff for two or three days to make sure that it's actually a short
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.860]   novel I think but I'm going to cancel stuff for a day or two just so I can make sure I
[00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:12.420]   can really get the comfy chair get the cool soothing beverage make sure there's a flashlight
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.620]   nearby in case I need some extra light in the room suddenly and just enjoy the stuff.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:21.540]   But I don't think you can go wrong at all with Neil Gaiman's fragile things with audible.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:25.820]   It's one of the most satisfying audio books full stop that I've ever had.
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:27.940]   I'm going to play a little bit of it just so we can hear it because I haven't heard
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:31.140]   Neil's reading and then I want to tell you a story about Neil because we interviewed
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:34.060]   him on the screensavers and that was a really exciting moment.
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:38.980]   And every now and again the cake tastes better than you ever could have dreamed it would.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:45.060]   A study in Emerald won the Hugo award in August 2004 as best short stories from the forum
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.380]   still makes me intensely proud.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:51.380]   Yeah you can tell he can read and talk he can he can talk he can read he can bring it
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:54.180]   to life that's great a lot of times I don't like authors reading their own books because
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.340]   they're well better writers than our readers.
[00:59:56.340 --> 01:00:02.020]   But he's a storyteller really I think that if he could come to everybody's house and
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:06.500]   just read his stuff allowed for every single reader that would probably make him on some
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:12.940]   level much much happier not so much his wife's not so much his kids but we'd be happier.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.500]   We'd be happy.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:20.180]   We interviewed him on the screensavers and he you know we used to get people go behind
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:25.660]   the set and sign the set and he signed the set and I think he drew a little drawing of
[01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.900]   the sandman on the set.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.300]   I can actually I can actually top that a little bit.
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:37.420]   I have in my possession an original creative piece of original creative story poem Cohen
[01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:43.300]   whatever you want to say a collab the one and only collaboration between Neil Gaiman
[01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:49.660]   and an Apple Newton message pad because I went to a signing in in in the candles I went
[01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:55.540]   to I went to a book signing at a comic shop in Kendall Square in Boston like 91 92.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:59.380]   I had him sign my copy of I think was books of magic but I also had my Newton message
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:04.220]   pad with me and so I said please you know we would like to sign my sign my message pad
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:09.780]   I forgot to put it into graphic mode and so it tried it kept trying to interpret his
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:14.980]   signature into text and so he signed his name and then it turned into text so he kind of
[01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:18.660]   like frown a little bit signed to get it turned into text like oh my god it's like consulting
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:21.500]   the Oracle at Delphi I never did.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.020]   I make I make a coin I never know what it's going to come back.
[01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.020]   So it still is there on my name.
[01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:28.020]   You saved it though.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:31.100]   I've got it's like four sentences it's actually quite Neil Gaiman.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:35.940]   Ask I've thought about just you know printing out one copy and auctioning it off for like
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.820]   the comic book legal defense fund or something yeah because even even Neil himself does not
[01:01:39.820 --> 01:01:44.300]   know this text that he has written it's a collaboration of course but a collaboration
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.700]   between Neil and the and the and I like it and and and right and Russian handwriting recognition
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:54.780]   software they come that of they come that of a co partnership to to be sure but it yielded
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.100]   some interesting things.
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.100]   Very cool.
[01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.620]   Well that's our pick and a great pick I can't wait I just put it in my wish list that's
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:05.180]   one of the things you can do it's kind of like the queue for Netflix you put it in your wish
[01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:10.260]   list and and then the next time you have a credit you can buy it if you if you don't

[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:30.260]   of Neil Gaiman that's our pick for the week and we do thank audible so much for their
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:34.300]   support of Macbreak weekly I'm flying out to Newark to meet with them in about a month
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.860]   some exciting stuff going on I can't tell you about but I shall when it when the time
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:46.980]   comes let us move on to our picks of the week and I'm going to start this time because I
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:52.140]   have a little mini pick so I'm going to I'm going to just do my little mini pick and then
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:57.260]   you guys can do the real pick but at least my picks are are free and they're actually
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:04.580]   a couple of them Jeffrey Friedel wrote an incredible book that I love read and and keep
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:09.540]   with me at all times called mastering regular expressions he's the king of grep if you
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:12.300]   want to understand grep you must read this book but that's not my pick he apparently
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:17.540]   also is a pretty good darn programmer because he has written two plugins actually I think
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:24.020]   more than two plugins for Lightroom that allow you to quickly upload your Lightroom pictures
[01:03:24.020 --> 01:03:29.620]   to Flickr with just as a preset they're very simple but they're but they really really
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:36.660]   work very well and they're extensible he's kind of he's made this extensible architecture
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:44.500]   so that people can add to it he has a Lightroom export plugin for Flickr that does a lot of
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:48.500]   very cool things I know you guys are aperture guys but this would this is I'm a Lightroom
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:53.180]   guy and I I just happen to love it he also it also work I think for smug mug which is
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:04:01.180]   what I use it for and Zen folio so it's on Friedel's site they're free regex regex regex.info
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:06.580]   but he doesn't he should put a look on the front page because he's always updating this
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:14.100]   so there's the newest version 1.3 supports leopard supports the Nikon D3 and D300 it
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:19.180]   gives you a lot of settings and so forth so that you can completely control how it gets
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:28.660]   uploaded and finally as I said it has an SDK so that people can kind of add to the capabilities
[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.860]   of this plugin I really love it I've used a number of different plugins in Lightroom to
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:36.860]   get my stuff up to Flickr this is absolutely the easiest way and since I'm a Flickr and
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:42.780]   smug mug user it really solves the problem for me in one swell poop absolutely free
[01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:48.940]   highly recommended from Jeffrey Friedel thank you Jeffrey both for your book on regex because
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:52.340]   that that I tell you at any time I have to write a regular expression I have to drag your
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:58.900]   book out second edition is really good but also for the Lightroom 1.3 export plugins
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:07.260]   for smug mug Zen folio and Flickr that's my pick zero Alex's for that one Scott born
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:14.980]   you got something for us I do I've been playing around with trying to translate some words
[01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:20.100]   from various languages into English and so forth because on twip we've been getting
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:24.180]   a lot of international email and for some reason many of our listeners just assume that I'm
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:29.860]   fluent in their language and I doesn't Scott born of course use his iPhone to tell and
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:34.260]   understand everything is a vest made of them well actually to tell you the truth I do now
[01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:40.900]   see because of a program called ultra lingua which is available for the iPhone and the touch
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:49.780]   it's sexy 2995 and it translates into a bunch of different languages it's also a great dictionary
[01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:58.100]   it's it's amazing what it can do and it I picked it because I actually found it when I was just
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:03.780]   looking for a good dictionary and it has a you know an amazing dictionary in it but the ability to
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:10.820]   very quickly translate words back and forth is pretty it's pretty amazing and it must have
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:16.740]   a so it's a web it's a web app yeah yeah it's a web app and you can use it on the regular web of
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:24.180]   course right but it has the ability and by the way it works on Windows mobile all kinds of smartphones
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:31.300]   now see this is where you wish that you had cut and paste yes and and we will in june and here
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:37.060]   you know here just some of the translation dictionaries french to english spanish english german
[01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:46.500]   portuguese Italian norwegian um french german german french etc my favorite my personal favorite
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:55.380]   is the esperanto english translations um there's even like gramatica for it um why do I get the
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:07:01.380]   impression that Andy and Akos speaks esperanto I I wondered frankly don't you think that he does
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:07.300]   though he might he seems like the kind of guy who would actually it's either that or or a Klingon
[01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:14.340]   yeah anyway there obviously there's a lot of stuff in here um but I actually just got it
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:19.620]   because the english definitions and the source initially and then found out it had a french
[01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:25.540]   definitions and synonyms section and all these translations for 30 bucks I mean if you do any
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:31.060]   this kind of work it'll pay for itself really quickly and it's very low price and and you can
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:41.540]   get it um at ultra lingua.com so I presume that everybody does stuff like this is is working hard
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:48.500]   beavering away to do it as a standalone app yeah I'm assuming that they've got an sdk in their
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:54.260]   pocket and uh and why do you say that we'll have cut and paste in june oh we will trust me just
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:00.340]   trust me you think that's part of 2.0 I do you have to have it yeah well we'll have we'll have
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:05.380]   stuff like parental controls cut and paste a lot of things you haven't seen yet good search search
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:10.180]   search that was the thing I loved about the palm when it came out man that was so cool you could
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:15.940]   search everything and if for some reason apple drops the ball and what I believe they're going to do
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:20.740]   what I've heard rumors are going to do then trust me one of these third party apps will come to the
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:25.940]   rescue and solve these problems but tricky though if you don't have uh you know you can't run in
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:30.020]   the background that's something you need to run in the background yeah I don't know how they'll
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:34.500]   pull it off but I'm I'm convinced that with some of john doe's money somebody'll figure it out there's
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:40.820]   enough and and I've already emailed uh you know this company to say I hope you got the sdk and
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:46.500]   and they didn't email me back but I I would love to see this dictionary as a native app on the
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:51.380]   iPhone it would immediately be the first thing I would personally buy because I've just come to
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:54.900]   you know sometimes I'll just be sitting around and go how do you say this in spanish and I'll just
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:09:00.260]   type in a word for entertainment I know that's silly but I enjoy it I think no that's kind of fun
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:09.220]   in fact I'm going to use now the lingvo.org traduko to translate uh uh for the esperato
[01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:15.860]   listeners in our audience I'm going to translate everything you know down many everything you just
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:22.740]   said into esperato lingvo.org and here it is ladies I'm sorry I was gonna say ladies gentlemen it's
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.780]   you take that back.
[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:33.780]   [laughter]
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.780]   My grandmother was a good woman.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.980]   A good hard working woman from the uelitus would never understand.
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:45.780]   Parolo this this is this is it in in synthesis apparently they have a speech synthesizer on here
[01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:48.780]   as well it's gonna speak.
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:50.780]   [speaking in foreign language]
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.780]   It sounds like uh portuguese.
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:56.780]   Great enough two reasons for not understanding what that was saying.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:59.780]   [speaking in foreign language]
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.780]   [speaking in foreign language]
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.780]   That was pretty good really you speak it?
[01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.780]   Heck no but it sounded convincing to me.
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:07.780]   [laughter]
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.780]   You Mr. Colingleo.
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:09.780]   [laughter]
[01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:10.780]   You went needs you.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.780]   [laughter]
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.780]   What is your pick Mr. Enatko?
[01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:20.780]   My uh uh my pick of the week is actually uh tied into the audible pick of the week.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:25.780]   One I found out that one of the stories in uh fragile things is actually available from
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:28.780]   HarperCollins as a free mp3 download.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:33.780]   So you can get uh one of the best I've probably I've been using it's hard not to use the
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:36.780]   perlatives when we're talking about gaming but definitely one of my one of my favorite
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:39.780]   short stories he's ever done called A Study in Emerald.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:45.780]   Uh just right off of uh right off of that other book uh read by Neil uh it's a really
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.780]   powerful story uh satisfying on so many levels.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.780]   It's set in the world of Sherlock Holmes.
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:53.780]   I will not reveal anything else above that because.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.780]   Ooh I like that.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:59.780]   The punch of this is just letting it unfold around you.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:02.780]   It's a very very satisfying for fans of Sherlock Holmes.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.780]   It's very satisfying for fans of Neil Gaiman.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.780]   It's just a very satisfying thing full stop.
[01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:14.780]   Uh you can download it for free from harpercolonsebooks.com uh the name of the publisher plus
[01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:15.780]   ebooks.com.

[01:11:25.780 --> 01:11:27.780]   [Laughs]
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:30.780]   Uh I have so mine is is is a little out there.
[01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.780]   It's zero Alex's.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:32.780]   Okay.
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:37.780]   It is uh it's free and uh for people who have been in in the Mac community for a long time.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:44.780]   Uh we used to remember before Bungie was owned by Microsoft uh they were uh you know they made
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.780]   Mac programs.
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.780]   Oh the Mac game of all time.
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:48.780]   Marathon.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:49.780]   Yay.
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:52.780]   And a lot of us were really really into marathon.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:53.780]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:56.780]   And uh and we played a little more than we should have and uh we were really tied into it.
[01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.980]   Well I was uh I was on the flight back uh with the friends Stu Mashowitz who's over at the
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:06.780]   orphanage and he said I have something to show you and he opened it up and it's marathon
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:12.780]   running on OS X. And uh and of course I was a little excited and it turns out they open sourced
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:13.780]   it.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:18.660]   So source.bungie.org um there is a marathon open source and it's been just recently updated
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:21.660]   with an entirely new marathon scenario.
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:26.860]   And um and so uh and and the thing is is what was great is you know we used to have to restart
[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:30.900]   our computers with all the extensions off to play marathon to get frame rate.
[01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:37.060]   Now I turned like every dial to 11 you know in the settings and I can't get it to go below
[01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.540]   30 frames a second you know because I mean every texture maps like and if you you know
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:43.540]   Halo really is just marathon.
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:47.660]   It's it's it's a bigger yeah bigger version of marathon but the idea is is that there
[01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:51.900]   is a something free that we can all play with we can all develop for we can all you know
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:52.900]   play.
[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.700]   Is the engine pretty good you think?
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:56.820]   What is the engine pretty good?
[01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:00.400]   And you know I I just started running around I didn't I haven't tried doing you know every
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.780]   man for himself or anything else that's that's particularly into it but what I'm hoping
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.540]   is is that a lot of our listeners will go download it.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:10.300]   And uh and then we can start because they have the whole thing all set up for internet
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:15.060]   play and being able to you know be able to do tournaments over the internet and it's
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.340]   a little retro which I which I think is actually fun.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:22.820]   I don't you know I don't need it to be Halo you know and I and uh I think that it would
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:25.820]   you know I'm hoping that a lot of people will go download it and then and then I have more
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:26.820]   people to play with.
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.820]   You know that's it.
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.460]   By the way Windows Mac Analytics so Windows Mac Analytics so you're not you know no matter
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:36.180]   what you can do it but this is the but the of course it started on those of you as I
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:40.900]   said I figured that I hadn't even ever heard of it I'm sure you know it's been out you
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:47.740]   know they really did it in 2000 2001 but they just released a new a new scenario just
[01:13:47.740 --> 01:13:49.500]   at the end of February.
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:53.980]   And so and you can also download high-res textures to ramp up all the ones so that looks a little
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:14:00.340]   prettier and and anyway I'm yeah I'm gonna be curious to see I warned the the folks on
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:03.020]   the online thing I was kind of like because I just found out about it you know over the
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:08.780]   weekend and I was like you might see a slight bump in traffic and you must all download
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:10.100]   it and we will have.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.300]   Well we're gonna make break weekly tournament.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.840]   Yeah we're gonna figure that out so so people should download it they should they should
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.940]   acquaint themselves with it and we'll figure out what we're gonna do I don't know when
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:22.020]   we're gonna do it I don't know how we're gonna do it but we're gonna do it.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.980]   I think that's great.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:28.100]   So and it's free you can just go download it you can play it it's a great game and a
[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:29.100]   lot of fun.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.540]   Does somebody have to run a server for that to I guess so huh.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:34.180]   I think so but I think that there's you know there's server trackers I haven't figured
[01:14:34.180 --> 01:14:36.260]   all that out but we'll do an update after we get it really.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.260]   Let's figure it out and we could.
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:40.300]   The only thing to figure it out is for lots of people to download it and get launched
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.300]   so we can figure out.
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:45.420]   And maybe we could do it like after you know the release day every Wednesday evening we
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.300]   could have a marathon tournament when the when the show comes out.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.140]   I can notice it on my server if we need to.
[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:52.780]   Yeah let's do it.
[01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:55.660]   Alright yeah yeah so that's that's my pick for the week.
