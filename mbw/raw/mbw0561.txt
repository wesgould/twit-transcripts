[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   here, Alex Lindsey's here, we're all gonna get together and talk about next week.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.880]   Because WWDC is on its way.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.840]   What will Apple announce?
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.400]   New laptops, a new Siri device, new iMacs, maybe even new Mac minis.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.080]   Stay tuned for our speculation right after this.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.000]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.960]   As we get close, the countdown to dub dub DC.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.840]   Renee Richie is here from Montreal, though he'll be in the Bay Area soon.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.040]   >> Is Sir, leave Saturday.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.360]   >> I'm more.com.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.560]   >> Yikes.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.240]   Here we go.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.240]   >> Like Christmas and Apple Day all rolled in together.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.520]   >> Andy Enoco also here from the Chicago Sun.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.280]   Times.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.120]   >> Hi there.
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.160]   >> Hi there.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.480]   >> I am the designated survivor of the panel.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.600]   You're not allowed to use the East Coast.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.760]   If this was just some sort of evil plan of Apple to move on to the stage two of a stage 19 of their plan
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.520]   and locking the doors and gassing everybody or putting in some sort of a chip.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.520]   >> Jesus, that got dark.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:30.640]   >> I mean, in the classic Batman thing, working gas everybody, everybody's unconscious for
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.040]   like a gold figure.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.560]   >> And then when they wake up, they find that in their name, amazing reviews of everything
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.360]   they announced have just been posted to every single album.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.480]   >> And lo and behold, I had a dream last night that the prodigal son would return to
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480]   Mac break weekly.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   Here he is, Alex Lindsey.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.280]   >> Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.360]   >> From the Pixelcore.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   It is well.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.240]   They will be streaming WWDC Monday, 10 a.m.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.520]   Pacific.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.920]   Add it to your calendar, says Apple.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.200]   >> Oh, and breaking news, Leo relevant to our interest.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.760]   They've just announced a schedule and they're going to have Apple podcast studio.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.080]   So podcasters can reserve the same day for up to an hour of on site podcasting up to four
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.280]   stations per podcast, 60 minutes with Apple experts to help you get your recording done.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.880]   >> What are we doing, Carsten on Monday?
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.080]   >> I will not be here.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.200]   I'll be in an airplane to Miami.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.480]   >> We will be live streaming the keynote as usual.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.480]   >> As per usual, we'll be here in the morning.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.360]   We Adam Curry and John C. Devorek hosting our coverage because everybody else is gone.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.880]   No, actually, I don't have we booked anybody?
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   >> Yes, it will be Nate.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.680]   >> Nathan Oliveris Giles.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.480]   Megan Marroni.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.680]   Andy, if you'd like to join us, you're more than welcome to.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.520]   >> Dub Dub DC may have.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.480]   Now, it's a worldwide developers conference, but nowadays, Apple takes every opportunity
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.680]   in front of the press to tout something that's of interest to the public, right?
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.680]   >> Yes, it's an opportunity to tell the story of what they think is important and what moves
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.880]   them over the next year.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.600]   Since they have to turn over so many cards for developers over the next week, rather
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.280]   than have that sort of stuff leak out and say, "That's interesting.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.600]   There's a new window type that involves having an actual emoji of a thumb on the corner.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.000]   I wonder what that means."
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.840]   So that's why they'll spend an hour, hour and a half saying, "Okay, it's the best version
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.200]   of Mac OS ever and here's why we're doing that."
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.360]   So, yeah, if the world's just, it's, I love how these past two or three months work.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.560]   It's Microsoft and Google and Facebook and Apple, all, they don't have a constitution
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.360]   that forces them to do an annual state of the union address, but this is their state
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.760]   of the union address.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.560]   Google came out really strong last time and now we get to sort of see what Apple wants
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.480]   people to think of it for the next year.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.360]   >> MacBooks.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.240]   >> I think Gurman said MacBooks, so I think we can trust that that will be.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.960]   MacBooks are MacBook Pros, that will be.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   >> Some interesting stuff.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.840]   I mean, Apple didn't do the KVLakes previously because they didn't have the right chips.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.280]   Maybe they have the KVLakes chips they want now and until it just announced I9, which
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.280]   is super interesting.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.280]   >> Isn't that interesting?
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.800]   This is the high performance desktop processor.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.920]   >> Yeah, like 12 cores, I think.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.680]   I think you go over 15.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.680]   >> 15?
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.680]   It's some ridiculous number of cores.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.880]   >> NAMD has their, was their thread ripper.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:41.320]   >> Well, what's so funny is I didn't really realize the market for this, besides people
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.520]   like Alex Lindsey, is Twitch streamers.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.520]   >> Wow.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.440]   >> Because they are playing a game, probably a fairly challenging game at the same time
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.680]   as they're encoding and sending live video all in the same PC.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.680]   So.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.160]   >> Yeah, I mean, and if you look at some of the like the razor, I have a razor and with
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.880]   its ability with a KVLakes chip to do an awful lot is pretty amazing.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.000]   >> You know, so it's, it's, there's a lot of, a lot of power in those, in the new chips.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.560]   >> Up to 18 cores in the I9.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.560]   >> Oh my God, this is the new X series and an AMD, it's interesting at the same time.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.840]   I guess it's because Computex is the big PC conference in Taiwan.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.680]   Taipei is going on right now, but.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.640]   >> Same day, both, both announced extreme additions.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.520]   >> Yeah, we have Alex Toby from Android Central there.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.160]   I think he's going to be at that event.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.160]   >> Uh.
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.760]   >> It'd be fun.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.920]   >> Ryzen, which is AMD's hardcore part will not, is not going to be a Ryzen for their high
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.280]   and desktop platform.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.920]   It's going to be, or is it?
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.960]   >> The thread ripper is a Ryzen is Ryzen platform.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.960]   >> Okay.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   Threadripper.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   >> What a great name.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.160]   >> 16 cores, 32 threads on the X3.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.960]   >> That rip out.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960]   >> Icebreaker.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.040]   >> It's really interesting if Apple, boy, it'd be a big deal if Apple decided to put AMD
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.040]   in.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.040]   I mean, it's all like say six.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.160]   >> Like competition, like as long as they're all making great chips that is better for us,
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.240]   if they're just depending on whatever Intel, you know, squats out every year, that's not
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   great for anybody.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.240]   >> Right.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.360]   >> I wouldn't, has Apple ever done an AMD?
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   I don't think so, no.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.960]   >> Not a CPU, they've done graphics, they've done the GPUs, but that's right.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   >> That's right.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   >> They're going very different.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.600]   Like the Intel CPUs are going high where they're making singles, GPUs that are super powerful,
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.480]   where I think AMD's goal is to make, is to go wide, which is similar what Apple does,
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.360]   to try to make the multiple GPUs that talk together and present as one logical GPU.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.440]   And that's, I don't think anyone's ever done that well yet.
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.080]   So I'll be interesting to see if they can.
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.080]   Super interesting.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.280]   So excited, Leo.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.200]   >> I have, I just bought a, I gave up on Apple and I bought a KB Lake Windows machine.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.840]   >> So that means they're shipping for sure.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.960]   >> Which means for sure they're going to do it.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.400]   >> Which means that Renee, it's between you and me to serve as the new host of the show.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   >> Yeah, I'm leaving.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   >> I'm going to do busy.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   >> Thank you everybody.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   Goodbye.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.800]   It's bad enough that I do the show on a Surface studio, but then.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.240]   >> And you're playing Xbox Live while the show is on.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.320]   >> You know what, this convinced me that I do want touch even on the laptop.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.960]   And I noticed when I'm using it, I use it.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.280]   It's really, it's an alternate input method.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.840]   It's not like my full-time input method, but I still use, I still use the mouse, I still
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.240]   use the keyboard.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.760]   But you know, sometimes it's like, there's just a button and you just want to hit it,
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.760]   you just hit it.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.600]   >> I use it a lot for scrolling.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.200]   It's a very natural way to scroll.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   And I like that.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.920]   >> I don't feel like you need to rebuild the entire operating system just to make it
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.920]   touch.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.440]   You know, it's just that there are certain things that are easier to touch.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.600]   It's easier to draw on things.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   It's easier to make.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.000]   You know, those are the kind of things that I think are just a lot easier to manage.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   >> And Mirazoc.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   >> I'll track that on the screen.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.800]   I just take the exact same commands on the trackpad and put them on the screen.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.680]   >> Well, and that's kind of Apple's response to touch was, oh, we'll just put it in the
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   trackpad slash touch.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   >> But do the screen too.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.440]   Like just everything around the trackpad, put it in the screen too.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.320]   Don't care about the hitting little tiny touch tap talk.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.080]   Is there any chance that they will do that?
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   >> No.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.080]   >> No.
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.080]   >> No problem.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:04.120]   >> Apple's just not the company that would say we think that this is a cool thing for
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.400]   people to figure out if they like or not.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.000]   They always, and this is a good thing about them.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.600]   They always think about, we don't want to give you a feature.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.560]   We want to, we don't want to give you a piece of hardware.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.240]   We want to give you a solution to a problem and until we can present this as an entire
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.240]   solution to a problem that is deeper than I'd maybe, some people want to touch the screen,
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.720]   they're not going to do it.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   >> Also better keyboard.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.000]   It's a Lenovo ThinkPad, better keyboard.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.800]   Not as good as the old Lenovo's, but still pretty darn good.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.280]   A lot better than the MacBook and MacBook.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:39.040]   >> Better than the Atari 400, which makes it better than the MacBook Pro.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.520]   >> Ports, it's got two Thunderbolt ports.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:47.160]   And by the way, it will use a Macintosh charger to charge, which is always handy.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:54.080]   I have a few of those, but it also has three Type A, USB 3.0 ports.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.600]   It also has a full size HDMI port.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.920]   It has a weird mini ethernet port.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.480]   That's a little strange, but at least it does have a physical ethernet port and I just bought
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.160]   the adapter.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.880]   I feel like I was tired of compromising.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.240]   Yeah, I much prefer.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240]   Here's where I miss it.
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.640]   Here's where I really miss it.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:16.240]   So I'm using, I use a lot of open source utilities.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.960]   I use a GPG, a new privacy guard for encrypting and signing email.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   And there's no problem.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.240]   I have GPG on the Windows machine, but I want to do what I can do on the Mac, which is drop
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.680]   to the terminal and run it from the command line.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.440]   And you kind of sort of can, because they put bash on there.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.000]   It's Ubuntu on Windows.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.320]   Just oh, it's horrible.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.640]   It's a Caliban.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:46.400]   But I can't get to the folder because it's, it's true to it and it's just, it's weird.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.320]   And I just want to drop into the terminal.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.800]   Everyone's why I do miss that.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.000]   That's the thing that Apple does, I think really nicely for some people.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.960]   Yeah, I'm keen to see what they're going to do when they show off the new Macbooks next
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.760]   week and there's, they're almost certainly going, all the indicators are that there
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.200]   are going to be announcements of new Macbooks next week.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.120]   And I don't know if they're going to do, hey, we got, we gave, we hit now have the new processors
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.200]   that you've been really wanting for the past since the George Bush administration.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   Hey now.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:18.880]   And, but I'm wondering if they're also going to sort of indicate show off at least hint
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.200]   at a roadmap for the future.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.360]   Because I don't, I don't anticipate anything revolutionary beyond, it'll look, they'll look
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.360]   the same.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   They'll look the same.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   They'll look the same.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   They'll look the same.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   They'll look the same, they'll look the same.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.060]   But it'll give them a chance to refine the story of the touch bar.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.500]   Certainly at WWDC, they have a chance to say who are here.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.040]   We've now had six months of experience looking at how people and how developers are using
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   the touch bar.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   So now we've refined it.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.140]   And now here's a better, we'll hear the new resources that you're going to have in the
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:46.620]   next version of the operating system.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:54.460]   I do think that this is a year when a lot of people are done settling for some compute,
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.380]   for a laptop that they don't really like.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:02.380]   I hope that this is a year in which people don't just buy the next, oh good, this new
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.380]   CPU.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.380]   I still hate this.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:05.580]   I still think this is a big pain in the butt.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:10.900]   I still wish I had a computer that's more like my wife's who has all these ports and
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.700]   it's a lot more easy to use that I keep borrowing all the time.
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.780]   I really want people to stop settling for something that they might not like.
[00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.700]   If you love the machine you're buying, great.
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.380]   You don't have to listen to anybody who disagrees with you because it's all about you and some
[00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.380]   about the new one.
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.380]   I'm super happy.
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:31.980]   But don't think that, well, I've always, I have not bought a, my primary computer has
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.540]   never not been a Mac ever since I was in college.
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.340]   No, I was in high school.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.700]   I can't not have a Mac.
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.660]   Always make that look at it and say if there's something that really cheeses you off, you're
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.620]   not supposed to spend $2,000 for a computer you don't like, especially if you did not
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.340]   spend some time looking at alternatives that you might absolutely be in love with.
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.660]   This is kind of where Apple has a, I guess it's an advantage disadvantage.
[00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:58.940]   A lot of what Apple has going for it is advantage and disadvantage.
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:03.740]   The advantage disadvantage Apple has is that it's, you know, there's, Apple makes all the
[00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:04.740]   hardware.
[00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.820]   So there's a very kind of clear, you almost could say buy the Apple you can afford because
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:14.300]   there's just the kind of this clear linear thing of, excuse me, on the disadvantage side
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.100]   is there is this massive Windows ecosystem and there's hundreds of hardware manufacturers
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:24.860]   and every possible bizarre configuration you can imagine.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.180]   And so you do have choice on the Windows side.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.420]   Sometimes, you know, Apple's not famous for choice, is it?
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.420]   That's not really what I've all about.
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.580]   Again, there are advantages to Apple's approach.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.660]   There's advantages to Microsoft's approach.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.020]   And rather than going to another 20 minute thing that people on Twitter are not going
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.420]   to like, I'll just say that I think that in the past Apple has been more aware and more
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:48.940]   determined to say, well, if we're the only people making Macs, we've got to make sure
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.260]   that we have a breadth of portfolio so that everybody who's interested in a notebook will
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.860]   find something that they can like, if not love, at least like in our line.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.020]   And now they're simply saying, we're for everybody who we have a different MacBook
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.580]   Air for everybody who wants an MacBook Air.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.580]   Yeah, but I don't want to make my book here.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.420]   And now here's your MacBook Pro Air.
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.420]   You're welcome.
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.420]   Do I have one?
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:16.140]   You're welcome, I said, and it says a new CPU, but I don't like your welcome.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:20.100]   How long before somebody is so Sarah in the chatroom and I agree with her says Apple's
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.660]   on its heels with laptops in particular.
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:29.460]   But Cobra Colorado Bra points out that Apple has the cool factor every time you go to a
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:36.140]   conference, even even Windows press conferences, every celebrity, they all have that Apple glowing
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:39.980]   Apple logo shining until they don't.
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:40.980]   I mean, how long?
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.980]   And the logo doesn't glow in more Leo.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:43.980]   That's right.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:44.980]   I want to give that advantage.
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:45.980]   No more glowing.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.980]   Thank you.
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:53.780]   And an all to all to my direct irony, the like behind the Apple logo on Mac has gone out.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.180]   Oh God.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.940]   But I know what Alex Lindsey is waiting for.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.340]   You didn't care about the Mac books.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.500]   He cares about a Mac mini and I'm a Mac pro.
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.340]   You use that you want desktops, right?
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.460]   I mean, I'm sure you've laptops.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.300]   We have a we have a lot of laptops.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.300]   It's not like the minis.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.300]   I know, right?
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.300]   But I love the minis.
[00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.740]   I mean, we have we use them a lot for as again, utility tools.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.260]   And they're really, really great because I can rack two of them into.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.860]   I mean, again, what we really want is the ability to have some rack mountable solutions.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.740]   And so I'd love to see better minis.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.740]   I really would.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.900]   That would be really that's an opportunity for Apple.
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:28.900]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.300]   And for us, I mean, the upgrades that we've had to do and mostly just moving them to SSD
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:38.180]   drives from from the spinning drives that they had and and what do you use a putty putty
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.420]   knife to open them?
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:41.140]   I don't know how the guys do it to be honest with you.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.500]   I just know that's a real skill.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.780]   It's not an easy thing to open a Mac mini.
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.780]   We got a guy.
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.780]   We got a second story, man.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:47.780]   I've been applying size.
[00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.460]   I told you guys, I bought one two or three weeks ago.
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.340]   So we went about Mac OS server and it was running out.
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.900]   Copy 10 and that just broke my heart.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.900]   Oh, I know.
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.900]   You just say that.
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:57.900]   Don't move.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:58.900]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.900]   Come on.
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.460]   Come on, guys, at least go around the store and put put.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.460]   Put zero.
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.460]   Restrink.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.460]   Grab them.
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.300]   The most you can get right now.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.300]   So they don't get any hardware.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.300]   Let me see.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.820]   You will buy them so they don't update them.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.780]   Let me see how I how much I can load up a Mac mini here.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:17.980]   If I could put a three gigahertz dualized seven in it.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:18.980]   No more than 16.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.980]   That's not even Skylake.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.980]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.980]   I wish I could put a terabyte TC.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.980]   I don't even think it's Broadwell.
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:26.980]   Is it still Haswell?
[00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:27.980]   Oh, my God.
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.660]   Well, but you plug it in.
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.980]   So that's less important, right?
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.700]   And I think that for us, we're not.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.900]   We don't really need it to be high performance.
[00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:41.340]   We're using it for, you know, we actually use probably more of them for producing scopes,
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.980]   you know, video scopes than probably anything.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.060]   Well, yeah, I don't we shouldn't be spec monkeys.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.860]   I mean, the spec monkeys out there say, well, you don't have a, you know, a KB like I seven.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.860]   What good is it?
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.860]   That's you're right.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.860]   You don't.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:53.860]   We're not.
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:54.860]   We're not.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.860]   We're not.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.860]   We're not.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.860]   We're not in terms of feature.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:58.860]   Like if you don't have Bluetooth 4.0, you don't get half the features of continuity or
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:16:59.860]   anything anymore.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.860]   So if they're not updating those things with latest radio technology and chipsets and
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.860]   they're not the future.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.860]   They're not.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.860]   I think not.
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.660]   Well, I don't I think that's got Bluetooth 4.0 on it, but I don't know like it doesn't
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.820]   have the latest chipset and who knows what's going to be table stakes in a year or two
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.820]   with me for now.
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:16.220]   I mean, yeah, when we think of the the trash cans and when we think of the IMAX, we think
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.100]   of performance for the minis.
[00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.100]   They are for us anyway, they are glue, you know, they're going to play out.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.300]   Yeah, they're going to, you know, do some some kind of video thing.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.460]   They're going to produce some web for the wall or, you know, there's lots of little bits
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.460]   and pieces, but we're not trying to run a business on them, you know, or do heavy duty
[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.780]   graphics or anything else.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.300]   That's what we expect to do from our again, from the trash cans or from the from the
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:44.340]   Mac minis or the Mac pros, I shouldn't say trash can, but I wonder how well those because
[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.380]   there's a similar form factor in the PC world.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.100]   Intel calls it NUC, the new unit of computing.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.380]   Everybody makes these things.
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.820]   I wonder how well those do on the PC side.
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:53.820]   They're okay.
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.220]   We have one for a server.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.220]   I just love it.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.220]   It's just in my office.
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.620]   It's a little server and it's great.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.620]   Like I ordered one.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.780]   I think you know, I was going to get a knock and it was like a nut kit.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.780]   So then it's kind of becomes a put together.
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.500]   You get a new egg, you're going to get a bare bones, NUC.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.500]   Eddie has a very pies it up.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.100]   You want a knuckle sandwich.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.020]   You don't want to give me the man is baloney and the lettuce.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.020]   I want all three.
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.020]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.020]   Yeah.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.020]   I got pretty excited.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.020]   Wow.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.420]   You mean that I can get like an I seven base like NUC for only $180 like, Oh, no, that's
[00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:26.820]   only if you don't want if you don't want to have a CPU or a hard drive or Wi-Fi or okay.
[00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.820]   Love you.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.100]   But I like the form factor.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.100]   I really do.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:36.860]   And really the truth is you could even desktop computing, you know, you get spend the money
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:40.980]   on a monitor keyboard and mouse and you put the NUC underneath the desk or whatever.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:47.340]   I had a we did an event that it wasn't us, but another company had a NUC for every screen
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:51.740]   and it was you know, looking at a web browser, you know, and looking at different pages that
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.780]   were updating with images and movies and everything else and driving like 30 screens.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.580]   But there's like 30 little nucks all like, you know, tied together.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.140]   And it was interesting when you have so many little computers, you can do a lot of you
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.140]   can have a lot of fun with it.
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.540]   I feel like it's a little opportunism, but Apple's very good at focusing.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:11.620]   It's at, you know, not being distracted and that would maybe be a distraction.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.620]   How about the iMac?
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:13.620]   It's do.
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:17.620]   Well, we see an iMac update next month next week.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.260]   To be detected, the timing is always to be determined.
[00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.900]   Those could be press releases depending on how like if to get stage time, it has to be
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.900]   pretty impressive.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.380]   Otherwise, it could just be a press release could be a press release the week after,
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.700]   but they're due for the KB like updates and maybe they're due for one of those new impressive
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.700]   Intel chip updates because Tim Cook said that they're going to have more more pro level
[00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:34.700]   desktop iMacs.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.340]   He said that this year, I think, right?
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.420]   He said that this year and at the very end of last year in that in that employee QA update,
[00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.740]   he said, but I mean, he said we're not going to do a new Mac Pro this year, but we will
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.980]   have something for you.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.380]   Although didn't he say by the end of the year in the iMac, maybe you said, which is why
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.380]   the timing.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.380]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.380]   Like depending on availability of the new chips and things.
[00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.780]   It's interesting the language that they use.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:03.460]   I think Apple has historically said that I think that I think that we get ourselves in
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:08.260]   trouble as users and as consumers because when we think that, oh, we've got new great
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.700]   new stuff for pro users coming up, we assume, oh, great, you're going to be updating the
[00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:13.340]   Mac Pro or oh my God, that's great.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.100]   You're going to be doing this when they have they're looking at user data and they're saying
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.460]   that, well, most of our pro users, admittedly because they've been horrified by our Mac Pro
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.460]   towers.
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.540]   I've been using iMacs, but they're happy with them.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:29.180]   So why don't we make iMacs that are more heavy duty that are more suited for people who are
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.180]   doing using pro type apps.
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:35.580]   And that is in fact the rumor that they would put Zions in these.
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.140]   They would put you know, server class processors.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.740]   But those are before the X1.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.540]   So it'll be interesting to see which ones they choose.
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:42.540]   ECC RAM.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.020]   Yeah, the X1 might be better.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.020]   Right.
[00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:46.020]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.580]   There's also the question of how would they have to really reengineer what's inside that
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.940]   to deal with the heat dissipation because these processors, they are designed to be, they're
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:57.580]   designed to be cooled by like chilled olive oil bubblers.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.980]   They're designed to have their design to live in rooms that are just screening with fans
[00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:02.980]   all the time.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:08.420]   So they might actually have to make an iMac that has a bezel that is maybe three millimeters
[00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.420]   thick.
[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.420]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.420]   See, that's not as vomiting.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:14.940]   And I think if you're really, if you're buying a server, you don't want the i'm you don't
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.140]   want this, you know, monitor.
[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:22.380]   You want a Mac mini sized device or I mean, or let's face it or cheese, greater Mac.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.380]   That's what you want.
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.300]   Well, I don't think again, I think that I think that the opportunity for Apple and I
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:31.780]   think I talked about this earlier, but you know, three you, you know, really nice, very
[00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:37.500]   modular piece that you could what what Apple could really innovate on, I think is making
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.620]   it just work and also making it easy to slide and change things like slide things in and
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.620]   out.
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.020]   So servers become this.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.940]   We have a lot of servers and you think, sir, I'm out format like a one you or I just think,
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.720]   I think I think you could build something that could stand up, but could also you could put
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.020]   ears on it and slide it in, you know, and, and have it look really cool on the front
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.580]   and have it, but in the back, be able to, okay, I want to pull this module out or put
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:06.580]   another module in and have things very, very easy to use and easy to upgrade, easy to add
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.900]   cards, you know, maybe put sleeves and cards where you can just slide them in rather than
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.020]   this whole like, I'm going to jam them all in.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.440]   I mean, you know, it's, you know, when you open up a server, you know, it's it's, it's,
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.580]   it's like having surgery every time, you know,
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.580]   and sonnet makes,
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:21.060]   I could be, I could be improved a lot.
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.860]   Sonnet makes one you, uh, Mac mini rack mounts and get too many's in it.
[00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:29.140]   We have, we just get Alex, number to Apple as fast as possible.
[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.100]   Please the Alex Lindsay console.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.100]   He's not included.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.100]   Yeah, we have.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.340]   We have, we have, we have, it looks like, it looks like two, 20 of these really.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.340]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.340]   Wow.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.260]   So they're just the right size to one you.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.260]   That's interesting.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.180]   Yeah, we, yeah, we, we have a lot.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.180]   Yeah, those are.
[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:46.380]   So if these were more powerful, promise cooling in this too.
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.420]   I mean, you know, it's, it's fine.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.420]   Those, those work really well.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.420]   We have lots of them.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   We use them all the, all the time.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.420]   Interesting.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.420]   To rack our minis.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.940]   I mean, that's really, that's how all of our minis sit.
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.740]   I mean, they're always racked up.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.940]   So that's a great way to drop the mini slider.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:22:59.940]   Another one Leo.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:00.940]   It's just like a Drobo.
[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:01.940]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:02.940]   No kidding.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.940]   Hot, swappable Mac minis.
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:05.940]   Uh, wow.
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.740]   And you can even look at, they even have a slot in the front.
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.300]   If you want to feed them a DVD, pull one out of the phone.
[00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.620]   They, they, it's a really funny thing because the power on the Mac minis is on the back,
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.620]   right?
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.860]   And you have to power them from the front.
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.620]   And so what you do is there, there's actually a button and it's a really cool little mechanical
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.220]   thing that goes around and pulls back.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.380]   And then so when you push the button in the front, it pushes the button in the back.
[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:29.820]   And it's a, it's a, oh, that's a, is it a mechanical thing?
[00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:31.820]   It's a mechanic.
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:32.820]   A little arm.
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.820]   That's a little arm.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.820]   That's a little arm.
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.820]   Teracle.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.820]   Oh yeah, there it is.
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.820]   Power button levers.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.820]   Oh, that's so funny.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.980]   It's, it's, that's tuck up.
[00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:41.980]   That's the word.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.460]   Cluj is the thing that leaps to mind when you see that.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.460]   Hey, but it works.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.460]   But it works.
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:54.060]   And, but the fact that this exists is testimony to the fact that there's a, there is a demand
[00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.140]   for something like this.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.620]   Maybe Apple's just said it's too small.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.100]   It's not a big enough business.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.100]   But that makes me sad.
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.100]   A hundred billion.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.900]   A unit Apple now.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.900]   Yeah, I know.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.900]   They don't care.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:04.900]   And I don't care.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.380]   It's not, they, they care.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.460]   I shouldn't say they don't care.
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.460]   They do care.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:10.460]   But you have to pick your, you know, you can't.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.140]   And you can't do everything.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.460]   You know, and, and, or do everything well.
[00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.100]   But I think that one of the other things for, for large customers, and I don't know whether
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.980]   Apple's aimed at it, but you know, for a lot of these larger customers, they don't actually
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.980]   have the computers right in front of the artist anyway.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:26.500]   I mean, that's why the RackMatter will make more sense in a lot of ways because you're
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.100]   taking those, you're, you're actually the computers are in a server farm somewhere.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.580]   And then there, it's much more efficient than just use fiber to bring it all back.
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.980]   And so you're actually typing and all you have as a monitor, your input devices and
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:37.980]   so on and so forth.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.660]   And you're not really, you know, plugging straight into the computer.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.260]   You know, you don't have one at every desk.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.940]   A lot of quality PC hardware though, just makes more sense for this, frankly, running a unique
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.700]   style OS.
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:55.060]   If you don't want to Mac, you know, if you don't need whatever it is that that, well,
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.860]   I mean, what is it that you use that you have to have a Mac for logic?
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.860]   I mean, what?
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.700]   Well, we still use Final Cut.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:02.700]   Final Cut.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.060]   So that's, that's a big one for us.
[00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.740]   But, but also, you know, we use Final Cut.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.140]   We use a program called Spectre, Scope Box.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.460]   Those are all things that are, that are driven to the Mac.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.820]   I mean, I have lots of little Mac apps that we use that I would probably miss if we didn't,
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.540]   you know, didn't have them available.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.980]   And also you feel, I mean, for better or worse, you still feel a little bit more, you know,
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.740]   when you see the want to cry and go out, you kind of go, well, I'm like, yeah, that's
[00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.740]   true.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.740]   That's true.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.180]   It's still, it's still more secure.
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.500]   It's not, it's not secure.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.500]   It's not perfect.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.500]   It's not perfect.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.580]   But you tend to be a smaller target for it.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:38.820]   So you worry a little bit less.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.220]   Not a bad thing.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.300]   Well, okay.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:42.300]   But let's, okay.
[00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:47.420]   Now that we've had our flight of fancy, none of that's going to happen.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:51.740]   Although I was looking, Phil Schiller said, new IMAX later this year.
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.020]   He didn't say late this year.
[00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.580]   He said later this year.
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.300]   So Apple has not had an event.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.500]   Somebody just pointed this out.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.420]   In eight months.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.220]   So you know, the last one was the end of October.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.420]   So November, December, say eight months.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:10.980]   Same as 2013 and 20, it was 2013, 2014.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.540]   They didn't have spring events either.
[00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.660]   So we're on that track again.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:19.500]   So we would, this 10.5 inch iPad Pro, you think we'll see that?
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.540]   Any of that stuff that, so the nice thing, when Apple does their own events and not beholden
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.860]   to anybody, and last year, for example, the MacBook Pro was supposed to debut with WWDC
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.300]   and the chips just weren't ready.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:32.260]   So they pushed it the year before the Apple TV was supposed to debut with WWDC and it just,
[00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.260]   the OS wasn't ready.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:34.260]   So they pushed it.
[00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.180]   So there's probably a bunch of stuff that's lined up.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:37.380]   It's ready to go for this event.
[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:39.100]   And if they're not ready, they'll just push it.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.820]   So all this stuff is rumored are likely candidates.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.660]   And it just depends if they're in a state to the demo and ship in short order, then they'll
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:46.660]   make the call.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.180]   Oh, my one of the things I've just started.
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:53.980]   It was listening to a replacement company.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:54.980]   It's rebooting.
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.460]   I don't understand what happened.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.940]   Getting ready for watch OS four.
[00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:58.940]   Oh, how exciting.
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:04.780]   It's probably just like, it finished buffering all of your private conversation about Apple.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.540]   Now it has to send those out.
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.540]   Compress it and send it out.
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:09.540]   Nothing to see here.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.540]   Hey, look, new watch band.
[00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.540]   Don't be connected with Google.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.780]   Watch band and just shut down to avoid.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:18.700]   I mean, one of the things I'll be really interested to see, and I think it's unlikely
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.060]   at this point, but I'd be really interested to see what happens with AR, whether Apple
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.980]   will address that for developers or not.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:30.300]   We've seen a huge push at F8 and an I/O with both Facebook and Google.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.660]   Facebook, I think, was a bit of a surprise.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:38.620]   I think Google we saw coming as far as announcing some very robust tools when it comes to AR.
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.500]   Specifically, some things that we've talked about, I think years ago when we started seeing
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.060]   augmented reality on the iPhone of being able to use match moving or motion tracking
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:52.780]   to track elements in the scene and be able to tie objects to it and providing a library
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:54.340]   for developers to do that.
[00:27:54.340 --> 00:28:00.340]   And so I think we're going to see an acceleration of that type of thing for Facebook and Google.
[00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:02.380]   I do think it's going to be important.
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:07.420]   I think it'll be-- Apple may start playing catch up if they don't have some kind of AR
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.780]   showing at this point.
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:14.460]   If they wait another year, I think it could be Google and Facebook may make some very
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.420]   strong inroads in that area.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.300]   The Google, as a matter of fact, during Google I/O, showed up-- during the keynote, they
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:24.940]   showed up something that was-- kind of showed you how if you think that AR and VR are all
[00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.780]   this really buck Rogers, I'm wearing this thing on my head sort of stuff.
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.620]   I think one of the most impressive demos was a classroom experience where there was an
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.220]   AR tornado in the middle of the classroom.
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:41.420]   And these kids were issued like basic Android phones on selfie sticks that could basically
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.500]   walk around the tornado and see it from all angles within their classroom by looking at
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   the screen.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.820]   And that's the sort of stuff that I think is always-- it's just a huge opportunity when
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.780]   Apple Maps introduces that kind of thing where you're just in the middle of Manhattan,
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:57.540]   you want to know, where the hell am I?
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.740]   I know that I need to go this way.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:02.700]   I know I'm about 80 blocks away, but I have to go this way or that way.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:07.460]   For Apple Maps to be able to simply superimpose on a live view of the street, like an arrow
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:12.220]   this way and then highlighting in blue, here is the building you're trying to get to.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.860]   That's when people A, will freely embrace augmented reality and B, just absolutely fall in love
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.980]   with their phone again when it can do stuff like that.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.300]   So huge opportunity for Apple and I really hope they at least-- I know they're not in
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.620]   the business of showing off stuff they're only thinking of making.
[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:31.580]   But everybody else is showing off things that they're actually making.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:37.580]   And so this is another chance where Apple being silent is so totally against its best
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:38.580]   interest.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:44.140]   It really has to say, no, we are not just about making an $1,100 version of the iPhone.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.140]   We are really doing some cool stuff that will make you happy that your next phone is going
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.380]   to be an iPhone.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:56.580]   And yet, Apple's never been-- very rarely been reactive.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.820]   I don't think the reactor, I think AR is coming slowly forever.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:02.300]   But they don't like it that Keynote is interested.
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.300]   Well, they've been talking about it though.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.500]   I mean, it's one of the few things Tim Cook has not been very hesitant to talk about.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.500]   That's true.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   It has been made table stakes.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.460]   And to Andy's point, I wouldn't be surprised at all if we see the same way they've done
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.100]   scene kit and sprite kit.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.060]   They have AR kit and suddenly you have all these technologies.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.060]   And they don't say why.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.660]   They just get-- John Hanky comes up and says, "With this technology, we can put Pikachu
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.540]   in a live background better than anywhere before.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.220]   And it's just totally under the radar because it's a good demo.
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.220]   But then all the developers go, "Holy crap, we have all these AR frameworks now."
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:35.180]   Well, Pikachu is the greatest industry ambassador for augmented reality because it takes something
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.540]   that is a research sort of thing and makes it real for people.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.100]   This is the technology we're using.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.380]   So yeah, that's a great point today.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:49.420]   Well, and I think that I think the bread and butter of AR is really going to be in locations.
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:53.820]   And if you look at matching it with Bluetooth LE and being able to identify where you are
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.740]   within, let's say, a foot or two, mall and just be able to tell you where the gap is
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:04.560]   or where the Apple store is and be very precise and show you directions and show you where
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.980]   you can find X, Y, and Z.
[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:10.540]   I think a lot of people could very naturally get used to just throwing something up or
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:16.460]   going to historical sites and being able to get glimpses into what that looked like when
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.020]   it was at its heyday.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.500]   Those types of things are going to be really interesting.
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.620]   Before we push aside the pure play VR stuff, here at the Star Trek game just shipped, you
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:28.500]   can have four of the four of us could be in command of the USS Aegis right now.
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.020]   And that's all Georgia wants to do this entire week is just play Star Trek on a bridge and
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.380]   there's no Mac that can run that.
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.380]   So I'm still sad.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:39.020]   Could I be in a science fiction universe that I'm more fond of such as Star Wars or Doctor
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.020]   who?
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.020]   Well, it's not even Star Trek.
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.820]   It's the Kelvin is a JJ Abrams Kelvin version.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.260]   All I'm saying is that I don't want to be in a VR game where every 20 minutes I have
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.900]   to go into a conference room and argue with a psychologist about whether we're doing the
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.900]   right thing.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.580]   But here's the fire, the death of the Dose.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.740]   Here's the sites exactly.
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.500]   It's called my rule all the way down Andy.
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.500]   Captain and not go.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:06.900]   The crew is feeling a lot of tension right now over your decision to defend the ship with
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:07.900]   physical force.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.300]   The line will be drawn.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.500]   Yeah, this far no further.
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.900]   I will make the pay.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:12.900]   There we go.
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:13.900]   Damn right.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:14.900]   They are.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.780]   Personally, partially I give us 50-50 chance of survival.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:25.660]   Another of course rumor that is strong, although rumors are meaningless, is that there will
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:31.180]   be a Siri standalone Siri device, a Siri speaker.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.180]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.180]   Well, we see.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.420]   You think Monday with a touch display maybe?
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:39.860]   If they need like so, it's a developer conference which some people will say suggest there won't
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:41.100]   be a lot of interesting hardware.
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.100]   Although a couple of points Apple has not gone out of their way to say no new hardware
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.900]   this year, which they usually do if there is no new hardware.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.100]   And also if there are things like a Siri speaker, they'll need to have developer support for
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.100]   it.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.180]   The current version of Siri kit is very limited.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:56.940]   I think it has seven or eight domains and I'll need way more than that to have a full
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.300]   living room experience.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.620]   So if it is something, they've not hesitated to show off things like the new the venue 2013
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.740]   Mac Pro and say coming later this year.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:09.020]   So it's quite possible they'll say we're shipping this in September, but we know we have all
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.020]   the developers here.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.860]   We have the new version of Siri kit and HomeKit for you to work on and we like we want to give
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.980]   you as much time as possible to make fantastic apps and experiences.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.780]   So here it is and either it's a standalone speaker or it's a some form of fancy iPhone
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.780]   8 dock that'll use the logic from the phone to create a living room or whatever they would
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.140]   ever form it takes.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.620]   They'll have it they'll show it off hint at it and then give the developers time to
[00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:30.940]   get their apps ready for it.
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.980]   They don't even necessarily have to show it off.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:38.100]   They could just simply even in the conference the actual conference itself, they could have
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.540]   in one of the boxes that is not revealed on the schedule yet.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:48.180]   That's a new new features of new API developer exposed features of Siri and at that at that
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.140]   session you will learn that oh by the way if there's if here's how here's how you can
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:56.340]   create Siri actions for let's say if there were a standalone device or let's say you
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:00.940]   don't know or better yet you don't know what you don't know you don't know you don't know
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.660]   what device this is running on.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:09.580]   So it could be because you know people could be using using Siri on a Mac on a phone on
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:16.580]   a watch on a or even on a we're just saying that maybe you want to start thinking about
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.580]   how to do that.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:22.180]   We obviously were going to be really paying close attention to the keynote but you've
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:26.380]   got to spend the next week watching all of these conference videos that come up because
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.580]   oftentimes that's where some of the most exciting stuff is.
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:34.660]   These are this is where companies going to talk about subtle stuff that's going to totally
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:41.380]   revolutionize and revitalize an operating system for the next five years and it's easy to demonstrate
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.740]   here is a new version of our here's a new feature in our photos app you see how this your
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:51.140]   daughter was was at at bat and playing baseball behind this chain link fence well now the chain
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:56.900]   link fence is now not no longer in the way that's an easy demo but explaining here's
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:02.900]   how we are going to make iOS work better with keyboards and other pointing devices in case
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:08.420]   you wanted to use your $500 iPad as a laptop replacement as something that maybe you don't
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:13.820]   want to buy one of these new $300 cheap windows machines or Chromebook here's a way to do that.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:18.420]   That's where you figure out that oh Apple is really really serious about moving iOS forward
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:23.100]   as a not just as a hey is a really great thing for comics and games here's a really great
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:26.220]   thing for just using it as a business device.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.340]   So we shouldn't even if Apple doesn't show off such a device and I wouldn't be shocked
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:35.260]   if they didn't I think that we're going to see some stuff that that points to AR that
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:42.580]   points to new applications of Shlomo and maybe even some stuff that you're saying.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.100]   Shlomo are.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.700]   Shlomo are.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.740]   Okay, there is a little problem.
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.260]   Siri sucks.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.540]   I would say I would say Shlomo sucks.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.300]   Well, for me a Siri device would just be one more thing to swear at.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.380]   I don't know it'll have been for me Mike Lee.
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.940]   He doesn't work in your living room.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.940]   She's fine.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.180]   You're fine.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.180]   You're fabulous.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:12.780]   Lisa and I have a little game we play when I'm looking for something I will ask Google
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:19.220]   Assistant and she will ask Shlomo and invariably Shlomo either says I don't know what the hell
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:22.420]   you're talking about or I found some stuff on the web that has nothing to do with your
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:28.940]   request and I got maybe is it just me I don't think I speak with an accent.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:37.300]   I feel like one of the risks Apple faces by by putting Shlomo up front is it really does
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:45.260]   lag behind Google's offering and there would be a slo mo 3.0 that would go along maybe they're
[00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:46.260]   going to go on that.
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:51.540]   Yeah, no, that's actually good enough or not is going to be hard to tell us when she was
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:58.540]   Bixby.
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:36:59.940]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.700]   Alejandro is a rebellious team.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.140]   They have different levels of maturity.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:09.500]   But also but also realize that you can have a much better experience with with Aliyosha
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:14.900]   and with the assistant because again I've got this device in front of me that has all
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:20.140]   kinds of microphones around it designed specifically to make sure that it can just it can differentiate
[00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.140]   my voice from someplace else.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.740]   Siri is almost always there is one microphone and it may not mess it's not a microphone
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:30.100]   that was ever designed to react to me at distance.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:35.060]   It was designed to be like in the middle of my face with absolutely no other noise around
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.060]   it.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.500]   And also remember that Apple has been doing some nice acquires they acquired that I can't
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:44.940]   remember the company but the company whose technology is in taking information that has
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:50.420]   been basically written for the web and find and sifting summarize again sifting it and
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.660]   be able to extract context out of it.
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:56.980]   That's exactly the sort of thing Apple needs to make sure that Siri can say that well Abe
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:03.300]   Bogota was in three different movies with how Lyndon before fish and before before Barney
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.380]   Miller these are three they were instead of I found these four articles on Wikipedia about
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.300]   how Lyndon and Abe Bogota.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.700]   So it's the great that all say is that the great thing about this platform these these
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:18.940]   intelligent speakers is intelligent assistance is that really as soon as you've bought you've
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:23.020]   given somebody a hundred and thirty dollars for this the hardware part is boring and it's
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.220]   over but it can always always always be adding new features and get smarter and smarter as
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.220]   you go along.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.820]   You said this I should point out for those listening audio I'm sorry I'll help a Google
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:36.140]   home you know that thing that Google thing you talk to yeah a Google home that's been
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:40.900]   set to mute because I have a smart man and the thing that might be controversial that
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:43.500]   will add to this is I've been I've been going back and forth I've been testing a lot of
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.780]   Apple Maps versus Google Maps Apple Assistant versus Google Assistant and they're all they're
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:50.940]   fighting for second place all of these things I'm going to quote Gartner when he says that
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.280]   if they were real we'd fire all of them but I still can't get you and be using any mapping
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.540]   solution reliably I would say nine out of ten times I can't get any assistant to answer
[00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:04.460]   reliably nine even the same question nine out of ten times so yeah like Siri is way
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.340]   behind an Apple Maps in many areas struggles but I can't get any of these stuff just reliably
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:12.180]   providing what I would consider table stakes surface services so I'm just hoping again
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.020]   that the competition increases and I understand it's super hard to figure all this stuff out
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:19.820]   but I just need to be able to rely on that the flooding went away two weeks ago and Google
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.260]   Maps will still not take me down any road that was considered flooded two weeks ago
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:28.100]   and I don't know how to fix that hey at least at least it knows about the flood roads it
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.900]   does but it's two weeks later and it doesn't know about the construction that's been going
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.380]   on for a month so there are roads that is closed it's just it's it's a mess for me the
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.820]   simple ones in this and even Amazon and in Google have trouble with this and in their
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:46.340]   home products are it is that I think we talked about this but but just picking the right
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:51.460]   song like I'm asking you to play a song I expect the single like like I don't expect
[00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:56.100]   a cover I don't expect the karaoke version I don't expect the the deep album version
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:00.660]   or the live version I expect the single and then if you can't find the single I expect
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:05.060]   the album version well that's asking an awful lot I just want to ask well but I don't
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.820]   think I just want to say when the giant is on the
[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:11.580]   relevance is not that hard though I mean that's those are all salt search but when those
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.740]   things those are those are really easy I mean you know if it knows that it's Elton
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.980]   John's Rocketman it should know that it's going to grab the one that look it Apple can't
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:26.860]   even give you a search in its app store that finds an app I mean come on let's like they
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.780]   they have added sloppy search now so you can misspell things finally after a decade I
[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:36.940]   can misspell tweet but still get an answer well okay I know maybe I'm only searching for
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:40.660]   new apps and that's why I've run into problems but I just I can't find well yeah so search
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.980]   for you whenever I want it will drink because it doesn't propagate whenever I want a app
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:50.980]   I Google it yes and then I find it because I can't find it from Apple and that's yeah
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.220]   I can go on and on and on and on sir I mean search is just tricky in general but the current
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:41:00.700]   name of my search pane is I I'm still using Autodesk Fusion 360 to design stuff and I
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:05.300]   just this I recommended a few weeks ago absolutely still love it I can't get good recommended
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:10.020]   highly enough but for some reason even on the search on the desktop what I launch apps
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:15.140]   by hitting you know command space bar for spotlight and so I type f u s I and it always
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:21.300]   will give me the app that was installed for how to de-in for de-installing fusion 360 it
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:27.420]   never surfaces the app itself and I don't know who I I've got I've got the phrase oh
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:32.220]   you stupid idiot piece of software right loaded and chambered and the cameras pulled back I
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:37.060]   just don't know whether to fire it at the Mac or fire at Fusion 360 because that seems
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:42.020]   like an obvious problem your mic just by the way is rattling or something are you on an
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:48.900]   unstable surface are you on a you abort a shit no I'm sorry I've got you in a truck my
[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:54.860]   my office the officer I've had since like 1995 wants me to wants to cripple me and I finally
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.700]   had to like say I will I will the only way to stop sitting in this is for me to throw
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:03.540]   it away and replace it with the old like school chair that and so unfortunate this is the
[00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:08.780]   first podcast in which by height is a little bit off my butt just it's like it's like there's
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.420]   a rumbler like the thing is ratwing on the table or something yeah so I think I think
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:17.060]   it's because I'm just sort of big one big one you start you play the start track game
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:22.020]   without us you know anything it's it's all it's also also it's it's a fit the official
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:27.100]   start of upscurf fan season so I had to move that out of the way maybe I maybe I it's your
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.340]   Monroe moment I don't know it's just me it could just be me anything else you want to
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.780]   say about WWDC it's coming Monday our coverage will begin and just sure operating to the
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:42.500]   end Pacific oh yeah we're gonna see iOS 11 and TVOS 11 Mac OS something something and watch
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:48.540]   OS 4 Wow watch OS 4 Wow yeah well let's take a break and then we'll talk about those I
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:56.260]   did get an update to my iPhone yesterday surprise update no this morning surprise update so
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:00.500]   we can talk about what's in there and lots more Alex Lindsey is here from the pixel court
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:05.460]   nice to see you Alex it's good to be here I just I literally dreamt that you would show
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:10.380]   up today and here I am and here you are you just name three times I must have done something
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:17.500]   in my sleep exactly also Alec besides Alex Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times always

[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:29.060]   well you're both on my left on my right i'm or comms amazing Renee Richie our show today
[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:35.260]   brought to you by upside comms speaking of amazing Jay Walker is a legend in the travel
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:41.340]   business he's the guy who created Priceline and really transformed travel then I think
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:46.620]   after he sold the company he took some time off but you know how entrepreneurs are he's
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:50.140]   he was thinking he was thinking what it what it means what what is a problem that needs
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:54.740]   to be solved and travel and he came up with a really good one and I speak as a small business
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:59.540]   owner when I worked for a big company for Ziff Davis we had a travel department and as
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:03.140]   a employee if you're going to book travel you don't go book it yourself you call the

[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.100]   they've pre they don't want you to do it yourself they've got pre negotiated deals they're going
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:16.420]   to save a lot of money promise if you're a business like mine or a small business or
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:19.940]   even a medium sized business and you don't have a travel department you haven't negotiated
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:26.020]   deals with airlines and hotels what do you do you go to Jay's new business upside dot

[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:26.820]   what do we know anything Renee's the expert I always go to Renee on the new operating systems
[00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:31.580]   because you do all the betas there are they beta in iOS 11 already no it'll be the day
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.820]   of the keynote they'll put it'll put if they follow their usual pattern the day of the keynote
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:40.020]   will get the developer betas for watch OS TV OS iOS and Mac OS so we don't know really
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:44.620]   much at all at this point no I mean there are a lot of rumors again rumors of a new design
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.540]   rumors of maybe a dark theme to tie in with OLED panels that are coming late in the year
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:53.100]   oh yeah oh you series one of the neat things about OE LEDs they don't use any power to do
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:58.420]   black yeah just for the just for lighting things up unlike an LCD which has to light up the
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:07.060]   whole panel back led to watch is is black UI right yeah I think it's also why this default
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.620]   font doesn't even have syriffs it's like that's more pixels you have to turn on that
[00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:19.140]   is a safe save a battery go black so that would be one thing we are at peak I mean I
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:24.380]   got a I got to say we're at peak iOS I don't I'd be hard pressed to think of something it
[00:49:24.380 --> 00:49:31.860]   doesn't have I think well I'm sure go ahead no handy handy just just a just a quick comment
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:38.740]   that it's by no means does it look frumpy Mac OS looks downright frumpy and needs a redesign
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:45.500]   but that by no means does iOS look long in the tooth but I think we I was I've always
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:50.940]   been wondering since the rewrite of of iTunes if we're looking a sneak peek at some of the
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:57.420]   design thinking they're putting into the next major visual redo of iOS where they introduce
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:03.700]   new heavier fonts there's I love the new I really like the new app the new music app because
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:10.340]   there's whereas the existing iOS I think is a little too wispery it's a little too understated
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:15.180]   it doesn't call it when needs to get your attention someplace it has no part of its
[00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:19.300]   design language to say here's where I want you to look here's the important thing you
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:23.140]   need to tap or the most important piece of information here whereas the music app has
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.260]   a lot of that built in so I'm most looking forward to seeing if they are going to make
[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:33.340]   their first real rethink of or excuse me real tune up of the of the interface since
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:38.500]   they've done since iOS was at six or seven I think was I have a seven yeah yeah I mean
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:41.260]   there's a lot of things that super interesting about it but it is where it's sort of like
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.300]   a maturity of the phone we were building up the phone as a platform for a long time but
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.020]   the phones both Android and iOS are super mature now and it's more of a rounding out
[00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:52.540]   of features and using the phones as the platform to build everything else off of and there are
[00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:56.900]   things like OLED that we can talk about there are things like the new music design language
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.740]   that's all ed cues division there was a guy in ed cues or a good idea for this big bold
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:06.180]   beautiful redesign and that's why maps got it and Apple music got it and the home map
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.300]   the things that are in ed cues division got it and that might permeate but they might
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:15.260]   use the dark theme as a way of sort of refreshing refreshing everything and the rest is just
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.580]   building out more Siri more intelligence surfacing more sort of the artificial intelligence
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:23.740]   engine throughout the phone and really rounding out the experience and things like Siri kit
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:28.180]   and phone kit let third party apps really work like first class citizens the knock was
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:32.940]   always that Android was built multitasking for a security later iOS security first multitasking
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:36.540]   later but both of those platforms are now figuring out they need to address both of
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:41.140]   those components and I think this year we're seeing big steps forward on on all fronts.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:48.140]   Yeah, I agree. There's less Google I owe and I'm just I'm just here as ambassador for
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:53.740]   I had to spend an entire week doing nothing but focusing on Google I owe I'm going to
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:58.020]   use information somewhere dammit. The Google I was the same sort of thing where a lot of
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:01.060]   the great stuff was here's stuff that we screwed up three years ago that we're finally
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:04.860]   getting around to fixing here's something that is a big pain of the but for developers
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:10.940]   and a big pain of the but for security in a big pain of the but for for memory leaks
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:16.660]   and battery use that we're finally fixing up. So if I think that the key features in the
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:22.140]   middle have always all been solved for both platforms and now the best way to improvement
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:26.620]   is at either end of the spectrum where the boring stuff that the consumer never ever
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:31.500]   sees they just think oh wow the new iPhone 8 is amazing I'm getting 23 battery life because
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:35.420]   this wonderful new phone know it wasn't it's because they rewrote something that was not
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:39.540]   working very well or the other end of the spectrum meaning that they can fix a phone
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:43.500]   by making it a lot more attractive a lot better style something just a lot more pleasant
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:48.020]   to hold and look at and take out your pocket of 80 times a day.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:55.100]   I neglected to mention this by the way I'm sorry I did if you download the WWDC app stickers
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:59.740]   there are some fun things built into it for instance as always there's some sessions
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:02.740]   that they don't want to say the name of because that would give it all away.
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:08.740]   This session session name hasn't been engaged yet with a diamond ring to be determined with
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:14.660]   a little bumblebee we're about to root we're about to reveal the real name with a little
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:21.700]   robot and it loves that one you just aren't qualified as a koala bear to know yet I love
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.700]   those.
[00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:27.020]   I some of them need to lose we don't want the use of the customers to see how much they'll
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.020]   be screwed by this new topic.
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:34.820]   There's a little you're hiding the lead because there's a new sticker pack including WWDC
[00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:40.780]   fist like a big fist with WWDC on the knuckles that you get your WWDC tattoo right here baby
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:49.020]   and then some classic you know there's a Susan care Mac and a command Z or Z for you Canadians
[00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:53.580]   there's a six color logo for Jason Snell six color.
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:57.180]   And I get those so I can put that on my messages right now I don't have to wait I don't have
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:53:59.140]   to get the iOS app or WDC.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:02.140]   We get to download the app because the sticker is an extension of the app.
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.340]   It's part of the app.
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.340]   Okay.
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:07.340]   So just search the app store for WWDC.
[00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:11.500]   Yep download that and then enable figure out how to enable a sticker on iOS.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.500]   Okay I can do what I know I can do.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:15.820]   I'm not on the show.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.620]   I'm not so stupid as I look.
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.980]   The app store is unavailable as usual.
[00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:21.980]   Okay.
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:22.980]   Moving on.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:24.980]   I'm sorry I didn't mean to distract.
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.540]   So iOS 11.
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:28.540]   Yep.
[00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.380]   Mac OS natural wonder name.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:33.380]   Yeah.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:37.540]   And what will will watch for be a big that's a big number that's a big jump.
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:40.420]   Yeah well I mean they did watch it was three last year and the big thing was they spent
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:45.860]   excess RAM and battery overhead to make apps more responsive and I'd argue that apps are
[00:54:45.860 --> 00:54:49.820]   still the wrong model and that hopefully they're coming to terms with that and letting
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:54.020]   extensions be extensions and maybe they'll use some of that budget for things like ambient
[00:54:54.020 --> 00:54:59.500]   time and super performing notifications and extensions that have better handoff capabilities.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.180]   So I think there's crossed we'll see a lot of movement there too.
[00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:06.020]   Yeah I got to say that most excited about what they could announce in watchOS because
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:09.020]   the watch the watch is still evolving.
[00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:13.420]   They're still figuring out what they want to do to it and last year they really learned
[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:16.860]   they showed they really learned a lot and now they have a focus they've got a target
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:20.100]   that they didn't have before the release of the first watch.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:25.020]   So I'm really excited to see what they do as they continue to apply not apply not only
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:28.660]   what they're learning from their users about what makes a great watch experience but also
[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:34.180]   as they themselves start to now we we're not just out for a for a family car ride to burn
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:38.660]   gas we know we have a destination we have a specific destination we're trying to get
[00:55:38.660 --> 00:55:42.900]   to and now we really want to move this watch closer to that destination.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.900]   So I'm boy am I excited about what they could be doing.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:49.220]   Maybe a leader boys Leo so we can feel really bad about being third place to make it every
[00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.220]   day.
[00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:52.020]   She's a workout demon.
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:57.740]   Can I have like an auto reply thing so that like if Renee sends me like something like
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:04.100]   that I can I'll have like some stock pictures of oh here here I am actually an entire Boston
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.820]   cream pie and a Dr. Pepper.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.820]   I said Leo is delicious.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:09.460]   So workout I sent him back a beautiful pizza.
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:13.620]   I'm okay so mad when you send me donuts and pizza I get so angry.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.620]   Hey.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:20.020]   Here are the seven movies that I watched Saturday sitting on my couch instead of having to rip
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.580]   bust my butt on a trail.
[00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:23.780]   Fight fight.
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:29.660]   You want to fight we can fight with media man.
[00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:33.700]   I said the messages guy I don't after that and they just I just got the flat face emoji
[00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.780]   back and I sent another one another flat face.
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:37.260]   Oh that's good flat face emoji.
[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:39.060]   That's what you're getting from me from now on.
[00:56:39.060 --> 00:56:44.460]   I think I wore up my welcome with messages.
[00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:50.700]   Let's see yeah yeah I think maybe Apple is probably going to double down on its commitment
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:56.820]   to health on the and fitness on the Apple watch they seem to have found a niche for it.
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:02.620]   We talked last week about the glucose monitor which by the way according to the verge is
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:03.860]   very hard to do.
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:07.980]   No one's really successfully done and I didn't realize this a non-invasive.
[00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:08.980]   Until they do.
[00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:09.980]   Hard until they do.
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:16.060]   Working technology as one of the developers described me as the as a cats tongue technology
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:20.380]   where it is actually this micro sandpaper right that you don't you don't know that's
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:24.820]   drawing fluid because drawing is so so little but it is actually drawing actual fluid from
[00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:25.820]   your wrist.
[00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:26.820]   All right.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.940]   Well maybe that's what it does just be really abrasive band.
[00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:34.220]   It's actually embedded what they do is they drill it right in when you get the law.
[00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:38.220]   They did well they you know the only the closest thing needed anymore.
[00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:46.860]   The closest thing to a non-invasive was created but it was taken off the market because it
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.860]   really irritated people.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:54.980]   No I don't know if that was the cat or not but that's the closest thing and in fact the
[00:57:54.980 --> 00:58:00.620]   you know the end of the story is it might be worth it for Apple to consider the lesson
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:02.540]   of the glucose watch.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.540]   It's not enough.
[00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:05.940]   If you put a tin in it then they measure the allergic reaction.
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:10.640]   It's not enough to get past all the regulatory hurdles to still be able to make money and
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:17.500]   then have a successful device you got to get to market and still not stick.
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:20.420]   Here we all see Wonder Woman we'll just want bracers anyway and then they can do whatever
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:21.420]   they want.
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:22.420]   What?
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.620]   I mean it is the holy grail and you know it's not everybody wants to do this.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:26.860]   Yeah everybody wants to do this.
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.860]   It's 30.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:28.860]   Oh no.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.460]   I mean right that that is legitimately a great idea.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:32.460]   The idea.
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:37.340]   If you were to create like again a Wonder Woman bracer and okay for people who are not as
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:41.860]   hip as you and I who don't realize Wonder Woman is a great character.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:44.540]   Imagine what you can do with that amount of surface.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:46.620]   Imagine if you could make it so that you're watching.
[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.540]   There's no hump or bump in here.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:52.220]   It really is flat so you could pull your sleeve completely down over it.
[00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:55.660]   Pull your sleeve up just enough to see the time or pull it.
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:57.660]   That's a great idea and that's a sort of innovation.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.260]   Andy and I haven't started out.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.260]   Exactly.
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:03.500]   We're looking for a series A financing before.
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:08.140]   We figure if as long as you don't want more than let's say $780 million we blow through
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:11.780]   before we stop buying ping pong tables for every employee and start actually producing
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:12.780]   stuff.
[00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:21.340]   Incidentally I think this is probably an indicator but if you order or try to order a Mac book
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:28.700]   at the store, not the 13 but the 15 inch at the store, the delay has been pushed just
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.700]   past June 6th.
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:35.020]   Will people be matter if there is no KB Lake MacBook Pros or if there are KB Lake MacBook
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:36.020]   Pros at this point?
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:37.260]   It's hard to tell what the internet is.
[00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:43.020]   Well I did just buy a 15 inch touch bar MacBook Pro a couple of months ago.
[00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:45.060]   The answer is yes, they'll be matter both ways.
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.540]   Yeah, they can be men no matter what.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:51.220]   Order today delivers June 5th through 7th.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:53.100]   That's after the Dum-Dum keynote.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.180]   After the keynote.
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:59.020]   So maybe, yeah, maybe, now what would they do if you ordered this?
[00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:00.500]   They would be the opportunity.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.100]   Yeah, they would just say hey.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:04.060]   You got an email saying you're getting the new version?
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.060]   Oh neat.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.060]   Okay.
[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:10.140]   That would be a good way to do it.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:17.820]   Doesn't change though for the 13th and the 13th and by the way it's kind of a sad farewell.
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:25.980]   I didn't realize this but Apple's 17 inch MacBook Pro will be added to the obsolete list.
[01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:27.820]   They sank my battleship at the end of June.
[01:00:27.820 --> 01:00:29.820]   I still missed my 17 inch.
[01:00:29.820 --> 01:00:30.820]   A lot of people do.
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.900]   I had one for years.
[01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:34.540]   But again, too small a market for Apple to spend any time on.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:35.540]   Right?
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:37.380]   It was like carrying Captain America's shield on your back.
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:39.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.380]   People loved it.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:44.500]   I have a friend who uses a 17 inch just every day because he loves it.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:48.460]   And we went for breakfast when I was reviewing the first MacBook nothing.
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:53.580]   I said, are you going to be like working at the diner in your 17 with your 17 inch MacBook?
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:57.820]   Can I bring some loaner hardware and just take some pictures?
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.740]   And it's just directly funny.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:05.460]   The MacBook nothing on top of this thing where you're like, I that's the smallest MacBook
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:10.460]   Apple has ever made because clearly that's not a 17 inch notebook because that would be
[01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:11.700]   ridiculous.
[01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.820]   So Apple has pictures from CSS in the old days with when Luca Brewster still worked at Palm
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:19.180]   and she stacked four Palm Viers on top of the brand new Galaxy Note.
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:20.180]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:21.180]   Anybody can't get the same year.
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:22.380]   That's a good one.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:29.100]   Apple has two classifications for discontinued devices vintage and obsolete.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:32.820]   Which one has a whole opinion?
[01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:37.980]   So after product like vintage is like it's better with time.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:39.700]   You know, it's got that great.
[01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.260]   It's got that great fake.
[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.660]   It's got that great fake wood paneling.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:48.020]   Vintage products according to Apple are those that have not been manufactured for more than
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:50.740]   five but less than seven years.
[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:54.460]   You're in that two year vintage window.
[01:01:54.460 --> 01:02:00.340]   The country of Turkey, except here in Turkey, Mac products purchased in the country of Turkey
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:05.220]   that are vintage may obtain service from Apple service providers within the country of Turkey.
[01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:12.020]   If you bought it in California as required by statute, in other words, there's rules
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.740]   and they have to comply with local rules.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:20.620]   Obsolete products are those that were discontinued like the 17 inch more than seven years ago.
[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:21.620]   Obsolete in the rest of the world.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.100]   Here's my favorite line in the whole thing.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.540]   This thing is so good.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.100]   Monster branded beat products are considered obsolete regardless.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:31.940]   It doesn't matter.
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.500]   No, they're regardless.
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:39.900]   Jimmy will come to your house and swipe them so that no more monster branded beat objects.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:40.900]   They're gone.
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:41.900]   They're history.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:42.900]   They're bitter.
[01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:46.380]   We're so sorry we made that deal.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.380]   You know, Jimmy, what, Dre?
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.220]   I got something to say.
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:56.620]   And then this is a list of Mac products vintage in the United States and Turkey, but obsolete
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.020]   in the rest of the world.
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.780]   How did Turkey get on that list?
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.780]   They lobby for that.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:02.780]   They must have it.
[01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:03.780]   Oh, right?
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.780]   Or something.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.780]   I don't know.
[01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.500]   But Turkey has that but not Obechistan.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500]   It's just weird.
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   Right?
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.500]   Weird.
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:15.900]   I think there's just going to be a culture just like the Cuban car culture where it's
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:22.340]   like just where you'll see in 2041, you're going to see people with 17 inch Mac books
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:29.020]   that now have like bubble memory that now have like tetraonic isolinear optical chips
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.020]   for CPUs.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:33.420]   They're all bolted in because they're there.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.420]   They are their own community.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.660]   They're the only source of making these things work and damn if they don't make it work.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:40.060]   When Alex sees that list, as he goes through his head and go ahead, three of those four
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.260]   of those five of those three of those three.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.900]   Look at the X serves that are now obsolete.
[01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.460]   All those X serves.
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:47.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:51.460]   Oh, I think we have a couple of them sitting around in a box.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.020]   And then here's iPod products that are vintage in the United States, but obsolete in the
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.300]   rest of the world.
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:57.300]   This just cracks me up.
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.380]   It's hard to believe this is serious, but it is.
[01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:02.020]   It's a gold mine.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.020]   Yeah, beats products.
[01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:06.540]   I'm just going to tweet this.
[01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.740]   Beats products, obsolete worldwide.
[01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.500]   Thank you very much.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.940]   Fong, Fong.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.900]   Bring that beats back.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:18.300]   Anyway, we'll put a link in this to the show notes.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:22.020]   That's a new marketing hook, especially for like music hipsters.
[01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:26.020]   Like, you know, these these head, they're really their vintage.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:30.620]   They're obsolete, not a whole lot of people would really get why they're really good.
[01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:32.940]   So maybe it's just go get some AirPods.
[01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:34.780]   AirPods are great for you.
[01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:37.620]   There's a huge zoom, a lot of songs going on.
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:38.620]   Just wait for it.
[01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:41.740]   Hey, I got a two based iPod.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:43.820]   It's just is a hell of an upgrade, but oh boy.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:46.820]   The warm, sweet, 100 songs.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.820]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.220]   It's like, I got it's my bubble bubble.
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:54.340]   I've upgraded my series, iPod to bubble memory.
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:57.220]   I can only play the first, eight tenths of a second of H.E.D.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:05:02.060]   But again, it's it's that department of the Navy, 1957 sound I'm trying to get at.
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:05.140]   He's got 300 songs in his parachute pants pocket.
[01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:08.340]   Let's see.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.340]   What else?
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:17.700]   Do Apple said to aim for trial production of micro LED displays by early 2017?
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.860]   Who said that and why?
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.860]   And what does it mean?
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.580]   This is interesting to me.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.380]   We thought that OLED was the next big thing.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.380]   Like we're getting OLED.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.380]   They're already on it.
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.380]   No, no, no, it's quantum dot.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.060]   No, no, no, it's micro LCD.
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.620]   That OLED stuff, that was just a stop gap.
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:30.620]   This fixes all those problems.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.900]   You can't have it yet, but it fixes all those problems.
[01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:38.060]   So this is a new technology better than OLED micro LED?
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:40.940]   Yeah, they're left faster.
[01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:42.780]   They consume less energy.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.500]   I don't know if they're actually higher definition, but I bet that whoever's selling them is
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   going to say that.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.660]   But mostly, mostly as far as I know, it really is.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:56.060]   It's basically, let's not overdrive these pixels the way we have to because we're using standard
[01:05:56.060 --> 01:05:57.460]   LED technology.
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:02.380]   So anything you can, if you can show, if you can create 35 extra minutes of battery life
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:06.780]   by changing its display technology, especially if you now have the ability to own the factory
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.180]   that's making this brand new display technology so that you and only you can get access to
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:16.580]   all the displays you need and everybody else has to go beat go beat carpets.
[01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.580]   That's a good thing.
[01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:20.780]   There's a new sheriff in town.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:24.340]   I thought Apple news was probably more abundant, but apparently not.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:30.900]   Apple has hired New York widely, by the way, highly regarded New York magazine editor Lauren
[01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:38.380]   Kern is now editor in chief, the first ever for Apple news.
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.900]   She was executive editor at New York magazine.
[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:46.260]   She also worked as editorial director for 2004 to 2010 and deputy editor between 2010
[01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:50.460]   and 2014 of the New York Times magazine like a real journalist.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:51.460]   And they need it now.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:54.460]   Like a while ago, you would have thought Apple news was just a center for technology.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.900]   Like, oh, you go look at the verge there.
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:06:56.900]   You go look at I'm more there.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.140]   Go look at why are there.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:01.700]   But given the current popularity of political news, Apple news is flourish.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.060]   I mean, I know people who just immediately they wake up, they grab their eye.
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.580]   Only swipe left for the news.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:09.380]   They hit the top political story and they just they buckle down to see what's going to
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:10.380]   happen to them today.
[01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.580]   And that's become hugely pop.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:14.940]   I mean, other websites, tech websites, everybody's saying they're losing traffic to political
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.380]   stories now.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.620]   And they need someone who's who's multifaceted and can handle like a really well rounded
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.020]   sort of a news feed for them.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.300]   Yeah, that's actually it.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:26.780]   I think that's we've even seen a small drop in a listenership.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:30.260]   And I think that that's probably true across the board that people, you know, everybody
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:34.940]   has a limited amount of attention time and a number of people are spending a lot more
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:39.620]   time looking at news than political news is consuming a lot the last year.
[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.060]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:45.400]   But also it's a chance to drive audiences to a service they probably have not been using
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.400]   up to this point.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.060]   If they're used to getting notifications and now they see that there are notifications
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:55.820]   that are human selected and very, very relevant and interesting that people that will get
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:59.100]   people using Apple news, even though they're not aware that they're using Apple news.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.900]   And then after a long enough time, they will start to become aware that they're using it
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:04.500]   and then eager to use it.
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.580]   So yeah, that's a that's a that's an easy hire to make.
[01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:12.060]   And you're right, I'm looking at my top stories of my Apple news, but everybody's going to
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:13.060]   be different, right?
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.060]   Yeah, if you set it up, yeah, everything will be different.
[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:20.260]   Yeah, but I have a tech actually two political stories, a couple about Manchester and then
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:23.980]   Tiger Woods looking very sleepy.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.900]   So yeah, but I bet there's definitely, you know, and I guess if you really were interested
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.580]   in political news, you would configure it to be.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:31.860]   I mean, Canada is different when I switch back to Canada is like man arrested for dumping
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.540]   maple syrup and drunk guy tries to write moose and I'm not kidding.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:38.180]   Those are both in Apple news at the same time.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.420]   So very different.
[01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:42.380]   But I mean, if you look at like the UK has got a huge amount of attention on Brexit in
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.780]   France, they had election attention here.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.140]   We've got governmental attention.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:49.420]   It's just globally, there's a huge surge in the popularity of political news.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.420]   I love that.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:55.460]   The headline here is Trump says Germany is very bad for the US.
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:58.420]   So don't get your hopes up on that.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:02.140]   That's why you put the words Trump said at the end at the beginning.
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:05.740]   So you know whether to continue reading or not.
[01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:10.620]   But even though even though Apple news is not writing or generating news, really, that's
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:15.380]   the whole point of having an editor in chief is to have a direction for the coverage that
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.380]   you want to highlight.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.380]   What does she do?
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.380]   What does she do?
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:22.220]   If she's I don't know what they haven't said, but if she's a traditional editor in chief,
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:26.380]   the fact that the ability to choose here are the stories that are important.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:29.380]   Here are the stories that people should be looking at right now.
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:30.900]   That's the decision of an editor in chief.
[01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:36.340]   Or rather, the editor in chief informs her sub editors that you're not there.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.340]   Basically here's the here's what our mandate is.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:44.420]   Here's where direction is when you have sort of a jerk as editor in chief, you wind up
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:50.780]   with a political site that will reject anything that is not in line with its party dogma.
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:54.220]   If you have a good editor in chief, you have someone who says that, yes, this is getting
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:55.220]   a lot of play.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:58.940]   Yes, everybody's talking about this, but we I'm not going to steer people towards this
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:09:59.940]   story.
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:04.260]   I'm going to steer people towards the story about how this story is really not true.
[01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.380]   And here's why it's getting so much traction.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:09.860]   That's the choice that an editor in chief makes, even if they're not actually creating
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:10.860]   creating news.
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:15.140]   That's weird because I mean, so you're really saying curator in chief, but I feel like the
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.380]   Apple news is really you curate the news, right?
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:22.500]   If there's people's both, it has your stuff down and has a lot of success in your.
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.500]   Okay.
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:27.580]   Because they've tried this and they've tried having Google, they've tried the having all
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:31.500]   the kinds of companies have tried doing world, but just where there is no human curated content.
[01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:35.140]   This is all based on what you what we think you like and what you want.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:38.300]   But that turns out that's not exactly what people want when it comes to news.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:40.140]   They do want a certain amount of randomness.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:43.660]   They do want to get some stories out of the blue.
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:48.940]   There I do like it when when a new service figures out that I'm really interested in
[01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:52.700]   stories about David Letterman and finds a story about David Letterman for me to see.
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:57.220]   But the really important thing is for them to say, here is a subject that is really
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.220]   important.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:01.840]   Here's something that if there's 800 things they could be looking at and they have only
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.420]   time for 10, this should be one of the three that no question about it.
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:07.740]   This person is going to be going to be looking at.
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:11.020]   So that's why you need an element of human curation.
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:12.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.180]   I didn't mean to start an opera song.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:19.820]   I just wanted to show you the Liam is back the the robot with some very special set of
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:20.820]   skills.
[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:26.500]   Let's play the video says, does my iPhone believe in reincarnation?
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.500]   Liberate.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.700]   I Liam stands for women.
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.260]   We never saw this before.
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.060]   Liam stands for liberate iPhone auto disassembly machine.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:37.060]   Does it really?
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:38.860]   Or is that a retro name?
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:45.420]   Liam takes an entire iPhone and takes it apart.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:51.100]   In the process, you end up with these perfectly separated bins of parts and figuring out what
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:54.100]   to do with those is kind of where the magic is.
[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:58.740]   Just trying to put them back into our own supply chain and really reuse our own material
[01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:01.060]   that we generally.
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:07.140]   Treating that material as the amazing gift that it is and sending it back around.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.860]   He is totally entitled now to work in a top hat and a cake.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.980]   I would insist on it if that were my job.
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.340]   What's his name?
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.340]   Tyler.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:17.660]   He's in charge of production.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:22.460]   Let's go back and find because they give him a little TJ Tyler operations and environmental
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.460]   initiatives.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:25.460]   I'm holding a bunny in the background.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:27.580]   Oh, hey, Tim.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:30.660]   He's the magicians assistant in this case.
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:34.380]   We were wondering when we saw those videos of Liam taking a phone apart.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.500]   What do you do with all those screws?
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:38.820]   Apparently, you put them back in.
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:44.020]   Again and again so that we don't have to extract new material from the earth.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:47.380]   That's the goal and that's really exciting.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:51.380]   Do you really think of fate or is it?
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.620]   Do they really reuse those parts?
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:13:00.100]   Aren't they going to be kind of funky after being in a phone?
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:04.780]   There's a between reclaim and reuse and also just the ability to separate them into different
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.780]   metals is a big deal.
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.220]   Oh, I could say that.
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:11.660]   Yeah, if you could just get the whatever it is that the weird rare earth metals that they
[01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:15.340]   need, if you could just extract those out, I could see that.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:21.980]   Remember that there's a lot of bad attention, justly so to a lot of electronics recycling
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:25.980]   where by electronics recycling, they mean that they bundle this.
[01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.860]   No, they bundle it up into a palette.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:31.620]   They send it off to another country where people just smash it with hammers at great
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:36.140]   risk of their own lives to get all these bad metals together and to reclaim them.
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:40.020]   So the fact, so it's a really good point if they're they want to make that we don't do
[01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:41.020]   stuff like that.
[01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:44.540]   We actually have technology to disassemble stuff ourselves.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.420]   I would love to see another video that says that and why would we want to disassemble
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.540]   a perfectly good phone?
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.540]   We're figuring out how to recondition and totally, totally wipe these and make them available
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:55.780]   for sale for markets where they don't.
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:14:02.060]   So that the $700 phone of two years ago can be the $80 phone of today to markets that
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:05.260]   certainly can afford a modern iPhone.
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.580]   Look at this.
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:14.180]   The number one, I phone according to a survey of 36,000 customers, part of the American
[01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:23.980]   customer satisfaction index, the number one phone in America, iPhone SE with an 87% accept
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:28.300]   that self selecting though, because you have to really want an iPhone SE to put up with
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:29.300]   the thing.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.460]   No, seriously, like you have to really want the smaller form factor.
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:34.500]   You have to really love it in order to put up with having not having the same camera and
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:35.500]   not having the same process.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.700]   I love not paying as much.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:39.660]   I mean, I think a lot of that's price driven, though, you think?
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:44.820]   I think it was surprised by the amount of people who actually wanted a smaller phone.
[01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:48.300]   I have an SE as one of my phones and I like it a lot.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:51.820]   My daughter, my daughter bought, you know, when a daughter lost her phone, she bought
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:53.620]   an or dropped it or something.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:57.340]   She bought a new SE and she was and she does like it.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.780]   Now, I just like that a smaller if it's in all my pockets.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.540]   It's just barely there.
[01:15:01.540 --> 01:15:05.420]   It's, you know, and so I don't it's not the only phone I use, but it's I do.
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.420]   That's the one I probably talk on the most.
[01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:09.180]   I'm just like it's like a pocket and do my thing.
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:14.700]   I do think the part of it is trying to refine what people actually value in a phone.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:19.580]   Because now in the past two or three years, there's such a small gap of real life performance,
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:22.860]   I think, between pretty much all top tier phones.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:27.420]   Talk about camera, talk about speed, talk about fluidity, talk about storage that now
[01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:31.460]   I think that people might be kind of looking for some more basic stuff.
[01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:32.700]   I just backed on kick.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:38.300]   I broke my own Kickstarter rule that never ever ever back a hardware project, but I had
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.180]   to buy this new phone.
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:44.700]   They're calling the jelly, which is just it's a it's it's it's it's almost about this.
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:49.380]   It's about the size of this remote and it runs the latest for now version of Android.
[01:15:49.380 --> 01:15:52.620]   It has just enough features to make it super super useful.
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:56.700]   I'm just really keen to see what it would be like to have a phone that is a real 4G
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:16:03.580]   phone that has storage that can be used as a hotspot that can run real apps and not be
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:04.980]   even as hard to manipulate.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:05.980]   Smaller is.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:06.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:08.460]   It's so teeny weenie.
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:14.220]   I know it's and it's even it's even much smaller than than the eye for the original iPhone.
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.900]   So it's not like I'm holding them up here.
[01:16:15.900 --> 01:16:19.500]   This my my Nexus 5X and the original iPhone.
[01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.140]   It's even smaller than this.
[01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:26.940]   This jelly phone can be put into the watch pocket of your jeans that's so small.
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:29.260]   They they were looking for $30,000.
[01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:33.940]   They've they've raised and they're not even done yet 1.1 million on Kickstarter.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.260]   And it also doesn't help that you can get this for $80.
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:40.740]   Ah, so you can't do some.
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:41.740]   Yeah.
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:42.740]   Wow.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:47.180]   Is it Android with Google services or is it just a OSP?
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.180]   Nope.
[01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:53.020]   It's the Android the latest version of Android so it has a little bit of the play store.
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:57.100]   You will be you certainly should be able to download any app from the play store.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:00.060]   Don't know how well some of them will work on that much smaller screen.
[01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:01.980]   It's not it's not a scaled down screen.
[01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:05.500]   It's actually something like 300 by 240 or something like that.
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:08.500]   It's a it's a it's a much much smaller pixel count screen.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:14.220]   But just like Apple Android developers have been brow beaten into saying do not assume
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:19.420]   the size of any screen you're going to design your UI so that it is adaptive.
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:23.500]   That's why we spent so much time giving you all these tools so that if you simply describe
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:27.100]   where vaguely this button will go, we will place it for you correctly.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:30.060]   So it's there's a lot of questions to be to be left.
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:36.180]   I am I am I am I'm definitely going to be spending $800 on a new smartphone within the year.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:40.700]   And I'm already starting to go through the that series of thoughts of do I really want
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.140]   something as big like as an iPhone 7 Plus.
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:49.940]   Do I want something that is like the normal what is now the normal size of a smaller smaller
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:55.940]   ish phone or is it time for me to say actually I usually have like a Kindle or an iPad with
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:57.580]   me for when I want big screens.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:18:01.820]   Maybe I really do want something that is so tiny that I won't get caught using it in
[01:18:01.820 --> 01:18:06.420]   church during a cousins wedding when I probably should not be on my phone during this blessed
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.540]   time of my relatives life.
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:13.460]   It'd be interesting to see so you know I I'm tempted to order it because I order everything.
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:17.020]   But I'm gonna let you enjoy this.
[01:18:17.020 --> 01:18:19.020]   And your pocket needs a phone.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.740]   Well, I think be actually good for the glove compartment kind of a thing.
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:28.220]   You know what one of my when my last things that maybe do do the do the buy was I'm also
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:33.540]   a court of sort of in that in the habit of trying to find like a good standalone mp3 player.
[01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:38.660]   And I'm just not is that the sand is the sand is the sand is clip.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:42.460]   I want an mp3 player that has lots of storage and Bluetooth.
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:45.060]   And they're just so nobody's interested in this category.
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:49.780]   And I finally and after again my finger hovering over the spot and saying I don't want to
[01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:53.540]   be one of those idiots who three years later is on Twitter complaining about how this was
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.620]   supposed to ship three years ago.
[01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:56.740]   And now they have the ticket.
[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.260]   They're not responding to anything.
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:03.820]   But I thought if all I get out of it is because it has a very small amount of internal storage.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:08.180]   But it has a micro SD slot that will take up to 256 gigs, which is enough for my entire
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.100]   music library times three.
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:16.860]   So if all I'm doing is buying an 80 or 90 dollar mp3 player that will run access access
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:22.140]   Apple music access Spotify and also access all of my local music.
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:25.900]   If all it does is that I think that it will be useful by you think it has a headphone
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:32.740]   Jack somehow somehow they found room for a headphone jack.
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:34.540]   Maybe their engineers are just better than apples.
[01:19:34.540 --> 01:19:35.540]   I don't know.
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:37.220]   I don't want to say.
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:40.140]   Oh, this is interesting.
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:46.140]   You can get this sand disc for $40 or if you want Bluetooth and 16 gigs you can get it
[01:19:46.140 --> 01:19:47.140]   for $60.
[01:19:47.140 --> 01:19:48.140]   It's not very expensive.
[01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.140]   Yeah.
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.940]   What's the battery life on the clip like?
[01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:53.220]   Battery is I mean great.
[01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:57.460]   I mean, last taking out every day on my constitutional stuff.
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:03.300]   It lasts the better part of a week before even notice of low battery partly because the
[01:20:03.300 --> 01:20:04.660]   screen is kind of terrible.
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:08.300]   It really is like what it really is like a tarry 2600.
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.300]   It should be terrible.
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:15.060]   Yeah, but which is okay because I'm not using it to really drink in the sumptuous album art
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.740]   of Sergeant Pepper.
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.860]   I just wanted to play music and make it easy to put music on and off of it.
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:21.860]   This is for athletes, right?
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:23.860]   I mean, that's really who this is for.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:25.660]   Well, it's an Andy.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.300]   Athletes and Andy.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.940]   I think that there's after this.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:35.780]   And this is this is what I often talk about that after X number of months or years in which
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:39.500]   you think that this is exactly the way that you should do things where I'm going to carry
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:40.500]   all my music on my phone.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.500]   That's going to be how I my music player.
[01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:46.620]   Sometimes you need to take a step back and say, well, what if that's no longer the right
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:48.620]   choice for me right now?
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:51.540]   This is a pain in the, this is this this phone.
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:54.100]   I love it, but it only has 32 gigs of storage.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.660]   It is a pain in the butt to get content on and off of it.
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:02.180]   I really want the my thinking is what if I were to simply say I'm not going to dedicate
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:04.940]   for this a gigabyte of storage for media.
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:09.020]   I'm just going to have fresh podcasts on this, but I'm going to carry around my music library
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:10.020]   on that.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.020]   Would that be Andy?
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:13.300]   And it's working up pretty good.
[01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:14.300]   I'm looking for a better solution.
[01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:15.780]   I'm thinking for the trip.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.700]   It'd be good to have that instead of draining my phone on the plane.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:19.700]   Yeah, that too.
[01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:24.180]   And also it was also the thought of as we cross borders and security is getting more
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:25.940]   itchy about what you can do with things.
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:29.940]   I like the idea that I don't have to erase this before I get across a border.
[01:21:29.940 --> 01:21:31.100]   A cheesy little phone.
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:33.300]   Have that cheesy little phone be your travel phone, right?
[01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:34.460]   That was another thing.
[01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:35.460]   Jelly travel.
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:36.460]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:42.180]   The other it's also an idea that I wonder if so many times I wish I would like I would
[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:45.380]   love to see what Apple has argued internally about this.
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:51.500]   It has two sim slots in it, which is super useful for parts of the world in which data
[01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:52.940]   plans are really expensive.
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:57.380]   So you might have one sim card that just is just for text messages and phone calls,
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:01.180]   but you have a second sim card for data because you can buy it more cheaply.
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:05.860]   It's also used in countries like India where you might go five miles and be on a different
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:06.860]   carrier.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:07.860]   Right.
[01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:08.860]   There are many carriers.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:13.620]   Or you might be traveling and when I travel internationally, it's like I would love to
[01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:14.620]   have a card.
[01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:17.860]   I would love to have a phone with two sims so that I could still get text messages for
[01:22:17.860 --> 01:22:19.820]   people who are meeting with me.
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:24.900]   But again, when I get into the airport, go into a vending machine, buy 20 gigabytes of
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.980]   online data and stick that in.
[01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:27.980]   And now that's my data card.
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:31.020]   Alex, what do you do when you go to Rwanda and Africa?
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.140]   Do you use a dual sim phone?
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:34.140]   I don't.
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:35.860]   I typically just pop a sim.
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:36.860]   You know, like just change the sim.
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:37.860]   A local sim.
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:38.860]   So I have a local sim.
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:43.220]   Then you have a local number, which makes it easier for the folks that you're working
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.220]   with there.
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.580]   You know, so if you're working with a bunch of folks that are local, whether it's Nigeria
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:51.260]   or Cambodia or whatever, you just change the sim out.
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:54.620]   I have some trouble with the iPhones doing that.
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:58.540]   Sometimes they don't work as well as my Samsung.
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.700]   So Samsung oftentimes is my travel.
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:07.620]   I'm going to travel with my Google Fi next or a Pixel because Fi is the same price where
[01:23:07.620 --> 01:23:10.740]   every who are, which $10 a gigabyte.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.780]   And it seems to work pretty well in a lot of countries.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:16.500]   It made deals with a lot of different carriers, including T-Mobile, who's everywhere.
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:17.540]   So I'm just going to see how that works.
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:27.260]   I was able to, last time I was in Machu Picchu, I had cell service.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:31.580]   In general, I'm usually pretty impressed with how far T-Mobile goes, you know, for
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:32.580]   international level.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:36.020]   Every one of the reasons that I have, well, the reason I have T-Mobile as one of my phones
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:43.340]   is because of the ability to most of the time have a phone number that works overseas.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:47.260]   So the other one is really just to make it easier for, again, local people to contact
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.540]   and you get better speeds.
[01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:54.300]   The T-Mobile is like, it's great, but it's like 2G or 3G speeds.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:59.820]   Oftentimes you can get a faster connection if you're buying a local sim.
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:02.300]   And then in each country, it depends on how easy it is.
[01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:06.700]   In Cambodia, you kind of drive by, pick something up, pop it in and prepay a little bit and
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:07.700]   you're done.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:10.020]   In Nigeria, it takes a half an hour.
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:12.900]   They take your fingerprints and they take a picture of you.
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:13.900]   Wow.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:16.580]   Like in Nigeria, I did it at the airport thinking I was just going to go right by and think
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:17.580]   about that.
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:18.580]   Why is that?
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.580]   Is that security?
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:20.580]   It's all security.
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:21.580]   Yeah, they want to know the more.
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:22.580]   So the more repressive the state.
[01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.740]   Oh, no, I don't think it's repressive.
[01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:29.260]   I think it's really just they've had a lot of, you know, all kinds of people using phones
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:30.740]   for all kinds of things.
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:31.740]   Right.
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:33.820]   You know, they're just, it's just more security.
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:38.460]   I just watch in season three of the wire, the burner phone episode and fascinating.
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:42.540]   I'm learning a lot about how to cover my tracks.
[01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:47.060]   If you do not want to spend $90 for Andy's jelly phone or 400, what is it?
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:49.340]   $400 for the iPhone SE.
[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:53.380]   Maybe you'd prefer to spend almost $700 for the new iPhone killer.
[01:24:53.380 --> 01:25:00.340]   This is from Andy Rubin, the guy who created Android and sold it to Google and Sidekick.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.300]   The guy has, was he ever at Apple?
[01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:03.500]   I feel like he might have been in Apple.
[01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:05.420]   Yes, yes he was.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:07.140]   In general magic then.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:14.300]   So no headphone jack and I don't know if, yeah, wild, right?
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:16.740]   And I don't know if this is going to be a harbinger of things to come.
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:17.740]   I kind of hope not.
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:23.140]   It does have a screen that almost entirely fills the final slab so much so that at the
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:28.420]   top of the screen, there's a cutout for the selfie cam and actually goes up.
[01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:32.500]   I figured that'll go underneath the glass eventually, right?
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.500]   I don't know.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.500]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:36.900]   That's translucent from the other side.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.580]   Yeah, I think that'll just be buried underneath the glass and then a generation or so.
[01:25:40.580 --> 01:25:42.100]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:46.980]   Right now they're saying, well, because the notification bar in Android doesn't usually
[01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:52.020]   use the middle, you'll probably be all right, although kind of depends how you set it up.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:55.820]   This is going to be 650 bucks, but then if you want, you could, by the way, they're
[01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.460]   taking reservations now.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:03.100]   This is the one plus strategy for $50.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:09.860]   You can get a clip 360 degree camera that just magnetically clips on.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:14.020]   This is an example from the knitting factory of a concert.
[01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:15.020]   He's on recode tonight.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.020]   Am I remembering that right?
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.020]   He's on the recode.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:19.060]   Yeah, he's on stage at their conference.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:20.060]   So what do you think, Alex?
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:21.900]   You've done a lot of 360 video.
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:23.220]   I should go full screen.
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.220]   I can't go full screen.
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:29.500]   But this looks maybe he's comparable, maybe a little better to the Samsung 360.
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:32.020]   It's no, it's no Osmo.
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.020]   Right?
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:35.620]   Yeah, I can't tell in that.
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:37.420]   It's hard to say.
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:39.380]   What's the URL on it?
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.060]   It's essential.com.
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:49.780]   And this is, they say filmed at the knitting factory concert venue on an essential phone.
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:55.340]   There's also a two lens phone, kind of like the iPhone 7, but unlike the iPhone 7, they're
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:58.940]   doing one of the lenses is monochrome.
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:01.900]   And they say this is going to give you better low light performance.
[01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:02.900]   So that's it's designed.
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:03.900]   I think that's true.
[01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.580]   But I think it's not going to give you the advances in computational photography we're
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.180]   going to see from Apple right there.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:09.180]   They're multi-lapse systems.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:10.180]   Apple and frankly Google.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.980]   Both are doing really impressive stuff.
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:13.300]   How much does Andy know?
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:15.220]   How much did he take with him?
[01:27:15.220 --> 01:27:21.260]   It will be Snapdragon 835, which is the latest processor.
[01:27:21.260 --> 01:27:25.740]   It's pretty much a flagship all around flagship phone.
[01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:32.180]   And they have these pogo pins in the back, kind of like LG and Moto do with these snap-on
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.180]   things.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:34.180]   Oh, this is the thing that's interesting.
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:36.220]   I'd say I said 360, I'm on that page.
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.220]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.620]   It looks pretty good for that's on your phone.
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:42.700]   Yeah, I mean, is it built into the phone?
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:44.420]   No, it's a snap-on module.
[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:45.420]   It snaps on magnetically.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:49.020]   See, the phone has these pogo pins.
[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:50.020]   And then it just clips on.
[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.940]   It's like a smart connector on the iPad.
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:52.940]   Yeah, very much.
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:53.940]   Yeah, right.
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:56.260]   That's pogo pins as well.
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:58.900]   It looks maybe just a touch soft, but it's a.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:27:59.900]   Well, yeah.
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.380]   You're looking at great low light performance.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:02.380]   I mean, you're in a dark area.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.380]   That's the area.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:28:04.380 --> 01:28:05.900]   It's better than the Ricco for sure.
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:07.580]   Yeah, and it's, well, definitely.
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:13.020]   And you don't really see in a dark, what happens when it gets dark with these 360 cameras,
[01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:17.820]   especially when they're mirrored, is the seam that goes between the two lenses because
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:19.340]   of the low frame rate.
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:22.220]   You tend to see one seam that goes around it.
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.300]   And I'm having trouble finding it.
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.300]   This is pretty seamless.
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.300]   So it's, yeah.
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:30.260]   It's a pretty impressive 360 camera, I'd say.
[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:32.580]   I mean, this is the guy's hand, but it's not.
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:34.500]   And then it's such a handle.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.700]   I'll tell you, the guy's hand, I'll tell you where that seam is.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:38.700]   You can see it going across.
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:40.380]   It should be right across here, right?
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.380]   Right there.
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:42.380]   Yeah, I don't see it.
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:44.580]   So out there and you look out and you really don't see it.
[01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:45.980]   Really a little bit, but not much.
[01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:46.980]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:47.980]   A little bit.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:50.500]   Usually you would, on the Ricco and probably on the Samsung.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:51.500]   Samsung.
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:53.660]   That go out quite a bit further.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:54.660]   It's nice.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.660]   It is funny.
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:29:02.820]   You know, we were, 360 at a concert is a funny thing, especially if you like plant it somewhere
[01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:06.700]   because the audience becomes just as interesting as the, as the--
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:07.700]   Absolutely.
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:08.700]   Don't you want to watch the fans?
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:09.700]   This is something--
[01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:10.700]   You know, we're upside down.
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:12.860]   I've done something wrong.
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:17.620]   I still got to say the most fascinating VR experiences are concert videos exactly like
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:22.260]   that because it's the only place, it's the only easy to do video where you literally
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:26.300]   can do exactly what I would be doing there or I'm standing in one position.
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:30.340]   I can't move around because the crowd is all around me, but I can look all around at any
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:31.340]   section of the stage.
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:36.220]   And if I want to turn around and see why am I hearing some Yahoo going, "Woo!
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.260]   Flame curtain man!
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:39.260]   Curtain man!
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:40.260]   Who is that idiot?"
[01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:43.180]   Turn around and see the idiot who's yelling "curtain man!"
[01:29:43.180 --> 01:29:47.420]   And the other thing, Alex, it's got four microphones.
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:50.980]   In 3D, they call it ambisonic tetrahedral arrangement.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.900]   Yeah, ambisonic is kind of the next big thing.
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:55.900]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:30:00.540]   Is supported in, I believe it's supported in Facebook and in YouTube, so--
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:04.380]   And finally, the materials, it's using titanium.
[01:30:04.380 --> 01:30:05.460]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:10.540]   And ceramic, the idea being that titanium, you know, and I've had titanium watches and
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:13.020]   stuff, doesn't dent like aluminum does.
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.140]   Powerbook G4 meets Apple Watch Edition.
[01:30:15.140 --> 01:30:16.140]   Oh, that's right.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:18.500]   The G4 was titanium, isn't it?
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:19.500]   Huh.
[01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:22.900]   A lot of that stuff, at least in my experience, like they give great demos, but if it hits
[01:30:22.900 --> 01:30:25.020]   the wrong thing at the wrong angle, it's still miserable.
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:26.020]   Glass is still glass.
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.780]   Glass is always going to break.
[01:30:27.780 --> 01:30:37.940]   And titanium is still-- When I've had titanium products, they sometimes have a paper quality
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:42.260]   to it where they fatigue really much faster than other materials.
[01:30:42.260 --> 01:30:47.100]   At least in my experience as a user of these things, where they-- Maybe if I drop it, it
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:50.020]   will do better than another material.
[01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:54.420]   But after a year and a half, I will start to see little stress cracks in the corners that
[01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:56.580]   would certainly not be there before.
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:57.580]   And I'm not joking.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:01.900]   It's like literally-- It's like, wow, I'd be taking a piece of hardware that they never
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:02.900]   asked for back.
[01:31:02.900 --> 01:31:03.980]   And I'm looking for, wow, why?
[01:31:03.980 --> 01:31:06.580]   This thing has literally been in a drawer for a year and three months.
[01:31:06.580 --> 01:31:10.100]   Why are there little tiny cracks in the sides of it?
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:12.980]   128 gigs, 4 gigs of RAM.
[01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:16.380]   This, by the way, is a 40 milliamp hour battery.
[01:31:16.380 --> 01:31:19.820]   It's fairly large for an Android device.
[01:31:19.820 --> 01:31:22.580]   This gives you a sense of a large ambisonic mic.
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:25.940]   Oh, it's an sonic screwdriver, man.
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:26.940]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:27.940]   Wow.
[01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:28.940]   Yeah, so--
[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:29.940]   That's four capsules.
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:32.940]   Four capsules there.
[01:31:32.940 --> 01:31:34.180]   But that just has a miniature version of that.
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:39.140]   Anyway, this is-- I mean, who even knows what kind of availability they'll be?
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:42.940]   You have to reserve it, and then you're getting line, and you will find out when it comes
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.100]   out.
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:45.740]   But some have said iPhone killer.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:47.780]   I don't know if that's the case.
[01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:52.100]   When you can manufacture in smaller quantities-- Amazon showed this with tablets.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:55.300]   When you can manufacture in smaller quantities, you can do a lot of interesting things with
[01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:58.740]   materials that just don't scale to hundreds of millions of units yet.
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:31:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.740]   So it's cool that we get to see this stuff, though.
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:01.740]   Right.
[01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:06.220]   I mean, also, this is where a lot of the future of the market is going to be driven, where
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.260]   it doesn't necessarily do things better than any other phone.
[01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:12.380]   But my goodness, the material is the styling, how you feel when you take it out of your
[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:16.020]   pocket, how you feel when you put it on the top of your dresser at the end of the day.
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:19.540]   That is legitimately part of the experience that people are willing to pay an extra 200
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:20.540]   bucks for.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:24.140]   And quite frankly, if the people in Mountain View and Cupertino wake up and the marketing
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:26.740]   and engineering people, synapse will start firing when they look at this and thinking
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:27.740]   of ideas.
[01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:28.900]   And oh, we've got these people on our heels now, too.
[01:32:28.900 --> 01:32:29.900]   It's better for everybody.
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:34.540]   I got to say, I love the idea of having Pogo Plug contacts for external cameras, because
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:39.260]   just think about the-- if all Apple or another company did was saying we don't have-- even
[01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:43.700]   have any specific ideas for this stuff, we just think that it'd be so easy to give third
[01:32:43.700 --> 01:32:49.740]   party hardware manufacturers a pipeline directly into the hardware.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:54.900]   If somebody wanted to take a Sony 20 megapixel sensor and put it in a capsule like that,
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:59.020]   they would simply clip on for people who want to spend $300 for something that can keep up
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:03.700]   with live action and low light much better than even an iPhone or top-level Android
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:04.700]   phone can.
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:05.700]   That's fascinating.
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:06.700]   That's--
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:10.260]   It would be great if they did the camera module, the extended battery module, the extended
[01:33:10.260 --> 01:33:11.260]   speaker module.
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:14.380]   I mean, not the way that LG did it, where it's like a John Woo movie and you have to
[01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:17.660]   check that spin around and slow-mo, put the new one in, spin back around.
[01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:21.660]   It's not like a Lego set or like the-- was it the fish tank one that Google was working
[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:22.660]   with?
[01:33:22.660 --> 01:33:26.740]   But if it's really just slapping this on, like-- yeah, if you're slapping it on like the smart
[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:29.620]   connector with the keyboard and other technologies, that's fantastic.
[01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:31.740]   It's just a better way of doing it.
[01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:32.740]   Let's take a break.
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:36.300]   WordPress is our sponsor today, WordPress.com.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:40.860]   That's where my site, Leo Laporte, is, LeoVille.com, my blog.
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:43.380]   I have to say, I'm really having fun with it.
[01:33:43.380 --> 01:33:50.180]   I'm going to be posting a lot of images here, getting ready for that from my trip.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:57.100]   WordPress, I started using WordPress, godly, 10 years ago, but I hosted it myself.
[01:33:57.100 --> 01:34:01.780]   And then I moved to another platform briefly, because they were a sponsor.
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:05.020]   But I'm so glad WordPress is back, because I am so glad to be back on WordPress.
[01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:08.340]   And this time I decided not to serve it myself.
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.780]   I didn't want to pay for a server.
[01:34:09.780 --> 01:34:11.940]   And frankly, I love the idea that at WordPress.com.
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:14.540]   Not only do they keep it up to date, keep it secure.
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:17.700]   They've got all the plug-ins, all the capabilities of myself hosted.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:19.780]   But there's also a community at WordPress.com.
[01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:25.540]   In fact, it blows me away when I go to my site and I see that I have more than half a million
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.300]   followers at WordPress.com.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.580]   It's as big as my Twitter feed.
[01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:32.620]   People who will get an update when I post on my blog.
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:33.780]   It's really nice.
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:36.500]   You should be on WordPress.com.
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:41.020]   WordPress powers 27% of all the websites in the world.
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:43.620]   That's an amazing number.
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:48.100]   And whether you're doing a blog or a business site or both, you're going to make a big impact
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:50.180]   when you build your website on WordPress.com.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:53.700]   A lot of big sites, Throt.com, runs on WordPress.
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:56.180]   I think ReCode is running on WordPress.
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:35:01.340]   Last time I checked, you get built-in search engine optimization, you get social sharing.
[01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.780]   When you build your website on WordPress.com, not only are you part of a community, you get
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:10.580]   support from the community and from WordPress directly 24/7.
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:15.780]   Our websites run on WordPress than any other platform.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:19.340]   I know Matt Mullenway, the guy who created it in the first place and I've known these
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:24.340]   guys for years and I'm just so thrilled to have them on our network.
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:29.980]   I think we were the first podcast they'd ever tried and I'm just thrilled about it.
[01:35:29.980 --> 01:35:30.980]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:31.980]   We've got a deal.
[01:35:31.980 --> 01:35:32.980]   Of course we do.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:37.980]   If you go to WordPress.com/MacBreak, you get 15% off any new plan purchase.
[01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:41.820]   Of course there's a free tier too but if you're a business, you're going to want to get one
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:44.260]   of the business tiers and save 15%.
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:48.500]   Look at the website and find the membership plan that's right for you.
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.140]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:55.980]   I love my new WordPress site.
[01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:59.820]   I have all the widgets for social media.
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:01.820]   It takes my tweets.
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.740]   It takes my Instagrams.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:10.700]   It makes it very easy for me to post stuff and all my podcasts are there too.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.860]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:15.620]   Let's see.
[01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:17.740]   On we go.
[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:21.300]   I got a little bit behind here and I should have been paying attention to the time.
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:24.020]   We've got another half hour before we have to run out.
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.740]   Let's see.
[01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:28.460]   Interesting little tidbit.
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:37.340]   The Apple staff has been told, the AppleCare workers have been told, "Don't take your vacation
[01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:41.340]   after September 17th."
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:44.340]   Don't take your vacation after September 17th.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:47.380]   I think that happens every year.
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:48.980]   Is it always the same date?
[01:36:48.980 --> 01:36:49.980]   It's always a wrap.
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:50.980]   I mean the carriers will do stuff too.
[01:36:50.980 --> 01:36:52.860]   The carriers will say they'll have blackout periods.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:56.420]   It means that's when the iPhone will be out and we're going to need a lot of workers
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:58.420]   on hand.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:02.300]   It could be the 7S and 7S plus.
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.900]   It might not be the 8 yet.
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:06.420]   It's also not terribly shocking.
[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:10.300]   Wow, that means there's going to be a new iPhone and it'll probably happen in mid-to-late
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:11.300]   September.
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:12.300]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.300]   All right, never mind.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.300]   I'm looking for anything.
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:16.260]   Oh, no, I'm making fun.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.100]   It's a data point.
[01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:21.140]   It's just another data point.
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:22.820]   It's just more news.
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:29.580]   LG is building a $3.5 billion OLED factory in Korea.
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:33.100]   Of course, the expectation is that they're going to do that because they'd love to get
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:37.820]   some of that nice Apple money.
[01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:45.620]   Samsung of course has a deal to do, I think, 95 million OLED displays this year for Apple,
[01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:47.700]   probably for the iPhone 8.
[01:37:47.700 --> 01:37:52.700]   But Apple, as you know, nobody likes to have a single supplier, certainly not Apple.
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:53.700]   And so...
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:54.700]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:56.140]   But now don't get your hopes up.
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:38:02.060]   I hope that when you build this LG that you can make micro LED as well.
[01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:04.860]   Yeah, and quantum dot and whoever else they go.
[01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:09.500]   Yeah, because, yeah, you know, micro LEDs on its way.
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:10.500]   Holographic's man.
[01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:11.500]   It's all about the holograph.
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:12.500]   It's all about the holograph.
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:13.500]   It's all about the holograph.
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.300]   Just to learn the micro LED and now it's like a mama.
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:17.260]   It's also possible that part of the...
[01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:21.060]   Part of the math that went into building this plant is maybe as we...
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:26.460]   When we get closer to having this plant ready and up to capacity, some company is going
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:32.620]   to pre-buy all of our output for the next three or four years thus guaranteeing its profitability.
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:37.500]   Because with so many companies making this so many devices that require identical type
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:41.380]   components, constraints are happening everywhere.
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:45.140]   And if you can lock down ownership, we will be able to...
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:49.660]   If we sell four times as many phones as in our most avaricious nightmares, we will still
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:52.020]   be able to have enough screens to make that happen.
[01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:55.060]   That's a big win for everybody.
[01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.060]   I still...
[01:38:56.060 --> 01:38:57.060]   I don't...
[01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:58.060]   Is Johnny and I have on sabbatical?
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:38:59.060]   Is he hanging around the campus?
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:00.060]   Do we know?
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:01.060]   He's building a whole new campus.
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:04.180]   Yeah, that new campus is up and almost running.
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:05.180]   I get...
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.340]   Do you think he's involved at this point though?
[01:39:06.340 --> 01:39:07.340]   It's just mostly...
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:08.340]   Yeah.
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:11.060]   He's probably hand polishing all those windows and stick it in place.
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:15.740]   He's probably just roaming every single room with a screwdriver, making sure that all
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:19.620]   the wall plates, make sure the wires and screw holes line up vertically.
[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.780]   Yeah, not front-hores readily.
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:22.780]   Very important.
[01:39:22.780 --> 01:39:27.780]   Well, we know his compatriot at Apple, Mark Newsom, has been working on a new product,
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:32.420]   a $12,000 hourglass filled with nano balls.
[01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:33.700]   But look at those nano balls.
[01:39:33.700 --> 01:39:36.340]   But they're the most beautiful nano balls ever made.
[01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:39.580]   Micro balls are good enough for Apple designers, aren't they?
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:42.540]   We have to have nano balls.
[01:39:42.540 --> 01:39:49.220]   This is for Houdinkey, which is Kevin Rose's watch blog site.
[01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:51.660]   Kevin is kind of...
[01:39:51.660 --> 01:39:53.340]   I think he's out of the day-to-day operations.
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:55.500]   He's like chairman of the board now.
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:40:04.340]   Houdinkey explains why you might want a 10, 12,000-dollar nano ball filled hourglass.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:05.780]   Because someone else has one.
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:09.500]   Yeah, there's only a hundred of them, so you know.
[01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:12.460]   Here they are in all their nano glory.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:14.220]   They're moving very, very slowly.
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:19.620]   It is perhaps one of the most fundamental objects in the world of timekeeping, and arguably
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.820]   one of the oldest.
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:25.220]   But I love the fact that it's so sort of deeply esoteric.
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:28.700]   It has this strange, of mesmeric quality.
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:30.340]   On one hand, you're witnessing tons.
[01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:32.620]   That sounds like the rain air that has.
[01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:34.780]   Does it look $12,000 beautiful?
[01:40:34.780 --> 01:40:36.540]   It's actually different.
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:40.420]   To somebody who can't afford $12,000 on a car, it looks stuck.
[01:40:40.420 --> 01:40:41.420]   It's not worth that.
[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:45.060]   There's someone who really loves into this and has enough money to pursue things they
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:46.060]   enjoy.
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:47.060]   So they're kind of magnetic.
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:48.860]   It looks like they kind of arranged themselves.
[01:40:48.860 --> 01:40:51.180]   I want nano bots in my hourglass.
[01:40:51.180 --> 01:40:53.260]   I pay 12 grand for nano bots in there.
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:55.140]   They spell out my name or something.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:56.980]   One of the special 100-piece editions.
[01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:58.180]   I bet Kevin Rose has one.
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.180]   I don't know if they're magnetic at all.
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:41:01.100]   I think it's just that they're just perfectly round.
[01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:03.940]   So they just organize themselves.
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.340]   Self-organizing balls.
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:08.140]   That's all we need.
[01:41:08.140 --> 01:41:11.380]   Are they in the ball union?
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:12.380]   Is there any other kind?
[01:41:12.380 --> 01:41:15.860]   Wow, Tim Cook's doing actually the glass one.
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:16.860]   That's kind of neat.
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:18.300]   That's why Tim's doing the hobby.
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:19.300]   You needed a hobby.
[01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.300]   There's still something on the side.
[01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:22.580]   You want something done right?
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:23.500]   You got to do it yourself.
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:24.500]   That's right.
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:25.500]   That's right.
[01:41:25.500 --> 01:41:27.260]   Don't think Steve Jobs didn't blow some glass in his time.
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:29.780]   I thought that was stick from the Daredevil show.
[01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:31.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:32.420]   Like nano-glau.
[01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:38.420]   I just feel so sorry for the kids in any house whose parent owns one of these because
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:45.300]   there'll be A between something that is genetically designed to provoke a genetic response of joy
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:47.660]   and interest in a little small child.
[01:41:47.660 --> 01:41:54.420]   But if you use I swear, if I come home and I see, I even smell peanut butter in my office,
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:56.340]   you are getting spanked.
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:42:01.060]   If I come home and there's peanut butter on my nano balls, you're going to hear from
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:04.580]   my attorney.
[01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:06.460]   So I guess Mark has a little free time.
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:07.460]   I don't know.
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:09.500]   Oh, it's a cool subject.
[01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.500]   If you break it, that's going to be a lot of cleanup.
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.500]   Like getting rid of all the nano balls.
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.500]   You'll find nano balls.
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:17.060]   If you have, yeah, you're going to have nano balls in your ears.
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:18.060]   You're going to have them everywhere.
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.660]   There's not every crevice will be filled with nano balls.
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:22.980]   You're going to be very sorry.
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:23.980]   Those things get every.
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:24.980]   Have you ever had that happen?
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:26.180]   They get everywhere.
[01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:27.180]   Yes.
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:28.180]   Mm-hmm.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:29.180]   Apple Maps.
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:33.100]   According to a site called iMore.com.
[01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:34.100]   Apple Maps now.
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:35.100]   Thanks.
[01:42:35.100 --> 01:42:36.100]   Fake news.
[01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:37.100]   Fake news.
[01:42:37.100 --> 01:42:38.100]   Yellow.
[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:39.620]   It's the new yellow iMore.
[01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:43.900]   Now Apple Maps will let you tour Apple Park in 3D glory.
[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:44.900]   Yep.
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.860]   Just don't look for the design lab.
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:47.860]   Oh, is it really?
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:48.860]   Is it blanked out?
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:50.860]   No, I, well, I just stand on the outside.
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:51.860]   But it's all there.
[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:52.860]   It's really awesome.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:53.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:42:54.860 --> 01:42:58.900]   By the way, if you're not in California, make sure you say Apple Park Cupertino, California,
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:05.420]   because according to your correspondent, Michael Sargent, who lives in in the Midwest,
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:09.060]   he got Apple Park, which is an apple orchard in Kansas.
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:10.900]   And that's not in 3D.
[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:11.900]   Yep.
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:12.900]   I would show you.
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:13.900]   I would get shut up.
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:16.740]   I would show you, but Apple Maps doesn't work on Windows.
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:23.820]   Well, you know, the JavaScript version does, but I won't get you very far.
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:27.660]   Making a website that can be displayed on more than one platform.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:28.980]   That's tricky stuff.
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:31.340]   You got to have some pretty good engineers to make that happen.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.340]   Believe you me.
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:35.340]   I'm not going to be able to do that.
[01:43:35.340 --> 01:43:36.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:37.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:38.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:42.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:43.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:52.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:59.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:43:59.340 --> 01:44:02.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:03.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.

[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:53.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:54.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:55.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:56.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:57.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:47:58.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:59.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:00.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:01.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:02.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:03.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:05.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:06.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:07.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:08.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:15.340]   I asked him when he says, "Nah, still few months off."
[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:16.340]   What is that building in the middle there?
[01:48:16.340 --> 01:48:17.340]   Is that just temporary structure?
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:18.340]   It could be.
[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:19.340]   It might be.
[01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:20.340]   This is the inside is the park, of course.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:21.340]   Still no corner office for Tim Cook.
[01:48:21.340 --> 01:48:23.340]   The only thing he asked me was make me a corner office.
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:24.340]   Steve said, "No corner office for you.
[01:48:24.340 --> 01:48:26.340]   I'm making the whole thing round."
[01:48:26.340 --> 01:48:27.340]   That's a temporary.
[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:28.340]   That's got to be a temporary building.
[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:29.340]   I'm probably the construction office.
[01:48:29.340 --> 01:48:30.340]   I wonder what's this part.
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:31.340]   That must have been preserved.
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:32.340]   Petting zoo.
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:33.340]   They get their own petting zoo.
[01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:34.340]   Cool.
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:35.340]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:42.340]   That's a Ferrari garage.
[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.340]   That's where they're building the blimp.
[01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:45.340]   Sergey's got one, Tim wants one.
[01:48:45.340 --> 01:48:48.340]   Do you see the price on that blimp?
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:49.340]   No.
[01:48:49.340 --> 01:48:54.340]   Sergey Brin, the founder of Google, has been renting Moffat Field,
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:58.340]   which used to be an aerodrome for Zeppelin's many moons ago.
[01:48:58.340 --> 01:49:01.340]   They have these giant hangers, blimp hangers.
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:04.340]   It turns out Sergey's actually building a blimp in one of them.
[01:49:04.340 --> 01:49:05.340]   They still have Alex.
[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:06.340]   There was some article about it.
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:10.340]   I think they said it was $150 million to $180 million.
[01:49:10.340 --> 01:49:11.340]   That's nothing for him.
[01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:14.340]   Isn't they have a 747 party jet for a while?
[01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:17.340]   If they parked at the NASA field across the country.
[01:49:17.340 --> 01:49:18.340]   I'm pretty sure they have a 747.
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:19.340]   I don't know what the party has.
[01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:20.340]   That's the NASA field.
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:21.340]   It was when they were younger, Alex.
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:22.340]   Back when they could still party.
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.340]   They definitely get about on their own.
[01:49:24.340 --> 01:49:27.340]   There's nothing better for parties in a Zeppelin.
[01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:30.340]   I just bless them, Leo, because if I had that many billions of
[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:32.340]   dollars in my 20s, I don't think I'd have to do that.
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:34.340]   I would have seen the other end of it.
[01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:37.340]   I could have won the 747 one now on this planet.
[01:49:37.340 --> 01:49:42.340]   This is the security.
[01:49:42.340 --> 01:49:49.340]   This is the place I will never get past right here as you go in.
[01:49:49.340 --> 01:49:51.340]   That's the Leo Laport tackling zone.
[01:49:51.340 --> 01:49:53.340]   Stop Leo's zone.
[01:49:53.340 --> 01:49:55.340]   I'm going to get a bulldozer.
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:56.340]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.340]   Don't worry.
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:58.340]   I didn't mind.
[01:49:58.340 --> 01:49:59.340]   I don't.
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:00.340]   That's fine.
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:04.340]   You'll find out how many of those trees are actually Apple security people.
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:10.340]   I am going to, though, as soon as we get a little closer to September call Apple.
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:11.340]   How many are competitors in the Leucid?
[01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:13.340]   You've got to let me in.
[01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:14.340]   Just once.
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:15.340]   I promise no cameras.
[01:50:15.340 --> 01:50:16.340]   I won't bring any electronics.
[01:50:16.340 --> 01:50:18.340]   I won't bring a Windows laptop.
[01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:19.340]   I promise.
[01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:20.340]   Just let me in.
[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:21.340]   I'll wear an Apple watch.
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:22.340]   I swear to God.
[01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:23.340]   Just let me in.
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:24.340]   I've got to go to that event.
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:25.340]   Laport's on the campus.
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:26.340]   Laport's on the campus.
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:27.340]   The doctor.
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:28.340]   The doctor.
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:30.340]   Some guy talking into his sleeve.
[01:50:30.340 --> 01:50:31.340]   Exterminate.
[01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:36.340]   Well, they do have Robocops now in Dubai.
[01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:38.340]   It could be.
[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:39.340]   Or move creep.
[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:45.340]   Apple watch is, we've always said it, but now we know it's true.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:52.340]   The most accurate heart rate monitor in a wrist-worn device.
[01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:55.340]   Recent study from Stanford against.
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:56.340]   That's a vanity explain.
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:51:01.340]   There is serenity looking very serious as R2D to Nader.
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:02.340]   Yes.
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:09.340]   She, a group of scientists at Stanford in partnership with the Swedish School of Sport and Health
[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:10.340]   Services.
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:15.340]   I should say, this Swedish school of sport and health services in Stockholm claim the
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:18.340]   Apple watch monitor has the smallest margin of error.
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:22.340]   Two percent out of seven tested devices including the Mio alpha two.
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:25.340]   The pulse on the Microsoft band, which is no longer made.
[01:51:25.340 --> 01:51:28.340]   The Fitbit serves the basis peak.
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:33.340]   Pretty close.
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:39.340]   The gold standard that they compared it to.
[01:51:39.340 --> 01:51:46.340]   I presume they don't say, but I presume is a chest strap.
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:53.340]   Or maybe one of those things, electrical things you hold.
[01:51:53.340 --> 01:52:01.340]   Neither garments nor polar sport specific wrist tracker were included in the study.
[01:52:01.340 --> 01:52:04.340]   So maybe there are better ones out there.
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:08.340]   This is against only against these other seven.
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:09.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:12.340]   And there's not any special lies in this stuff like polar.
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:13.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:19.340]   It shows you how hard I think Apple is working to be to get that word of mouth amongst people
[01:52:19.340 --> 01:52:22.340]   who are really using these devices seriously.
[01:52:22.340 --> 01:52:27.340]   Well, really, I think that if you tell people that by a wide margin, this is the most accurate
[01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:30.340]   heart rate monitor that's simply built into a convenient watch.
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:32.340]   You don't have to wear a strap or anything.
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.340]   That's how you get everybody who's interested in fitness wearing your device.
[01:52:35.340 --> 01:52:38.340]   You got it'll take a lot to turn people's attention away from that.
[01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:42.340]   Because it's not only just good on the face of it, but it also communicates here is how
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:47.340]   seriously this designer, this manufacturer is taking the purpose of this device.
[01:52:47.340 --> 01:52:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:51.340]   Well, and whether there's better devices, two percent is pretty darn close.
[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:53.340]   I will take that for sure.
[01:52:53.340 --> 01:52:57.340]   Especially in a watch device that has a bunch of other features woven into it as well.
[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:00.340]   It is a case though that you have to wear it right.
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:07.340]   And if you have a particularly hairy arm or a tattooed arm or if you're not white, it
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:08.340]   may not work as well, right?
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:13.340]   I think it's mostly the tattoo, like the variation and the opacity of a tattoo that has caused
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:14.340]   their problems.
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:15.340]   I don't think this is not a problem otherwise.
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:18.340]   I don't have to shave a little patch on my wrist.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.340]   Don't wear the laser button.
[01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:21.340]   The laser button will take care of that.
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:23.340]   Actually, it works very...
[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:26.340]   It's what I use when I really want to keep track of my heart rate.
[01:53:26.340 --> 01:53:32.340]   And I often do compare it to a chest strap or the handles on my tread miller or my exercise
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:33.340]   bicycle.
[01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:34.340]   And it's always very accurate.
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:36.340]   But occasionally it'll lose track.
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:38.340]   And I think that's because it's slid down lower.
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:39.340]   It's not as tight or whatever.
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:40.340]   Or if it's lose, yeah.
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:43.340]   But you should lock if it loses contact for long enough.
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:46.340]   It should lock on you and you'll know.
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:47.340]   What does that mean?
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:51.340]   Because it uses the connection to your skin to maintain the access to the device.
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:52.340]   Oh interesting.
[01:53:52.340 --> 01:53:55.340]   It loses contact with your skin to lock screen.
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:56.340]   Yeah, no it hasn't.
[01:53:56.340 --> 01:53:57.340]   It didn't do that.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:54:01.340]   But the other day I was working with a trainer and it was pretty accurate.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:05.340]   And then all of a sudden it went from 121 beats per minute to 84 or something.
[01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:07.340]   And I know what my heart was still beating.
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:09.340]   Oh no, it was like equilibrium Leo.
[01:54:09.340 --> 01:54:12.340]   When you just like the guy is on the machine and suddenly Leo takes a breath and he goes
[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:14.340]   not completely without incident.
[01:54:14.340 --> 01:54:15.340]   What a recovery rate.
[01:54:15.340 --> 01:54:18.340]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:21.340]   Your picks of the week my friends coming up in moments.
[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:23.340]   But first I want to tell you why I smell so good.
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:24.340]   You probably noticed.
[01:54:24.340 --> 01:54:27.340]   You smell awfully good these days.
[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:29.340]   You know, it's actually an issue for me.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:30.340]   I can't wear cologne.
[01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:33.340]   Lisa does not is very sensitive to strong smells.
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:38.340]   In fact, I have to get her approval before I use any product.
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:42.340]   And I've been using Orzen Alps lately and she loves it.
[01:54:42.340 --> 01:54:43.340]   It's nice.
[01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:48.340]   In fact, if you have a college graduate, you know, you're celebrating or a father.
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:50.340]   Maybe you have a teenager, a teenage boy.
[01:54:50.340 --> 01:54:52.340]   You got to give him Orzen Alps.
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:55:00.340]   This was designed by Laura and Mia to great entrepreneurs who had sportsman husbands.
[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:07.340]   And as we all know guys, it's the ladies in our life who tell us you need to take care
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:08.340]   of your skin.
[01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:09.340]   It's not your.
[01:55:09.340 --> 01:55:16.340]   So they designed skin care products for their husbands, worked with leading chemists to help
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:21.340]   men with skin that gets dried out and extreme outdoor conditions.
[01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:26.340]   But also, you know, I go to the gym as I was mentioning and the work, you know, this is
[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:27.340]   so great.
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:28.340]   I didn't used to carry a face wash.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:30.340]   Now I carry the Orzen Alps stick.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:32.340]   This never spills.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:37.340]   It's a solid face wash for men and it's men like it because watch.
[01:55:37.340 --> 01:55:43.340]   It'll put it on like you're getting ready for the big game, right?
[01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:44.340]   It blackens your face.
[01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:47.060]   And the reason is this is activated charcoal and it not microbeats.
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:50.660]   I don't use anything with microbeats anymore because that's bad for the environment.
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:55.860]   The charcoal works great to give you a little, a little abrasion to clean, you know, to clean
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:58.740]   off the dead skin cells.
[01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.540]   You know, you can actually wash your face without washing your face.
[01:56:01.540 --> 01:56:02.860]   Look at that.
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:05.220]   And then it's, I just love it.
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:07.300]   It smells so great.
[01:56:07.300 --> 01:56:08.780]   It's great for traveling.
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:14.580]   This is, that's the Orzen Alps power cleansing face stick, but they also make an Orzen Alps
[01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:20.140]   active deodorant, active armor with alpine caribou moss.
[01:56:20.140 --> 01:56:21.860]   Now there's no aluminum in this.
[01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:24.300]   This is not an anti-perspirant.
[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:27.740]   And I know there's sometimes you want to wear an anti-perspirant, but when you're working
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:31.900]   out or, you know, hiking or you're rowing, you want, it's important you sweat.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:34.180]   You do not want to block your sweat glands with aluminum.
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:35.860]   The size of aluminum is not great for you.
[01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:38.580]   But this will keep you from stinking.
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:41.220]   So you smell good, but you still sweat.
[01:56:41.220 --> 01:56:43.280]   So this is what you want to wear.
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:46.540]   Your skincare should keep up with your on the go lifestyle.
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:49.020]   What a great gift for Father's Day.
[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:51.820]   Orzen Alps, I'll tell you the deal in a second.
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:53.700]   This is the face moisturizer and eye cream.
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:56.860]   They knew that guys wouldn't use both, you know, two different products.
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:01.140]   So they made it one, a two in one hydrating and anti-aging face and eye cream.
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:02.140]   It's non greasy.
[01:57:02.140 --> 01:57:04.380]   It's fast absorbing.
[01:57:04.380 --> 01:57:06.220]   And guys aren't going to complain about the smell.
[01:57:06.220 --> 01:57:07.820]   And neither are the ladies.
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:10.580]   Lisa loves how it smells.
[01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:13.940]   I got, I got to tell you, this is a great product and a great gift.
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:15.340]   Ours is in rowing.
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:17.140]   Alps is in skiing.
[01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:21.460]   They're offering the Twitter audience a fresh start and a great gift comes in a beautiful
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:22.460]   package.
[01:57:22.460 --> 01:57:27.220]   Join the thousands of guys using Ours and Alps by visiting oursandalps.com/twit.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:29.820]   You'll get 15% off your first order.
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:31.020]   Ours, see an Alps.
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:36.700]   Get it, O-A-R-S-A-N-D-A-L-P-S dot com slash.
[01:57:36.700 --> 01:57:42.940]   Twit smells great, works great, and it's a great price.
[01:57:42.940 --> 01:57:44.460]   All of these products last you about three months.
[01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:46.180]   This is thick, which looks small.
[01:57:46.180 --> 01:57:48.580]   It's really great for the gym bag or for travel.
[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:50.580]   All of these, by the way, TSA size.
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:57.220]   So they're no problem getting them through the screening.
[01:57:57.220 --> 01:58:00.100]   But this little product, these last three months, it's great.
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:02.340]   Oursandalps.com/twit.
[01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:05.980]   We thank them for the support of Mac Break Weekly and now it is time, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:06.980]   for our picks of the week.
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:11.460]   And we haven't had a really good Alex pick in a while.
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:12.460]   I'm ready.
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:13.460]   It helped your wallets.
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:14.900]   Get out your wallets, kids.
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:16.180]   No, this one isn't too bad.
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:18.340]   This one isn't too bad.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:22.060]   This one is made by a company called Luma Labs.
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:24.260]   And if you look at it here, let's see here.
[01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:25.260]   Right, Konik.
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:26.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:58:26.260 --> 01:58:27.260]   Yeah.
[01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:28.980]   So this little guy here is a light meter.
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:34.620]   So we have oftentimes needs to know exactly how bright things are.
[01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:37.820]   And calibrate what your camera's set to.
[01:58:37.820 --> 01:58:40.780]   And these light meters can get pretty expensive to get this.
[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:45.220]   And so what you're able to do is actually push this into your headphone jack.
[01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:49.740]   You can use it through an adapter if you have an iPhone 7.
[01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:53.620]   But you push it into the headphone jack and it's talking to the phone.
[01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:57.900]   And then it's measuring your, if I hit the little button here, boom.
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:58:58.900]   It's here.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:58:59.900]   There you go.
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:00.900]   There's my look at that.
[01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:01.900]   Look at that.
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:04.620]   Right now, which is just, you know, it's for 60 bucks.
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:06.380]   It's pretty nifty.
[01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:08.940]   That is a great product.
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:11.420]   You can have it be Lux or Footcandals.
[01:59:11.420 --> 01:59:14.460]   And there's, you know, some other, there's other settings there that you can have, you
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:20.500]   know, so you can have like, you know, guide your, you know, settings on your, on your,
[01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.500]   on your camera.
[01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:25.820]   You know, so there's like, there's a couple of different ways of managing this.
[01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:31.140]   But anyway, we, you know, it's something that I eat, I need often enough and it's great.
[01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:35.140]   It comes in a little case and you can just kind of throw it in there and measure the
[01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:42.140]   lights, measure your light, your ambient light, your spot metering, so on and so forth.
[01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:43.140]   So it's pretty cool.
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:47.020]   It's made by, again, it's called the Luma Light Meter and it's by Luma Labs.
[01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:49.220]   L-U dot M-U is the website.
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:51.020]   L-U dot M-U, right?
[01:59:51.020 --> 01:59:52.020]   Yep.
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:55.580]   And it's a little light, I, you know, it's funny because you can, there are plenty of
[01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:59.540]   light meter apps for the iPhone and none of them were really very usable.
[01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:01.780]   So I ended up just buying a standalone light meter.
[02:00:01.780 --> 02:00:02.780]   Right.
[02:00:02.780 --> 02:00:03.780]   Right.
[02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:07.580]   And this one, yeah, this one is, you know, that having a dedicated sensor, it's one thing
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:09.820]   to try to use the camera but really having dedicated sensors.
[02:00:09.820 --> 02:00:10.820]   Yeah.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:11.820]   Yep.
[02:00:11.820 --> 02:00:12.820]   Yep.
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:13.820]   Absolutely.
[02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:14.820]   Yeah.
[02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:16.900]   Well, plus there's the issue of incident light or reflected light, right?
[02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:18.860]   And so this is nice.
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:23.620]   So you can, and this measures color temperature too, as well as luminance.
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:24.620]   That's neat.
[02:00:24.620 --> 02:00:25.620]   Yeah.
[02:00:25.620 --> 02:00:32.500]   Out of all, with all iOS devices, because it uses the lightning connector, not the headphone
[02:00:32.500 --> 02:00:33.500]   jack.
[02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:35.020]   Well, the one I have, the one I have is the headphone jack.
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:36.660]   Oh, well, this is different then.
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:38.420]   So then this is more expensive.
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:41.220]   Another more expensive or newer version that I don't have.
[02:00:41.220 --> 02:00:42.220]   Yeah.
[02:00:42.220 --> 02:00:43.220]   It's fine.
[02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:44.220]   I think it's the same.
[02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:45.220]   Now I'm crushing.
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:46.220]   Now maybe, well, wait a minute now.
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:47.220]   Maybe this is a different one.
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:48.220]   No, you, I think you have the right one.
[02:00:48.220 --> 02:00:49.220]   They may have.
[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:50.220]   Right.
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:53.700]   It looks the same except that it looks like they, they, that, what you're looking for.
[02:00:53.700 --> 02:00:56.280]   This is a new one that they designed for the iPhone 7.
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:57.280]   It's a pre-order.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:58.280]   It's more expensive.
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:00:59.280]   It's $229.
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:03.020]   And it doesn't look like it's, it looks like it's pre-ordered for, it's not out.
[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:04.020]   It's shipping this month.
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:05.020]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:06.480]   Or, you know, so, so this is the same company.
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:07.480]   It's just a.
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:08.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.480]   It does look like it's got a couple extra features in it.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:12.900]   So if you want the one with the headphone jack, that's a lot, it's half the price, third
[02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:15.540]   the price, and eighth the price, I don't know what it is.
[02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:16.780]   It's a lot less.
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:17.780]   It's massive.
[02:01:17.780 --> 02:01:23.760]   The winner of the price and even $300 buying a real one is going to cost you four to five.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:24.760]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:25.760]   Yeah.
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:26.760]   There were a good, a good light meters.
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:30.380]   And this one is great because you can then, this is what you want to do.
[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:33.120]   Record that meat reading in your phone.
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:34.700]   So you have a note of it.
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:39.700]   See, I'm always, I'm really bad at making, you know, John taught me this, making notes
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:44.080]   on the settings that I use for a shot, but this will report it for you.
[02:01:44.080 --> 02:01:47.960]   And also, and also the thing is, is it allows them to, you know, light meter interfaces
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:50.400]   tend to be inherently messed up.
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:53.560]   You know, so, I mean, they're, they're light, they're great light meters, but they're just
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:54.800]   not, not good interfaces.
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:58.600]   And so once you move it to the iPhone, I feel like, you know, I have another one that does
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:02:02.640]   temperature, you know, it's a little, you know, kind of like this temperature.
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:03.640]   Yeah, that's cool.
[02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:04.640]   Yeah.
[02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:05.640]   Oh, I don't know what this one does.
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:06.640]   Yeah.
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:09.800]   This one does, but, but the, but I have a, I have one that's specifically a temperature
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:11.040]   gauge.
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:14.200]   And, and just, you know, now you have a full interface on your iPhone.
[02:02:14.200 --> 02:02:17.480]   And, you know, the sensor itself is kind of, is very basic.
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:22.080]   It's all the math that goes into figuring out what that sensor means.
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:26.560]   And that can easily, just more easily be done on an iPhone than a dedicated piece of hardware.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:29.360]   All that and a tenth of an Alex.
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:31.120]   There you go.
[02:02:31.120 --> 02:02:32.120]   Amazing.
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:33.120]   Put on, boom.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:35.520]   Andy and I co your pick of the week.
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:37.080]   This is really, really fun.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:41.680]   I've had this for the, for a couple months now, this is the Samsung gear 360 version
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:42.680]   two camera.
[02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:45.640]   Is it out now or do I have to buy the European or the Korean version?
[02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:50.320]   No, no, I, it's, you get on Amazon now, they didn't announce a price a couple months ago.
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:54.040]   It's only $229, which is not a lot of money.
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:59.440]   And for a super, super fun camera takes, I just, in addition to the pictures it takes,
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:00.920]   I love the form factor of it.
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:06.360]   It's, yes, it is like a Miyazaki sort of wood sprite sort of shape.
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:10.720]   Or you see these things like gathering that does, but you just hold it up.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:12.320]   There is a power on button.
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:16.760]   All there is is you, it makes this cool noise when you turn it on.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:20.040]   When you turn it on, when you turn it on after forgetting.
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:21.040]   There you go.
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:22.880]   Makes it, makes it, makes a squish.
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:26.680]   And then all you see is just an OLED screen that says here's so much video recording time.
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:32.120]   Have you, you have left, there is a simple mode button for switching between pictures,
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:33.760]   still pictures and video.
[02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:36.200]   And it's just one button right here.
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:42.960]   And because it's a 360 degree camera, it really doesn't matter where you aim it.
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:44.960]   You just hold it and it will take a picture.
[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.440]   >> It's a little while with the recode of remember that.
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:48.000]   But I don't have to point it at something.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.520]   It just all went up.
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:50.520]   >> Exactly.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:55.560]   And so, but the shape of it is so, it's so fun to just, just, just, you depress a button
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:57.640]   and bang, great.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:59.680]   One click and now you've got a 360 degree picture.
[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:02.400]   >> Do I have a galaxy phone to use this?
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:05.760]   >> No, this is one of the improvements over last year's model.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.400]   If you have an iPhone, there's software for the iPhone so that you can remote control
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:10.400]   it.
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:13.640]   You can actually, you can live stream through Facebook and YouTube through it.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:17.800]   If you have an Android phone, you still, for some reason, the app is limited to the Samsung
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:18.800]   Galaxy's.
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:23.560]   Or you just simply put a piece of software on your Mac or on your PC, which will let
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:28.240]   you download and, and transmogrify an even higher resolution version of it.
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:33.240]   For 360 degree photos, it will actually just write a version of that photo to it.
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:36.960]   For videos, you can't do anything with what's on here.
[02:04:36.960 --> 02:04:44.080]   It does have a 256, excuse me, it does have a SD card slot for its own storage, USB-C
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:45.080]   charging.
[02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:48.480]   But it also has, of course, a built-in tripod socket.
[02:04:48.480 --> 02:04:52.840]   So if you're shooting video, you, there is no, you really have to have it.
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:56.120]   Don't be running around with it because that will be super annoying.
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:58.600]   You really do want to have it on a tripod.
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:01.440]   But for $229, it's not a lot of money.
[02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:05.280]   That's what a lot of people are spending for an action cam, which is what they buy to
[02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:08.440]   have in the house for their family videos for fun stuff.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:10.080]   And this is a fun extra camera.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:11.720]   When you're traveling, just hold something up.
[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:15.960]   I shot this video on a tripod in the middle of an oval during one of the brands, Roller
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:19.320]   Derby, which means that it's just shooting 360 degree video.
[02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:23.600]   So of course, this is a game where people are doing laps around this track.
[02:05:23.600 --> 02:05:27.880]   So you can, you can watch, you can watch for people are blocking.
[02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:30.760]   You can watch where the scores, the jammers are going.
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:35.200]   If there's someone, if there's a tussle you missed, you can look back and go see it.
[02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.960]   Imagine just doing that and pretty much anywhere you want to go.
[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:41.040]   Or imagine being in some place that's really, really pretty.
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:46.280]   And in about five seconds, you can just simply take a full 360 degree photo that lets you
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:49.440]   a week later or years later, just look anywhere you want to go.
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:51.840]   And resolution is very, very good.
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:56.520]   And as Alex said, if it's in low light, it is true, you kind of might see the seam between
[02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:58.640]   the front and the back cameras.
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:00.160]   But in bright light, it works great.
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:06.920]   You're not going to see stunning 4K video because remember, you're basically taking two
[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:08.600]   hemispheres of video here.
[02:06:08.600 --> 02:06:13.520]   So the resolution might seem a little less than stellar.
[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:16.160]   But for what it's doing, it's really a lot of fun.
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:23.320]   And once again, it comes in a nice little cloth lens tissue type bag.
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:25.960]   So easy to just, it really is part of my daily carry.
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:26.960]   It's in my laptop bag.
[02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:27.960]   It's inside my backpack.
[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:33.560]   If I'm outside of the house for more than a day, it's definitely in that bag with me.
[02:06:33.560 --> 02:06:35.160]   And I can't say that of other cameras I have.
[02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:39.200]   >> Can you use it with a pixel or does it have to be an iPhone or a Samsung?
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:41.240]   >> No, it has to be either an iPhone or Samsung.
[02:06:41.240 --> 02:06:47.720]   If you want to use live preview and start and stop recording remotely or stream it live
[02:06:47.720 --> 02:06:48.720]   to YouTube or Facebook.
[02:06:48.720 --> 02:06:51.160]   >> But you could record right to the camera.
[02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:52.160]   >> Exactly.
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:57.160]   It has built in storage and SD card so you can have a huge amount of storage.
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:07:04.520]   And then simply when you get home, use an app on your Windows machine or on your Mac
[02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:06.000]   to pull off the video.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.920]   It'll stitch it all together and post it to YouTube or Facebook in a 360 degree version
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:13.720]   that that service is going to understand.
[02:07:13.720 --> 02:07:16.760]   And the cool thing, you don't have to do anything with it.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:24.320]   All I did was I uploaded a video file to YouTube as generated by a phone app in this
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:25.320]   case.
[02:07:25.320 --> 02:07:29.680]   And just YouTube knows, okay, it's been properly tagged and meta, whatever.
[02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:31.400]   So it knows it's 360 degrees.
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:35.160]   And just by virtue of the fact that it's up on YouTube means that you're going to have,
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:36.160]   it's going to be presented in 360 degrees.
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:39.560]   >> This looks a lot better than their 360 from last year.
[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:40.560]   >> This quality of the image.
[02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:42.840]   >> Yeah, I think the quality is a lot better.
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:44.600]   Also, it's a hell of a lot more convenient.
[02:07:44.600 --> 02:07:47.040]   Like I said, I really think that one of the things that they were focusing on with this
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:53.280]   redesign is to make it less of a tool for broadcasters interested in 360 degree coverage
[02:07:53.280 --> 02:07:57.760]   and make it more like here's something that if you want to have fun with video, this will
[02:07:57.760 --> 02:07:58.760]   be a fun thing.
[02:07:58.760 --> 02:07:59.920]   I can't say, look at this.
[02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:01.880]   It's just a fun thing to take pictures with.
[02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:05.240]   >> Yeah, I think the form factor works a lot better than the original one.
[02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:08.920]   The original one still has an advantage that the frame rate at 4K is a little bit higher
[02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:11.240]   than the new one.
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:14.720]   But it's a pain to try to, you couldn't really hold it.
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:16.440]   You really had to have something that it was on.
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:17.440]   And so being able to pull this one out.
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:18.920]   >> So I have the old one.
[02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:21.120]   So I could use the old one.
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:22.480]   >> The old one I don't think will stream.
[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:26.920]   And again, it has an advantage that I think it's 30 frames a second instead of 25 at 3840
[02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:28.320]   by 2060.
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:35.080]   But outside of that, it's a little better on this new one or the old, because I wouldn't
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:36.600]   buy this if I have the old one.
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:41.480]   >> I think that the old one still has higher resolution still, but I'm not 100% sure.
[02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:47.320]   I couldn't find the exact spec, but I believe that they basically to get that form, the
[02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:50.680]   smaller, the more convenient form factor, I think we gave up a little bit of resolution.
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:52.800]   I think they found that those were out there.
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:56.640]   So the original one is not necessarily a, not something you'd want if you really want
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:09:00.440]   to get every ounce of out of it.
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.840]   But it is so much more convenient.
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:04.360]   I have both of them and it's so much more convenient to use the little one.
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:09.240]   >> Yeah, this one, this one, the lens part of it is about the size of a ping pong ball.
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:12.200]   The version one last year, it's almost the size of a cue ball.
[02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:13.200]   It's so big.
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:17.800]   Which is still pocketable, but it's the sort of size where I would give it some thought
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.120]   before deciding to bring it with me if I were leaving the house.
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:24.240]   Whereas, I mean, I'm going to be in New York for a day and a half and there's no way I'm
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:25.480]   not taking this with me.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:29.820]   Not because I have any plans to shoot photos or video with it, but why not?
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:34.040]   And if I find myself in, if I'm hoping to see the rose reading room at the New Republic
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:38.000]   Library was closed for a year and a half, two years after it looked as though some of
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.760]   the decorative things on that high ceiling were coming down and about to kill people.
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:45.920]   So they closed it for a year and a half to make it less kill less like a kill floor for
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:46.920]   nerds.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:49.320]   >> So should I bring this to the Galapagos?
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:50.320]   >> Oh, yeah.
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:51.600]   I'd bring the hell out of it.
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:52.600]   >> And Macha Picchu.
[02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:53.600]   >> Oh, I'd bring the hell out of it.
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:57.400]   >> I think Macha Picchu be cool to have a 360 image to see.
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:09:58.400]   All right.
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:09:59.320]   >> Do it.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:01.960]   >> It doesn't look very heavy.
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:04.320]   >> I'm really up against the weight barrier.
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.320]   >> Exactly.
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:07.240]   >> That's like your Batman utility belt, Leo.
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:08.760]   Just drop it in so the grappling hook.
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:09.760]   >> Yeah.
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:12.920]   They say I can only bring eight kilograms of luggage to Macha Picchu.
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:15.000]   So I have to, every ounce counts.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000]   >> You can think about it.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000]   >> I can put it in the slot.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000]   >> I just put it in the slot.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000]   >> Put it in the hat.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000]   >> Can we have a hide in the hat?
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.560]   >> No, this is my emotional support camera.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.840]   I have to keep the call on my, I have a note for my doctor that says that I have to be
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:28.440]   able to keep this with me all the time.
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.440]   >> But yeah, I just thought now.
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:34.720]   I bought tickets to visit the crown of the Statue of Liberty and they sell, you have
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:37.680]   to buy them like eight months in advance or whatever.
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:41.480]   And they only allow you one camera into the crown because you have to check everything
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:43.080]   because you feel too much bulk.
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:45.840]   So yeah, everything else you carrying goes into a locker at the base if you're going
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:47.520]   to make all that all that climb.
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:51.800]   It's going to be a hard decision to make if I'm going to take a quote real camera or not
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:56.960]   or something that will let me just have fun looking around months later.
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:01.920]   >> Well, if you're into VR, Renee Richie's pick is going to get you pretty darn excited,
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:02.920]   Renee.
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:06.720]   >> Yes, we spoke about this briefly earlier, but Ubisoft has just launched the Star Trek
[02:11:06.720 --> 02:11:07.720]   Bridge game.
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:09.160]   It's available, what's really cool about it.
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:10.160]   It's available for the Oculus.
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:11.600]   If you have an Oculus, you can play.
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:12.600]   It's available for the Vive.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:15.800]   So if you have the Vive, you can play and it's even available for the PlayStation VR.
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:20.320]   So if you have a PlayStation VR and a PS4, PS4 Pro, you can play and if you have a Ubisoft
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.400]   account or you create a Ubisoft account, you can multi-play, which is a real interesting
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:25.400]   thing.
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:26.400]   >> I've got a chance to play it yet.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:29.800]   It's just coming out today, but Russell Holly from VR Heads has been totally immersed in
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:31.200]   it for the last three or four days.
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:33.600]   I think he's blocked more hours than the original Enterprise mentioned.
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:35.360]   >> Oh, it's not just looking around the bridge.
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:37.160]   You actually, it's a game.
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:38.160]   >> You're playing.
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:41.040]   You are up to four of the bridge crew at the same time controlling it.
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:45.160]   You start off with the USS Aegis and it takes place in the Kelvin universe, which is a JJ
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:47.320]   Abrams version of the Star Trek universe.
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:50.920]   And it starts off with the Aegis because it's sort of that ship is built to use VR
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:54.560]   controls, but you can play the Enterprise later and they've recreated the Enterprise
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:56.960]   controls, which are apparently much, much harder.
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:58.880]   So it's recommended that you start with the Aegis.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:11:59.880]   >> Wow.
[02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:02.520]   >> And you can play by yourself, but that's also really hard, but you can get up to four
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:06.480]   of your friends and you each take and you keep a bridge position and you play as if
[02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:10.880]   you are really the people running the starship and you can do Kobayashi Maru, which is a
[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:15.840]   famous mission from Star Trek II where Kirk cheated his way to saving all the survivors
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:17.000]   from the Klingons.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.040]   You can play some other missions and it sounds really amazing.
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:21.720]   I'd not be able to drag Russell out of it.
[02:12:21.720 --> 02:12:25.280]   George I insta bought it this morning and she says we're playing it all night and into
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:27.400]   tomorrow and I'm really looking forward to it.
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:32.520]   But this to me is like the promise of VR being sort of like a holodeck and yeah, AR is definitely
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:36.760]   the future, but there are places, especially entertainment, where VR, the ability to be
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:40.560]   totally immersed in an environment with some of your friends and doing something that you
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:44.600]   only imagine doing like every Star Trek episode when you were a kid, you wanted to be there
[02:12:44.600 --> 02:12:49.280]   at the Science Station or the helm or one of the stations and this actually puts you there.
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:50.280]   And this is just the beginning.
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:55.320]   Like soon Andy will have his dream and he'll be the one firing the Death Star and Alex will
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:13:01.080]   be fighting the jet that he designed for Queen Amidala.
[02:13:01.080 --> 02:13:03.240]   And I'm so excited about all this.
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:06.840]   Again, you can't play any of this on a Mac yet, which is sort of sad.
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:08.160]   Hopefully we'll get to do that one day.
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:11.200]   But if you have a PlayStation or you have a gaming PC and you have one of these headsets,
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:14.600]   it just it looks like it's one of the first big games I've really been excited about.
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:17.640]   I think it's interesting you do multiplayer too.
[02:13:17.640 --> 02:13:18.640]   Wow.
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:24.080]   He Russell says the Vive is the best way to play this, but it is available for the Vive,
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:27.280]   the Rift and the PlayStation VR.
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:28.520]   PlayStation is in-room experience.
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:30.080]   I don't think it's up to par with the Vive.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:33.280]   Yeah, I think Oculus is getting closer with their room experience, but I think Vive really
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:34.280]   nailed that early on.
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:38.280]   Oh man, I might have to buy this.
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.600]   You and Lisa, Michael and everybody, Leo just commanding us.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:41.840]   We could all play it together.
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:42.840]   Yeah.
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:43.840]   Wow.
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:46.800]   Now you'd have to have individual PCs and Vives for each player.
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:47.800]   Yes.
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:51.440]   We'll be yaring fire, everything fire, everything fire, everything and expecting you to do it
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:53.360]   other than that.
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:55.760]   So I want her to be a hooroo.
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:57.960]   She's taking the captain's chair.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:02.440]   I should be in the captain's chair.
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:04.880]   I'll be in the way.
[02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:06.880]   Captain, Captain, Captain.
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:07.880]   I can't get in.
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:08.880]   I can't take one of this.
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:09.880]   And apparently they've patched the cheat.
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:12.320]   You can't do the Kirk cheat in this version.
[02:14:12.320 --> 02:14:14.000]   This is post-spok fixing the Kirk cheat.
[02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.440]   I'm told we'll be showing this on the new screensavers this weekend.
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:19.440]   Awesome.
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:21.640]   So there you go.
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:23.840]   If you want to see more Saturday afternoon.
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.880]   And I think they're real-
[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:26.880]   We're going to play with four people.
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:28.720]   We've got four PS4s.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:29.720]   Wow.
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:30.720]   Wow.
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:31.720]   We spared no expense on this one.
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:33.720]   Somebody's taking home one of those PS4s.
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:37.680]   It's going to be so good you'll keep playing until the next screensavers.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.680]   Yeah, no.
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:39.680]   It'll be soft.
[02:14:39.680 --> 02:14:40.680]   I won't be going on vacation.
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:41.680]   I'll be staying home.
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:42.680]   Yep.
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:47.680]   Really, really never seen just the beginnings of VR really becoming interesting.
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:52.200]   Yeah, this is the first game where I've been thinking, oh, wow, I might really want to
[02:14:52.200 --> 02:14:53.200]   play this one.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:54.200]   Have you played Robo Recall?
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:56.200]   No, everybody loves that.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:59.040]   I got to be careful because I feel like I could get sick.
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:02.840]   And Rec Room is ridiculously fun.
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:05.560]   I have to limit how much my son's allowed to play.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:07.560]   I don't want him to spend too much time with this.
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:11.280]   You can play Alex because it's high.
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:12.280]   It's like the perfect.
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:13.280]   I just do that.
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:17.000]   I don't actually, I go through the whole levels sometimes without using the guns and I just
[02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.000]   rip everybody's head off.
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:20.560]   It's my best exercise.
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:23.520]   You just teleport, grab them, rip the head off, teleport, grab them.
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:25.080]   And it's much better exercise.
[02:15:25.080 --> 02:15:27.080]   You can go faster with the guns.
[02:15:27.080 --> 02:15:28.280]   No, no, I'm not a player.
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:30.440]   It's not official, but like there's a lightsaber simulator.
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:33.440]   It's amazing exercise and you can actually battle now and you're just fighting those
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:36.600]   drones and it feels like you've been through an intense work at the end.
[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:37.600]   Wow.
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:38.600]   Yeah.
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:39.600]   All right, kids.
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:42.520]   Steve Gibson's getting all excited here.
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:44.200]   Thank you so much for being here, Alex.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:48.640]   Lindsey, I've had a fantasy that you might come back and you did.
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:49.640]   Alex is at the Pixel Core.
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:51.640]   You could follow him on the Twitter @AlexLindsay.
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:55.360]   In fact, if you do that, you'll probably be best able to keep up with all the things
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:02.800]   he does, including his workshops, his final cut workshops and more at Alex L-I-N-D-S-A-Y.
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.200]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:04.200 --> 02:16:05.200]   Thank you.
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:06.200]   Great to see you.
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:08.400]   Andy Inako, Chicago Sun Times.
[02:16:08.400 --> 02:16:13.400]   It's his home, but you can also find him on cwob.com and he makes a regular appearance
[02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:14.400]   here.
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:16.400]   And tell me this shows.
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:18.840]   You're not Cosomena X still doing that?
[02:16:18.840 --> 02:16:24.520]   I had to go ahead and take it on hiatus because they debuted on election night and I was way
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:26.200]   too depressed to work on show two.
[02:16:26.200 --> 02:16:31.620]   But I've got three more shows that are done as soon as I have four or five so that there
[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:35.040]   will be no more interruption of services redoing.
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:39.840]   If you're in the Boston area, I'm going to be back on Boston NPR tomorrow talking about
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:44.400]   all kinds of tech policy stuff and whatever they want to talk about.
[02:16:44.400 --> 02:16:49.280]   I'm actually finishing up the briefing doc the next hour or so.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:54.720]   You'll find Almanac and well, there was one Almanac and you'll find material with hedge,
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:57.480]   which has 101 episodes at relay.fm.
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:00.200]   You know who does a lot of...
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:01.200]   Sorry?
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.200]   Go ahead.
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:21.620]   If you go to imore.com, that's where Mr. Renee Richie hangs his hat, including some fabulous
[02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:24.920]   podcasts as well.
[02:17:24.920 --> 02:17:25.920]   Is this the redesign now?
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:26.920]   This is nice.
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:27.920]   I like it.
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:28.920]   No, this is...
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:29.920]   We're still working on the UHU.
[02:17:29.920 --> 02:17:30.920]   I'll send you the link.
[02:17:30.920 --> 02:17:32.520]   But this is part of the redesign.
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:34.960]   But we have a fancy new home page coming your way.
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:35.960]   Nice.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:36.960]   Yep.
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:40.080]   And you can find out apparently more about Carpool Karaoke, which we did not mention
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:42.240]   is coming to Amazon Music on the stage.
[02:17:42.240 --> 02:17:43.240]   Yeah, nice.
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:45.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[02:17:45.840 --> 02:17:50.760]   We do Mac Break Weekly on Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern Time, 1800 UTC.
[02:17:50.760 --> 02:17:51.880]   I will not be here next week.
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:53.920]   Who's hosting next week?
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:55.120]   I am hosting next week.
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:57.080]   Andy Inaco's hosting next week.
[02:17:57.080 --> 02:18:02.360]   With three empty chairs, which I'm filling as we speak with really interesting people.
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:05.440]   Yeah, that's one of the things we do, which makes it really fun.
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:09.280]   We have people filling in for me as they get to play on the show and make it their own.
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:11.800]   So I look forward to listening after I get back.
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:14.680]   I am not a pappet, Renee.
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:16.640]   I reject this kind of corocally.
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:18.640]   That's Canadian stereotype, sir.
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:19.640]   I'm a groundhog.
[02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:20.640]   Canadian stereotype.
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:21.640]   This is Beaver Puppet.
[02:18:21.640 --> 02:18:22.640]   Do not all of that work.
[02:18:22.640 --> 02:18:24.440]   I'm a groundhog, sir.
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:25.440]   I'm not a blaver.
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:26.440]   Look at my bat.
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:28.040]   Do not have a bee for bat.
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:29.520]   It's a groundhog bat.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:30.680]   Sorry, groundhog.
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:32.400]   It's the teeth for me.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:36.080]   Things like this is what the reason why we're replacing you next week.
[02:18:36.080 --> 02:18:40.520]   Next week is a job for you to come back.
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:41.840]   Thank you for being here.
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:43.840]   We will be back next week.
[02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:47.320]   And then the week after, who's going to host next week after, we'll find out.
[02:18:47.320 --> 02:18:49.640]   And I'll be back the week after that.
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:52.080]   Two weeks from today, three weeks from today.
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:54.040]   I don't know how it works.
[02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:55.040]   Have a good time.
[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:56.040]   We don't know how it all works.
[02:18:56.040 --> 02:18:57.040]   It's June 20th.
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:58.040]   Thank you guys.
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:18:59.120]   We'll see you next time.
[02:18:59.120 --> 02:19:01.880]   But now you have to go back to work because guess what?
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:03.520]   Big time is over.
[02:19:03.520 --> 02:19:03.840]   Bye-bye.
[02:19:03.840 --> 02:19:13.840]   [MUSIC]
