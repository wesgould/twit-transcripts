[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.000]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the weekly confab of Mac minds
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.680]   discussing the latest Apple news.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.920]   And around the board we have a fabulous team of Mac experts
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.680]   ready to pontificate.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.520]   Mr. McElope is here via telephone.
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.160]   >> Hello.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.520]   >> McElope in his special layer is not allowed to use electronics.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.840]   >> No.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.120]   >> So he has to use an old Western electric phone.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.400]   >> It's a rotary dial.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.520]   >> Yeah, it works.
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.200]   >> It's a shiny and black and I like it.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080]   >> How are things going at CNET?
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.080]   >> Great.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.080]   >> You like it there?
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.080]   They send the checks.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.080]   >> That's good.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.080]   Money's good.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.080]   >> Exactly.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.080]   >> Everybody loves money.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.080]   >> What's happening?
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.080]   >> What's happening?
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.080]   >> What's happening?
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.080]   >> What's happening?
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.080]   Macalope.com.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.080]   >> Zip.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080]   >> Okay.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.080]   >> Although I did take your advice and I posted an update to let people
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080]   know.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.080]   >> At least you're not home anymore.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.080]   >> I think that's where you can find me.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.080]   >> And you gave me credit.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080]   >> Yes.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080]   >> Thank you.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.760]   Also, ladies and gentlemen, from Los Angeles, we won't say, well, let's say
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.760]   it.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   >> I think it's a, it's really a kind of a revolution that you're using the
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.760]   ACES EPC.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760]   >> I am.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.760]   See what happens when you do a pick of the week?
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.760]   >> I buy it.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   >> And, well, you know what?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.760]   That's funny because I bought the audio engine speakers.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.760]   So it goes both ways.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760]   I love those speakers, by the way.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   They're really great.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   So, and you're using a headset with it, a USB headset?
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.760]   >> I'm using the very headset that you often recommend, the
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   Plantronics.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.760]   >> And it works out of the box.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.760]   >> Works, I plugged it in.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   All we had to do is set the preferences to recognize the
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.760]   Plantronics and this little $399 computer becomes a portable
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   studio for podcasters.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.760]   >> Isn't that amazing?
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   I can't, now, are you using something to record with it too?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.760]   Like, can you record audio?
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.760]   Because I would be, that would be amazing.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   >> Well, that's what we're going to work on next.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   We're going to, we're going to start doing some research on that.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   But, you know, $399 plus, I think it was $30 for the Plantronics
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.760]   headset.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.760]   And I'm in a hotel and they'll, let's see, where am I?
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   >> Marina Del Rey.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.760]   >> And, and I, I'm like, I can't believe I'm on a podcast.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.760]   >> Isn't that amazing?
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   It's fantastic.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   You can update the Skype, by the way.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   The Arge Technica has a really good article on hacking the
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   EPC.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   And one of the things that you can do, and I did right away, is
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.760]   upgrade to Linux Skype 2 beta, which allows you to do video.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   Because it's got a built-in camera too.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   This thing.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.760]   >> It's amazing.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.760]   >> We played with the camera using the proprietary software.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   >> Right.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.760]   Right.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   I'm ordering, I just ordered the OLPC.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.760]   So I'm going to do a head-to-head between that and the OLPC,
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.760]   which would be the one laptop per child PC.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.760]   >> Should be an interesting combination.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760]   >> I didn't know you could order those.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   >> You can order them?
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.760]   >> Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Lindsey from the Lindsey Labs has
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   Malachi.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   Am I saying it right when I say Malachi?
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   >> It's Malachi.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.760]   >> Malachi.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.760]   It's Malachi.
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   >> Now that's clever because it's an Irish name and I betcha.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.760]   >> It's actually an African spelling of a biblical name.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.760]   >> Right.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.760]   So is there an African name Malachi?
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.760]   >> Well, there's just Malachi, which is a biblical name.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   It's the last chapter in the Old Testament, and it's mostly a
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.760]   whole lot of you're in trouble.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   [laughter]
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.760]   >> You named the kid you're in trouble.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   >> No, no, no.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   He was a good guy.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.760]   Malachi was a good guy, but God was pissed.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   >> So God's pissed a lot of the Old Testament.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   That's good.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   >> It was one of those things that I kind of blurted out during the,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   you know, they asked what his name was going to be, and we hadn't
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   talked about it at all, and I just popped out of my head and my wife
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.760]   liked it, and then everyone else liked it, and then stuck.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   >> Did you do the Kuntakinte thing?
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.760]   I'll hold them up to the sky and say, "I dubbed the Malachi."
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   [laughter]
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   >> I crossed my mind.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.760]   No, I actually just took lots and lots and lots of photos.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.760]   So the nurse made a lot of fun of me, you know, sitting there with
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.760]   my little SLR, and within like the first hour, I had shot like 150
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.760]   photos of him, and he was very photogenic.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   >> Are you putting those in Flickr?
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   Anywhere we can see those?
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.760]   >> Yes, actually, if you go to web.mac.com/AlexLenty, all one word,
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   and that should be enough.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.760]   It should just take you right to that site.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.760]   >> Oh, look at him.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   He's beautiful.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   >> Yeah, he's a cubie.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   >> Oh, what a sweet little baby.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.760]   >> You know how everybody says it's the baby.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.760]   It's cute, and lots of times I think to myself, not so much, but in
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.760]   this case, that it should be really his cute.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   >> He's frighteningly cute.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   I mean, all the nurses kept on coming in and looking at him.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.760]   You know, you know, like, they just come in and say hi to him,
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   and he's really, really laid back.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   And you know, one of the things that's really interesting is this
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.760]   is the first experience that I had of using the iApps as an iApp.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.760]   You know, because you know, we do a lot of work in the ProApps,
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.760]   and this was a perfect example of something that, you know,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   I'm not going to build a big website.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:56.760]   I'm not building something out.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   I'm not doing whatever I need to do.
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   I'm actually just, I just want to throw up a web page, you know,
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.760]   and I want it to look pretty, but I don't want to spend any time
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.760]   on it whatsoever.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.760]   I mean, the big pressure was, of course, is that everyone,
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.760]   all the family and friends wanted to see it immediately.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.760]   And so, you know, he was born on Saturday morning,
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   and on Saturday night, I had that web page.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.760]   Wow.
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.760]   You know, and it looks great.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.760]   People were like, oh, that's really, really great.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.760]   And you can do a slideshow, and I mean, it's really great.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.760]   Yeah, and it was just put together, you know, that's just all iWeb
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.760]   and iPhoto and, you know, all those pieces,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.760]   and it just worked really, really well.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.760]   You know, I was, because I've been, I kind of poo the iApps a lot,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   and I was really surprised at how easy, you know, all of it was
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   to put it together.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   So it was from a Mac point of view.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.760]   That was a good time.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.760]   I can't believe she had a less than three hour labor.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.760]   You know, the well-of-the-know-thing is we had a 58 hour labor.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.760]   Yeah, I know.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   It was a little scary because we got in there,
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   and, you know, we were only in the delivery room for a long time.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   Hold on a second.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.760]   Hold on.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   I just don't hold that thought.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.760]   I mean, let me get Will in the conference.
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   There you go.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   You were in the living room.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   I interrupted because Will Harris just called it.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.760]   Oh, I'm just saying we were only in the delivery room for like a half an hour.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   It's like boom.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.760]   And this is your first, first usually.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.760]   This is your first.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.760]   This is your first.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.760]   Well, they said they told her, they told her, just so you know, if you,
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.760]   the next time, as soon as you feel any, any contractions, you need to come to the hospital now.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   Because she doesn't take long.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.760]   Yeah, they said the next one will take like an hour and a half, you know, and so,
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.760]   and so it's.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760]   So you're right to anyway.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.760]   The next one, huh?
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   What, I'm not saying we're planning the next one.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   I'm just saying that they said, if there's the next one, there would be that.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   That's what you'd want to, you want to make sure that you keep track of that.
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   And so anyway, but mom and baby are doing exceptionally well.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   Fortunately, he, he's super laid back.
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.760]   So, you know, he, he cries for maybe a minute here and there and the most part just, just hangs out.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.760]   So congratulations.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   It's great.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.760]   Matt Lechke, what a great name and a beautiful baby.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.760]   Will Harris has joined us from Oxford, England.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   Hello, Will.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.760]   Hello, how you doing?
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.760]   Finally getting you in the daytime.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   Well, not quite daytime, but.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.760]   Well, it's more daytime than usual.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.760]   That's quite fun.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   Not quite the middle of the night anyway.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.760]   Exactly.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.760]   So we have a lot to talk about.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   mbw ideas.com is the place to go.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.760]   And I will put a link if you don't mind Alex to your baby pictures in the.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   I think Shash is listening and we'll pick that up.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   Let's get to the store.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.760]   Let's get to the stories.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.360]   I posted so many, I have to say, it was really funny.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   I was actually trying to get ready for the show and I couldn't help it.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.360]   And I came in and like the minute before there was like, oh, these, you know, where did these
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   come from?
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   More pictures.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.360]   Isn't that fun?
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   Oh man.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.240]   You know, between you and Merlin's done a lot of pictures too on Flickr and it's really
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.440]   interesting because the cameras are so good and you guys are such good photographers.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.280]   These pictures are just mind blowing.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.600]   It's, you know, it, it, there are not snapshots.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.440]   And all it is is it's a, it's a, that's a, just an SLR with a, with a 50 millimeter
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   fast.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.520]   So Merlin's doing the same thing.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.200]   I think we have the same lens and the same camera.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.720]   It's like a 20 D with a 50 millimeter 1.8 lens and it's just that that's short depth.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.360]   The field makes everything in the artistic.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.360]   It does.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.320]   Well, it puts the baby in focus and everything else is soft focus and it really, it's fantastic.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.720]   I just really enjoy it.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.880]   I take about, you know, 20 photos a day.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.120]   So it's, it's slowly building up.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.960]   Should we start with the rumors?
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:41.120]   Rumors, rumors, rumor number one, Apple orders 13.3 inch LED backlit screens.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.840]   According to the Apple insider or is this a Mac rumors?
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.840]   I guess it's Mac rumors.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.480]   They say that Apple, digit times says that Apple place an order with Kenmos technology
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:58.560]   and Taiwan nano electro optical for these screens.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.120]   Apple orders.
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.920]   The sources disclose that nano ops LED notebook BLU.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.320]   Those are the backlit units shipments in November, only 10,000 unit.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.520]   Apple orders expected to drive shipments to over 90,000 units in December.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:21.400]   Kenmos said to be shipping LED notebook blue BLU to Apple for high end models as well.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   New sub notebook.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   I hope so.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.200]   Well, well, it could be, but it could just be better MacBook displays.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.080]   Couldn't I mean the 13 is the Mac.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.280]   MacBook is an MacBook pro has an LED backlight.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.760]   So it could just be there rolling that out across the standard map book as well.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.440]   Not to rain on anyone's parade.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.480]   Dell is ordering 12 inches.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   Dells are smaller.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.480]   Mackle up.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.000]   What do you think you follow the rumor mill?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.040]   Yeah, I mean, it could be, you know, you never know, but I mean, it could be the convergence
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.480]   of two separate rumors that, you know, just updated, updated Mac books and then, you know,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.160]   people have been talking about later.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   Slim.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.160]   We all want that.
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.080]   It's a gravel sized Mac book.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.080]   We all want that.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.960]   And the thing we've been talking about for the last few episodes is what the hell Steve
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   Jobs going to have to say it is keynote.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.160]   By the way, it's official.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.440]   He will be keynoting Apple a Mac world expo.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.640]   I was so hoping that the AT&T guy was going to take it.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.600]   He's not there anymore.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.400]   No, you got to be quit.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.280]   He was poor performance last year.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.480]   What could, yeah, isn't that sad?
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   He'll be remembered as the, as the, uh, the note card.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.480]   No card.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.840]   What could, what, I mean, really seriously, Steve's got or maybe doesn't have to, but,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.520]   but it is kind of traditional.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.520]   iPhone two, yeah.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.520]   No.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.520]   iPhone two will be what?
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   That'll be announced.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.520]   It won't be available.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.520]   Same issue.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.320]   Yeah, they'll announce it for June release because they have to get the FCC approval.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:57.560]   But Mr. Apple phone show guy, what would, what would a new iPhone mean?
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.360]   Bigger memory, but what else?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.040]   16 gigs of RAM, 3G, 3G and, and SDK.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   Tmo, or AT&T has been saying they're going to be rolling out more HSDPA.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.800]   Scott, do you think they'll be a GPS in there?
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.760]   I sure hope not, but probably.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   They kill batteries fast.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.840]   I, I, you know, I think, I think GPS is unnecessary in the phone.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.280]   You know, you got Google Maps, can you look up and see the street address that you're
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.120]   standing at and type that in and then go from there?
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.000]   But it kills the battery to the point.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.920]   And plus, I, once again, I repeat, I've just never seen a phone GPS that takes less than
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.760]   five minutes to acquire all the satellites.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.760]   That's true.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.760]   I don't want to wait five minutes.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.200]   And you, you know, if you put that in Bluetooth, the Google Maps will pick up a Bluetooth external
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   dongle.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.280]   That's why I use them in my blackberry.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.280]   That would be an easy update to the iPhone without killing battery life.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.520]   Yeah, because I have to say that I use them, I have the only reason I bought a trio long
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.440]   ago before I had my iPhone was specifically so I could hook it to a Tom Tom.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:59.240]   And it got to a point where I felt like I was, you know, if I was in LA, especially
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:04.800]   if I was driving around, you know, I really felt naked if I didn't have that, that GPS
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   there because I could very quickly route around, you know, all kinds of stuff.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.640]   But right now the iPhone won't see an external Bluetooth, right?
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.640]   Right.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.360]   But I think that also comes down to SDK, you know, being released.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.000]   So if they do do an SDK and the Bluetooth can see all that, that's fine.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.320]   I think it's a simple thing for Apple.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:25.480]   It's just, it's putting that definition into the Bluetooth spec because Google Maps does
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.240]   it automatically already on my blackberry.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.320]   I mean, it's, it's part of the Google, it's a feature of Google Maps.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   Right.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.560]   Speaking of Google Map features, there is a feature that is in Google Maps on other phones,
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.200]   not in the iPhone, the ability to triangulate your location using cell phone towers.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.160]   I can do, I will be able to do that now in the blackberry and other phones, but it is
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.680]   not on the iPhone.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.760]   Now, didn't Navicon or whatever have that working for a little while?
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.720]   Didn't they hack that into the iPhone for a while?
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.080]   That's how they, I guess they were working.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.080]   Yeah, that was a great thing.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.560]   They worked in it and they got killed.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.560]   It worked.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.560]   I used it.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.560]   It didn't, it works in metro areas.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.480]   So it didn't work where I am because you, you have to have people entering in the, this
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.640]   is where, I don't know if it was using triangulation.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:10.640]   You know what?
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.640]   I don't think it was.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.920]   Here's the nearest cell site and others have told us that cell site is in this area.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.000]   I don't think it was, was it using triangulation?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.960]   Triangulation would give you more accurate results.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.920]   Yeah, I'm not, I'm not sure.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.920]   I'm not sure how that comes.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.200]   I think the phone has to support that.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.160]   It has to be able to say, you know, what are some other cells in this area?
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.200]   In any event, it sounds like it's not going to be part of the iPhone.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.880]   While we're talking about the iPhone, Leo just want to provide you with some information,
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:43.040]   may not be readily available to you because it's not on the wires.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.400]   I don't think yet.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:50.040]   We have a correspondent in Germany telling us that the T-Mobile decision was overturned.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.640]   So the, the requirement that Germany sell the unlock phone is now no longer a requirement.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.640]   Interesting.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.200]   So they're going to pull back on that, you think?
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.680]   We don't know what their reaction to the court decision is going to be.
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.280]   My guess is they're going to pull back, but they, they don't have to do it anymore.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.280]   Like they did the decision was overturned.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.520]   They still have to do it in France, don't they?
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.520]   Yeah, that's the funny thing.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.520]   They do it in France.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.520]   They do it in France.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.720]   It's not a thousand euros in France either.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:20.560]   Well, and you have to wait six months though.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.200]   So what will really be interesting is for all the people that plunk down the unlock
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.520]   money during these two weeks, what's going to happen to them?
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.960]   Anyway, this is breaking news.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   I didn't know.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   Thank you.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.960]   No, I didn't have it.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   Thank you.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:40.160]   But AT&T's revelation that they're going to do, that they're going to do a 3G phone,
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.640]   it was a way of putting the screws to Apple.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:52.440]   Cringley says it was a billion dollar message to Apple saying, you better get the phone
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.520]   to support 3G.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.920]   He said, now Cringley is not notorious for being right about anything, but I mean, I
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.840]   like him and he's, and he's got some great ideas, but he doesn't seem to have particularly
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.160]   good sources.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.560]   And so I think this is more speculation on Cringley's part, but he says he speculates
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.400]   AT&T might be upset with Apple.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:25.200]   And so announcing this 3G phone or 3G iPhone might be a way of, I don't know what it's
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   an apple.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.400]   He's cutting off their nose despite their face though.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   Yeah, totally.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.000]   You know, people don't go out and buy iPhones right now.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.560]   That's money out of AT&T's podcast.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.560]   And it's right.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.640]   It's during Christmas season.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.360]   I mean, it was, it seems, it seems a little insane.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.560]   That's why it calls it a billion dollar message.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.480]   Sure you want to fill out the billion dollars of AT&T's money.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.480]   Right, exactly.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.480]   It's a huge cost.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:48.480]   Not Apple's money.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.400]   He says AT&T's absolutely went with Apple because Apple might be joining Google in the
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.560]   bid for the 700 meg, this is a very convoluted theory.
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.560]   The 700 meg of Hertz.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   Well, it's convoluted or not.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.920]   I mean, if you, if you want, if you really wanted to get Steve to start grinding an axe,
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.520]   this was a great way to do it.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.520]   It's on Steve.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.320]   Good smart business move.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   It makes Steve...
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.320]   You know, mad.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:17.800]   If he didn't know about it, I'm sure that there was an exciting meeting at Apple's.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.280]   It's exciting.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.400]   This is why they like to control the PR so tightly because, you know, nobody at Apple
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.640]   would ever say what's coming in the way of 3G, the way that the AT&T guy did.
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:33.800]   I mean, I guess Steve hinted at it before, but not quite this openly and dramatically.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   I don't know.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.280]   I think there's like about a thousand conspiracy theories over what happened.
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:44.240]   I wouldn't be surprised if it was all calculated for some reason, but I don't quite understand
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.000]   everyone's while Apple makes a mistake.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.320]   This might have been a make a mistake because we're getting lots of emails to show people
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.240]   saying, "Well, should I wait for the 3G phone?"
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.520]   And I'm like, "Well, yeah, you can wait."
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.040]   But I mean, we're not talking a few weeks.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   We're talking quarters.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.960]   What did AT&T say?
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.440]   They said, "Yes, there will be a 3G phone."
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.560]   There will be a phone in 2008.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.800]   There will be a 3G phone.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.560]   That could be December 2008.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.240]   They didn't say when in 2008.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   Exactly.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.240]   Exactly.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.240]   But you know how people are.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.840]   They're like, "Well, I'm going to wait."
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.520]   Is it that big a deal?
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:22.040]   Would it make a big difference in your mind decision if you had a choice between an HSDPA
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.240]   capable phone and the iPhone?
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   I don't think so.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.760]   Well, it's only in 220 markets right now, which sounds like a lot, but that leaves a
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.040]   lot of places that are uncovered.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.840]   And as Andy pointed out, the very first time we talked about this on Apple Phone Show,
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.400]   he lives in a place where there's 3G right now and he has a 3G capable phone that can
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.400]   rarely get online.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.400]   Right.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.400]   I mean, there...
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.400]   You got Wi-Fi.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.800]   In most cases, that's going to be fine, right?
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.200]   Yeah, it's not the panacea.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.640]   Everybody thinks it is.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.440]   And once they ship it, trust me.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.160]   They're going to see all the haters come out with.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.240]   Well, it's no good because it doesn't have 4G.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.640]   Well, yeah, well, yeah, I suppose.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.640]   I mean, I think that I'd love to see if I had a choice between 2 and a half G and 3G
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.640]   now.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.000]   I mean, I would definitely want a 3G phone, but the...
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   And I don't really care.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   I mean, I can keep it plugged in.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.040]   If it takes up more battery power, it doesn't really matter to me.
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:25.240]   Because as you guys know, I don't talk on the phone very much.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.320]   The thing is, is that I'm not going to wait for 6 months or 9 months or whatever for this
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   phone to come out.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.480]   And I don't think it's enough of an improvement that will hold people off.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.200]   If somebody wants an iPhone, they're going to get an iPhone this Christmas.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.640]   But do you think, Scott, that a January announcement of a much improved iPhone is imminent or is
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.600]   it just an evolutionary iPhone?
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:45.840]   Well, I guess I think it's going to be double the storage.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.240]   That would be good.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:52.440]   And 3G and the SDK announcement, and they'll do a couple of little doodads and they'll
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.480]   do it all at the same price of the original one, which is typical of how they do it, looking
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.800]   at the iPod history.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.600]   But it won't be available till June.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.200]   It won't be available till June.
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:07.040]   And that same kind of announcement at last year's Mac world was enough to foreshadow everything
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.840]   that was talked about at CES.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   Right.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.880]   Yeah, but that was the first announcement of the iPhone.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.920]   So he's probably got to think that that's still a pretty big card to play.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.120]   He may not have very few Apple announcements in history.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.880]   We're going to see that kind of impact.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:26.280]   And on a regular impact base, it's like, that's a pretty good bet.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.480]   Unless he's going to announce, like I say, the new sub notebook that is not much else
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480]   he could say.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.640]   They've revved the notebooks.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.520]   They've revved the iPods.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:37.240]   He doesn't do pro apps or pro hardware usually at Mac world expo.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.480]   I don't know what else he's going to see.
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   We're not going to see a new iLife Suite.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.240]   It took him till just a month ago to get that.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:48.080]   So maybe it's just, you know, I could easily see Steve giving his traditional state of the
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.840]   union speech and like, oh, we're selling a lot of iPods or selling a lot of iPhones.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   Everything's great.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   Congratulations.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.840]   Apple's number one.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.880]   I just don't think Steve would show up if that's all it was.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.240]   He's got to have more, you think.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.720]   I still think that I think the most probable thing is some kind of sub notebook.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.800]   And I think that the sub notebook may have a touchscreen, you know, because they've been
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:13.320]   working on all this technology around the iPhone that, you know, that they've really
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.560]   figured out a lot of stuff that you'd think they'd want to take advantage of elsewhere.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.800]   And while it hasn't worked for the PC side, I don't think I've done it.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.400]   I think that we're in a much more mature market now too.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   Right.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.400]   Right.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.400]   All right.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.360]   Well, I guess it's going to be, you know, we're going to, I should say at this juncture
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:36.400]   that we're going to be at Mac world expo covering it in great depth, including the traditional
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.560]   post keynote wrap up at Mac break weekly.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.360]   We'll do a special episode that comes out right after the net on the floor on the show
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.480]   floor in the West Hall and the West Hall.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.920]   So it should be a should be very should be a lot of fun.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.360]   People should get over there as fast as they can too, because there's only, I think three
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.160]   or 400 seats and there's a lot more people there at the keynote and everything else.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.520]   And then all week long we'll be doing shows there.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.760]   Twitt's going to be there on Friday.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.200]   We're going to do a floss weekly.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.680]   We're going to do a jumping monkeys.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.120]   Megan said she can make it.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.960]   So we'll do a lot of the podcast there.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.800]   And then Scott, you have in the conference track, you've got a podcast track.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:17.720]   Yeah, on Thursday, you'll be speaking there, of course, as will Alex and that'll be in
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:24.960]   the actual S. It's the conference segment known as SC, S like Sam C, like Charlie and
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.480]   for people that with by the conference tickets, we have an all day thing and it's literally,
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.440]   I mean, it's an all star cast and it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.000]   We'll be doing a lot of the same stuff.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.840]   We'll be moving stuff back and forth between the pixel core area and the conference track
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.840]   area.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:45.600]   So, and you know, we got girls going geek coming over.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.320]   We'll do a lot of fun stuff.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.400]   We'll do it all together.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.520]   We'll just throw it all in jambalaya stew.
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:54.480]   So if you have a conference pass, you'll be able to see like the, you know, how to, you
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.000]   know, from soup to nuts on doing podcasting.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.080]   And then you want to, there'll be much, much more content also in the West Hall.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.160]   So basically you could spend all week talking about that and watching that.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.600]   And Mackleope, I, if you want, we can get a bag to put over your head and cut some eyes
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   out.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.520]   You know, I'm trying to figure out if there's a way to do it.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.160]   Would you let me ask you this because I have to say no one among us knows who Mackleope
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.160]   is.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.680]   We've never asked.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:27.320]   He just appears on the show magically by a special Mackleope hotline actually phone that
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:29.040]   he calls in on.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.160]   So we, we don't know.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.080]   Would you be recognized if you didn't wear a bag over your head, do you think?
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.080]   Oh, interesting.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   Sort of.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   See, I had to figure this out.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.200]   Were you in Red Hot Chili Peppers?
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   Are you Dave Grohl?
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.360]   I have won a sock on various.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.360]   Nevermind.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.360]   Okay.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   So, but no.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.200]   So, so, so, so, but that, so you might need some anonymity, but we'd be glad to arrange
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.400]   a mask of any kind.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   You want to Steve Jobs mask?
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   I think that'd be kind of fun.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.400]   That'd be good.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.000]   Or just the tricky dick mask.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.400]   That'd be close enough.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.960]   Wear a black turtleneck jeans and we'll get a mask of some kind.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   Okay.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.960]   All right.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   Cause that'd be fun.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.960]   It would be.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.040]   You'd have to get guys there, Leo, and we get a three mics and you wouldn't know which
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.040]   one was live.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   Well, yeah, but I mean, I'm talking about the people in the audience though.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.760]   You see the audience are going to be sitting there.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.060]   There are going to be hundreds of people looking trying to figure out who the hell is the
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.060]   Mackleope really?
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.600]   And I'm hoping the fake.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.080]   I need to get a classic Mac and just hollow it out.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.080]   Oh, that'd be good.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.080]   Just put it on your head.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   Oh, that'd be great.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.080]   But have that Mac happy, the Mac face on there.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   Right.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.080]   Wow.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.160]   Or, okay, I got another idea.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.480]   If you can't make it there, we could just put a laptop with you in shadow in silhouette
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.480]   and do that and put that on the stage.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.480]   We'll figure it out.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.480]   Okay.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.480]   That's you.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.480]   Me.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.480]   We'll talk.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.480]   I'd love to do it.
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.080]   We'll figure out a way to hide your true identity.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.080]   It's a good.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.760]   It worked for Spencer the cat for years.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.320]   It could work for you.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   We lost Will Harris.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   The idea.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.320]   I'm not sure what happened to Will.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.200]   I don't know if he got he grew weary of us or if he seems he's lost his connection.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.240]   So if we can get him back, we will.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:15.440]   So T-Mobile, as you said, has overturned the injunction against German court has overturned
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:21.880]   the injunction against T-Mobile has now crossed the wires saying they don't have to unlock.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.680]   So they've relocked it.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.320]   They pulled that $9.99 Euro phone.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.720]   I wonder how many they sold at a thousand euros.
[00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.720]   Come on.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   Honest.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   Long move.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   Honest.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   Really.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.120]   That's a lot of mula.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:43.000]   Back to, I guess it's kind of a little bit of a rumor.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.160]   Apple may start raising the price on iTunes according to an analyst.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:53.280]   Apple's going to be paying the movie industry a lot more for movies and is going to have
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:26:01.680]   to raise the cost, the average price on iTunes to 15 bucks.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.480]   This is a necessary condition to luring Fox back in.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:11.040]   And that's the other big story is that even though Fox has Hulu on its TV side with NBC,
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:16.160]   Fox is going to apparently according to Apple insider make a deal with iTunes.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:20.720]   But $15 movies, would you buy a $15 movie on iTunes?
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.720]   I don't buy it.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   I don't buy it.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.720]   I don't buy it.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   I don't buy it.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:30.000]   I mean, the DRM to me is not worth the price.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.320]   Well, it's lower quality.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.880]   It's just the movie.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.400]   It's copy protected.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.600]   If it comes anywhere near the cost of a DVD, forget it.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.640]   Well, and the thing is, is that I'm afraid that I started buying a couple movies here
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.280]   just as kind of an experiment.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.480]   But I find myself very attached to Netflix.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.760]   My kids buy movies.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.720]   And that may be part of the thing is that this isn't aimed at us.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.680]   It's aimed at a younger generation that's used to buying stuff on iTunes.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.400]   It's the convenience, you know, they just, and they don't see the credit card.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.400]   So they just buy.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.480]   They just buy.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:09.000]   And, and it explains why all of a sudden high school musical is on my Apple TV because
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.400]   I didn't put it there.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.520]   Sarah, I'm not watching that.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.440]   I still haven't seen it.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.640]   And finally, the other shoe drops on the NBC pull out the, all the NBC shows are gone.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.560]   Actually, they're not gone.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.120]   They're just not listed on the sidebar.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.640]   Oh, but you could still get them?
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.320]   I did it yesterday.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   Directly?
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   If you go to the URL directly?
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   Huh.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:37.240]   All you do is go to iTunes store and type in the, so like I wanted to get Chuck or one
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:42.640]   of the episodes of Chuck and I just type Chuck and they're all still there.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.280]   But they just no longer listed on the sidebar.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.920]   Well, the contract expired.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.960]   I imagine that's just, that's just a, taking them a little longer to get the rest of it
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   gone.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.600]   I don't think it's easy to just turn it off.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.200]   Leo, I don't think it expires till December 30th.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.440]   I'm looking in gadget.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.080]   They say, I know how much you love in gadget.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.080]   They say it could be.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.080]   It could be.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.080]   It could be.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.840]   All I know is that yesterday I bought 20 NBC episodes on iTunes myself.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.240]   I thought it was the end of December as well.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.120]   But, well, okay.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.760]   Sales will continue through December, it says.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:21.760]   And then Hulu.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   Now I've played with Hulu.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.680]   The problem with Hulu is you can't download them.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.640]   You can't, you know, you have to sit in front of your computer and watch them on flash.
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.280]   And they only have the last five episodes, okay?
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.160]   You know, it's very weird on Hulu.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.880]   It's hard to predict what's going to be on Hulu.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.640]   There's some old stuff, there's some new stuff.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.880]   Sometimes the newest episodes on there, sometimes it's not.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   It's very unpredictable.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.640]   I mean, part of it is the writer's strike.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.440]   I mean, I can't tell right now.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.640]   You know, I mean, there's no new office episodes, but there are no new office episodes, period.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.480]   So let me look at heroes.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   Let's see.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.480]   Okay, popular.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.600]   Rows titles, heroes.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.120]   Because there's many seasons of heroes.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.080]   How much of heroes is on here?
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.880]   It looks like they only have, you're right.
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.400]   Looks like they only have five episodes.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.920]   Lots of clips, but only five episodes of heroes.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.800]   Season two, episode seven, eight, nine, ten, and eleven.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.360]   This is not going to cut it.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.360]   No.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.360]   Sorry.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.360]   Of course, it's free.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.440]   Well, if you want to take market share, you really have to knock it out of the park.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.000]   And that's the problem that they're not really getting.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.200]   Oh, we'll put something up there.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.200]   And that'll make a difference.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.160]   But it doesn't because it has to be a superior experience.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   People are, you know, they're competing, they're not just competing with iTunes.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.640]   They're competing with, you know, BitTorrent and everything else.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.880]   That's how real competition is just download the full high def version free.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   Right.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.880]   And people want, I think they want a one stop solution.
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.560]   And they're going to pick whatever their one stop solution is.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.480]   So it's that they're going to be people balloting from BitTorrent.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.120]   I mean, in my case, I have an ITV and I tape everything.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.880]   And you know, you're going to find your one stop solution and when that fails you for
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.120]   some reason, yeah, maybe you'll go over and you'll look at hula just if you've missed
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.120]   an episode.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.680]   My kids, you know, and that's funny because my daughter last night was watching content
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.440]   from was a desperate housewives or something.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.440]   ABC.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   Who Lou?
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.560]   No, on the ABC.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.120]   Now they have an ABC thing, right?
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.960]   They have a, you know, web based ABC thing.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:25.280]   So they want, you know, they'll do that.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.280]   They're ahead of us.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.880]   Well, and they're, well, maybe their standards are low.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   I don't know.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.440]   You know, I'll be honest with you.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.760]   You know, I wanted to watch Tin Man on a sci-fi last night.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.520]   And first thing I do is I go to iTunes.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:41.920]   Yeah, I know I could always download it for free, but I want to see if I can, it is easy
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.680]   just because it's easier and because I feel better about it, but it's also because it's
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.800]   easier just to do a season pass and then say, okay, good, I got it.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.800]   But it's not on iTunes.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.440]   Now maybe sci-fi is going to put it in a lot of times.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   This is what happens.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.720]   You know, weeds is now there, but it's too late.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.240]   I want to see it when it comes out.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.000]   So I'm going to download it.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Right.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.160]   And they're really missing opportunity by not jumping on that.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.800]   I guess they feel like it'll cannibalize the broadcast version, but I don't think so.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.040]   Do it a day later, two days later, if you're really worried about that.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.080]   But don't do it a month later.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:16.240]   Yeah, it's, I mean, I think that there's a whole different market for people who just
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.960]   want to just download and watch it than the people who are, you know, flicking through
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.480]   TV and finding it.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.720]   So it's, you know, it's one of those things that I know, you know, as we all know, I'm
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.480]   just kind of disconnected, you know, from cable, but I have, you know, my kind of super
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.680]   system with a little Mac mini and stuff like that.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.000]   And it's just great because I have, you know, I bought all the stuff and I've got, you know,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.680]   80 movies and, you know, I don't know how many episodes of everything just kind of sitting
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.960]   there and I can just find it whenever I need it.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.880]   And I have to admit, I just don't feel the need to go back to, you know, I would never
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.400]   go back to TV.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:51.240]   But the interesting thing is, is that it's, you know, it is all stuff that's just easy
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.680]   to, it's just much easier to do it, but they're, they're making it.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.400]   I mean, I don't want to go to a web page to do it.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   Right.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   Or watch in flash.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.080]   And, you know, you could always capture the flash, but, you know, that's not, doesn't
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.080]   even look that good.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:10.600]   After admit, I did that experiment with the, there's a company called VDC, I think it's
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:12.280]   just VDC.com.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.880]   And they do, you know, I watch my news, my world news, I watch Al Jazeera English and
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.600]   because it's the best world news.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:25.360]   It has the most African coverage and anyway, so I, but I don't want to sit there and watch
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.360]   it in front of my computer.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.320]   So I just took snaps and I just, I just hit play and then, and then just drew a little,
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.560]   drew my little square and then I went to work out and I came back and I had two hours about
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.560]   just zero.
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.360]   Put it on my iPhone and I just kind of wander around watching it whenever I need to, you
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.360]   know, to pull it up.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.840]   But that's the, but that's the problem is I don't want to watch it.
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.840]   I don't want to watch a stream.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.400]   I want to watch it when I want to watch it.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:47.400]   And that's the play.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   Exactly.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.640]   Well, there, you know, there goes, there goes the neighborhood.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.720]   There goes NBC and up goes the movies.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.160]   And I think these companies just don't understand.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   They don't get it.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.080]   They don't get it.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.680]   So if Apple pays more and they charge us more, if it's part of the way to get Fox on
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.680]   there and Fox gets on there and oh, nobody buys the man with the iron mask because it's
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.680]   $15.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:15.320]   Who's going to, you know, I mean, really the price of these things should be $4.99.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   That's what it should be.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.800]   I mean, if we're downloading something, it does have a extras, you know, and it's 640
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   by whatever.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.240]   It should be $4.99 and people would buy them like crazy and they, you know, it'd be just
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.560]   a knee jerk kind of thing, you know, and, and, and, you know, you can rent them on Xbox
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.560]   360.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.560]   You download it.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.560]   You have three days to watch it.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.680]   They're HD, which is kind of neat.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:39.040]   You get full HD quality for rental on Xbox 360.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.360]   And I need to get one of those.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   It's pretty cool.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   And the quality is good.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.280]   It takes forever to download, but you don't, you know, you play a little more mass effect
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:48.280]   and eventually the thing downloads.
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.480]   Do you think that's a better way, Mack, love to do it to random?
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.480]   I think it's got to be.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.480]   Then then Holly wants happy.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.280]   I mean, unless, right.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.520]   I mean, that's a price point that everybody's going to be happy with.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:05.480]   And you know, I think for the most cases, people, I mean, you know, people don't, because
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:10.480]   of the way network like this, those things that people don't need to keep the movie around.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.480]   Right.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:17.000]   The, the unofficial Apple web log thinks that in fact based on strings, once again, strings
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:27.280]   in the iTunes library that rental is the next thing for both the iPhone and iTunes.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.280]   You think?
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.520]   You think that's where Apple's going to go?
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.520]   I hope so.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.600]   And then what would be the price?
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.360]   $4.99 or do you have to compete with Blockbuster?
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.040]   You have to compete with Blockbuster, don't you?
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.040]   It's expensive.
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.600]   It's expensive on Xbox Live.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:48.000]   It is not, it's, you pay for the convenience of pushing a button and having it download.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   And you only get three days.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.280]   Once you start watching, you get 30 days to start watching it.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.040]   And then three days once you start watching it, that doesn't seem like a big.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.560]   It's kind of lame, but it's HD.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.520]   I don't know why you couldn't do the same thing that you could do with Netflix.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   I mean, really.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.520]   Right.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.520]   Keep it until you're done with it.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.640]   Well, the other thing is, I mean, there's a lot, you know, you're also competing with
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:06.920]   people with Netflix and handbrake.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:11.560]   Well, I mean, so, but I think that most people think, Oh, that's a small thing.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.200]   Small niche market of high of hardcore sophisticated users, which it is.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.080]   It's not, it's not a huge loss.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.200]   Do you think?
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   I don't know.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.680]   You know, I don't know how big it is.
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.600]   You know, I just, I just know a lot of people that do it.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.120]   So it's just, you know,
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.680]   Certainly nobody on this podcast.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.680]   Not me.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.680]   Never heard.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.680]   No, no, no.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.720]   No, but I mean, I just think that there's a lot of people who, you know, who just, you
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.320]   know, we were, there was a conversation that we had a lunch about the, about where Netflix
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.880]   maxes out.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:44.160]   You know, if you, if you run too many, you know, through and you're obviously not watching
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.760]   them all, then they'll put you, they'll put you in second tier.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.360]   And the fact that someone knew that that existed was, I found that.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.840]   And I didn't know there was a max, you know, I just, I just order what I order and get what
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.840]   I get.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.840]   So, so anyway, I was just, I just thought it was interesting.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.320]   But anyway, but that's, that's another piece of people who don't want to go online and
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:07.280]   don't, you know, and the thing is, is for me, Netflix, I mean, I have a pretty big, you
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.640]   know, I got the five, whatever, and I got playing movies laying around all the time.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.280]   And I don't really feel like the need to, between the, what I have sitting on my Mac
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.560]   mini and what I have in Netflix, I just don't feel like I really need to order that many
[00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   more movies.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.560]   I don't have that much time.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.600]   I think that's the problem.
[00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   So there's, if they make it too expensive, I just don't see myself doing it.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.720]   There's a new 24 hour Mac channel on the web, the digital lifestyle.tv.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:34.920]   It's using Moggulus, which I still can't get a beta invite to.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:40.000]   And Ambers Command N is on there, Morgan, Webb's, Web Alert, 24 hours worth of shows, not
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.280]   all Mac shows, but many Mac shows.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.560]   Have you talked to them, Alex?
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.440]   You know, they sent me an email and I have to admit it was like right before Malek I showed
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   up.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.440]   And so I'm planning to get back to it.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   Scott, you're on it though.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.240]   The Apple phone shows on Apple phone show is there.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.400]   Yeah, they contacted me.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.240]   It's, but you don't do video.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.680]   Do you, what do they do?
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.040]   They're just doing, they're doing link outs to audio podcasts.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:05.800]   So obviously we got to get Mac like weekly up there.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.400]   They're doing link outs to things that are audio.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.440]   They're just trying to be a Mac destination from what I understand.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.520]   Who are these guys?
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.680]   Just a bunch of guys.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   I mean, nobody we know.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.640]   Has anybody sat for 24 hours?
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:23.760]   Right now the digital guy is on or something.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.600]   The digital media dude.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.480]   And there's a picture of ducks.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.160]   It looks like he's doing some sort of photo shopping thing.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.480]   I mean, I think, you know, it's kind of an intriguing idea to me.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.800]   I mean, it's, it's a little bit like, you know, the, the educational channel running
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.600]   24/7 in the background.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.600]   But why not?
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.240]   I mean, there's certainly, I would say there's, if you're going to have a, it's so funny
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.920]   because tech TV said, Oh, we'll never do a Mac show because you can't get advertisers
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.400]   and it's not a large enough market.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   Now he's drove me crazy.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.200]   I always said, doesn't matter.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.640]   The Mac people are more engaged, even if they're fewer Mac people, more of them will watch
[00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.520]   than PC people watch a PC show.
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.880]   And maybe these guys have the right idea.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.080]   I think it's kind of an interesting idea.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.320]   Has anybody sat and watched it for any length of time?
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:17.920]   I was looking for a 24 hour block that I wasn't doing anything, but I couldn't find it.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:23.480]   I mean, you can't download almost all as far as I know you can download all of these shows.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.600]   Even though they have some original stuff and watch on your iPod.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:31.040]   It's that same thing of, do I want to sit and watch this on my screen?
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.040]   I mean, I think if you're a Mac show and one of the things that we're probably looking
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.240]   at, we're kind of looking at it.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:38.040]   If you're a Mac show, it's probably not bad to get your Mac show up there and get some
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.040]   exposure.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:45.280]   But at the same time, most of our, most of our viewers are going to be downloading the,
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.840]   you know, downloading from iTunes.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.600]   And I'm looking here and you can't even, even things that are TDL originals like Gary's
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.760]   Garage, you can download directly.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.200]   So, you know, they're all quick time files.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   So I think most people would, but I guess that TDL probably doesn't care.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.640]   Watch it live or download it.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.000]   You're still watching it.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Right.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.040]   As far as something that, yeah, playing back for you one after another, I mean, that makes
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.040]   a lot of sense.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.280]   I mean, I think it's a good idea.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.040]   It's just a question of once again, that convenience of being able to.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.000]   I love the idea.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   I wish him luck.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.760]   I think this is a 24/7 channel of all about Mac.
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.760]   That's great.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:27.080]   It'd be exciting to see this actually convert to a cable channel.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.920]   Do you think that's the plan?
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:33.360]   I don't know if it's the plan or not, but I think it definitely could be done.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:41.400]   I mean, when you look at a lot of this stuff, you know, there's a lot of excess cable channels
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.280]   right now, you know, a digital cable.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.000]   This is no worse than a lot of the cable channels right now.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Absolutely.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.640]   I mean, really, probably not the metric they're looking for.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.040]   We hope it can be.
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.640]   Hey, that's all we had.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.880]   That's all we ever had to do.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.840]   Just be as good as the other other crappy channels.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.720]   We don't suck as bad as everybody else.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.520]   You want to hear the digital media dude?
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.520]   Here he is.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.160]   I can undo that.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.680]   Click on save.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:10.160]   And then if I refresh, you can see that it's back to the way.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.520]   If I you can just change some of the patterns.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:16.920]   This is exactly what everybody when we started Tech TV thought Tech TV would be.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   And then you click the start menu and go to programs.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   That's exactly.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.520]   But you know, there's a market for that.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:33.680]   I think that one one of the things that I think a lot of a lot of people do in any
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.320]   of these podcasts, I think that the big challenge once they start really pushing the stuff
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:41.440]   down is finding, you know, tightening up all the shows.
[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:46.400]   So when you start streaming this, I'm streaming my whole day on you stream.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:50.320]   And people want to sit me and watch me sit in front of a microphone, talk to people,
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.920]   disembodied voices all day they can.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.480]   They still hear very interesting.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.280]   You had a paint on PBS.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   Yeah, that Bob Roskai, right?
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:01.280]   But he was good.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.840]   He had little fluffy little clouds.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.160]   There was something about him that was magic.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.720]   He was, I mean, there he was released.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.520]   And I think that's kind of what it does come down to.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:16.360]   I have to say is there is a certain amount of personality required to do that.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.560]   We have 180 people watching us right now.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:22.280]   I bet you that's more than watching the digital lifestyle channel.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.320]   13, I think, last time I saw it.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.320]   I'll do it.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   I'll have a lot more right after this podcast.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.800]   No, but I don't mean to badmeth him.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.640]   I think that that's great.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:36.440]   I think that that's kind of the promise of all of this stuff and of modulus particularly
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.400]   is everybody should do a channel.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.960]   You know, if you can aggregate enough content to go 24/7 due.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.640]   You should, there should be a pixel court channel.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.920]   We're going down that direction.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:51.560]   Hell, tech TV only produced, you know, eight hours of programming.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.040]   That's if that a day and just repeated it.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.960]   Call for help was on like five times a screensaver.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.760]   So five times that's half the programming day right there.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.840]   Well, that's when you're thinking about a cable network, you have to fill up all that
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.960]   time and you also want to make it available because people aren't time shifting.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   Right.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.520]   But once you have podcasts, it's a question of whether you need to do that or not.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.520]   Right.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.800]   Let's go on to patent nonsense.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:23.000]   Lawsuits galore, AT&T and Apple suit over iPhones, visual voicemail.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.720]   Glowsnut technology is said, we own that.
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.520]   We can be invented that.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:29.480]   What do you think Scott born?
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:30.480]   Apple phone show.com.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.800]   There's some like 250 pending lawsuits against the iPhone.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.680]   And I think that there are too many lawyers and I think that most of these will end up
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:46.400]   either being dismissed or they'll go away to nuisance suits.
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.680]   Some of them may be legitimate.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.000]   I mean, you can't really say, but it's like, come on.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.920]   It doesn't matter what's popular.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.280]   Whatever's popular, all the lawyers start suing it because they see a payday.
[00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   Right.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.520]   So if the, you know, if there was another cell phone, it was more popular than the iPhone.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.520]   You're right.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:04.280]   You got to wonder if, if closure wouldn't be suing them.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.520]   I don't, I mean, I don't know.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.200]   I don't know the specifics of this suit.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:12.240]   It could be a valid suit, obviously, but there are, we see so many lawsuits and then,
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.240]   you know, it's like all the suits.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.720]   They make tons of news when they're launched.
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.720]   Right.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:21.800]   Like the big, the big lawsuit, the big lawsuit over Steve Jobs and his options.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:22.800]   Remember that?
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.160]   Well, case dismissed, case dismissed, case dismissed.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.400]   There was something there.
[00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:34.280]   But I think as we talked about on, on the show, nobody really wants Steve, Steve to
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   leave Apple.
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:41.880]   So even if you're an end-run level malfeasance, I don't think anybody, no, the shareholders
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.080]   wouldn't force them out.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.280]   I think that what a lot of people miss from a legal point of view is that what happens
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:50.040]   is they get to a summary judgment in, in the court case.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:54.400]   So it never actually makes, even if it gets that far, it gets to a law firm, an Apple
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.160]   will hire a law firm that's, that's designed to kill the case at summary judgment.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.720]   They'll just attack everything.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.080]   And man, if your ducks aren't in a row, I mean, most cases just, if it's really
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:09.240]   not tied all the way down, these, these law firms specialize in getting them thrown out.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:13.160]   Well, what's interesting is they filed a similar suit against AOL and Vonage.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:16.680]   Vonage settled, giving them the cash to then go against Apple.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   Right.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.880]   That's kind of how you just couldn't afford to have it go any more.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:20.880]   Right.
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:21.880]   It's often how that happens.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.240]   They'll sue the small guys, build up a cash war chest, then go after the big guys.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:29.480]   Well, the point I want to make, Leo, is that you, you know, it was big news when jobs got
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.800]   sued.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.800]   It wasn't big news.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:32.800]   Well, case was just big news.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.200]   And so he was being investigated by the SEC.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.680]   No, he was actually sued.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.880]   Yeah, they sued the executive too.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.880]   There was a class action.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.880]   Class action.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.880]   Quite a bunch of cranks.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.280]   I don't know if there were lawsuits.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.880]   All these lawsuits against the iPhone make a lot of news when they're launched.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.040]   What we don't hear about is when they're dismissed.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   Right.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:56.320]   Hey, did you see this, this thing with Pepsi offering a billion DRM free songs from Amazon?
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.320]   Yeah, they're not.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.280]   They've, the last year, remember, it was iTunes.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:00.880]   A hundred million in iTunes.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.960]   A billion from Amazon.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.720]   And DRM free.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:05.720]   Is that a lot for iTunes?
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:09.160]   Is that, I mean, it's great for Amazon.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.160]   It is.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.640]   You know, have you been buying any stuff from Amazon?
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:16.560]   You know, I've bought a lot of stuff, but now I'm hearing not that anybody pays any
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:23.400]   attention to terms of service, but apparently the terms of service on the iTunes, I mean,
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:25.920]   the Amazon music is awful.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.920]   But who do you mean?
[00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:27.920]   I didn't even read it.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.880]   Everybody's people like Corey Doctor are saying, you know, you read the, read the license agreement
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:33.880]   on this music.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.840]   It's worse than if it had DRM on it.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   I don't know.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   I can't even find.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.840]   I'm trying to read the license agreement.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   I can't find it.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.000]   It's here somewhere.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.680]   I'm sure it is a lot of links, but no, I'm in buy.
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.680]   I love it.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.480]   Can I, can I take us down a rat hole for a second?
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.520]   If you want to read the worst license agreement on the web, the one that should curl your toes,
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.280]   read the friggin pay pal agreement.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.640]   Oh, let me take some.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:03.200]   You put money into pay pal anytime they want any reason they want.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:08.160]   They can just lock that count up for up to like a year and they'll let you know.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.520]   That's why I always take out whenever I have any money in there.
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.520]   I always take it out as quickly as I can.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.280]   Yeah, they held over 10 grand in mind for like a month.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.280]   That's frustrating.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.840]   And when my lawyers looked into it, they said, well, you know, when you click that little
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.600]   terms of service button, I said, I agree, you said they could do that.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:25.600]   Nobody reads this stuff.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:32.320]   I'm looking, I'm looking all over the Amazon MP3 page for license agreement.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:38.120]   They really bury it somewhere.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.760]   But for good reason, for good reason.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.120]   But if you do a search for Amazon license agreement, you know, people are really upset
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.120]   about it.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.120]   Right.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:50.120]   Well, I think that it's, I just found that I, well, two things happened.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.960]   One is is that when I got my little media center, if I went through the process of digitizing
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:59.080]   all of my CDs and remembering all of the ones that I hadn't gotten to yet.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.840]   And now that I have like 18,000 songs on there, I don't feel like, you know, that I put on
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.320]   for my, just the CDs that I had laying around.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.160]   You know, I didn't feel the need to buy that many.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.760]   But the other thing is, is that, you know, I just didn't want to go out to a website.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.560]   I really found that I'm managing everything.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.560]   Interesting.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.560]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   But you download some, but it has a little downloader.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.560]   It gets them into items.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.560]   It's all automatic.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.680]   I mean, I just noticed that I didn't do it.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.960]   I was all excited when it came out.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.480]   Oh, I'll go check it out and I'll do all this stuff.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   And this is really cool.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.520]   And it has made me very touchy about buying non-EMI songs on iTunes.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.440]   You know, like I really think about it before I, before I decide I'm going to do that.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.600]   Because I really don't want any more DRM at all.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:38.440]   I don't want to buy any more DRM songs.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:43.000]   So I just, you know, I'd rather buy the, I use CD from Rasputin down the, you know,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:50.240]   and then I would buy the, you know, buy a DRM, anything.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.880]   So that has me thinking about it.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.720]   You know, I just, I don't find the, I don't find the interface for the Amazon store very
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   good.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.520]   It's kind of a pain in the neck.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.920]   I don't like buying stuff on Amazon.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   It is.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   I don't know.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.360]   I guess it's like I buy so many at a time when I buy songs, I'm not buying one of the
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.360]   things.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.400]   And I will say I should own stock in Amazon for the amount of money I spent there.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:16.280]   I mean, I buy everything that I can find on Amazon, on Amazon, except for the music.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.040]   You don't like it, Mackle up either?
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.200]   You know, I use it.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.200]   I use it.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:24.520]   Well, I usually what I do is I try and see if I can get a DRM free for iTunes.
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.480]   But then if I can't get a DRM free from iTunes, I go to Amazon.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.960]   But I don't like the interface.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.760]   Well, it's not iTunes.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:34.720]   Well, it doesn't have to be iTunes.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   It just asked it not.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   Well, what's hard about it?
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.920]   I mean, you search, okay.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:44.040]   So Amy Winehouse, there's the album, buy MP3 album, you click the thing, the download
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.920]   or launches and it downloads them and puts it in iTunes.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.920]   I don't find it difficult.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:48.920]   I don't, I'm not.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:53.920]   Well, I think it pages the results, whereas in iTunes, you get everything.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   It does.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.920]   Yeah, it does.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.520]   I tend to be very sensitive about that.
[00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.920]   I mean, I think that's the probably the thing that I just go, I don't want to, you know,
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.920]   I just, you know, just the season.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   There's a bunch of junk on the side that I don't really care about.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:08.280]   I mean, I really, I really like something that's more dedicated to finding music rather
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   than showing me the rest of the stuff where you can click over here to get your recommendations
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.280]   and you can.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.920]   But you can buy for 89 cents, you can buy this.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.920]   You're a monster.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   Mr. Grinch.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   I already have.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   All right.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   But that's 89 cents unprotected.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:29.920]   Come on.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:37.920]   Well, like I said, that's, I mean, I go, I go there and I, and I buy it from there.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   If I can't get a DRM free from Apple, I'm not.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.920]   See, I can click the one click and I know I maybe I'm just so used to it.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   I buy, well, you do too, though, Alex.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   I buy so much stuff on Amazon that, you know, there's not that big selection.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:50.920]   That's the other problem.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.720]   I went looking for probably 10 songs the other day and found one.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:58.920]   If it had everything, you know what, would that change it guys?
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.920]   Alex and Mac Club, if every song you wanted were there?
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:06.020]   Yeah, I think that the problem is that all this page up, you know, it's constantly paging
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:08.920]   when you're doing searches just so you can find out that it's not there.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.280]   If I knew that it was going to be there, if it was big enough there, then I'd go through
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.920]   it and I'll find it, put it up with it.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.920]   Right.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.920]   But would you have this song?
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:27.920]   I just got to say, you know, the first steps in meeting you have a problem.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.920]   I have a problem.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.920]   I buy every Christmas song available.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   You know, the chipmunks are coming out with a movie.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   I saw it's such a weird looking movie.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:38.920]   Have you seen it?
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   The trailer?
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:40.920]   I want it.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:44.920]   The live action movie with CGI chipmunks.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.920]   CGI chip?
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   Well, what do you think they would do?
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.920]   Get real chipmunks, clear?
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.920]   Come on.
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:51.920]   Train chipmunks.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:52.920]   Yeah, now I'd go see that.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:53.920]   That's like that.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:55.920]   Star Wars had CGI spaceships.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.920]   I'm sorry, that's all that are available.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.920]   Well, now wait a minute.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:02.720]   I mean, they've done some amazing, they look at Lassie, they've done some amazing things
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:04.720]   with animal training.
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:07.920]   I think there's no reason you couldn't have real chipmunks.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:09.920]   Spend a little more time.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   Like a little harder.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.480]   They could do it.
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.480]   I think they could.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   I really do.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.920]   And I would go see that movie.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.920]   Wouldn't you?
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.920]   You know, I'm going to go see the one with CGI chipmunks.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:25.640]   You want to talk about those YouTube movies of the dog?
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.400]   I love that stuff.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.920]   That's what's made YouTube for me.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.600]   Did you see the spoof of that where the dog is just sitting next to the roller skates?
[00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.920]   Because they're on strike because the actor's right.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.880]   I love the, there's been a ton of great writers' videos going on.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.640]   I've been up because the writers are using this YouTube as a way to speak.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.920]   And I think that's really interesting.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.360]   How many writers are going to say, wait a minute, you know, I like this better?
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.720]   Of course it doesn't pay, does it?
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.720]   Not yet.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.680]   Top searches for 2007.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.760]   Interesting difference between Yahoo and Google on Yahoo, the number one search of 2007
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:08.240]   was, one, I guess, Britney Spears, followed by WWE, the world wrestling enterprises, followed
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.960]   by Paris Hilton.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   Go over to Google.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:11.960]   That's just so frightening.
[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:12.960]   Isn't that sad?
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.120]   It says a real statement about people who use Yahoo.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.360]   People use Google, the number one search, iPhone.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.280]   We like Google iPhone.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:23.880]   Well, it goes down fast.
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:27.800]   Number two search webkins.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:32.440]   Number three search TMZ, which is the, you know, the gossip site with all the videos of
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.000]   Britney Spears.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.240]   See, but see, Google users are smarter.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.040]   Instead of entering Britney Spears, they go straight to TMZ.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.360]   They know what they know where the upscirt shots are.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.760]   Transformers number four, YouTube number five.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.280]   That's funny going to a Google site to look for YouTube.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:52.440]   Well, I was at, when I was at Google, at one point, I was at Google for me and I looked
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.200]   up and maybe it was there when I was there with you, but we, I looked up at the screen
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:58.880]   in the lobby and someone has had Google Yahoo.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:00.880]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:01.880]   I was with you.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.200]   And then the guy who was with us said, yeah, that's actually one of the top search tools.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.200]   The term's like Google.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:11.480]   How do I find Yahoo?
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:16.560]   So I have to correct myself because while Google Yahoo was talking about the top 20 searches,
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.520]   Google was talking about the fastest growing search terms.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:23.820]   So I'm thinking maybe Britney will be on there because it's two years in a row that
[00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.680]   Britney's been the top, right?
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.680]   Why?
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:28.680]   Why?
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:29.680]   Let's step away.
[00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:31.320]   Step away from the spear.
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:32.560]   The crash.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:36.120]   You know, who this, the problem is these are the people who are going to be taking care
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:38.000]   of us in our old age, Leo.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.760]   Oh, you're right.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.080]   Oh my God.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.480]   It'll be insufferable.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.000]   I watch how my kids use the web.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.400]   And of course, they, you know, Britney Spears right up there.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.960]   That's the first thing they want to see.
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.840]   And I, you know, I admit that when I missed Britney Spears doing the MTV music awards,
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.920]   I went to YouTube to find, you know, the fiasco, the video of the fiasco.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:00.720]   I Googled it.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.120]   So you just stop and look at car crashes, don't you?
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.120]   I do.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.120]   I can't help it.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.920]   It was, that was a car crash.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.800]   PC magazine column by Oliver Rist.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:16.080]   Now remember the source PC magazine, although PC magazine has been pretty complimentary
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.520]   of Mac and Tasha.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.920]   And this is from their everything Apple column.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.720]   He says, Leopard is not better than Vista.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:27.320]   It is Vista and Tigers better than both of them.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:28.320]   Amen.
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   A lot of people are not liking.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.320]   Really?
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:34.840]   I just, I mean, I switched my computer over to Leopard and I'm not really having, I was
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:40.000]   waiting for bad things to happen and it hasn't.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.480]   What trouble are people having that I'm missing?
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:48.280]   Why five problems for, keyboards freezes on the Mac books?
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:53.120]   Now, one thing I am having is not keyboards freezes, but I have like four or five times
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.920]   had my, my trackpad freeze for a second.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.520]   Even like the mouse just kind of won't go anywhere.
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.280]   That's probably related.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:04.440]   I've had trouble with spaces being, and I know Merlin had trouble because I saw his
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.440]   Twitter.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:08.320]   He said, what something happened, my applications have disappeared.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   They'll come back to my reboot.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.040]   And then somebody said, it's spaces.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.760]   Just press F8C and everything will come back.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   And that's true.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:18.440]   For some reason spaces grabs windows and they got up in me one.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.720]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.960]   By the way that, you know, someone was posting it the way the docs should work.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.400]   You know, they posted this on Mac break weekly on the on the MBW list.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:32.280]   There is a list of, let's see, further down.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.680]   Oh, someone posted it.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:42.280]   It was a little video of, I guess, what used to be in the, in the, um, sorry.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.280]   I'm trying to find it before it.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.280]   Well, I do the ad.
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:47.280]   How about that?
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.480]   You'll find it before I'm talking about audible.com.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.200]   Our sponsor and after last week's tweet, I don't know how much longer they're going
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.520]   to be sponsored, but I love them.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.760]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:04.080]   If you'd like to get a free book, you get a credit for a book when you sign up at audible.com/Macbreak.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.960]   45,000 plus titles.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.000]   I'm listening to new stuff all the time.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.400]   I love, I just got a new book yesterday.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:11.400]   What'd you get?
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.400]   Getting things done.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   Dave Allen.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.920]   The thing I hadn't done was the thing I hadn't been getting done was actually reading the
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:17.920]   book.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.920]   Perfect.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   Get that stuff.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.320]   So now you can use Omni focus.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.960]   Well, what happened was, here's the worst part is I got Omni focus and I got all excited
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:26.960]   about it.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:27.960]   But I don't know how it works.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.280]   You have to read getting things done first.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.880]   So I got Omni focus and then I said, well, I better figure out how this works.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.720]   And then my wife actually had the getting things done book.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:39.560]   So I had it sitting out and I just kept on looking at it and looking at it, but I'm not
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.560]   really reading.
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:45.400]   So I was like, I'm never actually going to get to this.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:50.200]   So I bought the book and it's actually Dave Allen is actually reading it.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:52.680]   It's like one of his seminars, which is great.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:53.680]   It's really great.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.680]   And it was great.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.480]   I was just walking through Bristol Farms last night shopping and listening to, you know,
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.880]   feeling more effective, just listening to it.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:05.800]   If you've got a baby or you've got to go to Bristol farms, you need to join audible audible.com
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.800]   slash that break.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.080]   And if you've got things to get done, getting things done, that's a good, you know, it's
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.520]   not our first time we've recommended that, but I, I think it's a great recommendation.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.040]   It's worth, it's worth bringing up again, especially for the Mac folks who are going
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.200]   to start, you know, using Omni focus.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   It makes it, yeah, it is.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.200]   You're right.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.880]   Omni focus kind of is a getting things done application.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:27.880]   It's built around it.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.600]   I mean, they say that you can use it for the things, but that's really the thing that you
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.960]   want to, if you're going to, if you're going to really go at it, that's the thing to use.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:37.440]   And I've, I've become very clear with the baby and everything else that's going on that,
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   you know, my current.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.440]   You need this.
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:40.440]   Yes.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.320]   My current system is insufficient for the, what the requirements that I have in front of
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.320]   me.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.640]   So I'm trying to, you know, scramble into a new new structure.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.320]   So no, that's absolutely true.
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.680]   This is the time.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.520]   If you're not more efficient with a kid, you're going to be underwater very fast or you can
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:56.520]   do what Merlin did and just disappear.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.560]   All there's that I mean, we bet you.
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:00.160]   I chose on to please.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.160]   I beg of you.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:03.360]   Do not disappear.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:05.560]   All right.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.040]   That's a good recommendation getting things done.
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:12.840]   Our book of the day, if you would like to get that book or any book, 45,000 plus titles,
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:17.340]   you can get a credit towards a free book by just going to audible.com, A U D I B L E
[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:19.580]   .com slash Mac break.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:25.340]   You know, the number one search term on my blog is, is, "Twit Audible Picks."
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:26.340]   Nice.
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:28.580]   I've got to put together a list.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:29.580]   We have them all.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:33.060]   I've been saving them all there in a big spreadsheet and I just have to, I'll put them on the
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:35.260]   blog sometime in the next, this week.
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:38.100]   I've got to get it on the blog because I know people really want to see, well, what were
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.460]   those picks?
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.540]   And we don't want to make you listen to every single show.
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.740]   Well maybe we do.
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.740]   On second thoughts.
[00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:48.980]   By the way, I found this, this thing with a doc.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.740]   Let me finish up audible.com slash Mac break.
[00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.340]   We thank audible for their support of Mac break weekly.
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:55.340]   Okay.
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.940]   It's about two hours ago.
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:59.980]   If you go down the Mac break weekly thing from the time we're recording, it says, "The
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.860]   way the doc is supposed to work, stack's done right."
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:06.620]   And it was something, I don't know how they did it, maybe it was with a beta or something
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:10.300]   like that, but it was the idea that you could take the, you could grab a bunch of applications
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:15.100]   and drag them as a group onto the doc and then it would stack up a whole bunch of applications.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.860]   So make your own stack.
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:17.860]   Right.
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:19.340]   So you have your own little stack of applications.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.140]   Because then you control the size of it and so forth.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.140]   Right.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:26.500]   And so, and what's interesting about it is I saw that after I had actually found something.
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:29.220]   Oh, you're going to steal my Mac break pick.
[00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:30.220]   Oh, are you?
[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:31.220]   It's on a tool.
[00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:32.220]   Key?
[00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:33.220]   Okay.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:36.580]   I got a, I got a great pick that will fix the stacks.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:37.580]   Oh, okay.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.580]   Well, I'll tell you what I, this isn't a tool of any kind.
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:45.580]   Well, okay.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:52.580]   So, this is just a, what I found was is that I, you know, as you may have seen when I'm
[00:59:52.580 --> 01:00:00.580]   on like the lab or whatever, I oftentimes have a huge, you know, your doc has, so many items
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.580]   in the doc that the icons are about the size of a pinhead.
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:06.580]   So, so, so, so I just said, I don't want to do that again.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.580]   And so I was like, I wonder if I could just put all the, I could put aliases of the, of
[01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:14.380]   the doc that, that, that at first I thought was a bug and now I think is a feature is,
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:20.380]   is that if you put a applications only into a folder and then drag that folder onto the
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:23.580]   doc in the folder area, it actually doesn't show a folder.
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:26.580]   It shows the applications all stacked up on top of each other.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.580]   Oh.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:30.580]   So it, so it, which is exactly what it's supposed to do.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.580]   So it's doing what it's like.
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:36.180]   So, and, and like if you take one that was designed a pile of applications, that's what
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.180]   I did.
[01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:39.540]   So what I have a pile, I have a pile that's, I have a 3D pile.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:44.340]   I have a pro apps pile, an iApps pile, an internet pile, and an iWork pile.
[01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:47.860]   And the iWork pile is the one that probably works the best because they're, they're already
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:48.860]   in a folder.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.260]   I'm, I wasn't willing to move the applications.
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:55.260]   I mean, applications can be a little sensitive about being moved out of the application.
[01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.260]   Right.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:57.260]   So you just do shortcuts.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:58.260]   Alias is.
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:02.100]   So I just put aliases in, but the iWork one, you just drag the iWork folder in and, and
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.500]   then you click on it and they pop up.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   I like the grid.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:06.500]   I don't like the little thing thing.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500]   Uh, but.
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.500]   Try in this right now.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:09.940]   So, oh, look at that.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.740]   So if it's small enough, it'll do the right thing.
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:17.580]   Well, if it's applications, I don't know if it's anything, but I, it looks like this
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.140]   is, this was kind of the compromise.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:23.740]   I guess something wasn't working or whatever and they pulled it out, but it works great.
[01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:26.780]   And now I have a whole slew of applications that are all in little groups.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:31.540]   And so I was able to take what would have been probably, you know, 25 applications and
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.260]   stick them into, you know, five groups.
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:37.700]   I bet you that's what, why don't they ever use that as an example of stacks?
[01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.300]   That's how the stacks is meant to be.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.420]   So you can do my, so Adobe applications folder.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.260]   And how do you do the applications in it?
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.420]   And when I saw it, I was like, well, this is really what, I mean, this is, this makes
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.420]   stacks worth it.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.460]   I mean, because the other stack stuff, you know, I just thought it was nuts.
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.740]   So it actually works really, really well.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:54.740]   There you go.
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.540]   And I group your applications in there.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.540]   I like it.
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:58.540]   Wow.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.420]   Anyway, now what if you did a smart folder?
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:03.220]   I wonder if it would do that too.
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.540]   Oh, let me try it.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:09.820]   I'm going to make a smart folder with a just Adobe unit.
[01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:11.460]   That won't work too well though.
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:15.620]   But I guess you could, oh no, you could, you could say applications with a word Adobe
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:16.620]   in it.
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.260]   That would work.
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:20.780]   I'll have to play with it because I'm trying to do a show right now.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.380]   I see this is the problem.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:24.220]   I get sidetracked.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:27.340]   Look at the shiny little bubble.
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:28.900]   It's pretty.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:32.620]   You'd be surprised how many things I buy when I'm doing these shows because my, my resistance
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:37.540]   is down and somebody like Scott will say, oh, though, you know, those speakers are great.
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:39.540]   And I'll go click.
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.780]   I bought it, click.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.980]   It's mine.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:50.420]   Mac is now near a 7% market share according to statistics from net applications.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:57.980]   The Mac Intel platform garnered 0.3.59% while Mac OS 3.22%, a total of 6.81%.
[01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:00.340]   And here's what's really interesting.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:09.300]   The iPhone has now, now you might think this is ridiculous, 0.09% of the web browsing online
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:13.380]   market, but that best pocket PC.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:15.900]   Say that's interesting.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:16.900]   That's interesting.
[01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.020]   Is that interesting?
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:23.340]   We get a poll at the Apple phone show recently asking people what their favorite iPhone feature
[01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.340]   was.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:29.700]   And Safari was the huge landslide winner with more than about a third of the votes in the
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.500]   next closest thing was email at less than half.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.580]   So I'm not surprised.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:39.420]   People like, despite their, you know, crying about 2G, they like to use Safari and probably
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.900]   because of Wi-Fi making it particularly an enjoyable experience.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:45.260]   So that's a really fantastic success.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.540]   And it's not, yeah, it's iPhone plus iPhone touch.
[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:52.500]   So people really, even in the touch, they're liking Safari.
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:54.660]   And advertisers are liking it.
[01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:02.140]   And San Mateo based mobile advertising company called AdMob has created an iPhone focused
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:12.740]   Land Rover campaign of users who clicked on the Land Rover advertisement 23%.
[01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:18.420]   Responded to a call to action on the landing page, 88% watched the video, 9% entered their
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.260]   zip code to find a Land Rover dealership.
[01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:24.460]   I mean, these are numbers through the roof.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:28.980]   This is like, maybe, maybe iPhone users are just naturally Land Rover users.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.380]   Well, I got the money.
[01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.100]   Maybe that's the more important thing.
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.460]   They're like you when you're doing a podcast.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.460]   Yeah, click.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.460]   I think I'll buy that.
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:38.460]   Land Rover.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.460]   I'm on my iPhone.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.460]   I can buy that.
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.460]   Oh, boy.
[01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.580]   It's that secret electronic sauce that makes you want to buy everything.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.820]   Maybe we found a secret here.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.820]   Let's try something.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:48.820]   All right.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:52.860]   I want everybody to go to overstock.com and buy a squishy ball right now.
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.660]   Let's just see what happens.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.660]   Wild.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:57.900]   Wouldn't that be wild?
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:04.260]   No, that's frankly why advertisers like Audible like podcast because there's something about
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:05.260]   it.
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:10.100]   We're wired right to your neural receptors.
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.860]   We're coming right into your head.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:14.180]   I think that's true of audio particularly.
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:20.900]   I was talking to one of the other hosts on the VFX show, David's trip in us.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.740]   So it was mentioning that, you know, he says.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:27.300]   He has Tivo and he doesn't know who the advertisers are, even what network the shows are on that
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:28.300]   he watches.
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.740]   But he knows who all the sponsors are for all of it.
[01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:31.740]   Yeah.
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.460]   Twit and Macbreak and all these other ones.
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:36.220]   We know this.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:40.460]   One of our, I can't say who, but one of our advertisers did a study and we absolutely
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:41.460]   know this.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:49.460]   They got response very similar to this response for the Land Rover.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:52.060]   I mean, it's just mind blowing.
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:58.740]   I'm seeing a story and I think I put on Macbreak weekly that online ad sales next year, they
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:01.340]   expect will outpace radio ad sales.
[01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:02.340]   Wow.
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.340]   I think I put it on there.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.980]   Let me see if I'm, is it next year or the next few years?
[01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:10.740]   But that's like $8 billion.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:15.500]   When I think there's a huge opportunity again to get back into that writer's strike.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.140]   I mean, if it lasts a long time, the opportunity for lots of advertising to flow into our market.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.140]   It's very high.
[01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.660]   Well, maybe Audible won't leave us after Corey Doctorows.
[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:31.260]   He went off on Audible's copy protection during the Audible ad.
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:34.260]   That would happen.
[01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:37.140]   And then, and then, yeah, of course, it says Corey.
[01:06:37.140 --> 01:06:39.140]   What do you, I totally mean that would happen.
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.900]   Yeah, that's a landmine waiting to go on.
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:43.060]   And he, but he, but he was interested.
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.060]   He said, Oh, I love Audible.
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:46.540]   I bought thousands of dollars of books for them, but I, you know, and then he goes off
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.980]   on the copy protection and talks about how he broke it.
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:53.220]   Oh, that's all right.
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:57.020]   And then, and then at the end, he said, I'm sorry, you can edit that out.
[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.900]   And I said, well, no, not really.
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:02.220]   If I edit it out, then then an advertiser will influence content.
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:04.060]   And I don't do that.
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.740]   So anyway, I don't care.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:10.260]   So you just made a new ad that said Mac Break Weekly used to be sponsored by Audible.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.260]   I don't care.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:12.260]   Who cares?
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:16.980]   If we don't have advertisers, where we're going to, you know, we'll just, I'll just, I
[01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:19.940]   mean, we were doing what we would do if we were all the same.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:22.060]   We'd, I'd be exactly, we'd be doing this anyway.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.180]   We're not, we're, nobody's in it for the money.
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.540]   Remember, gear media tech, we did like, what?
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.660]   Eight straight hours of podcast teaching.
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:32.100]   Then we went over to a house of prime rib and then talked about podcasts for three hours.
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:33.620]   I wish I'd taped that.
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.820]   Then we'd have a podcast right there.
[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:39.860]   So have you seen the new, I, I, you gotta love these Apple ads.
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.260]   Have you seen the new Get a Mac ad?
[01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:43.500]   Let me, let me play it for you.
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.700]   This, you're going to love this.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:46.700]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.700]   I'm a PC.
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.700]   Hello PC world.
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:49.700]   Yes.
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:52.380]   I'd like to report a misprint, a very serious misprint.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:57.180]   Well, you said, and I quote, the fastest Windows Vista notebook we tested this year is a Mac.
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:58.180]   A Mac.
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:07:59.180]   That's impossible.
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:00.180]   Oh wait, I'm a PC.
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:01.180]   I think that's actually true.
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.580]   How can a Mac run Vista faster than a PC?
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.220]   It goes against the laws of nature.
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.220]   Well, you know what?
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:06.220]   I'll put Mac on.
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.220]   He'll tell you that I run Vista faster.
[01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:09.020]   I'll talk to them, but I can't see.
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.020]   Hello, I'm a Mac.
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:11.020]   Yeah, dude.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.660]   PC's definitely faster.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.940]   I love it.
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:21.180]   What a great way to highlight a very good story in PC world.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.980]   I didn't, they also, they did some online, and I actually missed it, but they did some
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:31.580]   online version of the ad where they were pointing it with the same two guys in like
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:32.580]   a little flash.
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.300]   Yeah, you see these everywhere now.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.300]   I think CNET has them too.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:38.220]   And weren't they pointing up at like a Vista ad?
[01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:39.700]   Oh, how funny.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:42.180]   And saying something about, you know, I didn't see it.
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:44.780]   I only thought it was happening and I didn't stop to look at it.
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:45.780]   Oh, how funny.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:51.220]   I actually were, you know, making a brand of Vista ad banner that was running across.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.220]   Oh, wow.
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:53.580]   I'm looking on the CNET page.
[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.420]   That's what all that noise is.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.780]   I'm trying to find to see.
[01:08:55.780 --> 01:08:59.300]   I saw it maybe it was PC magazine, but yeah, they, I, but I didn't see that they actually
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.460]   were pointing at a Vista ad.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:01.460]   Oh, how funny.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:06.820]   Boy, there's an example of an ad buy you're not going to get to a time.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:10.340]   I guess, I guess it's probably Mac world.
[01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:12.140]   I figured they wouldn't get it anyway.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:16.060]   All right, we're going to, we're going to get to our picks of the week.
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:21.660]   I'd like to hear from our columnists on their picks and I already told you mine.
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:25.940]   Sometimes we'll just blur it right out and I hope nobody else has this one, but it's
[01:09:25.940 --> 01:09:27.100]   such an obvious one.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:33.940]   It's called key Q-U-A-Y and it is a play on get it on dock.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:38.180]   But this, this is a program that fixes the stacks.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:42.120]   But now that I know Alex's trick, I'm going to, I'm going to use this and you can use
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.500]   both and that's, and that's the beauty of it.
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.560]   What it does is a simple little program.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:53.060]   You can use it for free to create one folder that has the hierarchical menu, the menu hierarchical
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:54.420]   menus back.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:10:01.980]   So I drag my eye, you open key, you drag your, my applications folder to it, say, and then
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.060]   you can label it, you can badge it, you can put some color on it, you can do all sorts
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.060]   of stuff.
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:11.340]   And when you're done, you drag it to the dock and all of a sudden, yay.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:15.120]   We're back to the way it used to be with a hierarchical menu.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.720]   Now there are some disadvantages.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.520]   You can't drag files to it, alas.
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.400]   But it works and it doesn't run in the background all the time.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.200]   I don't know exactly what kind of weird leopard food they're doing.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.960]   It's a cocoa application, but it, but it is, it does the job and it does it painlessly.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.640]   Free to do one folder, but it's a, I think this is a hundredth of an Alex, it's seven
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:43.360]   euros if you want to unlock it and I did immediately because I, I missed my hierarchical folders.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.260]   So they're back, but now you can combine them.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:51.440]   So I can have a stack for I work and I can have an hierarchical folder for my applications.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.640]   What a great way to go.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.640]   Q U A Y.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:11:00.120]   It's from brockahoff.net B R O C K E R H O double F dot net slash key.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:04.240]   And I think Rick Yeager of the Mac Merck Mac Merck dot com for tipping me off to this
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.240]   program.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:09.880]   I want to happy I was with my snacks.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:10.880]   Mr. Scott born.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.840]   You have a pick for us today.
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.840]   I do now.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.080]   We know what's the average iPhone call case cost.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.080]   Thirty nine bucks.
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.080]   Thirty five.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.680]   That's, you can probably everybody thinks that's just what it costs to get an iPhone
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   case.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.680]   Right.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.680]   Right.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.680]   Not right.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.680]   More or less.
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.960]   Are we going up or down going down, baby?
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.960]   Down.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:35.080]   We found a really cool pouch at a place that most people will not be familiar with if
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.160]   you're not from San Francisco, but that shouldn't stop you from buying from because they have
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.160]   a website.
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:42.680]   There's a company called Tad Gear.
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:46.120]   And we honestly who are from girls going geek term you onto this place right around
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.880]   the corner from my studio.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.840]   And they have a pouch designed specifically for the iPhone call the Tad Gear I come pouch.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:58.680]   I C O M M P O U C H and it's 16.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.320]   Ninety five.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.800]   Sixteen ninety five.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.560]   And that's Tad Gear dot com is the website.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.160]   Tad G E R dot com.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   That's correct.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.520]   And they have this this I come pouch.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:17.320]   It is it's made it's it's military spec quality in terms of how it looks.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.000]   And it will it will velcro on to just about any camera bag or vest and they make some
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.840]   great backpacks that it goes on.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:27.880]   It's it's perfectly sized for the iPhone.
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:33.920]   It has a little top flap that lets you bring your headphone wires out so that you can keep
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.120]   the phone in the case while you're on it.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.120]   But it's not a feat.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.720]   It looks like you're it's very paramilitary.
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.120]   Well that's what I'm saying if you're you know if you want one of the chic thirty nine
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:45.200]   dollar cases at the Apple Store go for it.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.600]   But if you're you're a little edgy and you want something that will do a good job of holding
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.520]   the phone and protecting it.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.800]   That is my pick of the week for six ninety five.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:56.720]   This would look good on your thousand dollar vest.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.720]   It does.
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.880]   I just need I just need fifty two of these for each one of my own.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.800]   It's got us this amazing vest not made of iPhones although he does have that also but
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:10.400]   it's a it's a custom made kind of like photographers vests camo cock.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.400]   It looks awesome.
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:15.480]   It's so cool and this this would go with their parachute material.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.480]   Oh wow.
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:17.480]   This would go with it so nicely.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480]   It would.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:22.400]   In fact they even have the they have the desert camo or the jungle camo.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.000]   Well I this place this is this time years in San Francisco.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.040]   It's right around the it's between the two buildings where the studio is.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.040]   I like this stuff.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.040]   Look at this pack.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:35.760]   Because I've been looking for it.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:40.440]   If you go if you go into this store you'll spend a thousand dollars.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.440]   Oh my gosh I can I can definitely see it.
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:45.360]   I've been looking for a hip diaper.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.560]   A hip diaper.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.120]   Yeah you know I think desert camo diaper bags that's so I'm not going to I'm not going
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.720]   to carry around that that flowery crap.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.960]   You know I was like I need like a like a medic bag or something like that.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.040]   You know so if you're in San Francisco and you just want a good time visit this store
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:06.280]   because I promise you there's no store you can buy camo gear and play robots all in the
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.280]   same store.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:13.000]   It's the elite class and adventure gear tag gear incorporated tag gear.com good that's
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.760]   neat and they have a bargain bin.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.160]   Yes they do and I like to point on the record 1695 is about the cheapest pick I've ever come
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.160]   up with.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:25.360]   Yeah I think I don't think we need to even go back in time to verify that I believe
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.240]   that's absolutely true.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.760]   Mr. McElope do you have a pick for us today?
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.960]   I do.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:39.200]   My pick is a website and it's negative Alex's because we'll actually save you money.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.200]   It is maxfanta.com.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:48.160]   I like the name and this was actually and I don't know I don't know if we want to get
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.400]   into this whole thing but oh why not we get in every other hole here.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:58.560]   Yeah when there was that whole controversy over I now I can't even remember what the heck
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.560]   it was.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560]   McElope.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.080]   Yeah McElope and all those other deals where they were bundling a bunch of applications
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.360]   together and some people were saying that the developers were getting ripped off and
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.560]   the people were saying well the developers chose to go into this.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.560]   That's right.
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.960]   And McElope is back by the way they're going to do another one in January.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:20.920]   Yeah well this is actually this is a collection of Mc developers who are all getting together
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:30.200]   of their own core and doing this and the savings you know all of the fees go right
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.840]   to the developers.
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.720]   So if you buy an application that's going to go back.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.560]   So this is kind of their response to McElope.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.560]   Yeah exactly.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.560]   But they have some good deals.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:45.640]   There's a set of applications that are available every day and they're 20% off and then if
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:50.520]   you go down to the bottom in the lower right hand corner there's an extended deals section
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:56.640]   and those are just coupons that you can enter for 10% off of applications that were previously
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.840]   featured.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:15:59.840]   And they've got some good applications.
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:02.600]   I mean we've got BB Edit and you're Jimbo and Mars Edit.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.600]   Mars Edit.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.600]   Yep.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.240]   And all good stuff.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.240]   That's really cool.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.280]   And I imagine they're going to add more over time.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.280]   Right.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.000]   That's a really great, really great.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.120]   MaxSanta.com or maxanadials.com I guess it goes to.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.120]   Right.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.520]   So very, very cool.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:21.560]   That's a great pick.
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:23.360]   Finally Alex Lindsey.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:31.200]   I have, so I have a pick that I kind of picked up as a just a, oh I didn't even know what
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.200]   it was.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:33.200]   It was just from Panic Software.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.200]   So Panic Software I just.
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.960]   Oh I know what you're going to say.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:36.960]   I just bought this too.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.960]   Go ahead.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:38.960]   That too?
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:40.680]   No I love Panic Software stuff.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:41.680]   No I have all the other stuff.
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.720]   I mean I use transmit all the time and I have and what I was doing is I was actually getting
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:50.000]   my re-downloading, I installed leopard and so I was re-downloading all the stuff and
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:56.520]   so I was downloading Dusttastic which I use when you feedback on quick times with Dusttastic.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:00.160]   And so I was downloading that and I was like, oh what is this statu and I downloaded it
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:01.680]   and it's pretty cool.
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:08.640]   So what happens with statu is you can have a bunch of, you can have different clocks,
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.560]   the date, calendars, possibly even mail.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.160]   I haven't tried the mail yet.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:14.160]   Your weather and everything else.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:18.480]   And what it does is it actually when it's on it actually puts it in a little strip that
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.840]   goes along the bottom of your desktop.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:25.320]   And one of the things that's important for me related to that is mostly that I deal with
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.600]   people all over the world.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:34.440]   So I need to kind of know what the time zone is and what the, when we're putting people
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.920]   that are on shows that are sitting in India and in Africa.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:37.920]   You're in Africa.
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:38.920]   And it's been working great at the same time.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.560]   I mean you're not working in regular time.
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:43.920]   Right and so having all of that stuff but I've always wanted to have kind of a heads up
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.720]   display that did that on my desktop.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.880]   And I love to put more stuff on my desktop actually.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.240]   This is like the beginning of what I'd like to see.
[01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:51.800]   But you know it's super cool.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.800]   And I think it's like 15 bucks.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.080]   I mean it's not, you know it's nothing that's, you know it's whatever.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.840]   How's it different from dashboard or Yahoo widgets?
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:17:59.840]   I mean what is the?
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.640]   Well, here's the deal is you're not hitting anything for it to come up.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.440]   So it literally is sitting over top of your, I mean it becomes part of, as soon as you
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.840]   close it you add a bunch of stuff.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:12.440]   You can add, you can add RSS feeds, you know the little headlines.
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.640]   You can add pieces from your calendar, so on so forth.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:17.360]   And it's sitting actually on your desktop.
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:20.480]   My thing is that there's a lot of that kind of heads up display.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.680]   I don't really want to hit the, I don't want to hit F12 and wait for it to pop up.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:28.120]   I really want it to just be sitting there so I can just kind of look down.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.920]   I don't keep a lot of stuff on my desktop.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:33.240]   So I just want to be able to look down and see that information.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:36.440]   So I've got like eight time zones and the temperature outside.
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.520]   And you know a bunch of, I'm sorry.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.520]   This is very cool.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:45.120]   It's one of those things, it's a slick little application that's just done well.
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.920]   I'd love to see, I'd love to have access to doing more, like you know putting more information
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:52.960]   on my desktop because there's a lot of things that are on the dashboard or widgets that
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.800]   pop up and I don't really want them, I really want them on the desktop.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.760]   I don't really want them on it because I don't use the desktop for lots of files.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:02.040]   I love to have kind of heads up displays that I can do.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.920]   And one of the things it does let you do in the preferences is play with the opacity
[01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:08.080]   and the color and everything else.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:12.880]   Why kind of, I just have a bare gray desktop so I can kind of have it just kind of fade
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880]   into it.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.760]   So I just look down, it's not something that grabs my eye all the time, but it just gives
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.200]   me the information that I'm looking for.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.960]   And it's just a fun little application.
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:24.000]   So you can of course download a little demo of it and you should definitely, you know
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   people should try it.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   It's really, it's cool.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.800]   You know the guys at Panicker, great.
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:31.080]   It's just solving little problems really, really well.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:35.840]   So I just spent 30 bucks on Candy Bar, which is their icon program.
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.080]   That's what I thought you were going to talk about.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:38.080]   Oh, Candy Bar is great.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.080]   I mean, I love that too.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:43.160]   I don't think they've made an application that I didn't like.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.880]   Everything I use, I use them all.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:52.600]   Panic software and statue, which you know, the Yahoo desktop just does not work with leopard.
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.920]   It's just funky.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:57.720]   And so I might have to turn to something else.
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.160]   Stat to might be the things.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.160]   Cool.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:01.160]   Panic.com.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.160]   That's our pick.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:08.440]   In addition, we've got a holiday deal for everybody who loves Scott Evestware.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:11.440]   This deal extends through Christmas.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:15.720]   If you want to get Scott Evest for a geek in your life, you get 20% off any Scott Evest
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.560]   item except for the twit items.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.560]   We have a separate deal for that.
[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:24.840]   I think that's the twit coupon code, but the Scott Evest, if any Scott Evest item, get
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:30.400]   20% off anything on the site if you use my name Leo in the coupon code.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:35.400]   So just buy what you want, put my name Leo in the coupon code and get 20% off.
[01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.880]   I love my Scott Evest.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:37.920]   Oh, everything I do.
[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:42.880]   I'm wearing Scott Evest pants shirt right now if they had underwear, I'd be wearing it.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:44.720]   If they had socks, I'd be wearing it.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.800]   When I went to Africa the last time, I used the one that I had and it was, you know, it's
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:50.800]   got like 40 pockets or whatever.
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.480]   And it was just, it was perfect.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.480]   Well, this also supports us.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.800]   This also supports us.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.720]   So we have, they've been very good.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.760]   They also make the stuff that we sell on ThinkGeek.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:04.720]   This doesn't apply to the ThinkGeek stuff, but they make the stuff that we sell on ThinkGeek
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.400]   and they're just a great manufacturer.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:08.240]   I'm very happy with it.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:14.560]   And boy, if you go to Scott Evest's website, Scott Evest.com, you'll see a ton of great
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:15.560]   stuff.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.040]   And this is good geek gifts.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:23.840]   Using it, my name Leo in the coupon code and you will get 20% off anything on their page,
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.520]   Scott Evest.com.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:29.560]   And we do thank them very much for supporting Twit.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.840]   He's been such a great supporter and is such a fan and just really glad that we can work
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.440]   together for this holiday promotion.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:40.320]   20% off code word Leo.
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:43.920]   And the reason we did Leo and not Twit is because this will also be for the radio show
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:44.920]   and so forth.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:48.920]   So we didn't want to use the word Twit because I think the radio show people might not have
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.920]   understood that.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.760]   It might have been puzzled.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.640]   Why do we call our, why do we have to say Twit?
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   I don't understand.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.200]   So Leo, hey, some great picks.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.200]   Everybody, thank you so much.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.400]   I think we've lost everybody.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:02.000]   Now it's just you and me, Alex.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   I'm here.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   McElope still here.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   Scott seems to have fallen off the face of the earth.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.480]   Will Harris could not keep his Skype alive.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.200]   Let me see if Scott is Scott gone.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.600]   Yeah, I think Scott, Scott disappeared.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:14.600]   He's using Linux.
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:15.800]   What do you expect if you use it?
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.480]   A fierrier operating system like.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   I thank everybody.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:23.560]   Now, next week's Mac break weekly is a little bit up in the air.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:26.080]   As is Twit, I'm going to be out of town through Tuesday.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.200]   Maybe we'll do a little bit late.
[01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:33.960]   I'm think what we would really like to do is do maybe something towards the end of the
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:37.240]   week, kind of a year in review and we're going to try to get everybody who's ever been
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.600]   on Mac break weekly this year.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.200]   So do a massive conference.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:46.800]   So we'll look for that and we'll, I'll keep you updated on Twitter or Jiku or on the web
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.400]   page, Twit.tv.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:50.760]   Thank you very much, Alex Lindsey.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:51.760]   Is it Pixelcore?
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:52.760]   Pixelcore.com.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.760]   It's core.tv or.com.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:59.400]   TV for the podcast.com for that great guild of artists.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.080]   What a wonderful holiday gift that would be.
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:04.240]   Alex isn't good about plugging himself, so I will.
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.240]   Pixelcore.com.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:09.640]   If you've got somebody in your family who wants to learn more about two in 3D graphics and
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:15.320]   production, audio and video production, I mean, this is the place Pixelcore.com, a membership
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.760]   there would be a great holiday gift.
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.840]   And the Macalope is at CNET.
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:22.680]   Do you have, is it Macalope.cNET.com?
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:25.000]   Blogs.cNET.com/Macalope.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.560]   Okay, that's close.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:28.560]   Blogs.cNET.com.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.400]   Don't go to that Macalope.com anymore.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:34.360]   No reason, no reason.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.600]   Nothing going on there.
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.600]   Go to blogs.cNET.com.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.320]   That's like keeping quiet.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.320]   Yes.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320]   Look for the hornet.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.920]   You're looking to get away.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.920]   Look, that's great.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:44.480]   It's a great blog if you don't want to do anything.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.560]   Just kind of sit there.
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:49.640]   Go to blogs.cNET.com/Macalope for the hornet ones.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:55.160]   Take on everything Apple and OS X and Mac and iPhone.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:24:01.360]   And of course, Scott Borne is the host of so many shows, including the iappelphoneshow.com.
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:04.200]   He also is going to do a Google phone show soon.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.600]   Watch for that.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:10.640]   GirlsGoneGeek.tv and podango.com.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.800]   And wherever he is, he's in Linux hell right now.
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.720]   Wherever he is, we wish him the best.
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:20.080]   And thanks to Will Harris too, who is here briefly, channelflip.com is his place on the
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.720]   web channel flip.com.
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:23.640]   I'm Leo Laport.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.640]   Let me see.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.640]   I have a checklist.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.640]   I mentioned Scott Evest.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.080]   I mentioned Merlin Mannerisms.
[01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.240]   I knew there was something else.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.920]   We have that great book of Merlin's Mannerisms.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.920]   It's a calendar.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.400]   We can offer it as a PDF.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:44.880]   So if you send me an email, Leo@leoville.com, with the word Merlin in the subject line, I
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:49.720]   will send you the PDF of Merlin's Mannerisms.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.200]   It's a calendar, a big book.
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.440]   You can also go to Lulu.com and have it printed for you.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.800]   That's fine too.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:03.080]   But Merlin's Mannerisms is a page a day calendar, which is so neat.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.720]   Put together by John Hoffman.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.320]   We really thank him for doing that.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:09.520]   And he's given me the PDF.
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:13.480]   And I would be glad to give it to you free as our holiday gift from Macbreak Weekly.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.360]   So all you have to do is send me an email, Leo@leoville.com.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:20.000]   Put the word Merlin all by itself in the subject line.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.480]   And I will just respond with a PDF.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.600]   It's 344K that you can print out yourself.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:29.520]   Or you can go to Lulu and search for Merlin's Mannerisms.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.040]   And you can have a printed version made for you.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.440]   Bound, spiral bound, and everything.
[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:37.920]   And thanks to John Hoffman of Kalamazoo, Michigan for putting that together for us.
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:44.200]   And thanks to Merlin Man for allowing us to use his name in vain.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.160]   Oh man, and we just missed.
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:50.600]   I just got an email from Dr. Tiki, Jeff McPherson, who was online.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:51.960]   We missed him.
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.000]   He was going to join us.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.480]   Well, Dr. Tiki, we'll have you on as part of our year end wrap up.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.480]   Thank you everybody.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.480]   Another Macbreak.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:00.480]   Miss Broke.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:10.480]   [MUSIC]
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:16.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
