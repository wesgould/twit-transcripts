[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Time for MacBreak Weekly.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   We're here to talk Apple Macintosh.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And sitting with me in the studio, Mr. Alex Lindsay of the Pixel Core.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   See you once again.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   It's good to be here.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Alex will be heading out of town next week to go to...
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   London.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   London.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   For work?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Yes.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   We're doing a shoot there.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   You will travel more than I realized.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Now that I'm coming into the office all the time, I see how much you travel.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   I never know.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   It's actually going to slow down because we're expecting.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So we're slowing down in June.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I shouldn't be traveling after that.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Good.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Having a baby is the only thing that ties Alex down briefly.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   I get in the summer.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   He also brought a toy, which we're going to take a look at a little later on.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   That's my pick.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So it looks like a magnet's on a chessboard, but we'll find out.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Also here from Baston area, Mr. Andy Inako of the Chicago Sun times and Celestial Waste of Ban with Hi Andy.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Hello Leo.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Hello.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Welcome.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And you are also traveling next week.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Yes.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Where are you going?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   I'm going to be headed to the mile plus 300 foot city of Boulder, Colorado next week for the conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   There it's like I'm doing like eight different panels that are open to the public.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So if you want to see me pretend to know what I'm talking about about third world debt and things that action supposed to know about.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   In addition, by all means, stop on by.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Good.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Looks for looks like fun.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   You're going to talk about Star Trek.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I've got I'm on like eight different panels and they are they range from stuff that is very, very interesting from, you know, how about the success of comic book movies like Watchmen and Batman.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   All the way to the future print publishing and what Twitter means and that sort of stuff.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Every year they put me on about seven to 10 panels and they go.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   They're in three different categories for me.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   The one the topics that I always talk about and I can basically go on a pilot and talk about the ones that are within my wheelhouse and they're interesting and I really have to focus on something really interested and I'm really, really keen on it.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   And then they're the two of three where it's like, wow, okay, so I'm on a panel about sex with a former nun and the co-creator of the real world program on MTV.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Wow.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I think I'll let these two ladies go first and then furiously be scribbling notes for the first 20.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   See what they say anyway. Yeah. And see if there's something that I could sort of, you know, to leap off.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   That was a that was really like one of my first panels my very first year there.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   So wow.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   It's there's a it's it's eight and ten, but it's a lot of fun.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Sounds.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Sounds really, really cool. Yeah.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I've been going for the past 10 years.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   It really is great.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Oh, I'd like to go to it.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Where is it again?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   University of Colorado Boulder.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   And like I said, it's all week long next week. Every every panel is open to open to the public. Roger Eber's going to be there. You can if you ever wanted to find out like what a former member that joined Chiefs of Staff speaks like there you go. You'll have three or four opportunities.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   They get people from all different professional disciplines. I mean, I've met three different astronauts at this conference.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Wow.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And I'm told to please stop bothering me. I'm trying to eat dinner son. We'll tell you all about space later.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Okay.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I love astronauts.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Hey, before we get into our stories of the week, I do want to mention our sponsor. Great.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Spots are go to meeting. These are the folks at Citrix and they want every Mac user to know that go to meeting.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Now is Mac compatible. He's always been Mac compatible for attending a meeting.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   You know, any computer can attend the meeting, but now you can host a meeting as well. And that's really cool. Go to go to meeting.com right now.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Go to meeting.com/macbreak. You could try it free free for 30 days. Put it on your Mac. Put it on your PC.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Once you've installed it, and by the way, this takes two minutes. Doesn't require any configuration of the router, any special tricks.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It's a hundred percent secure, 128 bit. You don't have to worry about that. But they're very smart.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   They figured out a way to make this happen using that traversal. You don't have to worry about any of this, you know, configuration stuff.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Two minutes to install. Now, if you're on a conference call, you just click the mouse. You can do it while you're talking.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You know, I mean, it doesn't take a lot of effort. It's going to start a meeting real quick.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And then say, "Hey, you know, I really want to show you this, whether it's a PowerPoint or a keynote presentation or a document,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   or maybe we should work together on this document." Or, "Can you, look, I've got the drawing right here. I'd love you to annotate it so I can better understand what you're thinking of."
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   You know, here's what you do. You tell your client or your colleague, go to go to meeting.com. Here's the meeting ID.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   They go there and boom, they're seeing your screen. So now they're seeing the document. And as I said, they could collaborate with you.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You could say, "Well, can you annotate this?" And you give them control. You could jointly share control. You can give them control.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I mean, it's just really incredible. There is one low monthly rate. Once you sign up, that makes it very affordable.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You don't have to count meetings. You can just use it anytime you feel like it. Easy to set up meetings ahead of time.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Right now it's free. So that's the best part. Just try it free. I want some Mac people to try it so we can get some feedback on how you're liking it.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   30-day free trial. Go to go to meeting.com/MacBreak. They've been developing this Mac version for quite some time.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   They wanted to get it just right. I think they have. I'd like to get your input. Go to meeting.com/MacBreak.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And thank them for their support of the MacBreak Weekly.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Now, as they say, the news.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So since we talked last, iPhone 3.0 software has been kind of banged on and played with. A lot of people have installed it.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   I guess you can install it on anything if you have a developer, if you're a Mac developer or a iPhone developer.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   So a lot of people are playing with it. Some interesting results people are getting. For instance, tethering is definitely in there.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   So as video apparently, we're seeing some screens that say video as a possibility.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And rumor has it that the new Skype application, which was released, was that today or yesterday?
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Today. Today.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Today.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   They say that it will, you can do calls on it over the 3G in version 3.0.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So the Skype application that sold or actually is given away in the iPhone store right now will only work with Wi-Fi.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It says the carrier, you know, whatever, doesn't want you to use 3G.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   But that makes sense because 3.0 is not really tied to any particular hardware vendor, right?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   So, I mean, wireless vendors. So they put it in, but then T-Mobile take or AT&T it take it right out.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Right.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I think that makes sense. I put it, I put it, people just played with it a little bit.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I called the Skype lady this morning and it worked.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Yeah, it is. It is really cool.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Also, you think about how, what a, the rumor has always been that, oh, well, the phone network still wants this to happen.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   But then you think about it and you realize that, well, you have an application that allows people to make phone calls on a telephone that they've already bought and paid for without using the wireless, the carrier's actual network.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And so they must be all over themselves saying, yes, please don't make calls on our network.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   We're, we have trouble enough getting people's tweets pushed out there.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Just, you know, it's also, it's also, it reminds their revenue.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   As a user, I don't really, I don't, I'm not going to change my settings.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I mean, I'm paying most because I want unlimited data, unlimited text messaging.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   You know, I'm not, I don't really think about my minutes that much because I never go over my minutes.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   I'm not going to really change my service. I mean, I guess some people will, but what I'm mostly concerned about is just making sure that I have all the data and text messaging and being able to have Skype on top of that is, is pretty interesting.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Yeah. I mean, it's going to, it's going to really help me out for international calling because I have a bunch of editors who are like in London and other countries.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And it's always, you always hate that, that, that moment where you're like, I need to, I need to, I can't get this person via email.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   I need to tell them that the column is up and they need to get it right now from a different address.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   It's going to really, I'm really going to pay $9 just to have a leave a 10 second voicemail. Oh, damn it.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Well, and especially I'm looking at, you know, being in London next week and being able to just simply, once I'm on a Wi-Fi network, just make phone calls, you know, and not have to have it with my laptop.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Literally, if I just have that Wi-Fi connection, I can simply on my hotel room pick up my iPhone and dial out.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   It's pretty cool.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Yeah. Can you, I haven't tried it for incoming calls yet. So it will take incoming calls via Skype if you sign up for that.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I haven't tried that yet, but I, from a phone, you mean, right from a phone? Yeah.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I'm assuming, I mean, I haven't tried that yet.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   You'd have to, you know, it has a place in your info where it says Skype credit, online number voicemail.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   So you have to sign up as always with Skype. You have to sign up for those extra things.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   In fact, if you click it, it says you have no Skype credit by credit, online number, your online number is not active by online number.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   So I think that all of those features, you know, it's just like a regular.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   It, frankly, looks just like Skype on the Mac. I mean, it doesn't look that different.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   You know, you, one thing you can do with 3G is chat. So it is a chat application that works with all your Skype contact.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I know a lot of people who actually use Skype just for chat or I shouldn't say that way.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I mean, they use Skype for phone calls, but they, that's their primary chat application, which I guess why not.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I mean, if you've got it running all the time, it's just like any other chat application.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It's nice. I mean, I think it's a big deal. A lot of complaints I've seen, a lot of complaints on Twitter.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   People say it crashes right away and it's not working right, but it worked fine for me right out of the box.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   You guys have the same experience? Yeah. It worked fine for me.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I think we know one thing which maybe some people don't, which is that you turn your iPhone off a lot.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   You know, you hold the top key and you shut the darn thing off.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I was doing it every day for a while. It's just a reboot and it sure makes a difference with programs that crash and so forth.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   In fact, you might be, might be a good idea if you haven't downloaded Skype yet or installed it to do that and install via iTunes.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   You might get better results. I have to say that I still have yet to download a single app on my iPhone.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Yeah, I have been. In fact, I didn't download Skype on my iPhone and haven't had the problems. They fixed that.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I think I just, you know, I realized it's scared. At some point in time, I was scared and then it just became a practice where I didn't even consider,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   like when I see a new application, I go up to iTunes and I download it and then I move it over to my phone.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Yeah. And it's something I don't think about that often.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Well, I'm still terribly annoyed. I mean, I still can't do a complete backup of my iPhone because there is, I've been through the process of elimination to try to find out what application is holding up the backup process.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   It'll get to a certain point and then just stop overnight, two days, three days. It'll just point stop.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   So now I'm really at the point where I'm going to have to find a day when I can do, I can focus on this problem and do without my iPhone for a little while and just wipe out every single application I have.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Back up every piece of data that I think that I have inside those apps and just keep rebuilding and re-adding apps time and time again because it is just getting pretty freaking annoying.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I haven't backed up my iPhone in like two months now.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Did you do the backup reset process?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Remember that when we first turn on the iPhone, it says, do you want to send log information to Apple?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Yeah. Yeah. That's a classic trick. We'd turn, supposedly you turn it off when you turn off the reporting.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   That's what's getting, that's what's slowing down the backup process. I'm pretty sure I did have that turned off.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I'm sure you're sure that's not the problem though because again, it'll get to a certain point and then stop.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   So I know that must be something, it's hitting a wall at one specific application when it's trying to back up its store or something like that.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And unfortunately because there's no real good application management features because there's really no good diagnostic information that's available to the users.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   As far as I'm able to tell, your only source, the only thing you can do is what I call a dad solution.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   My dad's solution, every problem was every time he's having a problem with his Windows machine was, oh, I just had to reform out the hard drive and reinstall Windows.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   What? What? Yeah, because the Windows were opening really slowly.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   I was like, yeah, or you could have called your son the tech expert who would probably have found a corrupted file.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   No, well, it's working fine.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Oh, no.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   You pulled those to the house.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   I'm working.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Let me just show everybody this.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   This is a really, you know, I don't know if you still need to do this trick, but it's a really great thing to know about.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   And I believe Andy, it could still be an issue for you because, you know, if there's a log, a big old log that's not getting sent by us, each application has its own log.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   You right click on your phone and you click and you click reset warnings and it in iTunes and you click reset warnings.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   And if you turn, if you've reset those warnings, the next time you sync, it's going to say, oh, would you like to have automatically send diagnostic information back to Apple?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And you say, no, no, I don't think that's the problem.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I'm definitely going to try it.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   And if it does work, I promise you, Leo, I won't acknowledge that your tip worked.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   I will simply pretend that I found a far more clever solution on my own that fix the problem.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Hey, that's what I do.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   [laughter]
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Haven't all of us been in one of those tech calls where, you know, you're so embarrassed that you go.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   They're just reading the, yeah, well, sir, I'm sorry, this is tech support.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   I do have to go through this list now.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Is the USB cable plug-in securely?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Yes, it's plug- Oh, yes, it's plug-in securely.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   It is.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   But I don't have time to keep any of this.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   I'll pop up later.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   They probably have.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   I would bet there's an acronym for that in the tech support world, you know.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   You know, I'm not going to be a tech tech tech tech tech fan.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   But I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I think it's a good idea to do that.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I'm trying to fix it.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I can't do it.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Once again, I'm so glad that this is why I own computers.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   It's not so I can write things and spend a contact with people
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   and have fun on the line.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   It's because I like doing diagnostic stuff.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   That's why I got into this business.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Me too.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   That in the mimosives.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   We all like the Skype thing.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Everybody should run out and get it.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   It's free.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   If you've got a Skype account, why not?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   I think that this is a really interesting between what we're seeing
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   with Skype and what we're seeing with Google Voice.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   It's really, I think that the whole phone thing has changed.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I'd hate to be the telcos at this point.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Just like, you know what?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   They're like the cable companies in this business.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   The cable companies are realizing that their only future is as an Internet service provider.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   They're really becoming the electric company.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   They're not what they've been fighting that.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   They're about to become a utility where you give me a connection to the Internet
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   and I'm going to use something.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Same thing with the phone companies.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Both, as I say, I've said many times, really rely on what they call premium services
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   to make their money.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Why else do you think Comcast is trying to sell you voice data and TV?
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   They want your bill to be.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   I remember when we were in the cable business back at Tech TV,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I got to talk to cable people a lot.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Many times when they were in their cups because we would go to these dinners.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   These drunk cable people would tell me things they probably wouldn't want to admit now.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   But among other things, really, in order to amortize the cost of acquiring
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   and wiring new cable customers, they need you to have $150 a month bill.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   They're going to do everything they can to get your bill up to $150 a month.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Otherwise, it's what happened to Charter, which is bankruptcy.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   I don't know how they do that anymore.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   When I moved into the new house and tried to sign up for just,
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   I just want a broadband cable, it took me, I'm serious, three phone calls
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   and a half an hour to convince the operators that it was possible for them
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   to not sell me a telephone package.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Of course, they knew that they could do that, but that's part of the script
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   that they're trying to follow.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   They have to get that extra $35.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   They pretended to...
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I kind of went into that arrogant mode where I'm saying, "Oh, my God, they don't understand how easy it is
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   to get on without a phone line."
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   I said, "No, they do understand.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   They just act dumb for long enough."
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I might say, "Well, I've got HBO for how many free months?"
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Okay, look, fine, just sign me up.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Just sign me up.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Just sign me up.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Sign me up.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Pardon it.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Then, of course, last week, they just cut us off.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   They just turned off our cable.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   We got some note on the front of the door.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   We thought it was some kind of whatever.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   They just turned off the cable.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   So everything was gone.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Did you not pay your bill?
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   No, no, we paid the bill.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   We got this thing that said, "They thought that our line was leaking."
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Your line was leaking?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   They told us our line was leaking.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   So they cut us off because we thought you were using so much bandwidth
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   that you must be sharing it with everybody on your street.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   I guess, because they--
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Leaking is their euphemism.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   So anyway, they came by and some guy, these guys spent 90 minutes
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   wandering around, and then they called back to the--
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   They got turned out--
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   It turned out--
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I'd like to show you something.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   You see that pile there?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   That pile right under your cable?
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   That's a pile of bits there.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   That's been leaking out.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Well, we don't know how long.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   It's all under the floor.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   You're going to have to rip up the floor, boys.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Now, you know, you're going to continue.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   So then it turns out that they called back and it turns out
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   they had the wrong house.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Oh, geez.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Somebody else was leaking cable.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Someone else was leaking cable.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It was the wrong house.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   So it was three days of not having it on, of course.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And then I complain about it on Twitter.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Copcast cares.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Yeah, Frank called you.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   He--
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   He twitted it up.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   We're getting our money back for the three days that we missed.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And so he actually did a pretty good job.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   But it was just like--
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Oh, you know--
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Now that everybody's on Twitter, how long before that?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I mean, they can't help everybody.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   The whole point was fix the squeaky wheel because these guys, you know, are making a lot of noise on Twitter.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   But now that everybody is there, how long Copcast cares are people like that continue to give this kind of
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   superior support to people who are on Twitter?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   Well, but I think that what's happening is that being on Twitter allows you to sort--
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It allows people to sort really quickly.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   One of the things, you know, we shoot a bunch of stuff for Salesforce.com
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   and they have a whole package that allows you to manage people--
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   They just launch this new package that allows you to manage your relationship with Twitter
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   so that you can actually see who's doing what and what they're asking for
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   and keep track of the job tickets.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Yeah, no, it's so--
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   That's really interesting.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Yeah, yeah, it just came out last week.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   And so that's actually where I was in New York shooting the video for it.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Wow.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And so you're actually able to-- so someone like Salesforce who wants to manage that relationship--
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So you see, when you're doing it in text and you're not calling them,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   and you want to know any of these things, it's much easier for them to manage,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   keep track of who it is and what they're saying and how they're saying it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Well, it's probably cheaper, isn't it?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   It's a lot cheaper, you know.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   So it's easier to keep track of those tickets.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   That's interesting.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   So maybe this is the future of Tech Support.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   So you just complain.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   I think they would love for you to complain directly to them via some good interface rather than--
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   Yes, that nobody can see--
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Rather than me complaining for a thousand people, but I can't--
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Whoopsies.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Well, it's good for everybody to remember.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   That's a real valuable way to kind of get better.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And it is worth complaining on Twitter about Comcast because--
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   They care.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   They care.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   I'm sorry I couldn't resist.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   But you know, I got to say I was amazed that anybody responded.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   You know, I mostly was just mad.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   And it was amazing that it was handled so quickly.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You didn't end up on curse bird, did you?
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   On what?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Cursebird.com is the site where people who use profanity on Twitter.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I don't use profanity on Twitter.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   I'm a clean Twitter error.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Give me a surprise how many people do.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   I know, my kids follow me on Twitter.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Oh, you can't?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   So then, yeah.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   So that definitely limits what I can do on Twitter.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   So Macworld Magazine is announced.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   They're going to be--
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Or be IDC.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I'm sorry, Macworld Magazine is not IDG.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   IDG is announced, first of all, it will no longer be Macworld Expo.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   It'll just be Macworld.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Because that's what everybody calls it.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   It's negative all.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   It's going to be in February.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Shoo.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Thank you.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   The CES conflict was a problem.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   Yes.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   So why else are you, you being-- Having a conference, CES or Macworld, right after Christmas break,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   ruins everybody's Christmas because every company that is presenting, every speaker who's getting ready,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   everybody who's doing all that, it has to literally-- you don't have a Christmas break.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   You have a-- we're prepping for Macworld.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And so now what you can do is-- February is a much more sane month to have a conference.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   9th through 13th of February.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   You're happy about it, too, Andy?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   And for exactly the same reasons that Alex said, I mean, I just only--
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Look, they're on the front page of Macworld's website.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   I only know it's you because it's your hat.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I saw your hat.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Did I kill Friday?
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   What happened?
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   No, I saw your hat go by.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   You're speaking on stage.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Oh, good.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   I'll keep watching.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Exactly.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Again, there's a Keno guy in Reno.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   He had a common-- you know, that was a very-- I don't care if the drinks are--
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   Here it comes.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   --or you can't water up down that path.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Okay, okay, there's a guy playing his iPhone.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Okay, there's people raising their hands for-- I don't know why.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   There's some guy-- oh, that's-- what's his name?
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Macworld guy.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   There's a lot of people taking a picture.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And there!
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   There, there's a Tania Naka right there!
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Immortality, alone on stage as he is in line.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   Whatever you'll be forever remembered.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   But that's a second point.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.680]   I mean, it's only when I saw this announcement that I think that thought that and realized
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.400]   that all my entire adult life I have never spent a Christmas and a New Year's where I
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.200]   was not prepping for a big trade show.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.040]   And if you're lucky, it's like it starts like on the 6th or the 7th and maybe you can relax
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.040]   a little bit.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.080]   But I have had times where it's like, I am at a New Year's party and it's New Year's
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.800]   day and I'm thinking, I got to be on a plane in 36 freaking hours.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.680]   And so it doesn't-- I don't think that it's not like the timing ever prevented me from
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:44.320]   going to Macworld, but I'm very, very glad that it's at a more rational time of the year.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.440]   Paul Kent's actually doing a great job of going around to people.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.560]   And in fact, he sent me an email and I owe you one, Paul, saying, I want to get together,
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.040]   have lunch and talk with you about the future of Macworld.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.080]   I think he's really trying to reach out to the community.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.080]   And I guess you have to.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:01.000]   I mean, if Apple's not going to be there, as we've said before, it's a community event.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.480]   And so you've got to get the community enlisted behind it.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.400]   This is a good first step, I think.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.280]   Again, Paul, you know, you can really-- not that the people who came along before Paul
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:15.440]   were not good at their jobs, but man, Paul, I have nothing to expect for him.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.960]   I've seen a new vibe, a new interest.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.480]   How long has he been doing it?
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:23.080]   I think he's-- I'm guessing three four years.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:30.440]   He was like the defacto czar of Macworld for a while before being the actual czar of
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.000]   Macworld.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.320]   But it seems like every time I have a conversation with him and he either mentions a good idea
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.640]   and talks about it with me or I say, hey, this is a really good idea.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.080]   I really like this.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.920]   It either becomes enhanced or encouraged or it's something that always translates into
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.880]   a really good solid show for the next year.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.840]   So I mean, if--
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.000]   You have the sense that he really gets it.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Good.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.480]   I mean, we've all been on the sort of shows where it's like, congratulations.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.720]   Thanks for signing up for eight hours worth of free talks.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.000]   Here's your zag nut bar.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.880]   But you have me on a panel at the same time that I'm giving a 90 minute speech.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.080]   We figure that you can probably give your talk at the panel and then go and give your
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.080]   other talk.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.320]   Well, you know, I could.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.280]   No, he's done a great job, really.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.280]   It's great.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.280]   Looks like--
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.160]   Too bad Scott Borne, by the way, Scott Borne is not here because his web hosting company
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.440]   was brought down by DNS attacks.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.120]   And so he's busy rebuilding his blogs.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:33.680]   It wasn't attacking at him, it was the whole company, which was weird.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.440]   But he would be very gratified to see more and more rumors about the iPhone hardware coming
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.680]   out in June, including one analyst, you know, take it--
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   Because he's an analyst.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   They know everything.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.480]   They are on the inside--
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:48.480]   --track.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.280]   They're making crap up.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:56.080]   Daniel Amir, a Lazard capital markets analyst said in his report that he expects Apple to
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.600]   begin production on a high-end iPhone with 32 gigabytes of flash memory and a low-end
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.840]   3G version this spring doesn't say why.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.840]   I've also heard that it contains a laser razor.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.480]   Laser, razor.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.800]   It's actually going to be a new application with a--
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.640]   They're going to be using the tethering.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   So--
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.240]   Yeah, that'd be kind of cool.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.240]   I know, actually, that's how it--
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.680]   You know, I don't know where they get this stuff.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.720]   One thing is I guess it's coming from the fact that Apple's been buying flash memory
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720]   like crazy.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.040]   I do that all the time.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.360]   I think they must be-- because of the iPod, as well as the iPhone--
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.280]   Yeah, they've got to be one of the biggest purchasers of NAND flash memory.
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.600]   So I don't think that's necessarily indicating anything.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.400]   But I do think we will see one in June.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.480]   I don't know what it-- and it makes sense it would be a 32 gigabyte.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.920]   Love to see a cheap iPhone.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.720]   That would really seal a deal.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.280]   What would you take out to make a cheap iPhone?
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   I don't really know.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.760]   You take out the GPS.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:57.760]   You take out--
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.640]   You don't really need the GPS.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.080]   Oh, you could probably make it a smaller screen.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:10.840]   If Apple is going to-- again, we have to make sure we label this as a guess.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.840]   Because we know that we hope that they're working on a larger version, a larger version
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.040]   of a tablet, a larger version of the iPhone OS that works with a larger tablet machine.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.000]   But part of that would have to be that big break with the developer community that's
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.160]   saying, you can no longer count on an iPhone screen being exactly this size.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.960]   You have to either prepare a special build for this device, or you have to simply make
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.920]   a fluid interface that will work in whatever size screen.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:38.000]   Once they do that, then that does open the door to saying, you know what?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.440]   We are going to make a nano-sized iPhone that does run a special set of nano apps.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:49.840]   Me, the person who writes OmniFocus, can make an OmniFocus version that works on the iPhone
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.000]   nano with a subset of features, of course, but it would still work.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.760]   I really do think that if they do a cheaper iPhone, they can't just make last year's iPhone
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.640]   and take not 50 bucks off the price.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.240]   They still have to give people reasons to keep wanting the new hardware.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.960]   If they're basically saying, we'll still let you always buy whatever was two years old,
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.920]   four years old and features at a much, much more impressive price, I think they're going
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.480]   to lose a lot of the repeat customers.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.520]   Do we think that, I mean, does it, it just seems like if you made it any smaller, it would
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:26.880]   start to wreak havoc on people being able to format their video, format the, you know,
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.280]   how you're, you know, the applications.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.680]   I mean, it's, it just seems like changing that would add a lot, especially if you added
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   one that was larger.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:37.360]   If they happen to do a tablet, it just seems like a lot of different formats.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:38.880]   I wouldn't say so.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.440]   If you do, the, the Nano works pretty great.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:45.120]   As a device for watching video, you hold it in your hand and you know that it's a smaller
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.120]   screen.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.240]   So you know that you're not going to see Wally and high def, but you can still watch it perfectly
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.240]   fine.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:55.960]   Also that scroll, scroll, the, the thumb pad plus one click interface works pretty well
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.480]   the way that they, the, all the different iPod apps that I've seen that, that use that
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.360]   simple roll through a list, click on what you see what you want works rather well.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.560]   It's not a text intensive interface, but you can do a lot with just that interface.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.520]   I would be very, very surprised if I saw a, let's say a $99 iPhone with a conventional
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.680]   touch interface that would find a way of adapting the scroll wheel and add up maybe just add
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.320]   a touch pad for, for dialing on top of it.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   Right.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.280]   No, I can see to, to be agree that we're hoping for a $99 iPhone.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.400]   I think that that's actually what Apple's probably hoping for.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.200]   That seems to be the number that they would have to hit to make it worth their wealth,
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   but cheap iPhone.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.520]   I think it's just a matter of, I mean, every phone goes through this.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.520]   iPhone's been out.
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.960]   This will be its third iteration.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.960]   It's time for a cheap iPhone.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:46.360]   That's what I'm wondering is what do you, how, but maybe Apple doesn't care if it's
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.800]   cheaper than, you know, for them to make.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.640]   That's true to, I mean, they don't want to cannibalize.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.640]   Well, they could.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.640]   I mean, that's what happened to the razor.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.960]   They didn't give, make a cheap razor.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.760]   They just cost less.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.040]   I just think, I think it's more likely that they would, I think it's more likely they
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.320]   focus on a larger one than a smaller one.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.240]   Well, they might do both.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   Maybe.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.920]   I mean, I can see the reason that, you know, it continues to suck the oxygen out of the
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.520]   system if you have, this is the same thing they did with the iPod, which is that you
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:17.360]   have a wide range, everything from 50 or $60 to all the way up to whatever the highest
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.000]   end iPod is.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.160]   It doesn't leave a lot of places for other people to insert products.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:28.280]   Well of course, Apple has been, Apple's kind of been a contrarian.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.640]   And even in this bad economy, hasn't really done much to lower prices.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.440]   The price of the many.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.400]   It hasn't been really hurting them.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.920]   Well, we don't know yet.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   We don't know yet.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.400]   Microsoft's going after Apple.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.760]   Have you seen the latest Microsoft ad?
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.000]   I'm just not cool enough to own an Apple.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.160]   It turns out it's an actress.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.840]   They send an actress out.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.280]   She's supposed to be a real person saying, what do you want in a computer, Lauren?
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.560]   And she says, I want a 17 inch display for $1,000.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.600]   And then the Microsoft shill says, if you could find it, we could pay for it.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.880]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.800]   So she goes, first she goes to the Apple store.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.640]   Now sharp eyes have noticed that as she goes into the Apple store, there's a guy in
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.840]   plaid pants walking by.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.760]   And the same guy still walking by as she comes out of the Apple store, which kind of
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   applies.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.280]   She didn't spend a lot of time in the Apple store.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:23.760]   But I guess she already knew that she wasn't going to find a 17 inch computer for under
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   $1,000 there.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.920]   I'm going to the bright side.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:27.920]   Maybe she has a stalker.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.920]   Oh, maybe that guy just keeps walking back and forth back and forth.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:31.920]   Back and forth.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.440]   He also feels as if he's too cool.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.880]   He's not cool enough to own an app, Apple, but he wants to be part of the scene anyway.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.520]   That's the funniest part because she gets in the car, starts driving around.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.040]   She's looking for a Best Buyer.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.720]   Maybe I hope she's not looking for a circuit city.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.280]   She's looking for something.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:50.920]   And that would be funny if they said, let's find the windows store.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   Hmm.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.080]   I guess there really isn't a windows store.
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:58.400]   There used to be a window store, you know, and wouldn't anyone go.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.600]   There was a metric on remember.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.160]   It's a horrible is on the third floor.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   There's all boxes.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   Right.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.040]   The metric on is like where stores go to die.
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   Sony store is still there.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.040]   Nope.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   That's dead.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.040]   The game store is still there.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.920]   But the, I think the game store is still there, but the Sony style store is created by Sony.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.340]   I know when you close your own store in your own building, it's like a mall downtown,
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.320]   San Francisco, kind of like a high tech.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.080]   They were going to have it was going to like be virtual reality and stuff.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.040]   It just turned it over regular mall with a movie theater and food court.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.000]   The movie theater makes more money than any other lows in the country.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Really?
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.720]   The movie theater is very successful.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.800]   Everything else is not so good.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   Good noodles there.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.600]   Successful noodle place and free wifi free wifi, which we can't claim here.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.800]   Apparently I know it's working.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.800]   Is it working?
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   I'm back online.
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   I sat on it.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:45.800]   I beat it a little bit.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   Beat it.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   I didn't beat it.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   I was not my, you know, wifi.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   I beat on it.
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:54.960]   So anyway, so finally she's she's saying, well, I guess I'm just not cool enough to own
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   an apple.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.960]   I mean, it's really too bad because Microsoft has a lot of, you know, I mean, I mean, I
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.440]   makeers of Windows machines have a lot of really good arguments to make against the
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.440]   Mac.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   Exactly.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440]   And the cost is one of them.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.640]   And if they just simply, right, right, right now I've got my, my Dell mini in front
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:15.160]   of me, even as, you know, a Windows XP notebook, the fact you can buy something like this for
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:17.880]   250 less than 300 bucks.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.120]   That's what they should be beating apple over the head with.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:25.080]   Yes, it's, you know, it sounds like I'm being sarcastic here, but I think the greatest,
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:29.520]   the greatest Microsoft marketing slogan could be not the best, but damn it, it's good
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.520]   enough.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:34.800]   And well, that's kind of what that ad said, I think we guarantee you that if you walk
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:39.240]   into our store with a thousand dollar bill, you'll get a $500 bill back and send several
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:46.560]   $35 bills and chains, you know, she bought something that she found a $699 HP, a 17 inch
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:52.360]   and probably looks like, well, it's, you know, seven pounds and it's got an AMD kind of
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.440]   turi on doesn't have the fastest chip in the world.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:57.720]   And of course not for 700 bucks is not going to right to be a super nice, but it's going
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.000]   to run Excel very fast.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.840]   It's going to run configur very fast.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.640]   You should be very happy.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.880]   You've you just bought a configur machine.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.640]   Now as Mac users, let's not be smug.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.640]   Let's not be smug.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:16.400]   But April 1st, a lot of Windows users on Wednesday are going to be tomorrow happy.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.040]   It can be very well there.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.920]   They're all worried right now.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.920]   What you see if you go on any of the sites is what to do about configur.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   What's going to happen?
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.000]   A semantic on their antivirus sites says, don't worry.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.880]   All it's going to do is make itself harder to find and remove.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.800]   Done and done, done and done.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.760]   I'm just going to dig itself in.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.120]   It's just going to, well, I guess what they're saying is it's not going to erase your hard
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.120]   drive.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:44.600]   It's just going to make itself a better piece of stuff.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:49.440]   It's just going to make it easier for porn and illegal ATM card numbers to transact its
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.640]   way back to Russia.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.200]   Oh, geez.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.360]   I mean, remember, remember folks, if they're making, if they're making money off of your
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.760]   credit card numbers, they're not making money selling nuclear weapons to terrorists.
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.120]   So you know what?
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.360]   Everyone has to do their part to make this world a safer place.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.520]   And our kids win too.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.320]   It's a good thing.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.320]   Good thing.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   Why do you hate children?
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.480]   I love children.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.960]   Keep configuring your system.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.000]   Don't worry about those barnacles on your back.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.960]   They're just going to dig in and disappear eventually.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:26.280]   So the guy who did the pwned-own exploit, you know, which really, I mean, frankly,
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:36.320]   we shouldn't be too cocky because this guy was able to create a nasty virus, safari
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.720]   virus that immediately took over a Mac.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.600]   By the way, Firefox has fixed that vulnerability in Firefox.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.320]   I don't know if Apple has or not.
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:53.680]   But he, the guy who did it said, Hey, I still think the Mac is more secure than Windows.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.480]   I think he just wanted to win that Mac book here.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:03.280]   And also what doesn't get reported a lot is that it's not that random people walked in
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.600]   and were given access to this and got it in 10 seconds.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.920]   We're talking about it's like it's almost like a beauty pageant.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.160]   They planned these things up.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:12.840]   Well, it's not it's not it's not when he's called a setup.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.640]   It sounds like it's something that's been rigged.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.760]   It means that people, these exploits are known for quite a while.
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.280]   People know that this is coming up on their schedule and they said, you know what?
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:24.600]   I've just found a really great trick that will get me in there in 10 seconds.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.720]   It'll take me days to figure it out and get out the make it work.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.840]   But when I get there, I will have a flash drive that will have this exploit ready to
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   go.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:36.080]   So it is important that they're finding these bugs and they're airing these out to the public.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.640]   But it doesn't mean that any random person with 10 seconds worth of access to your network
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.600]   could suddenly own your own your machine.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:46.640]   Well, it just reminds us that those exploits are there.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   They exist.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.640]   Right.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.000]   I mean, a lot of it is just the fact that people forget that this isn't like this isn't Matthew
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.680]   Broderick and is 14 years old in his basement just playing around with computers.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:02.600]   These are really heavily financed crime syndicates that have a really good economic motive to
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:05.720]   create these exploits and create these systems.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:10.160]   And so if there isn't a really good financial incentive to beating up a certain operating
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.480]   system, then that operating system is pretty safe.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.840]   It's hard to make a model for exploiting a Mac machine.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:21.120]   It's really easy to make a model for the profitability of exploiting a Windows machine.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.120]   Right.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.760]   Tom's hardware has the interview.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.680]   It's a very good interview with Charlie Miller, the guy who won Pwn 2 Own.
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.080]   He worked by the way at the NSA.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:38.720]   So he was five years at the NSA, he has a degree in math.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.280]   He was the first to hack the iPhone.
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:45.480]   He's at a company called Independent Security Evaluators.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.240]   So this guy, I mean this guy's, you know, no slouch.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.160]   He knows what he's doing, right?
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:52.160]   No slouch.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   He says, I spent a lot of them in research time on Mac's because I like them and because
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.520]   they happen to be pretty easy to break.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.840]   Oh, that's not what we want to hear.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.200]   Is it Mac users?
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   No.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.160]   Do read the article though, because they talk a little bit about what you were saying, Andy,
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   about exactly how it works and how the setup is and so forth.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:21.800]   And he says, you're at the mercy of your hardware manufacturer, you know, and or, you
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.360]   know, your operating system manufacturer.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.560]   And so, but he says he'd prefer, he'd prefer to have a Mac, but he does talk a little bit
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.520]   about ways to protect yourself as well.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:35.880]   So it's a good, it's a good, very, very interesting article actually.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:36.880]   Let's see.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.040]   What else before we get to our picks of the week?
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.520]   Sounds like pigs in space.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:53.000]   Are there any other big stories that you would like to talk about kids?
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.880]   Ask in the chat room.
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.920]   Anything, anything at all.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.840]   There was a, oh, I should mention there was an update.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.080]   Apple pushed out a pretty big update for iLife and iWork.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.320]   As usual, pretty scant information about it.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.120]   Although, so we fix some things and then make good things more stable and yeah.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.520]   But, but, you know, recommend, I think there were some security fixes as well.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.280]   Do we think we're going to see, do we think Snow leopards going to come at WWDC?
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:20.280]   By the way, WWDC was announced.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.280]   Oh, that's an other story.
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.280]   Yes, it's going to be in June.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   I got the invite.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.000]   Yeah, I think that's an interesting thing.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   They moved it up.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.120]   It's earlier than it usually is, right?
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.520]   Just a little bit, but maybe by a week.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:35.280]   Well, it can be as late as August, I think.
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.920]   I haven't seen it after June for a long time.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:39.920]   Okay.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   And the typical.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:48.640]   Do you think it's significant that WWDC is happening roughly when it's been said that
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.480]   Steve Jobs is coming back from Apple and usually at the usual timeframe for announcing new
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.480]   iPhone hardware?
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.800]   Oh, yeah, that's interesting.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.640]   I think it's highly likely we're going to see.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.400]   Would Steve walk on the stage with a new iPhone?
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.840]   Boy, that would be a nice feeling.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.040]   I think that I think that I hope it's not going to be a new iPhone.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.200]   I'm hoping it's going to be a tablet that runs the iPhone operating system.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.760]   Not a Mac tablet, not a Mac tablet, but a iPhone.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.400]   What an incredible way to come back.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.600]   I mean, if you're fantasizing, all we need now is a Beatles iPod.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.080]   Yeah, we're done.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.080]   The yellow submarine.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.080]   We can just stop doing this.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:21.120]   So I think if they're going to release something at WWDC, I think that they'll roll out Snow
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.320]   Leopard a couple of weeks earlier than that so that it's not so that the only thing they
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.960]   have to worry about is their new product release.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:34.600]   Boy, that would be so great to announce a tablet, a tablet, a iPhone, and for Steve
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.600]   to do it, to do it.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.280]   You know, start with Phil Schiller.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.720]   Start with Phil Schiller and then Phil says, Oh, and one more thing.
[00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:48.800]   And Steve comes out and shows something on a zip on a zip line above the crowd.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.880]   And then he does he does a backhand spring.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.320]   I'm getting I'm getting teary teary eyes here.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.280]   That would be just a wonderful moment.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.440]   He'll be just like the end of the wrestler.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.240]   Yeah, Mickey Rourke just saying I'm where I belong.
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.640]   Yeah, I make a killed in the ring tonight, but he's having a heart attack.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.640]   Doesn't matter.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   He's getting up on those ropes.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.640]   He's up on that guy.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.600]   I try to kill him one last time.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.120]   It was a touching moment.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:11.440]   Oh, yeah, I forgot.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.040]   He also he dumps his girlfriend as well.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.920]   No, man, because he has to be who he has to be, man.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:20.800]   That's why he dumps Mercedes rule.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.640]   Yeah, he dumps he dumps.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.240]   No, it's a Merced to me sorry.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.440]   Sorry about that.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:30.800]   Dumps the gorgeous Merced to me has a heart attack and the ring knows he's pretty much
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.080]   going to kill himself.
[00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:34.080]   Gets up on the have you seen the movie?
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.080]   I have not.
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.080]   It's fine.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:37.080]   It's fine.
[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   I don't care.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.640]   It's a spoiler alert.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.520]   So no, do we do do we?
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.960]   Is there really controversy going around with Mac Heist?
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.480]   No, what's the controversy?
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.480]   Kind of over now.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:51.760]   People are still writing and people, you know, some software developers complain that these
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.240]   these folks are selling off their stuff really cheap.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.120]   Well, so well, if they're choice, they're grown ups and evidently it's a cash cow.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.720]   And for charity, I mean, you know what?
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   For charity and for.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:03.280]   I have to give them a little bit.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.440]   And everybody's happy about it.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.280]   I have to give them a little props because these guys are.
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.320]   I mean, it's not just because I like Lisa Bettany.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.160]   These guys are.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:18.720]   So it is a factor then.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.840]   I admit there's a little slight conflict of interest.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.040]   I like Lisa Veronica and Chris Perilla.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.560]   They have sold $29,792 of these at $39.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.120]   They have raised $277,000 for charity.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.520]   I mean, how can you complain about this?
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.640]   Now I'm not actually I'm not buying it because all the things on here I already own.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:46.440]   World of Goo.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.920]   That's worth 39 bucks alone, although it's only 20 bucks.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.240]   iPhone view, I own that.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.240]   I love it.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240]   Acorn.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   We've talked about that before.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.040]   That's a $50 program you're getting for 39 bucks.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.120]   Wire tap studio.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:01.320]   That's a great it's a great value.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.160]   I mean, at this point, it's a very good value.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:06.240]   If they get to they sell more, they're going to unlock.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.360]   They have a couple more things to unlock, including espresso, which I am loving.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:11.120]   I'll talk about that a little later.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.200]   And Boink's TV.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   But it's.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.200]   Boink's TV is a very expensive app.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:17.360]   Well, but this is an ad supported version.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.000]   So you're not getting the full version.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.360]   In fact, that's the thing I would carefully check on this to make sure that these aren't
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   time limited.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.200]   And sometimes it's been the case in the past that you didn't have upgrade rights or there
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.320]   were some small restrictions on it.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:38.160]   But I still think if you want two or three of these, even if you just want acorn, it's
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.160]   a deal.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   Right.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.960]   So I've purchased the two previous Mac heist applications.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.080]   It's just by now, I own all the stuff that I want.
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.200]   But I think no, and I don't think there's any controversy anymore.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.360]   Oh, yeah, I said there's some developers that are people.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:53.360]   Well, they may be.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.360]   They shouldn't be.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:55.920]   If you don't think if you don't like it, don't sell it.
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.400]   They give 10 bucks every sale.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.040]   They give 10 bucks a charity.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.040]   Right.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:06.320]   And they figured out how to defuse any possible complaints.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.640]   The developers are getting just a cut of it.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.640]   They're not getting a flat fee.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.640]   They don't get their full amount, right?
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.680]   But they're getting it, but they're getting a percentage of the sales, not just a flat.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.000]   That was the one complaint that was all right.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.920]   Leveled at the first one is they were getting paid a certain amount up front.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.920]   But that was all they were going to get.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.200]   And the guys made out really well the first time because it was very successful.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:27.160]   The second time around, by the second time and this time they, you know, they're just
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:29.840]   getting a percentage, a certain percentage of the income.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.920]   I mean, I think it's a great money maker for the guys running it.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:35.680]   It's a good money maker from the software company I've talked to, has said it's a good
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:36.680]   money maker for them.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.720]   And it's a great money maker for the big winner is, of course, charity.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:44.000]   I think we can, I think we could say at this point that these guys are brilliant marketers.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.880]   They've done a lot of good for the partners and there's no, and for charity and there's
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.840]   no reason you're getting, you're getting what you're paying for and then some.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.800]   I think this is actually quite inspired.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.280]   Developers, you know, look, it's, it's hard to make money on, on shareware software out
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.000]   there without getting your name out somehow.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Right.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.640]   So I think the next time you're going to see a lot of developers, maybe even people who
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.720]   are complaining say, Mm hmm.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:08.720]   This isn't such a bad thing.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.160]   Well, you know, if someone had come to, if someone had come and talked to us, we would
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.320]   have put some of our stuff in there.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.600]   The one thing I'm thinking I don't have that I would like is I don't have any good cooking
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.600]   software.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.080]   Has anybody played with Sous Chef?
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.920]   Is that, is that worth?
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.240]   That's a $30 program from a Kesha tree software.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.040]   You're a digital cooking assistant.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.600]   I don't know.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.120]   I have all the other things that I want.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.960]   So what's picturesque?
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.720]   I don't know that one.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.200]   Makes images gorgeous.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:38.320]   I have iPhone view, little snapper.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   I have it.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.320]   That's a good thing.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.320]   I think I have, I think I have over half of them.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.320]   Me too.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.920]   We've recommended a lot of these.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:49.000]   It's a good, it's a good grouping.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   All right.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:50.720]   We're going to take a break.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.720]   I don't, you know, I'm a bad.
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.600]   I probably have, I have like 18 commercials I need to do here.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.000]   I forgot the look.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.400]   I'm a bad, bad man.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.240]   Oh no, we're good.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.320]   Audible.com.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:10.760]   So before we do our software picks or hardware picks of the week, Andy, Alex and I, we will
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.040]   mention our friends at audible.com.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:18.560]   That's the place where you get audio books at amazing, amazing selection of some of the
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.560]   best books ever.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.680]   I just finished Electric Universe.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:27.200]   So inspiring, so interesting, the story of electricity, which really now I have to think
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.840]   more than the internet, more than the microprocessor, really the discovery of electricity, which
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:37.560]   is only about 150 years old, transforms everything because all of those other things
[00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.560]   rely on it.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.880]   Electric Universe is a great book.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:42.960]   Just finished that.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.120]   Now I got a lot of choices.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.280]   I don't know where I'm going to go.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.640]   I'm going to go next.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:47.880]   What are you, what are you listening to, Andy?
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:50.160]   You got anything that maybe I should take a look at?
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.160]   Yeah.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:55.280]   I've been just last night I bought Alex and me by Irene Pepperberg.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:03.320]   This is a really cool science book about this researcher who decided to see how much language
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.000]   she could teach an African-grade parrot.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.280]   Alex made a lot of headlines a couple of years ago when, I don't know whether her Institute
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.160]   just suddenly got a published or something.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:16.200]   But you're used to the, you're kind of used to the idea of parrots speaking in human
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:21.040]   voice, but you're not used to them doing is showing any evidence that they actually understand
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.640]   the language and that they can actually think.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.600]   But Pepperberg thought was that, well, normally all these language studies with non-human
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:32.120]   language studies are being done with primates and they teach them sign language and stuff
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.120]   like that.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:38.120]   We know that we have a piece of hardware here that is equipped for speech, aka a parrot.
[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:43.480]   What if we were to try to see if we could actually teach a parrot to actually speak normally?
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   And you see all these demos, if you go to YouTube and you do search for Alex and parrot,
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:53.600]   you'll find all these demo videos of not just simply Alex pick up the red key, but more
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:49:02.080]   let more like a, which one of the show them, which of they'll show them like six different
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.080]   blocks.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.440]   One of them is like actually a ball, not a block and they're all different colors.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.080]   And you ask the parrot, which one of these is different?
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:14.200]   And the parrot will say red, because it's the all rest.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:17.480]   And all these different demos where it's really hard to convince yourself that there
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:19.880]   isn't really active thinking going on.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:23.280]   Not only that, but that this parrot can not only understand the language, but understand
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.240]   proper use of the language.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:33.360]   There was a time when she was the parrot was introduced to new type of fruit that he had
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.360]   never been exposed to before.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.560]   And he built a new word that combined he was familiar with with bananas.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:45.240]   So he used to, it was a poor man toe word, combining the word banana, because it was
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.840]   something that was a fruit with a texture he understood and a color that he understood.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.280]   So it really looked as though he was quite on his way.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.080]   He was part of this research for about 20 years.
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.600]   Unfortunately, the parrot passed away last year at the age of 30, which is kind of young
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.360]   for an African great parrot.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:05.600]   But not only is it just to plan a great story, it is exactly the sort of science book that
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:11.200]   I love to listen to while I'm driving or even just reading it, because this is going to sound
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.480]   as arrogant as hell.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.720]   But you know, I am what I am.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:18.440]   I love these science books where as I'm listening to it, I'm saying, this person is an idiot.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.920]   Oh, he's, oh, for God's sake.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.960]   What kind of BS are they shoveling here?
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:29.360]   Because the idea of at what level of awareness can an animal use speech, that is controversial
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:32.360]   with people who even who know what they're doing, what they're talking about.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.360]   And of course, there's lots of discussion and debate about did Alex really understand
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.520]   the language or is this just really good, really complicated training conditioning that
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:46.560]   she knew that he knew what response was being expected and was trying to create the response
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:50.440]   that Irene actually wanted to produce.
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.480]   And of course, the thing that makes me look better is that, of course, as you start reading
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.200]   this book and start listening to it, you think, oh, come on, convince me that he's not just
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:02.240]   been trained to do a very complex animal act.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:04.320]   But as you go, it becomes harder and harder.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.160]   You stop wondering if this animal is really understanding what the language is, and you
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:14.840]   start wondering what would have been the potential of this animal to really comprehend the world
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.200]   around it.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:21.120]   It said that Alex, by the end, had the emotional maturity of a two-year-old child, which is
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:23.600]   actually fairly impressive for Bird.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.880]   On the negative side of the of the tote board, it took 20 years of training to give him the
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.320]   language skills and awareness.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.640]   Well, that's actually and that was like, because if it was if he'd learned it within
[00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.000]   like months, I would have really been depressed.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.480]   Well, well, I mean, it's just it just goes to show that it really forces you to sort of
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.080]   think about what is your relationship to under to to language?
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.120]   What is your relationship to other living beings on this planet?
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.120]   It's a cool science book.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.280]   It's a cool personal story.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:54.560]   It's just a cool book full full on and it is unabridged.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:52:00.120]   Again, for those of you like myself who like to know how much how much hours we're getting.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.400]   It's five hours and 39 minutes.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.640]   Very good for one credits work and you get the whole thing.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.920]   And it's really kind of amazing because a parrot reads the book, which I don't think
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.120]   anybody really would think a parrot could do.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.120]   No, the parrot.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.120]   Actually, every third sentence, one and that.
[00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:18.440]   Mark, the next time they get a gay war would be an offer me a crapper.
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:19.960]   I was going to kill her.
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.400]   Alex and me by Irene Pepperberg narrated by Julia Gibson.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.920]   You know, it's interesting because one of the things that's audible does is great.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.280]   They give you recommendations.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:32.480]   People who like this book also like, I don't know if this is accurate.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.840]   I think that the computer might have been a little confused here because people who like
[00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.640]   this also liked the pig who sang to the moon.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.000]   I don't think that's about a singing pig, but I could be wrong.
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.240]   And Portuguese irregular verbs.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.720]   I don't know exactly.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.440]   Well, if you're into languaging, you might find that parrots and Portuguese are very
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.440]   similar.
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.440]   It is.
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:55.120]   For that long six hour car trip, you just want to hear conjugations.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.120]   Maybe that's it.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:59.000]   Maybe that's just not the kind of conjugation I want people to speak.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.600]   Oh, it's actually it's not what I thought it was.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:06.400]   It's not about Portuguese irregular verbs.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.200]   It's a mystery.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.000]   Any event, this gives you an idea of the variety of books you can get from audible.com.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.480]   I just love Audible.

[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:39.640]   This just in from Gizmodo, Mitch has offered Lauren his 17 inch MacBook.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   If you saw the ad with we were just talking about the woman who's searching for a 17 inch
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.560]   computer for 699, she bought an HP pavilion.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:51.400]   Mitch actually Mitch Gerwitz of Michigan said, "I recently watched the new PC ad on television
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.920]   about Lauren purchasing a laptop for under $1,000.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:57.680]   It was a great advertisement targeting everyday PC users.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:03.240]   My only concern is I feel the computer Lauren in quotes, "chose will not provide an overall
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.480]   positive experience."
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:09.640]   I can't provide a positive experience for you like I can Lauren.
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.560]   Lauren, I'm asking for your assistance to help me locate Lauren.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.880]   I'm willing to give her my 17 inch Mac top for free.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.880]   I'm in love.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:20.760]   She's right and I'm sorry and I'm willing to make it good Lauren.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.760]   She does say and I like this.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.640]   I do believe everyone on this planet is quote cool enough to be a Mac person.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.960]   So they're looking.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.920]   Lauren Gizmodo is looking for you.
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.680]   She'll hook you up with Mitch.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.160]   That 17 inch is yours.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.840]   Of course, we've since learned that Lauren is an actress and really doesn't care about
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.640]   that notebook at all.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   There you go.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.240]   Mitch says, "I'll put my money where my mouth is."
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:49.760]   We got to say that one of our picks by the way is Scott has to be Skype for the iPhone.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.720]   That's a must down load but that's kind of a given.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:56.800]   So I am going to mention another pick.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.320]   Something you actually Andy would like this.
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.880]   It just came in my mail today.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:05.520]   This is from the website in your face.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:06.520]   Let's see.
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.880]   I have to give you the right URL.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.040]   I think it's in your face USA.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.680]   Yeah in your face USA dot com $30.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:19.720]   You know Andy, you've got your little suction cup on your gorilla pod so you can watch your
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:20.720]   iPhone.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:25.760]   It's like a clip that's designed to go on an airplane tray or anything else.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:30.120]   It has an iPod holder, an iPhone or iPod holder in it.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:37.000]   Now I can watch my movies on my iPod just like that right in your face as they say.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.400]   This is kind of a neat clip.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.200]   Hands free video viewing anywhere anytime.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.320]   You might have seen it at Macworld.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.680]   I did and I just got one.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.560]   I literally just came today and I kind of like it.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.560]   It's pretty cool.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:54.960]   I mean I can sit here and watch my iPhone movie while you guys talk on and on and on.
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:59.120]   You like that in your face USA dot com $30.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:02.560]   I've been looking for something like this for traveling for some time.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.800]   It also is resizable so it'll fit pretty much any.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.760]   You could probably use it with it soon.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.200]   It's not specific to the iPhone.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.400]   It's got a little spring loaded clip in here.
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.560]   So if I can just pry the phone out.
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:18.080]   It likes the phone a lot.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.080]   It likes it.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   What you don't want it to be lose.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:24.560]   And then there's some other little such which I kind of like is that this clamp pivots so
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:29.760]   that depending on the angle of what you're clipping on to it can give you a variety of
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.840]   clip faces which I think is a smart idea.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.680]   Very sturdy clip.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:37.320]   This is completely bendable.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.560]   Looks like it's coax cable.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.160]   It's got copper in it.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.160]   Very nice.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:46.320]   In your face USA dot com and this rotates so you can get any angle you want.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.320]   That's pretty.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.360]   I got my cell for keyboard.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:52.760]   Oh, that's a keyboard.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:54.840]   Oh, I'm so excited to see this.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:55.840]   I've read about this.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:01.480]   So this is the ergo decks DX one.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.840]   And I think it's a hundred and forty nine hundred sixty four dollars.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.920]   But it looks like you could put the keys anywhere.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.920]   Yes.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.920]   So look at this.
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.920]   So they're numbered here.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:10.400]   So I have these little numbers here.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.600]   And what I can do is I can actually.
[00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:13.600]   Are they magnetic?
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:15.000]   No, they're like sticky.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.400]   Oh, sticky.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.680]   So they stick onto.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:20.880]   So what it looks like just to describe it for people listening, it looks like a wackum
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:24.880]   tablet, maybe one of the larger wackum, the middle sized wackum tablet is like an eight
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.840]   but it's got keys by ten.
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   And then there are it looks like a loose keyboard keys.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:31.840]   And you can just move them around.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.280]   So like this one I have set up so that these are my five fingers or well this is for
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:39.680]   ergonomics, you can position it, move it over here to match your hand.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:44.840]   Now if you're an editor, if you're a gamer, if you are, you know, an artist where you
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.000]   want to have things in a certain way, you want to have them laid out, I've been thinking
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.960]   about running this into we were testing Boinks TV.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:54.240]   And I've been thinking about running this into like have all my editing stuff.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.840]   Oh, what a lay it out in the way that that works for me.
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:57.840]   Yeah.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.600]   To have all the cuts and everything else all set up.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.920]   I'm actually one of the things I've been playing with is actually taking my ambura and making
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.560]   like building the exact layout of my keys on my ambura.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.800]   So like I play it like an abira.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.520]   But they'll make it map the keystrokes to anything in the software.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.560]   So you run a program called keyjack and what keyjack will let you do is you you press the
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.000]   key and then you hit you tell keyjack and then you press the key you want it to map
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.240]   to but you could it could be key combinations too.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.520]   So it doesn't have to be just a single key.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.680]   So one key here can represent lots of keys and they come with little stickers that I don't
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:26.680]   have.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.560]   So you have like a control key thing as well and you can could you have two hands but you
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.560]   could have but you could have it.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.400]   You could have just be using one hand a lot.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.640]   I guess my dominant hand you know and actually I actually I built this one.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:40.440]   I tested this one with my right hand but I actually talked to them and they said most
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:43.600]   people will do it if you're right handed use their left hand because then it's just over
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.680]   here and you can be hitting using your mouse with your right hand.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.080]   You're not going to be typing letters with it.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:51.120]   What you're really doing is is setting up something that really works for your hand so
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.960]   that while you're doing other things with your mouse or whatever you can quickly hit
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   things that you need to hit.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.680]   I'll be really curious if this how this works out for you whether it's something that you
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.720]   end up using or not.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:05.600]   I think for as I said what I'm looking for a specialized uses like and I think we will
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.600]   use it for stuff like a boinks TV where I'm doing a switcher.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.840]   I don't really want to necessarily use that kind of control service.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.560]   I just want to have something but I want to lay it out in a way that makes the most sense
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:18.560]   so I can feel without looking down and kind of feel over it and just hit it.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.640]   Can I can I can I can I look at it?
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.800]   I don't want to I don't want to destroy it.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:25.160]   No have fun with it but it's but it's it's pretty heavy duty to feel.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:28.080]   I mean it feels like it's a it's a it's it's well made.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:29.800]   It's industrial strength.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.480]   And so each of the keys has a number on the bottom of it.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.040]   Right and that's how you map to the that's that's how you're mapping out.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.720]   And there are button what's this button in the upper right hand corner is that just like
[00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:41.520]   that's you know that's because then you have to hit that button to to map it.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.920]   So you say okay you hit the button that you want and then you hit that and then you hit
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:49.920]   and you could slide underneath a something that would it looks like you could slide something
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:51.920]   underneath that would say this is what these keys do.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.760]   You can lay it out and then put them in there.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.120]   And so what's nice about it is you can really adjust it to your workflow.
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.680]   Oh and they they push they have a yeah they have they're like a regular like a regular
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   key.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:08.240]   Huh so it's my biggest would be I was just gonna ask how how easy is it to dislodge those
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.880]   keys once you've set it up exactly the way you want them.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.760]   That's pretty hard they're on there on there on there.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:17.240]   But is it movable I mean can you I have it I haven't I've moved them I've moved them a
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:23.160]   couple times and they still seem to stick really really well and and I don't know how
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:29.280]   many times but it's pretty sticky and it seems to stay sticky and I'm it's some kind of space
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:34.920]   age nanotechnology from the great minds of 3m minnesota mining.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.920]   Yes minorous.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:41.200]   Yes I think it's nanotechnology I think it has a lot to do with chameleons.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.560]   It seems to me like that would be a cool thing for like mobile field use but you can't would
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.160]   you be would you be comfortable tossing that into a bag.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.160]   Oh no no knowing that when you get you know it does the technology works in such a way
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.520]   that if you wanted to just permanently epoxy these things down you could do that.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.040]   Yeah you absolutely absolutely could just just cut them down.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.000]   In fact I believe that this top piece is yeah it's removable.
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.160]   So I imagine so the little plastic thing that the keys are stuck to is removable.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.360]   So my assumption is is that I could even have a couple of these plastic you know a couple
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.000]   of the tops where I had different configurations.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.520]   Oh I have different tops.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.040]   You just swap the tops.
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.000]   So maybe the tops would be cheaper too because it's just piece of plastic.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.800]   Right right and I haven't tried to do that but but I I'm assuming because you can take
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:29.400]   that you shaped this kind of in a palm shape so it would just you could rest your hand
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.400]   on it.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:34.000]   But I could just put my hand down like this and I could just very comfortably you know
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.080]   move it up and have a couple different ways.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.800]   But obviously you know I'm gonna I'm still in the process of experimenting with it.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:43.520]   The negative of all these things is you have to retrain your brain.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.440]   You know we already know how to use a keyboard and you have to retrain your brain if you're
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.840]   willing to put the effort into it.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.840]   Well and I'm not looking at what I'm looking at is new applications like an editing software.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:52.840]   Like something else.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.280]   Where you don't have any preconceived notions and and I and I just want to hit a thing or
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.800]   there's just certain things that you do where it's a multiple keystroke kind of thing and
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.640]   you just want to have it sit in there sitting and hit it.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:09.200]   The biggest problem I'm worried about is that if I get used to it then I will have a hard
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   time using you can't go anywhere else.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.000]   You can't go back well that's always my my concern with any of these things but but I
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:19.640]   we've been really looking for some way to customize this stuff especially around live editing
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:23.080]   where you know we have to react very very quickly.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.720]   It's kind of a specialized use.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.280]   And we want to be able to do it like the control surface that you have sitting there right now.
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.480]   I use a control surface for switching but I often go back to the keyboard just because
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.720]   it's got more capability.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:37.440]   Well and the thing is is that is that what this is a good example of there are more keys
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.200]   on that on that control surface than what I would want.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.200]   I want them further apart.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:42.200]   I want them.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:45.360]   I want to be able to look not even look down and feel over and go oh that's the one I want.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.360]   You know that's the one because there's nothing else it could be.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   There's nothing else around it.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:51.360]   So I'd rather have something like this where I could design the layout.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.840]   That's a hundred and fifty bucks.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.840]   Well that's not bad.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:54.840]   That's surprising.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:55.840]   It's not a lot more expensive.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.400]   It's not very expensive.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.400]   Huh.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.400]   So it's and it's ergo decks.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.400]   Dot com.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.400]   Dot com.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.200]   Ergo decks.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.960]   The DX one.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.160]   I fiddle therefore I am.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.600]   That's what that means in Latin.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   Oh really?
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.600]   No.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.080]   I fooled you.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.080]   I was so impressed.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.160]   And this is the DX one.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.160]   There is a version.
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.960]   There's a little PC with a PC.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:20.960]   Yep.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.200]   In fact it's a little bit more integrated with a PC.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.520]   It's been out on the PC for a while.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:24.520]   So that's where they figured it out.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.680]   Well it looks like they have custom key tops you could put on.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.480]   No you can get stickers that have like for editing, gaming.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.480]   There's little stickers that'll go on top of those.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.320]   And they have blank ones that you can just draw on and stick them on there if you want
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.320]   to.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:37.320]   Ah.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.320]   Very cool.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:39.880]   Thank you Alex Lindsay.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.400]   Yes.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.040]   Thank you Andy and that car.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.520]   Thank you all for being here today.

[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:22.920]   You didn't do a pick yet?
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   It's good.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.760]   How could you not done a pick?
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.560]   Well I know all because I usually have the quick to go to a fight.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.880]   I got confused because you did the book pick and I thought that was your pick.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.680]   I am so stupid.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, don't tune out now.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.240]   You'll miss Andy's pick.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.240]   Okay.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.440]   Well now better be worth it.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.080]   So yeah so next week I am doing that really great conference and one of the cool things
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:49.760]   about it is that for 8 different times during the week I get to blather on for about 10
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.880]   minutes and that's not that it's great stuff but it's content at least and I do want to
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.120]   do a podcast of all the stuff that I'm talking about.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.600]   So I've been sort of assembling my gun belt of technology that I'll need to quietly be
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:07.600]   recording high quality stuff while I'm talking to 100 to 300 to 300 people.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.080]   And so I've been playing around with blue microphones.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:14.200]   Has this really awesome little microphone called the Snowball.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.880]   And now they have a version for video that they call the eyeball.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:20.920]   Now half of the feature is just how cool this is.
[01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.720]   This is the whole microphone.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:27.680]   It connects by USB and it's all set up and this is how you would basically carry it with
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.520]   you in your travel bag.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.960]   But once you get to where you're going you just simply put it on the desk in front of
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:37.560]   you, flip this out, turn it in front of you and now here is your microphone and microphone
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.920]   stand.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.040]   You can angle it to pretty much any way you want it.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.160]   I should also say that this is built out of metal.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:47.360]   This isn't just like cheap, cheap frickin plastic.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.960]   That's funny because I have one that's cheap frickin plastic.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.600]   So this is the updated snowflake.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   This is the updated.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   Well, again, it's a snowflake.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.480]   It's also the snow, the eyeball.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.480]   It's the snowflake.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.600]   Oh, yours is a camera.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.600]   Exactly.
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   Because once you're done, once you're done with, if you want to shoot video, you just
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.640]   click this thing on the side and a height.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.640]   Oops.
[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:08.640]   Something's going to pop out.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.640]   Watch this.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:15.440]   And a high definition video camera sticks out on the side there, which can shoot 720p video.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.440]   You're kidding.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:17.440]   720p.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.440]   Oh, man.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:23.880]   You do have to have like a MacBook, something with something with a small, at least an okay
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.360]   amount of processing oomph.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:30.200]   I've been using it like on a Mac mini just for testing and it really puts out way too
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.280]   much bandwidth for that little processor to handle.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.680]   But my MacBook handles it just fine.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.400]   So it's a big upgrade over your right side camera.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.440]   Is it Firewire or USB?
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.680]   It is USB 2.0.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.920]   But I also, again, I do want to keep talking.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.800]   I do want to keep talking about how well this is designed.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.560]   This is designed for traveling.
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:49.560]   So when you're done with it, you just fold it flat just like that.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.480]   But on top of everything else, this is not just like a built in hard base.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:58.920]   You can just remove this and now you have hooks that you can then just mount it on the
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:02.120]   top of your monitor, on the top of your notebook, on the top of everything else.
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.800]   On the top of everything else, this is completely hollow.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:12.080]   So you take your USB 2.0 cable, you wrap it around nicely around here and then slide
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.480]   it in and you have one nice tidy package with everything you need to do your remote
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.240]   podcasting or your remote recording in.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.000]   And for all of that, it's not an expensive thing.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.840]   I think it lists for $120, $130.00.
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.240]   But you can get it on Amazon for less than $90.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.800]   And that's really not that much more than any good, any halfway decent portable USB microphone.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.680]   So that's a pretty good camera for Skype.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.400]   It's great for audio.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.600]   It's not as good as the big huge capsule microphone that I've got here, of course, but it is a
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:47.120]   big, big step up from anything else that I've been traveling around with.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:54.400]   I've been doing a couple of sample podcasts with it just privately with just my dogs and
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.400]   my shame-watching.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   And the audio quality is just phenomenal.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.640]   It's a huge leap up from anything else that I've been using.
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:04.080]   I've liked the Snowflake as an inexpensive USB mic.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.080]   I've liked it a lot.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.320]   I like it better than their bigger, what they call eight ball or snowball.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.320]   Snowball.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.960]   But boy, they had the camera on there.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.960]   It's fantastic.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.640]   Andy, have you noticed any peaking issues?
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:20.200]   One of the problems with the Snowball was that it was very sensitive to...
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   Yeah, the no headroom at all.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.560]   It seems much better, frankly.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.560]   It does.
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:28.160]   I should probably send you guys a sample just as you can hear it.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.240]   If you have a better ear than I do for the quality.
[01:08:30.240 --> 01:08:31.640]   It's hard to miss.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.000]   It sounds like, yeah, scratching.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.520]   Oh, no, nothing like that.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.520]   Okay, great.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:41.560]   As with any microphone, you figure out what the optimum distance is going to be to pick
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560]   up what you're doing.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.600]   You angle it correctly.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:44.920]   And I just see no static.
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.600]   I see no clipping at the top end.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:52.400]   I just see lots of my lush, rich baritone is captured in all of its immediate wonder.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.400]   Bring us on the cruise.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.640]   We can do some shows from China.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.040]   When are you doing the cruise soon?
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.040]   July 3rd.
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.600]   I'm leaving July 3rd because I'm doing the land portion.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.480]   When you come back, my family will be larger.
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:05.480]   Yes.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:07.240]   Because we don't get back to the 18th.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.680]   Leo and I are going on a cruise ship for 10 days, so we'll be larger too.
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:14.280]   Oh, no, I've worked so hard.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:16.600]   Leo's working so hard to be smaller.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   That's the big thing in the office here.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.600]   Big thing what?
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.000]   Everybody in the office here, we're all trying to lose weight.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.880]   Because we all took one look at each other and realized, oh my God, we're all budget
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.880]   tubs.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.320]   No, this is a, I really like the snowflake.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:31.320]   I want to get now.
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320]   I wish I could trade it in.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.040]   That's really awesome.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.240]   So this is, they call it the what?
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.680]   They call it the eyeball.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.680]   The eyeball.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:43.600]   Personally, I think that those of you who are getting into the tech manufacturing business
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.320]   do not get into the business unless you come up with a product name as cool as the blue
[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:48.320]   eyeball.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.400]   And the design, but blue's always had the best looking microphones.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.040]   They make beautiful microphones.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:57.640]   And I mean, just, I mean, almost just, I would almost buy this just as an object.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:01.080]   Just as the, if I just need a microphone, I would order the one that looks the coolest
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.280]   and it would be this one.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.360]   The fact that it's also, again, I'm not a professional like engineer.
[01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:10.240]   So I can't really, all I can say is that I record stuff with it and it sounds fairly
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.240]   awesome.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.600]   And I'm very, very happy with it.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:18.320]   No, I think it's, I think it's actually, I prefer it to the snowball, which is their
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:19.720]   big, it's big brother.
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:23.520]   Oh, although, you know, with the snowball, you do get to pretend to be like a 1930s ballroom
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.520]   cruder.
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:25.800]   I know the look of it is great.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:26.800]   And it scratches.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.800]   Yes.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:28.800]   Yes.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.960]   All that words could save.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.960]   There.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:34.520]   Now I've got mine all wrapped up too.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.880]   You inspired me to, I've been trying to wrap this snowflake up and put it away with the
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.680]   USB kit.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   Very nice.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.080]   Andy and I go, thank goodness we didn't forget you.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.560]   Well, we don't like to impose Leo.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.520]   Thank goodness you remembered you.
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.000]   All right.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.940]   We also want you all to visit Andy's website, the celestial waste of bandwidth c w O B
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:11:01.360]   .com and look for him in the Chicago Sun times.
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.480]   Anyone stupid enough to pay me?
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.680]   I'll show up or yeah, at that conference.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.720]   Tell us once again, what's the name of it?
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.600]   The conference on World Affairs.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:16.640]   If you do, if you go to Colorado.edu/cwa or just search for conference on World Affairs,
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.120]   you'll probably turn it up.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.360]   Like I said, the people that you get to meet and hear for free is just phenomenal.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.520]   I would be going to this show probably even if I weren't speaking because you know, where
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:32.640]   else do you get to hear James Randy and Mike Farrell and a guy used to be.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.360]   They basically all kinds of really cool people talk about all kinds of really cool subjects.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.760]   Oh, one of the highlights is that you'll see every every we're Roger Ebert picks a
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.800]   movie that he's going to do what he calls an interrupt us on where on Monday night they
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.520]   screen the entire movie.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.120]   And they spend Tuesday night, Wednesday night, Thursday night, Friday night screening the
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.440]   movie all over again.
[01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:56.640]   But anytime you see something interesting or you have a question, you just yell out stop.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:12:00.560]   Roger picks up the remote and stops the projection and you discuss what you've just seen or
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.560]   probably just noticed.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.920]   Probably one of the greatest things, greatest weeks times I've ever spent at this conference
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.640]   was going through the silence of the lambs with 700 people frame by frame shot by shot.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:13.080]   Or led, of course, by Roger Ebert.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:17.400]   I saw things in that movie that I'd seen it seven or eight, nine times that I never saw
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   before.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.400]   It really is phenomenal.
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:20.400]   Once again, it's open to the public.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.400]   Just show up.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   It's free.
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.400]   Free, free, free, unbelievable.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.080]   And look at all the people who are going to be at this.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.080]   I want to go.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.720]   You should you would really enjoy it.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:32.720]   Give us more warning.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720]   I would have gone to.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.640]   Oh, man, I pick up and go right now if I could.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:39.120]   I'll make sure you're you're you're spoken up on the list.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.760]   I will I do have to tell you it is the worst.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.240]   I'll try to make this short.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.920]   It is the absolute worst pitch ever to try it when you when you're trying to get someone
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.120]   to like speak at this conference because this is how it was pitched to me that well,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.120]   it's a week long conference.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.160]   Oh, so I'll just be talking about technology.
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.200]   No, they usually like to put you on a lot of stuff that you don't know much about.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.960]   Okay, but I'll have lots of time to prepare.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.160]   No, they usually don't establish that till a week beforehand.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   Okay.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.160]   Well, there's an honorarium.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.160]   No.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.600]   Oh, so I'm just going to be reimbursed for my airfare.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.600]   My hotel.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.320]   No, you have to bring yourself here, but we will find you like somebody with a guest room that
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.320]   you can crash in for the week.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.640]   Dr. Keith is going to be there too.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.640]   I see.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.600]   So the fact the fact so I basically said, okay, thought to myself, I'll do it once so that
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.840]   I never have to do it again.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:24.040]   How awful could it be?
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.840]   And the fact that I've been back for 10 years every year, every year since just on that's
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.320]   on those same terms should show you how cool it is.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:32.960]   I'd like to stream some of this maybe next.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.880]   I will I will, by the way, be doing a tweet up probably Wednesday night next week in Boulder.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:42.040]   I'm trying to figure out what night I will have off to do that sort of thing.
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.240]   So follow my Twitter field, probably make an announcement there.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:48.320]   Once we figure out what place is going to be suitable and what time and what night I
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.880]   can do it, but I definitely want to do a tweet up when Simon Boulder.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:51.880]   So alert alert alert.
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.400]   Oh, and I feel like I'm on the end of the show.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:59.080]   I'm also going to be speaking at the Colorado Mac user group on Thursday night.
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.800]   So if you can't make it to any of the stuff that's happening at the University of Colorado
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.680]   campus, check out the comug.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.240]   I think it's comug.org.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.280]   Colorado Macintosh user group, the meeting is at Thursday night from I think seven o'clock
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.280]   onward.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:18.040]   The annual conference on world affairs, sicolorado.edu/cwa.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.240]   Alex Lindsey is at the pixel core.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.920]   All you have to do is go to pixel core.com to find out more about that amazing guild of
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920]   multimedia artists.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:30.360]   And we just would just a reminder that we've got a new Mac break work with mail merge.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.360]   Very exciting.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   Oh, cool.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.160]   No, lots of lots of good stuff with your parents.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:38.280]   Yeah, no, it's Mac break work is really showing you how to get all everything out of everything
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.400]   out of your work environment.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.280]   And also Mac break studio is talking about color correction and we've got sal back for
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.280]   advanced automator.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.280]   Oh boy.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:50.520]   So in Mac break, they find that iTunes and pixel core.tv.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.840]   You can get connections to it to it on pixel.tv.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:59.400]   But if you go up to iTunes, they're all clustered together in the pixel core grouping.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.200]   And so definitely check it out.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.200]   Very good.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.200]   Very good.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.360]   Everybody, thank you for joining us.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:05.360]   We appreciate it.
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:06.360]   We'll see you next Tuesday.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.040]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:31.320]   [Music]
