[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.840]   Welcome to Mac Break Weekly. I am not Leo. I think we always say that. We have to make sure that
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.120]   you're clear that the person you're listening to is not Leo. This is Alex Lindsey and I am
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.400]   sitting in for Leo as he continues to enjoy his trip. I don't know where he is. He's somewhere in
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.880]   Europe. Having a good time I'm sure and not listening to the show. Hopefully. So anyway,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.480]   but I'm joined here coming in from Boston. Andy Naco. Hey, Andy. Hi.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:13.320]   Hello, Andy. Statistically speaking, aren't most of us not Leo. Unless your
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.640]   name is our Leo. I'm just saying that's usually a very good safe guess to make. That's good.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.800]   Also coming in from Inthaca, New York, we've got Adam Anks from tidbits. Hey, Adam. Again,
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.160]   not Leo. Glad to be here. Good. And join us for her debut. Megan Maroney.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.400]   The long ban on me being on Mac Break is over. It was lifted. Thank you. Also, definitely don't
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.360]   tell Leo this. But yes, thank you for having me. I was like, Leo's not here. Let's make it.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.040]   Oh, oh, oh, Megan. There are so many things we're not going to be telling Leo about.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.160]   We'll just add that to the pile. You know, we just have to take over. Like the number of times I
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:02.360]   use the word buttocks during the show. So, so we've got we're now a week out. We've we've had
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.960]   almost a week since the since the the big event. And we've had a little time to think about it,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.080]   a little time to research now. It looks like the the iPhone XR as announced is going to be taking a
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.880]   little while longer to get to us. Is this a Andy? Is this a marketing thing or is it a technical
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:27.640]   issue as far as getting the XR out on any. Any first of all, I think I think we I think I
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.720]   proved canonically last week that because Apple declined to release a phone called the iPhone
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:40.680]   X II they released an iPhone number eight that we must be intended to say the letter X in iPhone
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.280]   X. So I will I will I will I will stick to my guns here and say, well, any time you hear any
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.840]   time you have you hear a theory that, Oh, this is this is a shortage or a delay or something like
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.120]   this is marketing bravado from Apple. Like and Apple is the one company that doesn't need to
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.240]   market anything. They could just they could actually like have the middle finger and the poop emoji
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.320]   hanging in the front of all of their store windows on the doors closed and people would still be
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.880]   lining up to get iPhones. So it's it's they're they're using a brand but they're calling a brand
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:16.680]   new display technology for the LCD and the less expensive iPhone X. And so it's not it's not
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.600]   unlikely that they're having problems with the usually usually the problem with the new display
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.120]   is yields where they can make them but they're throwing out a lot more than they thought they were
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.880]   going to have to. So the rumor is that there was a good they're going to be delayed a little bit.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.600]   And so that's okay. That that really is the but that really is the phone that kind of everybody
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.480]   wants. And I know I know this the one that I'm interested in. I've had a week to look more into
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.320]   this and I still can't figure out why I would why why I would I personally would buy the excess
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:50.040]   over the XR unless I really just wanted that extra that the stainless steel case and I wanted the
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.760]   and I wanted the OLED screen. I'd much rather have the banana yellow phone frankly than
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.560]   the better screen in the stainless steel really really the banana yellow. Yes absolutely the
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.440]   banana yellow is pretty cool. But but there's people looking at it. I was like who's going to buy
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.600]   that phone. It's my question that we know. Somebody anybody anybody who wants to answer the phone
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   by saying banana phone go or go for banana phone. You know you can now use it you could use it for
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.280]   banana for scale. You can just set it out there and you know it'd be actually more accurate than
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.400]   a regular banana. So seriously Andy to exume doesn't mean anything to you to have soft tickles
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:36.680]   room. It's given given that the main camera is still going to be identical to the main camera on
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.120]   the other one that I still will have 3d face the fact that they will still be able to at least fake
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.400]   the best of the fake to lens like f-stop features in the in the cheaper one. It's not it's not a
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.880]   small amount you're not saving a small amount of money here by going for the cheaper phone. And
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.960]   even if even if you do have iPhone 10s I'll just be kind I'll say iPhone 10s even if you do have
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.280]   iPhone 10s money I would still be saying well why don't why not buy the cheaper phone but max it
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.120]   out for storage because I'm probably going to have a lot more room in my a lot more use in my life
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.040]   to make sure that I could shoot 4k video as long as I want as opposed to I'll get that second camera
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.960]   which is it's going to be nice but it's it's still you're still dealing with one of the best
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.120]   cameras even with digital zoom you can find. So again it's not it's not a small amount of money
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:34.040]   250 bucks that's a lot of money. So now so you're going for the 10R Adam where where are you landing?
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.840]   Well so I have a 10 and honestly I'm not doing anything. You know it just when I look at the
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.680]   differences yeah of course I mean I don't know maybe everyone else noticed this too. Every time
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.120]   Apple has to say this is the best iPhone this is the fastest iPhone on the on the launch I was
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:58.280]   like well if it wasn't why would we bring it? Of course it's the best iPhone it better damn
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.520]   well be. Exactly. So so yeah so so so but so I have the iPhone 10 and and I like the cameras
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.640]   and I like the screen. Although my eyes are at 50 not so good so I don't actually I can't
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:20.040]   actually see the screen hardly at all. And so so yeah so I'm not doing anything if I were forced
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:26.200]   to buy a new phone I would probably get the 10R and I'm going to try very hard to say 10R and 10S
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:32.840]   and 10S Max even though man it's hard. It just looks like XS at XR and you know.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:38.840]   And if you're living in excess you know when you when you buy it I mean it's just it's just
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:43.880]   you know it's one thing it's one thing when it was 8S and you know you know 4S and 5S and all that
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.240]   you know because it was a number in a letter that was easy. Once you go to a Roman numeral in a number
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.200]   that's just getting that's asking for too much and particularly when you put the word Max in there
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.240]   you know because it's extra small Max and you know what does that mean?
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.680]   Well the question really is I think that is are we going to go to XI next year?
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.400]   Hey next year it better go to 11 that's all I have to say.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.880]   Yes.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.800]   You get you we already know what the it's it's going to be we took it to you know we turned it all the way
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.920]   to 11. I mean that is.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.720]   It's got it.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.080]   We already know where that's going.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.520]   And if it tells us.
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.080]   Are you thinking about creating?
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:22.200]   Uh yes I now if I were paying for it I would get the 10R in blue because I like the
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.920]   I would like a colored iPhone but I'm not paying for it Leo is so I decided to get the most expensive
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:35.080]   so I got a 10 Mac 10s Max with 512 gig.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:42.360]   Yes exactly of course no actually I gotten I think this my 10 is 512 the 10 went to 512 right?
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:47.720]   Oh no okay okay so this is 256 and I don't I mean I don't even ever get close to it so I think
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:52.680]   I stayed at 256 because that's what he did to he had gone to 512 I might have gone to 512
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:58.200]   and he ordered the gold so then I didn't order the gold I ordered the space gray but then
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.440]   the guy at the Apple Store said it might not be here by Friday so then I said any color
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.160]   you want is fine because you just put a case on it anyway so it can you know it doesn't really
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:14.360]   matter so yes I um but if I were if I were paying I would get the 10R and I've heard of you know
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:20.440]   that we talked a little bit about how they were aiming the R the 10R at kids I would never buy
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:27.560]   my children you know because it's almost 800 dollars yes right they're happy with the leftover
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:36.360]   phones or the SE and but I don't so I'm not exactly sure who is going to buy those 10R ones
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.480]   besides Andy I would just like no for the for the for the drinking game you were the first one to
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:47.160]   say iPhone SE just just just bring it out is that on the drinking game I am a big fan of the SE I
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:53.560]   bought two of them this year everyone is a big fan of the SE and yeah you know they Apple will
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:57.960]   not update it and you know and people are saying well it must not have sold that well we don't
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.800]   know Apple hasn't said you know maybe maybe it was probably because they were trying to make it
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:07.960]   small and cheap well I don't know I think Apple also says about the SE I think that Apple also has a
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.200]   issue where not they already have a lot of phones now like like if you think about the different
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:20.360]   sizes and the different you know they have the 7 the 8 the the the the 10R the 10S 10 you know and
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   and so they already have this wide range and it's just how many are you going to keep on selling
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.480]   you know how you know how many Vabs are you running and so on so forth so I think that that makes sense
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:35.960]   I think to me anyway you know I have to admit I'm I'm probably going to get the max and then I
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:42.760]   oh I was gonna get the black but but the but then I the space gray or whatever but then I realized
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.800]   I'm from Pittsburgh and black and gold is often you get to get a phone that's black and gold and so
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.160]   I think that I'm probably gonna get black go Bruins all right I'm not all penguins penguins
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:58.440]   penguins penguins is okay penguins is okay pirates okay Steelers okay and Bruins not oh no that's not
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:03.720]   I thought you're saying black and gold that's oh I'm sorry my mistake but but they well it would
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.320]   have been nice for them to keep like the smallest smallest size the classic iPhone size
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.160]   it's it would have been a nice statement for them to say we will have ones really small phone for
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.800]   people with small hands or people with small pockets well there is some discussion let me know
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.960]   what you think of it there is some maggot maggot this is just because that's for you what
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:31.720]   have you seen the the concept that it is it is a gender biased because the phone is too large there
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:36.280]   is an article I think in the New York Times yesterday talking about women saying that it's a gender bias
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.680]   because the phone is too big for their absolutely everything is a gender bias first of all let's get
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:48.760]   but I I put the phone in my purse I'm never putting the phone in the pocket so I could have a giant I
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.240]   could use my iPad as a phone because I carry a purse I think it's actually you guys are the ones
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.280]   that are left out in the cold because it's not as accepted for you to carry a giant bag so maybe
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.440]   it's a gender bias the other way because we put everything in our purse that we want whatever
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.080]   size phone you want give me my wife my wife tanya is absolutely I rate about this because
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.560]   she hates purses she doesn't like to carry purses she she's no reason why she should be
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:19.640]   bogged down with this stupid bag all the time and so she has a phone that she she has the
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:25.240]   success and she is unhappy with its size and we were actually were for testing reasons brought in
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:30.760]   an old iPhone 5s and sort of reset it up with iOS 12 and everything and I swear if it didn't
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.160]   have a broken camera she would probably be using that phone right now interesting yeah it might
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:43.560]   and you know my wife has a has the eight s or I'm sorry the eight plus plus plus and
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.040]   and she puts it in her back pocket I'm always like you're gonna break that screen all again
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.160]   and I just keep on saying it but she just keeps on putting in the back pocket and she
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.200]   hasn't been a problem for so far but I I am she's very small hands I don't know I don't think it
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:02.280]   would be that would be the issue but a lot of it's been around how hard it is told with a
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:07.480]   large and I and I will admit the thing that I like about the current 10 is that I can't operate
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   it with one hand if I go back to the max I know that I'm going back to two hands because I can't
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:18.920]   really get to everything even as a as a man I'm it's challenging so anyway the you know that um
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.560]   Tim Cook talked a lot about you know he had some interviews he was talking about iPhone pricing
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:31.240]   dual sim support Adam why do you think that we are only seeing dual sim support in China
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:38.040]   uh I think that's not true though we are seeing physical support right two physical
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.240]   physicals I don't understand Chinese carriers but my understanding is as the apples e-sim
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.240]   technology doesn't work in China or isn't allowed in the China for the question is why can't we
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.040]   have it all you know everywhere you know no I would assume I would assume it's more expensive
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.960]   to manufacture right to have I mean because I mean that's well anything you do in the
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:01.400]   iPhone that's physical you've got to know there's trade-offs and and issues with and so
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.520]   if you can have only one sim slot and do the other one that e-sim that seems like a fine thing
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:11.400]   is there is there a reason why not having a second sim slot is more of a problem I mean I've only
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.200]   like once wanted a second slim sim that was when we were traveling in England well second
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.520]   I mean I I travel a lot overseas and so having multiple sims is a big deal
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:27.480]   exciting for me being able to actually be able to you know keep two sims in the phone and have a
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:32.040]   local phone number and a international phone number and you can't do that with e-sim it's also
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:39.480]   you can go ahead go ahead well number one e-sim is not just apple standard so emerging it's
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.600]   emerging standard that apple wants that apple is getting behind they've got most of the US carriers
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.680]   behind it it's not a world I don't believe it's a worldwide standard yet but it's going to be
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.840]   as to why they I believe that apple is really willing to tailor things to specifically to the
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:00.920]   Chinese market when you have two physical sims that allows you to have a lot more flexibility and
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:06.280]   how you interact with different carriers there's a and it's not just China and the US either
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:13.080]   there are a lot of places where people will have two different two different carriers one for one
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.120]   because one which will give them cheap data another one which will give them cheap voice and cheap
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:24.600]   text and some in some parts of the world if you do traveling doesn't just mean going 3,000 miles
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.640]   to another continent it could mean just going about 500 miles and suddenly you need to have a second
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:35.400]   account on a second service to make this work and I don't I don't know why they're limiting it to
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:41.400]   just China I would guess that it's because that dual tray is harder manufacturer more expensive
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.760]   manufacturer I'm going to guess don't make it gives it gives them less space to remove to
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:51.240]   continue to thumb their nose of people who want to use actual physical headphone jacks
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.840]   but I wouldn't be surprised if it was some they had they had some conversations with certain
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.080]   officials in China and they said we are not ready to sign on to the e-sim standard yet
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.880]   and if you so if you could give us two separate sims that'd be great most most of the phones that
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.440]   I get out of China for either for review or the cheap ones that I buy just because they're weird
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.200]   happen to have two sims so that's kind of what the people are expecting over there
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:19.160]   and it sounds like the if you're traveling overseas I mean I guess the way I'm looking at
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.960]   approaching it is that I'll probably have the e-sim be my local yeah my local phone number and
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.720]   then I just have an empty slot that I'm going to use for for the other number does anyone know
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:35.080]   how it manages data between two sims like is something you choose what services it's a different
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.840]   plan I know that you can have a separate plan but you have a separate plan but like if I have a
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:45.320]   T-Mobile plan and an AT&T plan is it which is it going to use for text versus data do we know
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:52.760]   about it depends on for phone calls whatever it will basically present as whatever number is
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:59.080]   incoming I believe that in terms of which data plan you're going to use if you've got two accounts
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.400]   that have two availability of two different data services it's kind of like being able to choose
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.120]   between two different hotspots so to speak you'll in terms of mobile data you'll be able to choose
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.120]   between two different services that are available to you that's my understanding at least for for
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.400]   general use some use you got it and then I don't I don't have one of these new phones yet so I can
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:22.520]   only get from what I know from the companies that give me phones do we think that this is the big
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:29.640]   push that e-sims needs to to move forward is to have Apple like USB was before yeah I mean
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.960]   yeah it makes it in the series in the in the Apple Watch and the iPad Pro up to this point or the
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.000]   iPad up to this point so it's not like it's completely new and but putting it in the iPhone just
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.120]   radically increases adoption right yeah also carriers love it because it makes it really easy
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:48.840]   to when you're when you're trying to sell somebody who is not bound to a contract hey switch to our
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.960]   plan here's how much money you can get you there will be no hey now you have to go to one of our
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:59.000]   stores to pick up a physical sim or will mail you a physical sim a lot of the e-sim stuff is here
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.600]   is a here is a a QR code just scan that QR code and the phone will figure out all the rest so
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.680]   that's it's it's this is why the carriers are really really really happy about it because they
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.280]   are really now fighting each other to get they're they're they're signed up everybody they're going
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:17.480]   to sign up in the US and so they want to sign up other people's existing accounts and one of the
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.960]   other things that Tim Tim talked about was the the fact that you know when they're talking about
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.400]   pricing he said well we find that you know that we want to keep on innovating and there's some
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.440]   people willing to pay for that so if we keep going down that path do we see this kind of this fork
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:37.080]   Megan do you see this fork of the R and the S or are you know where we're going to start seeing
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:42.600]   it fork off where the the S keeps on becoming more and more expensive or that version and the R
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:49.720]   kind of tries to maintain this this price of about $750 yeah or at least that that gap in price
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.320]   between what the most expensive is I do I do think because there's some people that just want a brand
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:19:00.600]   new phone and they'll continue to pay you know $300 less than what the most expensive phone is
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.560]   yeah I think they saw how many people bought the 10 they weren't you know a lot of people were like
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:09.400]   no one's gonna buy that but it had a lot of adoption and so I think that they will continue to have
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.120]   this sort of lower end because I mean you know very few people really can tell the difference
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:20.600]   between OLED and you know an LAD screen and LCD screen and I think there's other few things I
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:26.920]   think they figured out the things that people will want will don't need and then they can
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:33.320]   reduce the price for that I think the quality difference between the the R and the S is much
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.080]   smaller than the yeah to the 10 does that make sense Adam yeah it does and I will say though that
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.520]   I found it a little disingenuous when Tim Cook was talking about how you know they're interested
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:50.440]   in the 10 R to make it more affordable for people and things like that this is still a not a cheap
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:58.040]   phone I mean it's you know it's more than the eight was before and it's just it's a $750
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:04.680]   phone to start with so it does feel as though Apple is just pushing everything up in terms of
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:10.440]   what we're willing to to pay I mean I think it was Jason Snell who used the the boiling frog example
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   you know it just keeps getting a little hotter and we don't really notice oh yeah
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   iPhones were always a thousand dollars you know you don't really think about it
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.000]   and I have been paying a thousand I mean Leo has been paying a thousand dollars for my
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.440]   iPhones for several versions because you get the most you know the most space so my seven was
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:34.200]   over a thousand dollars because I had you know 256 I think and so was the eight and then so
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:40.360]   was the 10 and so now it's like that is how the boiling frog works like $1,500 doesn't seem like
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.320]   that much or it wasn't 15 and I have to be I wouldn't be surprised if it was 2000 three or
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.640]   four years from now you know it's it's a and one of the things that we've seen is that also if
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:54.120]   you look at the stats I think there was a someone posted stats to show that the iPhone
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.920]   processors now are about as fast as some of them you know are getting very close to the
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.480]   fast at some of the bottom end MacBooks so yeah you know I think that the there's the there's the
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.320]   so you're you're looking at stats there and and speeds and and capacity that is starting to
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:17.800]   the MacBook Pro 13 not being possibly that much more powerful and probably by a 13 a 14
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:22.120]   we're probably going to see a point where you know you are buying a computer you know that just
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:27.080]   happens to be really small I think we but we are talking about the difference between like a
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:33.880]   iPhone consumers and all other kinds of consumers where people who who love iPhones one of the reasons
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:41.080]   why is because they can appreciate both the real intangible and the ethereal stylistic
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.640]   advantages of having this sort of phone and so they're sort of willing to go for that everybody
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.520]   else they're the frogs who jump out of the iPhone pot and jump into the Android pot
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.880]   where this the heat is called the lack of privacy but it costs a lot less money and so that's
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:01.960]   so same same pot different different different sort of stress level what I do like is that now I
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:09.800]   don't think the the the minimum buy-in for an iPhone is now under $500 if you want so you want to buy
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:15.560]   a walk it around Apple store and walk out with a new device that for that that runs iOS for the
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:20.840]   least amount of money now that that phone is now it's a two-year-old phone now but it will still
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:26.040]   cost you under $500 which is not something I had before and yes this is two-year-old technology
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:30.760]   or two I'm sorry I'm blanking on what year it was released but you're talking about a couple of
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:37.240]   the previous generations phone but if you were to go into any other phone store with $450,
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:45.240]   $500 you would also not be getting a Google Pixel 3 or Samsung Galaxy S9 you would be getting
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   something with a lower processor an excellent but not top of the line camera a very very good but not
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:57.080]   top of the line screen and there was also the at least when when Tim was being interviewed by
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.960]   a certain Asian market journalist he was and also based on what he was saying
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:09.560]   along lock during a press day last week he they seem to Apple seems to have decided that
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:15.800]   the way forward to compete with the kind of budget phones that are dominating so many of the world
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:21.480]   markets is not to try to make an inexpensive phone they just don't have the skills or the interest
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:27.080]   in doing that but to put more refurbished iPhones back into play so the more the more
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:33.160]   older iPhones that they can recapture into into the Apple supply chain refurbish and then resell
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.960]   to another market halfway across the world the better for them because now they have the ability
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:45.400]   to sell a $200 bona fide iPhone and also they can also sell the idea that look we don't want
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.720]   these things to go into landfills that's why we are we have we are the most recyclable
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:54.520]   company ever we will take a phone back so to make sure everything gets recycled as it should
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:59.400]   not necessarily break it down into to become car tires and plastic car bodies but
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:04.840]   again to become some kids first phone halfway across the world one and is there a do we know
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.880]   what percentage of the users now are in a monthly plan versus the purchase plan because it seems
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:14.120]   like part of why you can push keep pushing this price up is because so many people are just making
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:19.560]   payments right now it's $40 a month which seems like a lot but I think that's what it is on the
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:24.440]   but it's less than $1,800 right I mean and Americans are not good at thinking about
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:30.440]   you give us a payment plan we're very good at being in debt right so I have a
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.120]   I have a question though Andy you're making an interesting point Apple selling refers phones
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.760]   I mean in a place like India for instance what kind of iPhones can you buy there
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.880]   can you buy an iPhone 5 in India that's been refurbished and that's a new phone and it costs
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:49.400]   equivalent of a hundred bucks does that mean is that is that a thing I just don't know yeah it is
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:55.880]   worldwide India is special because that there's so many markets that are absolute just so idiosyncratic
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:02.920]   like there there's in Pakistan where I'm blanking on I'm trying to remember the details of the
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:08.280]   the FM radio phones that are so that's so important in certain parts of the country where you really
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:13.560]   do have to have an FM radio because data is so expensive that if someone wants to get their soccer
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.640]   scores their football scores they're not going to get it off of a data plan they want to tune in
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:24.360]   by FM radio to get it that way so it's not so they apples just not in a position to create
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:30.680]   different like Samsung can build a phone for every neighborhood in a market if they they find out
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   that people love this band on this band in Dorchester but they don't like this they like this other
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.560]   band in in in Cambridge they can make a Cambridge edition and a Dorchester edition they've got
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.640]   that manufacturing capability apple really has to decide on which four or five phones they're
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.240]   going to make so I think I think they're making good plan the other part of their plan of course
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.920]   as we're talking about the fifteen hundred dollar phone two thousand dollar phone I wouldn't be shocked
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:58.120]   if we see a two thousand dollar phone because of more and more part of their business part of
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:03.400]   their strategy is not necessarily to sell more iPhones but to make more money off of every phone
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:10.200]   that they sell so to to somehow add more value to a phone that on the surface doesn't seem to have
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:16.200]   ungodly wonderful features compared to last year's model if you can still manage to get people to
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.840]   find that extra two hundred fifty dollars that's exactly what apple's trying to do because they're
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.080]   as as many analysts have said they're starting to run out of people to sell iPhones too well and I
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:29.080]   think that also the first time you know they're making you know they're in this area where they do
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.240]   have the group of people willing to pay all that and they have most of them you know so
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:37.720]   statistically they have most of those folks that are willing to pay extra for equality and
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.120]   there are some of us that that you know we spend so much time on our phone we just we don't want
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.520]   them to be constrained by you know because anytime you take a product you are looking at that product
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.160]   being uh I want to put these features into it this year I wanted to you know have these things can
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.280]   we get it done in time and can we get it done inside the the constraint of the costs you know
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.520]   there's a you could have your your phone probably levitate and you know teleport if we we're willing
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:05.400]   to charge enough for them and so so the the issue is is that you know I mean as we go through that I
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:10.680]   think that apple now is realizing that it's better for them to just unconstrain that that top end
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.000]   and allow it to keep on floating and allow let their engineers do whatever they want to do to
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.320]   not whatever but within reasons start to be able to keep on expanding the the feature set of the
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.840]   phone now do we think that one of the things that they've spent obviously spent a lot of money on
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:27.960]   is the and we just talked about the speed of the 8-8-12 chip is that a is that really as far ahead
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:37.640]   of android as people say andy uh I wouldn't say so no it's a it's a it's a hella fast of CPU
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:43.560]   it's also has the two things that are going to be more and more important in mobile chip design
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:48.040]   one is to just just like there's a time where you could have a graphics processor as part of the
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.920]   main processor and then suddenly no you can't make a you can't sell anything like that it has to have
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:58.600]   a dedicated GPU now you also have to have a dedicated machine language chip something that will
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:04.040]   basically do all that math and take the load off of the off of the CPU and also a secure enclave
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.920]   to make sure there is a place that you can store keys so that they can't be cracked either by bad
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:15.000]   people or by good people who might be doing bad things in your opinion of when you're standing
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.240]   there at checkout I would say that I would say there's there's certainly a step ahead of what I'm
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:25.080]   aware of uh and but not uh not light years ahead and that comes down to the fact that they are really
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.320]   they're literally designing uh and making their own their own chips there they're don't they don't
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:33.560]   have to work with partners they don't have to tag team off of someone else's business plan they don't
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.920]   have to wait for someone else to be ready to roll out a certain manufacturing technology they build
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:45.160]   it to the specific they they build a specific chip to be put into these specific handful of devices
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:51.880]   and by damn it they get it and mega do you think that this is apple kind of with the a12 chip kind
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.920]   of sneaking up on you know moving these chips to a point where they do become part of the laptop
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:04.200]   line oh I don't know that's a good question I think um it's hard to say what they're you know
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:10.360]   between the laptop and the the phone I always wonder like other people at apple that are like all
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.560]   laptop and all phone and they're just like why aren't we getting that you know so I do think
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:20.440]   that more people are using their phone as you know to do almost everything and so like you said why
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:25.160]   why be constrained by anything well and Adam doesn't it seem like at some point unifying the
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.320]   chip structure would make sense I mean Intel's not going at the speed that apple wants it to
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.400]   they keep building chips they're catching up to where to where the uh the laptops are
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:41.880]   you have to assume that apple is is compiling uh mac OS on a 12 chips that they were doing this on
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:47.080]   on you know Intel chips back when they were running on power pc you've got to know that they're
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:53.080]   thinking that because apple doesn't like to be beholden to anyone and right now they're pretty
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:58.760]   beholden to intel and so this is not to say that it's going to be a complete shift or that they will
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:06.120]   you know do it anytime instantly but uh it just makes no sense at all that apple wouldn't be thinking
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:12.920]   down those roads as the eight a series becomes more and more and more powerful now the final
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:18.520]   thing that we keep on that apple touches on almost every event and and we keep you know keep on
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.000]   covering is you know one of their secret weapons in addition to the to the pieces that we've talked
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.080]   about as privacy and and you know one of the questions is is this really something that's going
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:35.480]   to continue to set separate apple i guess specifically andy is it is this a is there
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.600]   can android compete with this you know can android compete with apple not needing to
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:46.680]   sell you anything other than the phone no absolutely not this is this is the biggest chank
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:52.600]   and uh in google's armor right now uh because they're they don't they're not like facebook they're
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:58.040]   not uh they make a observable amount of money not off of advertising but that's still that's their
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:02.920]   iPhone that's their their ed businesses their iPhone if it goes away they got problems and they
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:09.880]   don't really have a they don't have a way to run that business in a way that is as secure as apple
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:17.480]   and we're asked a couple years ago this used to be a question of uh uh pride or marketing where apple
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.960]   could say well yes that we don't have they we don't have an affordable phone and yes we don't let
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.800]   users or let alone developers do things they want to do but by gum we have the safest and most
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:33.000]   secure phone and we save the privacy is sacrosanct so long as you don't ask us about your privacy
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.240]   when using one of our web browsers because we actually don't care about that but still it used
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:42.520]   to be a lot of like here's here's a here's a selling point a marketing point of uh of our phone and
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:49.240]   now we have the EU and the United States government absolutely honking down google and facebook snorkels
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:55.640]   about how they are you collecting and abusing citizens private information it's a hot button
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:01.240]   topic it's something that gets both the democratic voters and republican voters equally wound up
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:07.080]   and so there is no way that this is not going to be a larger and larger issue
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:12.440]   uh over the next couple of years especially come to the to the election coming up two years from
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:19.080]   now so app so whereas apple is being very proactive and announcing to the EU that oh you know that
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:23.560]   you know that that set of regulations that you just passed four weeks ago we are already complying
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:27.000]   with all of that or rather we we've made trivial changes and we were already planning on we've
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.880]   been following your the path of this legislation and anticipating the need to be able to comply
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:38.280]   with these new rules and we are now compliant google has to go hat in hand and say here's what
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:43.880]   we're doing to technically comply so that you will have to sue us and then it will take four or five
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.800]   years of us still making money before we will have to think of something else uh it is it's it's not
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.520]   just a strategic problem it is a tactical problem for google so that's that that could bring down the
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:33:03.640]   ship and and and and Adam the um as we see more you know GDPR privacy California laws all those
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:08.600]   things kind of moving in does it feel like apple is on the virtuous side not virtuous is in good but
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.840]   like in the advantage at the advantage over a lot of these um situations where the the tide of
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.000]   politics is kind of moving their direction where even though they didn't necessarily create that
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.080]   they are the ones that take advantage of it yes absolutely and and i will say
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:29.720]   you know i'd like to give apple credit um and say that you know oh they were always totally into
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:35.800]   this and everything like that but i think that privacy for apple has become a huge marketing and
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:41.560]   product advantage in the last five years and so they've just been hitting that and hitting that
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:46.680]   and hitting that and they can do it because it's not where their business model is they're willing
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:52.360]   to just sell you product and a sell you a service and they don't have to integrate it with anyone
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:58.040]   they're not beholden to anybody they don't need your data and so it just it works so so well for
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:04.280]   them and they are you know as as you say as as the tide of history moves more and more towards
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:09.800]   you're going to need want some access to your privacy apple is is is right there taking full
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:15.560]   advantage of it and you know it's good thing actually i don't mean yeah right it's good
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:21.960]   it's more privacy finally so does that justify the higher price of the phone and if so then how can
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:27.720]   Samsung justify the their high end phones or google the pixel high end phones which are coming in
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:32.840]   close to that price anyway it seems like it's one of the yeah it's just one of the advantages i mean
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:37.640]   so right you know like i i was talking to someone who has a um has a friend that has a Samsung phone
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:44.040]   and the the Samsung phone the the camera you know according to her is so much better than the
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.440]   iPhone so there's still people who are interested in in that you know there's all these you know
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:53.000]   as there's different people with different levers that that are important to them um i think that
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.200]   for me privacy is somewhat important so so uh you know that i i definitely am sensitive to that
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.640]   yeah i think i think i agree entirely it's just one of those things it just adds on a little bit
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:11.560]   that you know it's a great phone it's got cool technology oh and we're not going to be tracking
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:18.280]   everything you do yeah well let's also just make the point that apple as apple regards privacy
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:24.840]   and security as absolutely sacrosanct and paramount unless you're a chinese citizen in which case
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:31.000]   well what are you going to do so well they have not allowed they haven't allowed uh china
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.040]   to hack the phones either right i mean they that's not that's not been something that they've provided
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:41.000]   for i mean even in the yeah but yeah but they're i cloud to be you know if they get a if they get
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.160]   a warrant for an i-cloud account they still provide that information but but they're still willing to
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:53.320]   let the they they can i've said this so many times i'll try to be as concise as possible that their
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.000]   position is that they will comply with whatever laws are in place in the country in which they
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.280]   operate but sometimes the laws that they're in place are designed to basically weaponize every
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.360]   single smartphone in every single citizens pocket and make sure that it becomes a
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:12.920]   a surveillance device in a way to track this descent either real or imagined and control it and eliminate
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:18.840]   it uh this is a i mean this is apple it's a very very proud moment when apple can legitimately say
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:23.560]   here is all here's all the hard work we're doing to make sure that even we don't have access to your
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.600]   secrets that's very very pleasant and very proud moment as it was when they stood their ground when
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:35.720]   the fbi uh kind of fraudulently said we insist that you provide us with a custom version of the
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:41.560]   operating system for getting into a suspect's uh uh deceased suspect's iphone that is very very
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:47.880]   laudable however this is also the company that when when uh when uh when uh uh when uh uh they were
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:52.760]   uh when china basically said you can't have the tywanese flag anywhere in the emoji file you can't
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.080]   have that anywhere you can't have anything that will acknowledge that that will acknowledge that
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:03.960]   tywan is even a thing because we do not acknowledge so this is this is the level of granularity that
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.160]   china is sort of inflicting on people uh and and on manufacturers so now now it's just that every
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:14.680]   day i've and yeah exactly so any so anytime that anytime this this comes up i just at least want to
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:21.000]   add that footnote that they don't believe that privacy and security of personal security is
[00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:28.760]   absolutely uh non-negotiable they just aren't willing to they aren't willing to
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:35.080]   stay out of a market where they will have to compromise the security and the safety of a
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.920]   customer's phone and i also think that there's also which is which is they can they can do that
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.040]   that's fine just i just want to make sure that that's always a footnote in this conversation
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:49.320]   right yeah and and i think that you uh you know again i it seems to me when i want to look at what
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.640]   they're doing is that they're not they're still not giving even china access to the data on the phone
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.760]   you know like they're you know they're they might do something with the flag and they might
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.600]   you know the the iCloud stuff is still available which is something they make available into other
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.000]   countries and still on chinese servers still on chinese servers right so you shouldn't assume
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.080]   that anything you put on iCloud in china is going to be secure um but but at the same time the phone
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:17.720]   itself is still you know there and and the reality is is when you talk about the phone i think that
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:23.880]   uh your data is um you know somewhat controlled but of course you're still touching cell towers and
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:28.440]   it still knows a lot of who you called and who you hung out with and where you all were and those
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.200]   are things that china was still there's still there's still there's no anti-stingray feature
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:38.120]   leaving for us yep yep absolutely now the one thing that we that we didn't see at the uh at the
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:44.360]   show was a lot of talking about the air power what happened like we didn't even get an update like
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.600]   it wasn't like like they didn't say oh by the way you know not one more thing or or they didn't you
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:54.920]   know they there was no uh um you know they didn't they just is it gonna just disappear do we think
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:58.360]   it's just gonna let they're just gonna stop talking about it well they didn't talk about air pods
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.440]   either it would have like that would have led to like will there be new air pods um because you
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:09.080]   need a special case right for the um yeah so i think it is weird that they just brought it up and then
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.880]   you know oh other people have similar things it seemed really exciting when they first talked
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:19.800]   about it but i could care less now yeah exactly i never really shared that much i don't even like
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:25.240]   my my my watch charger so i you know to me when i saw it i was just like ah whatever i don't even
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:31.080]   like my air pods so yeah i love my air pods they fall out of my ears oh yeah no but make it that's
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.680]   i mean that that's such a great point because it's so easy they apple apple did something very
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   unappily by actually supporting a recognized established wireless charging standard and so
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:47.880]   any people i think last year people would be willing to wait three or four months to wait for
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:55.400]   this wonderful magical willy wonka style air pad charger with all these magical mystical features
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:00.200]   and then run about month four they realized that they could essentially for one quarter the price
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:06.440]   of the air pad just simply buy a bunch of really good anchor brand twenty dollar charging pads
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.400]   from from amazon have them in every place where they set their phone down and not then never think
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:17.880]   about buying another charging pad ever again so the rumors about why it's delayed are interesting
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:23.160]   but i don't they they've lost a huge opportunity yeah it sounds like it was just a difficult
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:28.200]   engineering process that you know getting it so that it could charge an iphone and apple watch and
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:34.120]   air pods in this reputed new case all simultaneously and presumably with some kind of apple special
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.880]   sauce you know that main things aren't always as easy as they seem although it's the i think
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:43.800]   the mistake that people are pointing out is that usually mona apple
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:49.160]   try to take on an engineering challenge that's really tough and they fail uh they haven't announced
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:54.520]   it first yeah i think i i thought it was i thought it was really really chilling that you
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:00.040]   at first there were distant rumors that they're having huge overheating problems with them and
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.800]   they also can't figure out how to one of the selling points was going to be oh no you don't have to
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.840]   you don't have to drop the phone or the charger or the or the air pods anywhere specific just drop
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:13.240]   it anywhere in the pad because we've got so many little antenna little uh little copper coils that's
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.040]   going to work and interference between all those is working also communication between devices
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.440]   wasn't working and i at the at that point i'm like okay gosh that's really interesting and
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:26.840]   really troubling of true uh and then uh groover and a couple others i are
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:32.440]   manipulating their their sources uh and i think in groover's piece on it he said that uh
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:39.160]   that the project at this stage is i think i i think he's quoting someone that he was talking to
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:45.240]   at apple i'm saying okay uh here's a i'll see i'll use the word and also none of the the the
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.280]   side word but you know that letter kerning is a problem okay that you have to make sure in certain
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.480]   words you set the letter kerning correctly because sometime if you could if you were to say that the
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:04.840]   air pad is flicked f-l-i-c-k-e-d but the l and the i were too close together you would get the word
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:10.840]   that groover used and that is like oh dear yeah so so we were so we shouldn't hold our breath and
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:17.320]   it does feel like that that apple in some cases like the um you know like the home pod as well you
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:21.800]   know that where they got themselves ahead of it are almost reacting somewhat to the market
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.240]   of wanting to tell people hey we're working on something don't go buy something else you know
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.920]   and i think that they the the home pod is a good example of something that kind of they were
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.640]   behind on and and they've really lost a lot of room in google and in amazon have basically
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:38.040]   you know taken that market it's going to be very hard apple had to do something even better
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:42.680]   but then they came out with it really late you know and most of us now have at least one echo
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:49.960]   or seven yeah or lots of them that's that's the problem it's it's there's people to some
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.600]   so on some products you talk about the inflection point with the smart speakers there's the infection
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:43:00.440]   point where at some point you have a just by over the over the there even these have been around for
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:08.760]   so long now that now i've i've now realized that i have one two three different google home devices
[00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.800]   and i'm caught and i'm contemplating during the black friday sale this holiday if they're if the
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:18.520]   google if the regular google home goes down to hundred bucks and picking up another one and
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:23.480]   not be not because i'm a fanboy but because these things work really great together and it's really
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.240]   great to be able to have one command that sends the same music everywhere in the house
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:31.960]   and i don't have to transfer my calendar i don't transfer everything the fact that i put another
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:38.440]   one of these in this place extends the the extends the powers of magic voice into into the kitchen
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.280]   now and into the bathroom and so uh now who are they marketing the home pod to uh
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:51.160]   basically people who really really like apple style which is which is a not insignificant reason to
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:57.960]   uh to buy apple stuff uh people who are have got grown to know and love series specifically
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:03.160]   and god knows uh ios 12 and uh serie shortcuts is going to give people more reason to to love
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:09.560]   serie but otherwise they they really have to turn the tables over and and create a new starting
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:14.760]   point for everybody to really get people into this now well i want to connect this to the security
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.960]   and privacy conversation we're having before because i have never chosen apple because of privacy
[00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:24.680]   until i started getting into smart home stuff and then you're dealing with your personal stuff
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:29.960]   your kids your home what you're doing and i have thought that i do feel more comfortable with home
[00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:35.640]   kid enabled stuff i do have lots of echoes everywhere but i just now that it's in my home and listening
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:40.680]   to everything that i say i am finding that apples promise of security and privacy is more important
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.720]   i will admit that i'm waiting for a moment where i feel like the home all the home the home pod
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.120]   and all the other bits are mature enough and and there is in the back of my head that i look at the
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.880]   i look at the olympic go eventually i'm gonna have to kill you you know like you know like you know
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:45:00.680]   like you know like i look over the google one i was like i like you i'm still talking to you but
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:05.080]   i'm gonna cap you sometime it's uh it's something you know it's uh so i'm not that attached to those
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:10.120]   because i just because i feel like both both organ is it you know both groups are collecting lots of
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:14.760]   data it's in there but you know amazon's is building more and more around collecting that data
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:21.000]   sometimes i i don't know this for sure but sometimes i feel like i'm talking on the phone in my kitchen
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.600]   and then i'm seeing ads on amazon that are very much like what i was talking about and it
[00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:32.520]   and it's not that it's happening but it feels like it you know and and and that's like it really
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.160]   feels sticky you know when when that uh you know and i think that that's the it's just it's just
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:43.400]   weird so anyway it's not weird that some of the echoes also they have the you know the picture
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:46.600]   one that's supposed to you know i tell you what you look like and stuff like that for your bedroom and
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:52.520]   that was the one where it just like completely tipped over for me i was like that's just wrong
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:58.040]   you know why would you have a you know an echo with that can see you in your bedroom
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:05.240]   would do that i have an echo show and i and i but it stays in the kitchen you know like it's
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:10.200]   right it's safe in the kitchen and it's used mostly for timers like that is the number one use of
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:15.800]   timers and my daughter when she's trying to learn the words to a new song will uh will stand sit in
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.760]   front of it and play this she'll ask her to play the song and then and then uh sit there and watch
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:24.360]   all the words right because i believe yeah it's good for kitchen karaoke as well kitchen karaoke
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:30.440]   yes yeah but but doesn't but doesn't it make it interesting that we uh tend 10 years ago you
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:35.240]   you felt a love for apple because you felt as though you know these people you felt as though
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.520]   you know what they would do and what they would not do you trusted them you feel as though this
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:44.600]   company is aligned with your values and that would be a very ephemeral sort of thing and nowadays you
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:50.360]   with with the power of connected devices particularly as Megan said with smart devices and home devices
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:55.880]   connected over the internet and the power of basically unregulated privacy here in the united
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:47:01.800]   states of america you know that really becomes an important thing if i had if i had five or six
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:07.240]   amazon smart speakers in my house i would start feeling a little bit
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:14.920]   can a little bit worried because i'm not i'm not sure that i 100 trust amazon to do things that are
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:22.040]   guided by the right set of morals the fact that the fact that they seem to be driven
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.760]   mostly by numbers that it doesn't that doesn't they don't really care about bad reports about
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:30.920]   how people are being treated in their warehouses or but their delivery people the numbers say that
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.960]   this this system is working they will trust the numbers and so i feel as though we're asked google
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:40.760]   my opinion of them is that kind of nerdy person who will make mistakes only because they are not
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:46.040]   the most uh they're not socially inept but they are not the most apt person in the world that they
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.040]   will make a mistake but it'll be an honest mistake and they will fall over themselves to fix it i
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:55.320]   feel as though amazon is the company that if i were if if i were to use my smart speaker to say hi
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.880]   uh could you uh go on ebay and uh bid on that auction they would say do you know that the same
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:04.760]   product is available on amazon like i wanted on ebay i just ordered it for your for on amazon you
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.480]   can and we won't charge you until third until until ten days after you receive it like no that's not
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:15.720]   what i told you to do and i and sometimes i wonder whether apples focus on privacy is rooted in they
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:19.720]   started thinking about home products then they started realizing that people are going to be
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.640]   really worried about home products spying on them and then they you know this is because we know that
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:28.680]   apples been thinking about home products for a decade probably you know and and started and
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.920]   what kind of might have guided that that thought process was actually thinking about if we're
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.680]   gonna be in your home if we're gonna be in your car we're gonna be on your what on your hand
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.160]   that us saying we're not gonna pay attention to that that that's on our business model may not turn
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:47.000]   out today but a decade from now when people realize how screwed up that is that that they you know
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.720]   becomes the key you know one of the core actors now you're talking about footnotes i do have to
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:57.400]   know that if you look in mohave and the privacy preferences there's now a new advertising panel
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:05.160]   and where it will you can turn off apples tracking so that you get less customized ads in the app
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:12.440]   store and an apple news and uh... one of their places i'm blanking on stocks um so you know
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:18.920]   they're you know that they're doing it with their own stuff internally so there is a little bit of
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:25.000]   that you know why don't you walk the walk and just ditch this entire tracking nonsense
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.840]   rather than just give us a control over the other side will say that the you know like i kind of
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:35.640]   enjoy the at amazon ads on facebook you know you know what i do i i i do you know what's funny is
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:40.360]   is that is that is that they it knows me like i started to think it knows me better than i know
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.600]   myself like i look at stuff i'll look at the first page you know because it scrolls sideways
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.960]   and i look at the first one like that is crazy why would why would they advertise that to me and
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:51.240]   then you then you look at the next one you're like oh it's not that bad the next one you're like oh
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:55.400]   i really like that i didn't even know that that existed you know and so it's a they're definitely
[00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.480]   building some you know so there is something about the contextual that's that is i find kind of
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:04.200]   entertaining um and i kind of think because i don't want to encourage them so i just look at it and
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:10.040]   think about it don't encourage them no and i and i got to say the reason why i don't really watch
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:14.840]   anything this on broadcast television or go through my through my cable is that i get so
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:20.120]   p oed by the commercials i said did you put did you do did a slick did a slick talking
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:24.600]   huckster talking to buying a timeshare that turned out to be fraudulent and now you're buried
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:30.440]   under payments yeah talk to our slick talking hucksters well we'll we'll we'll help you we'll get
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:34.920]   you out of this horrible agreement and into a new agreement that if that still gets you screwed
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:39.160]   but stiff it helps us i know i'm kind of i have to admit that i'm kind of pleased that i would much
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:44.360]   rather see oh look remember that i was looking for for bicycle chain oil yesterday and now instead
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:50.120]   of seeing ads for like fraudulent home home lending schemes i'm looking for oh look there's that
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:53.880]   there's that bicycle oil i was thinking about but amazon still doesn't know that i bought it i buy
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:59.320]   so quickly that that usually i see these things i already bought i'm like yeah that's everywhere i
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:05.880]   bought tickets to cats the revival and Broadway and it's like one of my friends was uh was had
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:11.320]   one of the lead roles in it and so after like four or five or six months i'm like i want Chris
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:17.240]   to be in this role in this production as long as he wants to be in it but the sooner this this
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:23.320]   play this musical closes the sooner i will stop seeing ads to buy tickets for a show that i saw
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:29.800]   seven months ago yeah exactly all right so i just i just i just can't pay too much attention to these
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:34.680]   things then again i grew up you know my parents actually hooked up a uh a choke cable um you know
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.880]   so it's one of those things where you can push a push a lever and it moves something down at the
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:44.280]   other end and then my father actually drilled a hole for the vong control and the tv so that he
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.200]   could you know push something while he was lying down on the couch and shut the tv off during ads
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:54.040]   in the 1970s so you know just don't pay attention and one of the things you think about is that
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:58.520]   this whole ad market you know there the trouble is is this it's the same thing that happened in the
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:05.400]   music industry which is that is that in the 90s you know i think that really what killed the music
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:09.320]   industry it's now coming back but what really slammed the music industry and i happened to be in it
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:15.240]   during this tumultuous time that in the 80s we came out with compact discs and the compact
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:20.280]   great music sorry i'm talking great music i i'm great music because i'm we're i'm from the
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   oingo boy go go everybody hey man i hung out with danny elfman they had uh they had they they
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:33.480]   played at carnegy melon university in the back in the back campus or whatever and anyway
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:39.640]   it's great that anyway so but it's all the great music in the 80s yes yeah so so the uh uh uh
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:47.320]   so the issue the issue is is that what we saw in in music was that that uh we started bringing it up
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:52.360]   in 1990 1991 when i was working for sony we were like we're okay we know that the cds cost 44 cents
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:59.480]   a pop and the the the tapes cost 21 cents a unit you know to produce you know and the cds were 44
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:04.680]   cents a unit so there's a difference of 23 cents for the same ip you know that that was the conversation
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:10.600]   we're it's same ip but there's only 20 some cents you know and you're charging $6 and $16 so you
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.480]   when you say well we have to pay the artist well you have to pay the artist for the cassette too
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.800]   you know you know so so it's it's not quite that and we knew that the artist artists rates you know
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:22.360]   artist producer rates were in two three dollar range maybe up to four depending on the artist
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:28.040]   so we knew what the numbers kind of uh you know were on that and we just said we're charging way
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:32.520]   too much for these you know we're actually you know and there was a band called um Ned's atomic
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:38.280]   dustbin that was one of the bands i was promoting at the time and and they decided to take their album
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:45.000]   and do a a sale at $9.99 instead of $16.99 or whatever across the board and it you know sold like hot
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.280]   cakes you know there was definitely a lot of pressure for people who wanted those that type
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:55.640]   of pricing and um and so we were there was a bunch of us that were proponents and you know at risk of
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:59.720]   getting to a lot of trouble telling everyone we have to lower the price i mean cds should be $8.99
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:06.920]   or $9.99 and they didn't do that and uh and so the um so what happens is you have a lot of people
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:10.600]   who just know they're being taken advantage of when tower records are selling at $18.99 for
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:15.880]   something we just know we're being screwed you know and so what that does is it disconnects that
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:20.440]   connection to the brand so no one felt bad when napster came out they were like they've been screwed
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:25.480]   us the whole time like we're just gonna you know like no one felt bad you know like for and and
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.800]   that was the they were completely they weren't part of that community they didn't care and and so
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:35.160]   then you ended up with um you know napster you know and and i think that in ads i mean the ads drive
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:39.400]   us crazy um and and i think that a lot of people are trying to figure it out you figure out there's
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.560]   gotta be some fall where where people just start moving away from things that have you know a lot
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:47.080]   of ads i don't watch tv because i can't deal with it anymore my kids have never seen them
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:52.040]   my kids there's like one month in our entire life where they saw what about youtube uh they
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.120]   maybe they seem at the very beginning but they're not used to interruptions so they're used to like
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.680]   i pay my price of if you know when they go back to their ipad and play roblox until the ad's done
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:04.440]   and then they start watching what i'm watching you know that's that's kind of their their what they
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.200]   do but the idea that you would have they're used to the break where their ad used to be in hulu
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:13.240]   and like it goes dark and then it comes back up but to them that's the entire like the break
[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:19.400]   so anyway so we've got updates coming up uh the uh we're gonna be talking about the new updates
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.880]   they all came out this week or many of them came out all but one uh came out this week but before
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:29.480]   we get to that and i think leo has a couple couple words for us our uh sorry interrupt guys but our
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:33.480]   episode of mac break weekly they brought to you by fresh books i thought i'd tell you about it
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:39.880]   because i am a customer i was for a long time when i was going up to canada and doing the call for
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:45.320]   help show and uh the lab with leo show i had to bill you know and do expenses and all that stuff
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:49.320]   and i'd do it in canadian dollars it was real pain in fact in fact some months i would just
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:56.520]   forget or maybe intentionally forget and i did learn that when you don't bill you don't get paid
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:03.800]   amber macarthur told me about a new terrazzo startup this is two thousand four web 2.0 startup
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:09.720]   called fresh books two thousand four two thousand five something like that now let me tell you i
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:16.760]   don't know how to do accounting and most accounting software is really made for account it's not business
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:21.480]   owners bookkeepers people understand things like double entry accounting fresh books is an owner
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:26.040]   first accounting platform that puts you the small business owner back in control of your business
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:32.360]   but you have all the information you need fresh books uh they call it uh approachable accounting
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:38.200]   is absolutely full industry standard double entry accounting but your fingers and yours though
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:45.160]   because i know that as soon as i hear that i go ah but no because it's you don't do it they do it
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:52.600]   it's automatic it's painless and it really works you quickly can generate access accounting reports
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   like things like general ledger trial balance chart of accounts that's right there in the fresh
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:03.480]   books dashboard and you know what you can share those reports with your accountant your financial
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:08.120]   advisor your tax prep guy and they'll go oh yeah well you must have a bookkeeper right no
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:14.200]   fresh books does it for me of course uh i started using fresh books because it let me send
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:20.520]   professional looking invoices and seconds they still do that beautifully you can see which invoices
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:25.480]   have been sent which invoices been paid which invoices are overdue even which invoices have been viewed
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:32.040]   or not so your your client can't say well i didn't see it yes you did i know you did it says it right
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:36.360]   here you saw it except online payments right from your invoice clients do like that because they
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:40.440]   push a button they pay you you don't have to set up a merchant account or anything it's all part of
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:46.600]   the fresh books service and this is great you get paid because clients it makes it easy for clients
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:52.040]   it eliminates the friction you get paid on average about twice as fast thanks to fresh books you're

[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:56.600]   One thing that i i forgot to talk about when we were going through the whole thing was the
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:02.840]   how big of a deal for many people the apple watch was for the last presentation people like
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.960]   i the phone is okay but people were really excited about the about the apple watch
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:13.400]   Megan did you what did you think of the of that as far as i thought it was exciting i've had
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.240]   every apple watch and this is the first time that it will actually really physically change
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:23.400]   so i'm excited about that i am excited i talked about this on ios today i'm excited about the
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:29.080]   fall detection because yesterday i had a fall you can see a little bit of bruising and i know
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:34.600]   the first thing i i was running and i fell and i was alone and the first thing i thought was like
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:40.440]   oh if i only had my new apple watch like it'd be calling 911 right now while i'm lying here i got up
[01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:47.000]   but um you sort of forget how first all easiest is to fall even you know when you're not elderly
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:53.080]   and what a shock it is to just go down and because i was just thinking like how is apple gonna
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:59.080]   know that but of course if they know if i'm riding a bike or you know running it's gonna know a
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:05.400]   fall is a very certain thing so i'm excited about that so speaking i actually had exactly the same
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:12.680]   thing on a Wednesday morning right before the uh the presentation i went down on my bike
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:18.520]   loose gravel and managed to rip up my palm and so i was thinking about it when they were talking
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:24.520]   about this as well and it interested me because i i'm running a bike a lot and so i have gone down
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:30.520]   many times and in many most cases frankly the last thing i want is 911 being called
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:39.320]   and i don't want to even have to think about calling off 911 so it's um what i've heard and i'm
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:45.400]   you know being able to copy the gotten one yet to confirm this is that the feature is
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:51.080]   allowed by default on 65 and so if you are younger than that you'll need to turn it on manually
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:57.240]   and that if it does activate you have it won't it won't act sorry it will notice your fall but it
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:04.200]   won't activate until unless you've been immobile for a minute so you know when i fell down i was
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:10.280]   not immobile i was getting up and yelling and screaming and swearing and all those things that
[01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:16.360]   you usually do when you fall in a stupid way and are mad at yourself so it shouldn't have been a
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.200]   problem but that's i do want to see a little bit of how this is works because i think it's going to be
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:26.600]   absolutely brilliant for senior citizens who are really concerned about this or kids whose
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:32.040]   parents are getting older and maybe are a little less stable than they used to be on the one hand
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:36.760]   and uh you know and obviously the rest of the health monitoring features uh with the the ecg
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:43.000]   and the afib detection and whatnot um boy this becomes a no-brainer for for people of certain
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.560]   health conditions scenarios and do we think that the watch is really the next the next core
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:55.400]   piece of hardware for apple oh it already is uh they've said they they i don't think they made
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:01.800]   any bones about their interest in pursuing health as a whole category and uh after after a couple
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:07.480]   of fall starts with the apple watch bullet it it find it's it's it's it's slot in the road there and
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:13.480]   boys are going fast and furious uh and not and not just we'll just we'll just keep trying uh new
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:17.480]   different fitness and health features and see which ones work and which ones don't they really
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.760]   have a plan moving forward uh even uh even before they had the ability of the processing power in
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:29.640]   the sensors to do things like ecg, ecg and uh and false and fall detection they were still talking
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:35.960]   about how we are we're basically creating a new sort of heart health study uh that if people opt
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:40.120]   into it they will be collecting data that that so that we'll have a data so that researchers will
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.920]   have a data set they have never had before in terms of activity heart rate and all kinds of other
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:50.280]   health statistics so this has been an aggressive part of of of their business not just uh not just
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:56.440]   a product uh it's uh it's it really does throw everything else to shade the same the same week that
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:02.760]   apple uh through the through the wraps off of the apple watch series four uh couple days actually
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:08.600]   couple uh couple days before that quark calm and quasi google got together to announce sort of
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:14.520]   like the next wave of of hardware coming for for android where now called where o s but we're
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:18.440]   gonna keep calling it android where because that's what we're calling it for ten years uh or whatever
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:25.480]   and really they're they really couldn't say that anything they really couldn't show off anything
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:32.360]   that seemed important whereas the the the apple watch announcement everything just seemed important
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:37.640]   it's not just making you more fit but helping to extend your life and save your life uh the the
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.960]   the uh quark calm announcement was all about hey now we we're basically making a much better
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:47.560]   processor uh with a co-processor so that when you don't need android where the operating system and
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:52.200]   you just want to it to tell the time and be a fitness watch it can power down the main cpu
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.960]   and can also make it much much smaller you can use a smaller battery so michael coars and uh and all
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.840]   these basically they they are repositioning it as a fashion brand that ain't i'm a fashion designer
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:07.800]   who has watches in their line want to have a fitness watch or want to have a smart watch here is the
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:12.840]   operating system and the platform you want to do with it which is nice but it's not like by the way
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:18.360]   if you're if you're your mom who's been having these disney spells falls down she won't have to
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:24.120]   somehow drag herself to to a phone she will be able to tap a button and not necessarily not even
[01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:29.480]   necessarily call 911 but call her next door neighbor to please come over not not in a six thousand
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.280]   dollar ambulance but just help me get back up and help me get back upstairs that's how you sell
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.600]   four hundred dollar watches my friend and the reason that i'm you know i'm buying one for my dad for
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:45.080]   christmas hope he doesn't listen to this but a year ago my dad my dad had you know he had his heart
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:50.200]   you know he had a feeling a bad feeling went to the doctor they did some tests seemed like it was
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:55.560]   okay they said just rest and we'll have you come back in if you feel anything else and then you
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:01.320]   know my dad being my dad went and was the lead in a play the next day the next night you know
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:05.160]   he didn't want to let anybody down so he was like he's like the show almost go on
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:10.200]   community no exactly community theater you know and he felt like he was gonna you know then he felt
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.200]   horrible he felt sick he felt all his other things well he's having a heart attack you know like and
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.320]   and and he got you know he almost died the next day you know and so he's
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.200]   by now and you know doing more than he's supposed to and all those things but i'm like i need to
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:27.960]   put a watch on that because he would have gotten alerts if you have that you should have put a
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:32.680]   watch on it if you love it then you should have put an apple watch on it to before watch with
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:37.000]   fuckball control on it yeah what i mean but the thing is is that that afternoon or whatever it
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   would have been like your heart is going crazy you need to go to the doctor right now you know like
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.480]   it would have told him something you know like i think so i mean we'll find so it my my father
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:51.560]   worked long we were talking father stories um a year ago my father had heartful repair and uh and
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:57.240]   so it was all successful and everything like that but you know it's about as major surgery as you get
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:02.040]   and so he didn't feel so good and you know had to keep going to the doctors or you know maybe
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:08.360]   this was just regular stuff and one of the problems was that when he didn't feel good was never when
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:16.040]   he was at the doctor right so so this was um this was a really like last July or two years ago in
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:21.800]   July and so in January of twenty twenty eighteen when the cardio band came out or uh December i
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.840]   guess it's twenty seventeen um we got a macardiaband which is apple was going on about this is the
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:33.160]   first fda blah blah no the cardiaband did this in in December and January um and you know you could
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:38.680]   you know put your finger on it and it would give you an easy yeah an ecg and it was interesting
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:47.400]   um and he did it and he wore it for a while um i think what we learned is that ec
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:53.240]   electrocardiograms are one not necessarily something that you as an individual can interpret
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:08:01.480]   um and two that you there's a lot of things that can cause variability so just because you can take
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:07.880]   one and it might look weird or you know that doesn't necessarily mean anything so you know they
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:12.920]   i think in the case that i was talking about is just that you know already went to the hospital
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.680]   it's a warning that you know you were paying attention to it now you really need to pay attention
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.000]   to it and um yeah i'm more talking about the ecg spist stuff specifically that people are going
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:27.480]   to be looking at this and saying wow i've got this weird spike yeah a lot of people have weird spikes
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.880]   this is not something to be freaked out about necessarily go talk to a doctor and get a
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:36.120]   yeah more serious one done if you think it's a real problem and i think that what's more interesting
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:43.800]   to me about this is not so much how it helps the individual but as a group how it's you know it
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:48.680]   with all that data going back in you know anonymized and you know all the things that apple's gonna
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.840]   do when people want to join that study you could theoretically have thousands hundreds of thousands
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:57.880]   millions of people participating in a study where they may see tremors they may see things that are
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:04.440]   happening um in in someone when they're wearing the watch that uh that may be a precursor to a
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:09.080]   heart problem that might not present itself right until three months from now you know that we see
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:14.120]   that when we see this three months before then they then they don't know well it's you know like
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:18.600]   we would prefer not to figure that out early it's it's important to set proper expectations for
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:25.880]   this when most people think about uh in ekg they think about the classic like 12 it's a 12 sensors
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.440]   a much more complicated piece of equipment and an actual technician that's reading things out
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:36.040]   these are the this is the sort of ekg that can say that can do more than just say huh that's funny
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:40.200]   it can actually diagnose problems and say there's something specific that we think is going wrong
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:45.240]   and this is what this this is what we're going to be looking at next uh we're asked this is a
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:51.480]   technically like a two contact ekg and from what I understand so I've been spending a week trying
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:57.160]   to understand I've been talking to more cardigan it's weird that uh you know there is this history
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.400]   of heart disease in my family I should have been talking to cardiologist long before now but no
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:07.160]   I'm learning about I'm learning about ekg synch cardiology basically to figure out what apple is saying
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:13.400]   about this device uh my impression is that uh it's uh it's the people on like cardiology like
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.360]   message boards actual doctor message boards are really really excited about it they are echoing
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:24.440]   pretty much the same things that uh that uh that uh uh that has already been said here that it's
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:31.880]   something that really key ekg is different from a two sensor ekg and also it has to the their only
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:37.880]   fear about this technology is that even if its utility is to just tell the difference between
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:44.120]   your heart seem I'm these these my sensors indicate captain that uh your heart is a normal sinus
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:51.080]   rhythm or be captain I'm seeing an anomaly I don't know what that anomaly is uh and also the FDA
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:58.280]   I also uh this morning found the FDA approval papers for it uh that came through uh a day before
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.840]   the announcement uh they're filed their they're filed the first or second week in
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:07.560]   august the FDA finally came through with their approval one day before uh but the paper the
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.720]   actual paperwork says that and that lists here's what here's the here are the conditions under
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:16.200]   which we can approve this as a as a device as a de novo device meaning this is the first of
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.440]   its kind and so we have to give new rules for it because you can't there's no precedent that you
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.120]   can point to to say this is how this thing is going to work and one of them is saying that this
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:30.120]   that you're so that the software can't diagnose anything it has to the decision of what's going on
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:34.680]   what needs to be done is something that always has to be done in consultation with the doctor
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.600]   so I don't I don't know uh I still have questions in at apple as exactly what
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:45.080]   kind of uh alerts what the actual text the alerts are but the my impression here uh here
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:50.200]   like uh less than a week after the announcement still never having actually put my hands on one of
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.840]   these watches even in a demo area yet is that it's going to be sort of a it would be a binary sort
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.400]   of thing where this seems like normal sinus rhythm or no this does not seem like normal sinus
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:05.240]   rhythm it could be an a fib and then the ability to export all that data into a pdf but what else
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:09.720]   was saying I love what there's so much so much I love about this even if it's not again I'm a
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:15.080]   real like 12 sensor EKG and this and this and this I think I mentioned this last week but it's still
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.560]   very much on my mind it wouldn't be great if at some point there's actually like a checkbox that's
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:24.760]   sort of like the organ donor card like on organ donor checkbox and the driver's license saying that
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:30.440]   at the risk that where if you if you drill down into the settings for health or for the watch
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:38.840]   it says okay at the risk of being morbid if you are dying if you check this box you give us permission
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:45.480]   to basically start like a a part of this software we call the black box like the flight recorder
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.360]   so that when you die we have a whole bunch of data that no not only is going to be available to the
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:55.400]   people who are trying to resuscitate you but is also packaged so that researchers can then actually
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:01.400]   see we had we had all these sensors hooked up to someone who is in the process of dying unexpectedly
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.200]   so that we can collect maybe thousands of these pieces of data and detect when something is going
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:12.360]   kind of screwy to tell people that hi by the way your your 10 o'clock appointment you're gonna have
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:17.720]   to leave right now because the traffic is getting a little bit late your package is going to be
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.720]   delivered at 2 p.m. today and i think there's an 18% chance that you're having a stroke right now so
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:29.480]   maybe you want to add like a detour point or just as you at some point your watch just says
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:36.760]   it will take you 26 minutes to get to the hospital and you have you have 32 minutes to live we
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:43.560]   recommend that you that you move quickly it starts it starts displaying your bucket list from from
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:48.920]   apple notes with the time remaining the time remaining is not just the time to get to
[01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:52.360]   you know because you know George Carlin always said you know wouldn't it be great if you had a
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.200]   two-minute warning you know two minutes to get your yeah i would like it to just like tweet
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.520]   something funny and sweet and also post something on facebook and instagram so you're not stuck
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:03.960]   with like that stupid thing you said that's what i'm always afraid like i'm gonna die and
[01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:08.280]   it's gonna be some dumb tweet that everyone's gonna look at this is all turned very far stop here
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.600]   but i was thinking it would have nice to have an animated gif of an adorable baby elephant
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.240]   as trying to cuddle with somebody but it's falling over no no no don't go to twitter that that that
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:21.640]   doofbag is tweeting again if you don't want this to be your last thought yeah
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:27.640]   but it's not a series the research i mean that is it's my understanding that part of
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:34.040]   how they develop this ecg technology is through the heart study that we signed up for it didn't
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:39.000]   sign up for like they are constantly doing that kind of research if you sign up for the heart study it
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.560]   went i think three or four months it ended and you know who knew who knows what it was doing but it
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:48.360]   was taking rates of your heart rate and at different times and i compared it to other people and it
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:53.960]   was all very different so they as long as you sign up for it um and give it okay they are and it's
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:15:00.040]   pretty easy to do and i would if you have i mean unless you're super afraid of um not protecting
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:04.120]   your privacy i think that there's no reason if you have an apple watch to sign up for the hard
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.920]   studies they have so that you can add and make this stuff better well and i think that that is also
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:13.560]   gets back into why it's so privacy is so important for apple that it's not anonymizing all that data
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.960]   it's and you probably trust apple that they're going to be able to keep that secret and so you
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.360]   know you don't feel like it's affecting your insurance and your employability and you know all those
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.400]   other things because that it is revolution and i don't think a lot of us would let amazon or google
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:32.040]   or facebook do the same thing because i feel like we would be selling us diabetes pills or something
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:38.440]   you know like it would be the dash button yeah exactly yeah dash buttons so so the anyway
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:47.960]   the updates have uh have started to roll out um ios uh has has um you know been been out i think
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:52.520]   most of us have updated i think uh andi uh what is the one of the things we should be looking for in
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:57.480]   the new ios release uh the first thing you're gonna notice is that whether you have a notch or not
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:02.920]   everything in the top row of your phone or ipad has been moved over as though your device has a notch
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:09.000]   so i i got i got this when i finally finished installing this this is not the biggest feature
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.160]   but this is like oh wow isn't it we're oh that's why the the date and time is now over on the left
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:22.280]   hand edge of the screen not in the middle uh but yes i say it's it's feels faster it feels more fluid
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:27.240]   there's going to be some more gestures if you have an older device that now you will have to know
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:31.800]   because for instance uh turning on the brightness and the volume is no longer attached to the swipe
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:37.160]   up now you have to use the same corner in uh drag as uh as people with the iphonex have been using
[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:44.680]   for the past year or so uh but really serie shortcuts is the big big uh win of this entire update uh it's
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.240]   it's it's packed with protein top to bottom and it seems to be pretty stable but the ability to
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:55.640]   finally have a degree of control over your uh over your phone and over your ipad to simply say
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:02.120]   here is here is here's something that i do every single morning before i leave the house to and to
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:07.960]   adjust the lights uh make make sure that i send a send a message to somebody tell them i'm on my way
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.920]   find out what the weather's going to be find out what the traffic is going to be why do i have to
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:15.880]   do that step by step by step by step by step i could script this if i was on a mac but i'm not i'm on my
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:21.640]   iphone something that i spent more than my mac more than i spent on my mac and now the ability to do
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:27.800]   that automatically and then not just not only that but simply say uh you know h slo-mo i'm i'm leaving
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:32.840]   the house now and had these 13 things happen for you automatically and then i've obviously
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:37.800]   happened had the the final version installed long enough for it to learn what i want but
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.840]   eventually it will i don't even have to create these shortcuts it will just simply know that uh
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:49.000]   it'll it'll figure out that while it's it's uh it's nine a.m it's Tuesday he usually goes out to
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.960]   breakfast with friends so he will just simply add a little alert a little gentle notification
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.680]   saying touch this to get the traffic to the the diner where you're meeting your friends uh because
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:03.240]   that's something that it knows i'm going to be checking every single time it's Tuesday morning
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:08.280]   at around nine a.m. uh this is going to be uh i hesitate to use the word game changer because it's
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:13.240]   kind of meaningless it's been used so much but this is the sort of thing that gets someone like me
[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.000]   who's been using an android phone for about something like the past five years do you think
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.640]   iOS is pretty nice now and gosh those that's stay this did he did he say surgical stainless steel
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:28.920]   the body of that new iPhone 10 well does it gosh it's really nice do we think it drives the home
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:34.680]   the home automation market on an apple on the apple side with shortcuts for me you know i
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:39.720]   i can see myself wanting it to start boiling the water when it realizes i picked up the phone in
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.160]   the morning you know as soon as it's a big of the phone i really want the water to start boiling i
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:47.000]   don't have a i don't have a pot that knows how to do that yet so you don't have a smart pot
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:51.880]   you don't have a smart pot you have a smart pan you have a smart pan i'm waiting for the smart
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.400]   pan are you getting a smart pan i want to see if you like it first okay i'm getting it yeah
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:19:00.840]   but that's interesting because like i do have a connected coffee maker it's not it's not home
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:09.400]   kit enabled obviously um or even uh amazon echo enabled but i do use the app to start the coffee i
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:14.040]   wonder if if the next time i do that if series shortcuts will recognize that and be able to do
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:18.520]   that you just say if the app supports it yeah uh the app is supporting that's going to be the real
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.840]   problem i mean you know that every time i sort of think oh i'd love to automate this thing that i
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:29.400]   do on my iPhone the app doesn't support it you know that every night i want to turn on the libby app
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:35.560]   and listen to the current audiobook for 15 minutes let's sleep timer but i you know until libby allows
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:40.840]   me to do that and then invoke it with serie i'm gonna be opening the app tapping play tapping
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:45.560]   15 minute timer and then putting the phone down and you know those those actions are going to be
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:50.840]   unavoidable until uh the app i want supports the those capabilities then also how deep into the
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.520]   app will will the app support it you know i know right yeah when when mpr allows for the playlist
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:01.400]   again which they've said that they're going to do i'm very uh very sad i was with the npr playlist
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:04.600]   they're gonna put it back in they've said that they're putting it back in they said this is
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:10.600]   by the way we're sending it we're gonna get it they acquired my my friend Russell Lavonovich
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:17.560]   had a co-head of pocketcast to create to basically not only be to make pocketcast an internal project
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:23.480]   but also to inform and counsel the development of podcasting and and digital broadcasting i'm sure
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:28.040]   that we will see it if not we know who to beat up in australia it's gonna happen well i have a
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:33.400]   question for you adam does the audible app uh support it because i think that that um you know it's i
[01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:40.520]   don't know i have to admit um when i i mentioned libby uh libby is a new app from overdrive i love
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:47.240]   libby and um yeah and the beauty of it is is that living in new york state as i do um everyone who
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:52.760]   pays taxes in new york can get a new york public library electronic card and then take out ebooks
[01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:57.560]   and audiobooks from the new york public library which is a huge huge collection much better than
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:04.440]   and bigger than the fengalakes library system that is here in ithaca and so i you know honestly
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:11.400]   not buying books much because i read fast and i you know it just works well to get from the library
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:16.840]   and we know one in one out i love it's a great app too it's really nicely designed now yeah it
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:23.000]   seems to it's it works well you know it's it's it's i have to say i i only consider book reading apps to be
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:32.040]   fine or bad i mean either they work the way you expect and it's just okay or they suck
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:36.680]   well and do you really kind of just be how could you have thought this i i guess i i keep on thinking
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:42.760]   this is the last opportunity for apple with you know with the books app is that is that the
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:47.240]   there's an opportunity because apple doesn't have to follow along of creating books that are really
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:50.840]   interactive creating books that are and and part of me thinks that that maybe that's where they're
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:55.960]   trying to go towards with texture and so on so forth maybe not but i i feel like books are you know
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:02.680]   when we when we put the it's kind of when we take a book and we scan it or whatever and or and
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:07.560]   convert it to a digital format and put it on a phone and then read it it's kind of like you know
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.960]   it we're taking this old thing and putting it on something new rather than saying you know we could
[01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.360]   build something that's much more interesting you know and and i think you know then that had video
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:22.600]   and had things you had a lot of it no i mean that's that's that's that's nice but i think you i think
[01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:27.960]   you're overthinking it's just it's it's like what if the white album is fine you know the the Abbey
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:32.440]   Road album is fine you don't have to say but if we're moving this on to a phone shouldn't we have
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:37.320]   like augmented reality and and we should have like started the pepper land band actually marching
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:42.760]   and playing on your desktop where no the the thing is the thing that was created was this the album
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.840]   that was designed to be listened to i don't without cartoon sergeant pepper land i think i think books
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:51.080]   in the same way they're one of the things that's so brilliant about it is that it really is just
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:57.560]   ASCII text so long as you just take that that uh that that pile of eight bit eight bit data and
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:02.360]   pour it into another container it will assume the shape of that container and absolutely work i
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:06.120]   i think taking old books and doing that makes sense i just think that as you look at new books i think
[01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.320]   that the the issue is is that i i know that i know that i'm not though i'm not having enough time
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:17.560]   convincing someone to publish my novel to convince them to also find 1.2 million dollars
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.680]   to build this entire digital strategy around it so that frankly i never i never thought was part
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.920]   of it because i really wanted to write a funny story about someone who manufactures cardboard boxes
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:33.000]   in australia so yeah so speaking as someone who was a book publisher and actually my degree from
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.680]   Cornell is in hypertextual fiction so i actually have been doing you know sort of go beyond the book
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:48.760]   since 1988 and the problem is is exactly what Andy was saying is is that writing a book is something
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:55.400]   someone can do without a whole lot of other people and you might need an editor you probably
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:24:01.240]   need proofreaders etc etc maybe an indexer but that's all really easy and relatively cheap as
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:07.480]   soon as you get into audio video interactivity you are talking video games you know you're talking
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:12.600]   massive production budgets you're talking skills that the author doesn't have the author may not
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:19.000]   even have the art direction skills to explain what they want they they probably frankly don't
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.840]   want anything and so every time i see one of these books i i look at them periodically and
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:31.480]   they're moderately interesting but i've never seen one of these things where i you know and this is
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:37.240]   over decades of of looking and being back in the academic research just no one does anything
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:40.440]   that interesting is what it comes down i just think that you know that is the
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:46.360]   maybe so i mean i i know that that you know uh we build a lot of hardware that does things
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:51.080]   that no nothing else doesn't do it doesn't yeah hasn't been done before because we know that
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.720]   there is a market there somewhere that is going to allow us to to do that process and
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:01.560]   and immediately i think back in the mid 90s an animation company asked me to write their manual
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.240]   and of course i said if i'm gonna write the manual this is what i want it was basically built in
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.120]   hypercard you know like you know like early 90s it was like i want to build the whole thing
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:12.120]   hypercard you can click on things and they'll be little animations and and they and the issue is
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:18.600]   is that there was a um and what where i really got it when i did build a little um how to internally
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:23.320]   when i was working at a company about how to use this it's called mr nitro it was the thing that
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.240]   blew things up in computer graphics you know which i'm really good at is blowing things up so
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:36.280]   anyway so um uh as i still can we're anyway i'm not gonna show so anyway uh but the um uh what i did
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.960]   is i built thousands of of samples where i just changed the i changed everything slowly changed
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:47.320]   all the variables you know five points at a time and and and built literally thousands of
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.760]   renditions and then you could just change them and hit the button and watch it and what happened
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:54.440]   was is immediately you understood how it worked like if you just changed it and you you could just
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:57.800]   change all these things and immediately hit go because instead of rendering for four hours
[01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:03.080]   the the iteration rate had you completely understand what you were looking at very quickly
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:09.080]   and i realized how important at that moment getting animations and seeing video of something
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:13.720]   you know changes the way you interact with it and changes how fast you can assimilate and i think
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:17.800]   that i i personally think that that the future of education is going to be a lot more video driven
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:23.160]   than than what we have now you know and you know i i have said this before on the show that you know
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:27.880]   text is a highly efficient compression and deep you know it's a highly efficient compression
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:32.600]   technology that takes a lot of power on the end code and decode to to um you know get the full
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.920]   value out of it and so so you have if someone really good at writing someone really good at
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:43.160]   at uh reading it and i think that the the issue is is that we could teach people a lot faster if we
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:48.040]   weren't slowed down by that compression technology so you know we there's some people who are good at
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:52.440]   reading but we spent two million years watching somebody else do something and learning how to do
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:56.760]   it by by looking at what they were doing you know and there's a lot of um you know and that's been
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.800]   the the issue that i've had and it's really it's been really funny you know i i've gotten close to
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.440]   writing books before um and it's mostly been a thing of like if i can't add a bunch of interactive
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:08.440]   stuff i'm not i'm not interested because i'm so so i do think i think you actually i mean you make
[01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:13.800]   a good point in terms of tutorial or you know specifically when you were till the learning of
[01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:18.360]   physical task that kind of thing i say but but 90 percent of a bookstore i mean what used to be
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:22.200]   bookstores 90 percent of bookstores non-fiction it was about something we were interested in you know
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:26.760]   10 percent was fiction now they might have a lot of best sellers but when you look at the mass of a
[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:30.600]   boarders bookstore there's one section that's non-fiction and the rest of it's all about things
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.960]   that we're interested in you know it's not you know it's it is not um you know it's not a fiction-driven
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:42.760]   business you know the you know it's uh you know so that's the sure you're right i mean fiction
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.040]   that doesn't make sense i mean i don't think i think fiction is fine for all the books
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:51.960]   and actually i guess what i was what i was going to go for though is is that i mean this this video
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:59.080]   podcast notwithstanding um you know i find that i far prefer FaceTime audio when talking with my
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:04.360]   parents for instance i know what my parents look like i don't need to have a phone you know we could
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:09.800]   do a video call you know we have vast all this technology and what it turns out is voice is in
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:15.800]   fact all we need um and i'll just because we can do something i will be talking about that and i
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.400]   think that there are definitely subjects that i don't think necessarily make sense for for this
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:24.920]   i mean there's a lot of things i like to listen to i hate video calls like i'm i'm which is funny
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.000]   because my entire business is built on video video interaction over i mean i mean i mean we did
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:34.040]   800 Hangouts you know you know you know for for for clients and so i i you know it was my business
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.480]   it was really funny because google could never get me on the on a video call like they hate it
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:40.600]   when i hang out and i'm like i don't have enough bandwidth and i just call in you know because i was
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:44.680]   like i'm not interested because i do all kinds of things while i'm on the phone you know i clean my
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:48.440]   office and it keeps me calm as to like clean my office and fiddle with things and everything else
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:52.280]   and and so if you put me on a video call i'm literally looking at the at the thing of how fast
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:57.160]   can i get off this call maybe that's why they do it but i was like i for video calls i would have a
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:00.920]   i have a i have an agenda we're gonna move through that agenda and we're gonna close this with and
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:06.680]   give me back 15 minutes so so it's an interesting uh so i agree with you on that i i think that anyway
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:13.160]   yes that's a whole nother yeah we're going down a raffle so many rabbit holes so we're going down one
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:19.080]   round now do we think of the life balance do we care about the life balance you mean this the
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:25.000]   in the stream time and i care about it a lot um for myself and for my children and i said it
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:30.120]   um for myself i think it still only has some work i said it yesterday i might for myself and i said
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:36.680]   that you know i was going to go dormant between 10 and 10 and 10 and 10 and 7 it went fine usually
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:40.680]   i have do not disturb on but that doesn't keep me from picking up twitter you know and looking at it
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:45.640]   but it's 6 30 i did the thing that i normally do which is to check twitter at 6 30 in the morning
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:51.240]   first thing i do and it said my time limit was up which isn't accurate because really just i was
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:55.240]   on that just do not disturb it wasn't that i'd reach my time limit but i didn't check twitter i was
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:30:00.840]   like oh you know what it's 6 30 and i could just um just go eat breakfast with my kids and do other
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:05.800]   things besides being on twitter so it was a nice reminder um but i did try to set it up with my
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:11.720]   kids who have all like they're 15 13 and 13 and they've had many years without it and they've also
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:16.440]   had many years of me throwing like things that were in beta screen you know things that purported to
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:21.240]   help you manage your kids screen time but really just mixed up all their apps and drove them insane
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:27.880]   um so they're already wary and both my boys who have the iphone se's said well will it work if i
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:34.680]   don't update ios 12 and that's because maybe we won't update ios 12 because i can say because i'm
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:41.000]   updated and i'll show me them it'll show me you know my kids in there um it is rather confusing even
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.080]   for me and there's some questionable placement but it is better than what was there before and i
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:52.680]   think it's nice just for a reminder for me or for them that like hey you've had you know you've been
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:57.000]   playing games for two hours like do you know want to do something else for me the interesting thing
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:02.600]   is that i've i started reading a lot about the pot that there are some theories that the whole
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:08.840]   screen time push and the amber color and all those things are that they're finding the blue color
[01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:13.880]   may cause macular degeneration and i had this at the same time i was reading that i was noticing
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:19.480]   that i when i spent a lot of time on my phone i was feeling like there was a like a blind spot
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:24.040]   you know like like you know kind of like a burnt out screen on my eyes so i just turn my phone to
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:29.960]   amber all the time like i just said it it starts at 10 p.m and ends at 9 59 p.m. scheduled you know if
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:33.640]   i want to watch a movie i'll turn it off i'm never watching a show but other than one i just leave
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:37.960]   it on amber the whole time i leave it on half and i've noticed how much better my eye now i didn't
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:43.960]   slow down how much screen time i have slowed down how much we we never had these problems with our
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:51.880]   eyes when our phones had CRTs in them i've always said that if you have a good cga ega card and a phone
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:58.360]   a good like not a screen you don't have to be any bigger than that back in two you know never any
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:03.480]   i-string whatsoever i think that's your next year's future always but i-string no problem and what do
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:08.360]   we think are the big for the watchOS also came out um what are the the new features that we're most
[01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:15.880]   excited about automatic workout detection finally i mean why should you have to start remember to
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:21.080]   start your workout you know you know and then you don't remember and then until you're halfway in
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:24.840]   like oh now i've missed it and you get why you can't actually control the apple watch drove
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:29.000]   builder anyway i'm trying to figure out what i'm and i have to admit my workouts are very old
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.640]   fashion so i all i need so at least at least running i don't do any of the other workouts and i don't
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:39.480]   okay i don't i mean i sort of do this for amusement value because uh i'm always using a Garmin 620
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:47.400]   for my real stuff but um but basically you just start running and about three minutes in um you'll
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:51.560]   get a little tap on your wrist and it will say it looks like you're doing a workout would you like
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:58.120]   me to start and you tap a green button and uh and it uh retroactively applies all everything you
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:05.480]   did in terms of time and distance to when you started um it's not it's it's smart about starting
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:12.280]   and it's smart about ending it's not very smart about pausing pausing it it seems to be it seems
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:18.680]   to check arm movement and so if you're you know talking with people or stretching and just moving
[01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:23.960]   around it will often start up and so your times and thus your paces will be quote unquote wrong
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:29.400]   but it's very good about uh you know you get you get in there the other thing you do is you get back
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:34.440]   in the car um after your after your workout and you drive home and you're like oh i forgot to turn
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:41.400]   off my workout look i've been going running really fast for the last three months um is that you
[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:46.440]   have to in if you do stuff with Strava there's actually a uh you know i think you can edit your
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:51.480]   segment to you know cut out the part where you were driving because it's obviously stupid
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:57.160]   and so it is nice that again it will retroactively go back and say yeah yeah you you ended this a
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:03.080]   while ago let's let's take care of that properly so i just think that's brilliant you know there's no
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:07.560]   reason why it shouldn't be able to use these sensors to figure out what you're doing and react
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:13.160]   appropriately the pausing was already included like if you said it um like when i walk my dog and
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:18.360]   i said a walk and then he has to stop and sniff everything it'll just stop if i'm not moving i
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:23.880]   found that to be pretty useful but maybe um that's just because my heart rate isn't very high well
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:29.560]   it's not hard i said i think it's our motion so so for instance for me i park you know if i'm driving
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:35.480]   to go running um i park for car i run a mile into where i meet my friends and then i do various
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:41.560]   various sorts of dynamic stretching exercises to warm up um for the run it doesn't shut off
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:45.960]   during any of those dynamic stretching exercises because i'm actually moving i'm not running like
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:49.400]   mine doesn't even know if i'm i use a recumbent bike that's what i watch because i like
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:54.520]   i the one way to get me to bike a lot is the as like i sit down on recumbent in the gym and i
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:58.920]   and i just i watch a show like i just like i get to watch a show but i don't really want to
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:04.040]   winter right so unfortunately if i do a movie then i get really tired and you know because i
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:09.320]   just like two and a half hours in there so the bike turns off a couple times like hey you got to
[01:35:09.320 --> 01:35:14.040]   get out of here there's people waiting for you you know and uh but um uh is anyone excited about
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:18.600]   the walkie talking as has anyone used the walkie talkie it's funny hasn't updated her watch yet
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:23.560]   so i haven't got a chance i haven't used it but i don't really like i know the the well if i'm trying
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:27.560]   to my husband's at the store and i need him to buy milk i mean doesn't have an up let's say he had an
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.960]   apple watch how is it different than me just texting him to say buy milk well you can talk to him
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:36.600]   because it's you could you could just like interrupt him right then and there yeah what's
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:41.480]   it's a different than calling him uh you just don't have to get your voice rather than the phone
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:45.800]   ringing and i think it's also like you so it's like i get pushed to tap okay maybe i do need to get
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:51.720]   him a metal watch so i can just be like i'm watching you i'm working to you yeah i was
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:56.520]   listening it's it's a it's a brilliant way for apple to like if if one partner has one but the
[01:35:56.520 --> 01:36:01.000]   other one doesn't it's a good way for them to sell a second apple watch yeah i do think what you
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.880]   were just saying the the idea of being able to do it as an announcement someone said uh the um
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:11.960]   evil RC on on the chat in the chat said wacky talkie works best as an intercom in the house
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:15.880]   i was like can you walkie talkie to the home pod that would be actually oh yeah that'd be pretty
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:21.800]   useful like you know dinner's ready or your omelet is getting cold and i have to yell that downstairs
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:27.240]   right now well say for for the last two years of tristan being in high school you know i would
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.720]   you know raise the watch say you know hlomo you know it's time you know it's time you know text
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:37.080]   tristan it's time for dinner i mean that was what i did and it was great to do it via siri because
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:41.800]   you know my hands were often dirty or you know is busy cooking or whatever and so that was the
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:47.800]   thing and so yeah i i think uh being able to do that via voice you know just another method tvOS is
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:52.040]   is upgrade is that speak well before you leave the poorly lived watch just one one more thing i'm
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:56.440]   really looking forward to uh the new seria watch face because it will bring to apple watch something
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:03.000]   i really really like about uh about android where the idea that uh it will figure out what it
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:07.160]   thinks you need to see you want to see or you need to see at this moment and make sure that that's
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.240]   right there in the watch for you so you don't have to drill down into any other apps or scroll through
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:17.240]   alerts theory again that's that's that's why i say i'm keen i'm keen to see how well it works
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.840]   it works i've seen it on my android where work watch they have something like this only because
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:28.920]   that's how the that's how they design the user interface to essentially give you a glance and
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:32.200]   figure out what you'd want to see and that glance and make sure that's on the screen at the right
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:37.960]   time uh and for apple to do it in a much more sophisticated way uh that could be a really big
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:43.240]   thing i i think that as i as i said i think when the first android where worst uh watch came out
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:48.920]   that and actually no i think it might have first said that after i got my first demo of first apple
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:55.080]   watch saying that if you that the the standard unit of interaction with a smart watch should be
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:59.720]   glancing at it for five seconds and getting that piece of information that you want to get out of
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:04.040]   it that the moment you're the moment the watch forces you to start tapping and scrolling and
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:10.040]   clicking and and swiping you lose because that's not what people are not people have one of these
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:14.120]   you know to do the swiping and the clicking and that's that sort of thing uh the watch is
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:19.720]   glanced what time is it or glanced what gate is my is my flight at or glanced like do what
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:25.000]   do i have enough time to get to uh to get get home before whatever time so that's the series the
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.520]   series watch face could be really cool and one of the things the comp the the uber face that we saw
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:35.320]   uh last week with the eight complications is only on the new watches so as you update your watch
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.320]   o s there was that was a question that i got a lot of last week is it are you going to get to have
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:44.440]   that that new interface but there but there are but there are more complications that you can put
[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:49.960]   on the old modular face right so the old modular face which is i don't know that seems to be the
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:55.160]   most popular one that i hear people talking about uh well you can do more there that's great
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:39:03.640]   um so uh new apple tv o s i don't i don't really yeah whatever sure sorry oh yeah oh Dolby
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:09.720]   Dolby atmos that's that's cool that would be double speakers right yeah doubly i can we
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:16.360]   can we do i thought that no i actually i think final tip i think i think oh yeah well whatever is
[01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:22.360]   actually uh what apple said during the keynote about tv o s when they mentioned it oh yeah apple
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:28.200]   tv s whatever comes there goes yeah yes i'm not nothing nothing here to see uh also the uh home pod
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:34.440]   has been updated with uh multiple timers and phone calls and phone calls i haven't used it yet
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:38.040]   have you used it i have not used it for phone calls i thought we were getting multiple timers on our
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:42.440]   watch and i said to and then i tweeted about a yesterday and someone was like that's not you didn't
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:49.480]   get that i was like oh yeah that's true it once just stopped i know i i have to why is that so hard
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:55.000]   i don't know i it's i'm sure that they think that that's too complicated like that's that's the
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.640]   whole thing is like it's too complicated for people to have two timers and i i so i have to like
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:04.920]   there's things you have to set like i have to think about it and set a scheduled alarm for one timer
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:11.480]   and then because the main timer i use for me is just tea how long my tea is going to brew uh the
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:20.840]   that is we've got a couple more things to talk about uh apple did apple is are they deleting our
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:26.200]   movies and a little bit about infinite loop coming up next but before that i think it's got a couple
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:31.400]   other things to talk about uh let me interrupt a little bit mac break weekly brought to you this

[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:19.720]   now back to macbreak weekly so one of the things that we have uh been here it was drama drama last
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:26.760]   week or over over this week is uh someone reported that apple is now deleting their movies uh and uh
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:29.960]   and not giving them any kind of refund adam what's the what's the scoop on this
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:37.240]   yeah so this this has gotten really quite interesting um i i'm still tracking the guy down a little bit
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:43.880]   um but it appears that he was in canada where he bought some movies with a canadian itunes account
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:49.640]   and then he moves to australia and so he's in australia now and then three movies disappear from
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:54.760]   his from his library and he asks apple what the deal is and and basically they say they're not
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:59.880]   available you know licensing reasons and it's still a little unclear to me you know kind of why that
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:07.480]   is um and um they don't do particularly good customer service here they they they toss them a
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:12.600]   bone on well give you some you know a couple of rentals um which does did seem to be a little bit
[01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:18.680]   cheesy uh and uh and then he you know he posts about this and you know includes the the email from
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:24.920]   apple and everything like that and so it kind of blows up but it does seem as though no one else
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:30.520]   is running into this and so there may have been just the those license those you know let's face
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:35.320]   it this is a mind boggling a complex annoying situation where you have to have different licensing
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:40.520]   arrangements in different parts of the world is like the dvd region playing problems and so
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:47.560]   my guess is that that's what he's run into in in some way and it's not anything that's more
[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:52.840]   general than that is it something that we should worry about i mean and i know that like for me
[01:45:52.840 --> 01:45:58.200]   i've had a couple times where uh you know i changed my credit card number for instance or or my my
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:03.960]   i had to i lost my my atm card and i had to have it replaced and then apple literally locked up
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:08.680]   while i was waiting for that locked up all my movies and i'm like i bought these you know like
[01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:13.640]   you know like i shouldn't have to have my credit card valid quote unquote to just get the movies
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:17.880]   that you can download them and that's i think the other thing is is that you if something is
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:23.480]   available entirely online there's all these you know obstacles to you getting it you have to know
[01:46:23.480 --> 01:46:26.600]   your password you have to have your your account still has to be good you have to have your credit
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:31.000]   card associated and things like that so in the case like this one where you can download is my
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:36.360]   understanding anyway um and he just had a local copy it wouldn't have been an issue and the problem
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:41.480]   was that he was relying entirely on the cloud and which most of us do i mean and there's not a
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:45.320]   totally legit i'm sure he didn't know when he did it that that was going to be
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:51.720]   an issue now that said it would have been nice if apple had sent him something saying uh by the way
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:58.280]   you're going to lose access to these you know you should download them as opposed to so sorry
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:02.600]   you've lost oh well not even so sorry you just they disappear so that's the thing he got no he had
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:07.560]   no notification or warning or anything like that so i think this is i mean i think the big lesson for
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:11.800]   the cloud companies is this is sometimes that they just need to be more transparent about
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:18.200]   some of these licensing issues or or whatnot where people can get hit in ways that are completely
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:24.760]   non-intuitive you just like but i bought this why don't i have it why can't i get it it's
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:29.720]   it's not really a purchase it's kind of an extended rental yes yeah it's it's like the
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:35.240]   the difference is that like if i i bought this copy of uh dvd of strange brew and i'm
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:40.360]   i'm responsible for making sure that like i keep it i i keep track of the dvd and i keep track of
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:45.160]   the case but i do physically own this and i can actually sell this on when i get tired of ever
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:51.960]   seeing this again uh with now i never have if i exactly you can't mess with alia for god's sakes
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:56.680]   uh but uh but the thing is no matter what's really a budget there that's the thing uh dvd reasons
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:02.280]   will bite you well there was around it but but but but but interpret it terms but but again the
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.680]   thing is i could still let let's say i did let's say i did go to australian region cones bit me i
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:11.560]   could still sell this to someone in america because i own this this is mine you have to remember that
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:15.000]   whether you're buying a book on the kendall store whether you're buying a game for the iphone whether
[01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:21.720]   you're buying a movie on itunes what you're buying is a license to use it on to use it according in
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:27.960]   accordance to whatever terms of service are you've agreed to and the 32 pages you click through because
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:34.440]   you wanted to install the lace version of itunes on something so as the most famous uh there was a
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:41.320]   famous issue i think in two twenty ten or something a while ago where i guess the kendall store had a
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:46.360]   copy of uh of a james of an orwell book that apparently they shouldn't have had and so people
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:53.240]   who bought it suddenly just disappeared from their library because they were at the situation changed
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:58.360]   and suddenly they didn't have the right to own it anymore and so rather than simply writing them
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:02.600]   letters as as an olden days and saying hi we sent you a copy of this book that we shouldn't
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:07.480]   have sent you here's a post-paid mailer could you put it back in this bag and send it back to us they
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:13.000]   could simply essentially break into your house and steal it back and and try it so that that's why i
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.320]   that's why i will always if there's something the every single time the highest compliment i can
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:23.000]   give like a movie or or an album is when i don't even want i don't even care that i've already got it
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.520]   on google play music and on itunes uh because i'm subscribing to both of them it's like i actually
[01:49:28.520 --> 01:49:35.560]   want them on cd i want them as as unlocked mp3 or flag files that i can put anywhere i want and
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:41.960]   that there's nothing no if so if there's a if there's a biblical apocalypse so long as i could still
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:47.720]   recharge my phone or my my my player or at least get my sony disc man working again i can still
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:53.240]   listen to this album because it is not beholden to this device being able to tell talk to apple
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:58.120]   servers and get a note of back saying yes app and he is indeed entitled to watch strange fruit he
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:04.920]   did pay 13 dollars for it back in 2013 but i i will say also just the one one variable there
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:10.520]   that we hit as well is that uh you know our vhs tape of the princess bride which is one of the
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:17.320]   very few movies that we would ever watch again um yeah even though we have a vcr on a big screen tv
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.000]   it's just horrible
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:26.920]   so the life moves on i mean as some in some cases you know unless you've got a first edition leather
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:33.000]   bound uh i don't know why you know the great gatsby you know life moves on all this modern
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:38.120]   media does have a life span so well i think that the one the other side of that is that is that
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.880]   when i look at like what apple now with apple tv there's a bunch of movies that i bought they're
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:46.200]   now available in 4k well if i had bought that physically and then 4k came out i was not going
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.880]   to get that i'd have to buy it again right you know and if you put it movies anywhere you can
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:54.600]   even if one of the services go down you can get it from another one but that's but i think that's
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:51:01.240]   that's a really important point though uh i if i own something if i own a blu ray and let's say that
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:05.800]   i was able to take this blu ray i purchased and somehow through some elephant magic converted to
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:12.280]   a video file i can convert it to another format it won't be it won't be up sampled to 4k and it won't
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:19.000]   have Dolby mega sound whatever uh but i can still convert that from a format that's not
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.640]   no longer useful to me to a format that is now useful to me well i can copy it from one device
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:29.560]   to another without having to say mother may i well uh not that i would ever condone this
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:38.600]   or but i've heard that there are that there are a friend to my acmi to sdi converter sold on
[01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:46.920]   amazon for about forty dollars that um validate the hdcp but then just push sdi out the other end
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:52.680]   i've heard that if you hooked up one of those to an apple tv heard only in rumors and on reddit and
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:57.480]   so on so forth uh that you could hook a recorder up to the other side of it and then just hit play
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:03.640]   and record and it's bit for bit pretty darn i wouldn't you know but of course i would never
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:09.960]   adhere to that and i would never name the name of a view being the little converter box that
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:13.720]   you could use and he's not even acknowledging you yeah exactly you would never have that
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:21.560]   estranged trip i know i i i am i am morally outraged you would use that kind of convert that kind of
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:26.760]   converter i have never to capture the hdmi screen you should do what i do the do the ethical thing and
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:30.040]   simply use piece of software to break the encryption on the blue ray
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:39.400]   now making you i guess my parents just raised me right um i do buy movies on itunes i was burned
[01:52:39.400 --> 01:52:44.920]   really early on do you remember like um in the early two thousands i remember when i first signed
[01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:51.240]   up to download um to itunes when it first came out and i was used i was downloading at work and i
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:57.720]   had a windows computer and you would give um you'd have to give them your birthday and like in two
[01:52:57.720 --> 01:53:02.520]   thousand i remember that being like i'm not giving anyone my birthday like so i'd make up a fake
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:08.840]   birthday and then you know years like then i lost my account and i didn't i didn't have access to my
[01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:12.680]   email address so then you just lost you know so all those movies that i bought were just gone you
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:17.400]   right like they never belonged to me i just gave up so i have and then i went through a stage where
[01:53:17.400 --> 01:53:25.160]   like bought a lot of DVDs which i still own um but now i do buy movies and even tv shows like there's
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:30.680]   and i muth you andi like it's sort of um like the highest compliment you can give like we were
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:36.680]   watching um killing eve through the bbc app and then it ran out and so i was like we only have two
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:40.760]   episodes left but i love the show and i want to support more creative shows like this i'm just
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:45.400]   gonna buy the whole season and it does feel like you come to a certain kind of maturity where you're
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:50.360]   putting your money behind something instead of just figuring out other ways to get it and i i mean i
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:56.360]   don't i have uh i buy a lot i mean i have my subscription on netflix and i have my subscription on prime and
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:54:03.640]   i have my wife and kids watch a lot of dance shows on hulu that's the that's their big um dancing
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:10.520]   singing competitions or whatever and uh and then i buy a lot i mean i have um a lot of movies i
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:14.760]   don't rent movies because i always i never make it to the window i just i just rented i was what i
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:20.280]   was gonna rent uh the i tanya i rented it and i ran out of the window i just didn't i wasn't in the mood i
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:23.000]   just kept on not being in the mood and not in the because i was like i don't think i'm gonna watch
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:27.560]   that again so you pay for it but you don't watch it i paid for the rental i didn't want it and then i
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:33.320]   you know i also say that another advantage is going to good will and like buying a movie like that not
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:38.120]   only at uh for only two dollars but also paying cash and knowing that there is no digital record
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:44.840]   anywhere that i was interested in seeing i tanya let alone owning it well i got such good reviews
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:50.680]   because i first saw it so it seems it seems good free on hulu apparently free on hulu so i can
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:56.360]   unfortunately i have hulu so that that will uh work out but i the other way not to watch it i think i
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:02.200]   don't understand i can not watch if if you have your own copy you can not watch it on any device
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:08.520]   you own at any time well i what i don't understand when that flicks and amazon amazon prime they're
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:11.800]   constantly expiring my i like i'll download a whole bunch of like i'm just gonna fill out my
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:16.120]   iPad i'm going on a trip and then it seems like days later it's like they're all expired and i'm like
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:20.760]   real i mean i'm did i miss my payment i don't understand why i'm why these things are getting
[01:55:20.760 --> 01:55:24.360]   expired and that's part of why i have iTunes on some of the stuff because i just want to know that
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:28.520]   there's a movie that i really want to you know have and because i'm you know head of the household
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:32.040]   and i got all these you know like i buy these things knowing that my kids will watch it a hundred
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:35.880]   times and you know they'll they'll enjoy it i don't buy a lot of i don't buy as many rated r movies
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:43.720]   because of that but anyway so um uh so it doesn't sound like it was quite as clean as it was made
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:48.040]   out to be now one of the other things that was really interesting um that we that we saw come up
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:54.040]   is the wire did you guys read the wired story about the world history yeah it was pretty tasty
[01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:58.760]   of infinite loop the old uh the old apple campus yeah cool stories it's still the current campus i
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:04.360]   mean oh sorry the original campus right but yeah it was it's it's worth reading because if you're
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:08.440]   expecting here's here's what the land was like before they started building and here was the
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:13.000]   con you know it really is like stories from people who have been who had been working there including
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.320]   like all the way up to Tim Cook people who were working on that campus so it's basically a large
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:23.080]   collection of stories of apple history that are very very personalized like my favorite one is from
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:30.840]   uh scott forestall uh who was saying that like so he he would like he would have lunch with uh with
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:37.240]   Steve jobs and there's of course he was the king of wallock we all eat like in the big like room
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:42.520]   with everybody else because instead of like having making the making the point of uh of other CEOs
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:46.680]   who like had their their their dinner sent up on fine china in their own boardroom like no no
[01:56:46.680 --> 01:56:52.520]   and so and so scott tells a story about how well Steve would get like pre-made like sushi and like
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:57.000]   the at the register and i i'd have ordered like a wood-fired pizza and he'd always in seat always
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:01.320]   insist on paying for me and i feel guilty because like he's he's waiting for me and he's waiting for
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:05.400]   me and i just kind of feel awkward and finally say you'll Steve you know i can pay for my own that
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:10.440]   that's fine and then Steve and then Steve says no no you don't get it you know how like you use your
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:15.720]   id and like scott so like they're gonna like deduct fifteen dollars from your pay my pay is just
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:21.240]   like one dollar a year it's like we're both getting free dinners it's like this guy is billions of
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:25.800]   dollars and he's like giggling because he's like screwing apple out of out of free sushi and a free
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:32.600]   pizza could we love this man anymore i like the story where they talked about i guess when they
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:38.600]   were canceling the newton that people were they were protesting yes outside and they were like
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:41.800]   they're protesting and Steve was like they should they should be angry they have every right to be
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:43.640]   angry they should be angry they should be angry they should be angry they should take them donuts
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.600]   and coffee you know and apologize and you know tell them they they they they love they love the
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:52.760]   they love the newton they have a right to be right we should send them coffee and donuts and tell them
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:58.040]   that we understand keep protesting we had to do what we had to do but right well come out with
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:02.440]   something very similar in a decade just hang on
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:07.480]   get another seven hundred dollars ready we're going to need it from you in a couple years time
[01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:12.920]   but it is interesting you know it's it's uh it's a very different campus than the new one you know
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:17.160]   it's it's also i think that part of it is they're treating it like it's like i think the oral history
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:21.560]   of like the infant loop like they're going away but it's that right you know it's it's still a
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:27.160]   coveted place for a lot of the teams um it doesn't have the open office you know um lay out it
[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:31.240]   uh it's still you know i think there's some teams that prefer to be still over there
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:37.480]   yeah oh and and and such an in such a beautiful way where Tim's saying that where that uh of course
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:43.080]   Steve's office like at the at one infant loop he just locked the door it's exactly as as it was
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:47.960]   when he left it the his his there's some personal things in there that went to his wife but otherwise
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:51.880]   the the drawings on the white board are still there the stuff on the desk is still there and
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:57.320]   occasionally he like goes back to that old office just to get inspired and just to think about things
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:00.920]   which is like oh god wired magazine you're not supposed to make me cry
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:08.120]   um have you read Ken cicenda's book creative selection he was the apple engineer i think
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:13.160]   Renee talked about it on this show um he worked on the iphone the ipad the apple watch he helped
[01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:17.800]   develop the keyboard and i got to interview him and it's his book is great i highly recommend it
[01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.960]   like and it's it's getting to the point where like i feel like reading apple history really is
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:26.840]   history i remember reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs and i felt a little guilty
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:31.640]   i was like oh i'm just sort of obsessed with apple products and um but now i'm over that you know
[01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:36.120]   i just like all this stuff i eat it up i love it it's it really is part of our history and if
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:42.280]   we're using these devices constantly they you know there's no no shame in obsessing over the history
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:48.120]   of them it's interesting it's just a very interesting thing i'm glad these stories are being recorded
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:54.120]   because Steve supposedly was just very anti-history was like not sentimental at all but it's not just
[01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:58.520]   it's not sentiment it's not being sentimental it's like having stories that can inspire
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:03.720]   future generations of engineers and entrepreneurs i'm glad these stories get written down some place
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:09.080]   rather than just simply disappearing like tears in the rain yeah so to speak i mean Ken Ken's book
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:13.160]   does that really well i think he talks about like how uh what are the important things about being
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:17.480]   creative and putting creative products out in the world and what does it take to do that and
[02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:23.080]   it's not just like you know he sort of obsessing over apple products well and apple has figured
[02:00:23.080 --> 02:00:27.560]   something out i mean they went from near death to the largest company in the world it's probably
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:32.840]   worth studying them a little bit you know like there's yeah there's some version of there's some
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:38.040]   DNA there that is uh that's probably useful for anybody running a company to look at what they did
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:41.560]   and and they run very differently than a lot of other companies you know they don't they just they
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:48.200]   approach the entire process in a much much different way than a lot of other corporations well particularly
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:52.920]   modern corporations and they're they're in some ways a very traditional corporation in terms of
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:59.240]   just selling a product right right honestly not trying to make money on all the other stuff
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:03.240]   and not that concern i mean i i don't think as concerned i mean i i think that more in the
[02:01:03.240 --> 02:01:09.320]   Tim Cook years than than in the Steve job years but not as worried about the stock market or their
[02:01:09.320 --> 02:01:12.600]   stock price or whatever i think that Tim Cook pays more attention to it i think that's why we have
[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:16.040]   stock buybacks and you know all of those things i think Steve was just like we're just going to
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:19.640]   make our products and people if people want to get on the road they want to get on in the car
[02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:22.120]   they get in the car if they don't want to be in the car they get out of the car you know i think
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:26.760]   that was kind of his approach to it but i think it was also when apple was in a heavy growth phase
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:31.960]   which you know is maybe different i mean you know but although it doesn't feel like it i mean i don't
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:36.280]   know what their value is today but it felt like once they crossed over the threshold of of a trillion
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:42.520]   dollars they just kept on accelerating i also think that modern day CEOs when they you know get edged
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:47.320]   out for whatever reason founders not not CEOs but founders if they get edged out they're always
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:51.640]   doing this whole steel i'll be back like Steve jobs i don't know if you know none of them were
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:57.400]   Steve jobs i knew Steve jobs and you're not Steve jobs i didn't know Steve jobs but i
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:03.880]   all right so um we've got our picks coming up so everyone start to line up your picks
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:08.920]   but before that Leo's got one last thing to talk about one last interruption before we go on with
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:14.440]   the rest of Mac break weekly our picks of the week i presume but first a word from zip recruiter
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:21.400]   hiring is tough if you're the person doing it it's really tough because you're down a person and
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:25.480]   you've got a so you're going to work harder right this will happen to Lisa when we lost our
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:31.880]   accounting manager so a couple of months ago she was dreading it because you know if we don't find
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:38.840]   somebody in two weeks Lisa's doing all the work i uh this was at breakfast i said hey you know we
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:43.240]   do these ads for zip recruiter why don't you try them i think we'd use them before i know we'd use
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:47.960]   them before but Lisa said oh yeah yeah so she put the job posting up now a couple things happen right
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:55.480]   away first of all zip recruiter post to 100 plus job boards twitter facebook everywhere so you're
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:00.360]   your listings immediately out there and that helps because you don't know which job board the
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:04.760]   right person's ad you know you want to get to everywhere but then they do something else that
[02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:11.000]   i don't think anybody else does and this is huge they have already millions of resumes in the system
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:17.400]   they use AI they use machine learning a powerful matching technology to look at these resumes and
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:24.200]   find people that fit the job posting you just put up and then invite them to apply they don't just
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:29.400]   give it to you but they say hey you know uh Lisa and Leo are looking for somebody with exactly your
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:34.520]   skills apply here person applies goes right into the zip recruiter interface which i like they
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:40.040]   format the resumes so it's easy to read they give you screening questions so you can eliminate people
[02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:45.960]   without any work if you know they don't meet your needs but what's great is you start getting those
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:53.000]   names those applicants right away in fact we we so we did this at breakfast about an hour later
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:04:01.000]   least it looks at her zipper recruiter interface oh oh this is this one's good she got one that was

[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:55.480]   now back to Mac break weekly all right so uh we're on for our picks for the for the week making
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:05:01.800]   what's your pick okay um have you used life some the app life some no um i had used it a while ago
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:06.520]   it's sort of like my fitness pal where you can um you know write down everything that you've eaten
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:10.120]   and somehow magically lose weight by doing that
[02:05:10.120 --> 02:05:19.720]   i uh i re-heard about it in the apple event they talked about it they're being a life some
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:26.840]   complication i was like oh i'll try that again um and so uh what i like about it is you know like
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:34.200]   my fitness pal you add foods but this one includes a photo picture so um if i want to i'm in the ad
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:38.920]   food so let's say i'm having a snack and i can take a picture of it so now with my fitness pal
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:43.480]   and all the other ones of course you can you know take a you could uh take a picture of the barcode
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:50.120]   and that's old so i'll i'll take a picture of these sour cream and onion potato chips and then it's
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:58.840]   kind of figure out what it is and deep analysis of the photo and cream whipped cream no uh vanilla
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:08.520]   cookies no white cake no milk chocolate no um so um it's like it's amazing more suggestions um
[02:06:08.520 --> 02:06:12.680]   potato chips see potato chips that came up it's weird because it feels like it should have
[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:19.160]   read the words but um then i can add uh the potato chips on there but what can also do is like take a
[02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:22.600]   a plate of food so let's i'm going to just dump these right on the table sorry john
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:29.160]   um let's see if it uh you can
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:35.000]   okay let's see what if it recognizes okay so that was a snack i'll have this for lunch
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:41.480]   and i'll take the picture and let's see if it recognizes what those are
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:50.760]   that is one yummy picture it says sure is life some looks pretty tasty salt chicken breast with
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:07:00.040]   skin white fish mushrooms ravioli and tomatoes sauce let's try that again um well it kind of makes
[02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:08.920]   you hungry for a much more substantial snack yeah uh so that salt yes and was potatoes one of them
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:16.600]   okay so usually uh it has worked um i did have some salt let's try to get from a different um
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:21.160]   let's let's make it think it's a snack see i i think a lot of these apps are really useful if i
[02:07:21.160 --> 02:07:25.480]   really decide i'm going to use them because there's just such a pain to put something in that you
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:30.520]   don't eat really oh my gosh i'm gonna have to input this and oh i feel like doing potato chips it got
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:37.720]   at that time potato chips so then i can uh i had potato chips one bag and then i don't have to
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:42.760]   you know write all the calories it's true that um it is a pain so i've started using this again and
[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:47.560]   i uh it's a subscription and i went ahead and paid the whole forty seven dollars for the year because
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:52.120]   you know like a gym membership now i'm gonna actually use it and record you connect that always works
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:59.160]   it always works every time um and noted this is my own money leo's not paying for it so that's
[02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:03.960]   another reason why that phone leo's paid for it i will use it so tell you how many calories yeah
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:08.520]   it tells you oh yeah and it you know then it works the rest of the way like my fitness pal would
[02:08:08.520 --> 02:08:14.520]   work and then um it says you know i should have uh a certain amount of calories per day and it has
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:20.280]   meal plans so it can do recipes i i answered this whole thing and it told me that i should do two
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:30.040]   days of fasting um which i might do i don't know have you fasted i have i like it you do i don't
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:34.600]   like doing the i don't like doing like the note like i like the water fruit kind of thing on a day
[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:39.160]   you know i definitely feel a lot better but generally i i think i've gotten to the point where i
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:43.480]   you know i think you get to a certain age where you stop eating because it tastes good and you
[02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:46.440]   started it because you feel good after you ate it you know like like you know like you know and so
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:49.720]   if i don't feel good after i eat something i kind of check that off the list every once in a while
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:56.760]   like love Ethiopian food and Indian food but won't eat it very often because i just know i don't do
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:03.320]   well you know and so so the uh uh so i um you know and which leaves you mostly with you know salads
[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:08.440]   and eggs but you know but you cook an omelet every morning you inspired me we did this segment together
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:13.880]   on cooking and you make a different omelet every morning i do i do right now i'm into fluffy really
[02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:19.480]   like foam omelets which um i've took me a little while to get the right blender for it but i actually
[02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:25.160]   i like almost build the the omelet into a meringue and then you cook it for 90 seconds and put some
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:28.360]   butter under it you cook it some more and then you flip it and it comes out it looks like a
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:32.840]   you see if you go to my instagram you'll see a picture of my first try at it soon i'm gonna put
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:38.280]   another try on because i've now built i've made 20 cents that picture well i was gonna buy the
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:44.120]   sous vide but that felt like too much of a jump for me so i bought the insta pot and um it's
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:49.640]   it's hard to cook i made i decided i was gonna make vegetable broth in the insta pot and so like i
[02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:56.120]   got four leeks i cut up the parsley um the things that look like carrots but are white turn up snow
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:03.000]   parsnips parsnips yeah like all that stuff and then you're supposed to just throw all that stuff away
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.520]   like and just have the broth and that didn't make any sense to me and also i have a friend that
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:12.840]   makes a lot of um uh broths and there's the picture of the foamy that's the foamy that's my first try at
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:17.720]   it um they're better now but but that one that one is the first uh and i you know i was what
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:23.080]   what happens is i watch a lot of youtube pictures on a youtube videos on on omelets i don't know why
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:27.320]   i just that's okay for a while it was breakfast sandwiches i make my kids breakfast sandwiches but
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:34.520]   i kind of got that one pretty mastered so i um but uh uh i saw you know Jamie Oliver was talking to
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:38.440]   some french guy and then i then you start searching foamy omelets and you end up with all these ones
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:42.600]   in japan and ones in france and and then you watch them all doing it by hand and you try to do it by
[02:10:42.600 --> 02:10:47.320]   hand and you're like this is crazy there's we have technology for this so and so what you were
[02:10:47.320 --> 02:10:53.240]   talking about the friend you have from no who makes vegetable broth tons of broth and all she does is
[02:10:53.240 --> 02:10:57.960]   uh while she's cooking she just throws all the stuff like what no she just throws stuff into the
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:11:02.760]   pot the pot's boiling and she throws you know whatever she's making she just starts throwing
[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:06.840]   stuff in there so it's not like she's throwing that away she's taking the extra stuff extra stuff
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:12.840]   and just throwing it in and um that's kind of how she she does it and the broth is really good so i
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:17.480]   should just eat the vegetables and still have the broth i can separate the vegetables it seems like
[02:11:17.480 --> 02:11:21.880]   it's just something that's done in parallel to just regular cooking okay you have to cook a lot
[02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:27.160]   gravy yeah gravy before or after or maybe exactly those chicken i don't know how we got them
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:32.600]   and throw it in we started with counter-tour that's yeah yeah okay that's my thing life some there's a
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:36.520]   free version and it has ads and it still includes the camera but it doesn't include a lot of the
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:40.840]   other fancy features and you won't use it unless you paid for it that's what i decided that's true
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:47.960]   and i still might not use it even though i paid for it you know Andy what's your what's your pick
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:53.880]   for the week uh well to bring the conversation back to apple i was watching my apple tv uh the
[02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:58.920]   segment that you did and i noticed that when you were searing the steak after you suvided it you
[02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:03.080]   didn't use a sera sera sera sera sera sera well we're using just like the raw nozzle of the butane
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:07.640]   torture did you have it was i was it was better tv it was so the thing is the sera sera sera
[02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:12.680]   was an exciting to look at like so yeah true that was the the decision the decision i made was to
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:16.840]   leave the the sera sera's all off because it actually tastes better with the sera's all on it
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:22.600]   and i mentioned the sera's all in the show but i didn't think when i when i tested i was like i
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:25.560]   don't think this is gonna look good on tv it's gonna look like i'm waiting something magic over
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:32.360]   it i just wanted to just i just i just just just because when uh you you're on that long list of
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:37.800]   people that when you do something that confuses me my first go-to reaction is he must know something
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:43.240]   i don't know i must learn what he knows he must he must have something that came out much better
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:49.240]   than the sera's all that looks so cool it just looks cooler than than uh than than than than the
[02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.480]   sera's all and and it doesn't bother like some people don't like the taste of the if you actually
[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:58.040]   put the flame on it and and i it doesn't bother me so um i actually kind of like it i there's certain
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:02.600]   things that i like to use it for that i can that i taste it and it's so it's not it's not i don't
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:07.560]   always use the sera's all either so let's see advantage of sweet lady propane use
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:10.040]   if you taste the meat not the heat
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:16.520]   okay my pick my pick of the week uh actually devtales into all the updates that we've had this
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:25.000]   week uh my favorite like to do productivity project project management app uh for apple devices is
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:33.320]   things uh it's it is not just uh it's not only like the probably the only to bespoke app for project
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:39.240]   management getting things done to do list that i've actually stuck with because it didn't it didn't
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:45.080]   make me learn now first of all now normally if in an old-fashioned to-do list you just write down
[02:13:45.080 --> 02:13:50.360]   by light bulbs but our app is so sophisticated and it's so much more productive because first
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:55.560]   tell me what the context of buying the light bulb is it could be the light bulb is in the kitchen so
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:14:00.280]   the contact is in the kitchen or maybe it's a home of like i just want light bulbs just remind
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:06.200]   me to get light bulbs uh all the way up to i'm running a 400 page book and i'm managing like four
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:11.160]   people who are working for me to like do layout and stuff like that and their deadlines that people
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:16.680]   can get get real scoldy at me if i don't if i don't do things right uh it's not only a really great
[02:14:16.680 --> 02:14:22.440]   app for all kinds of stuff like that it's also a legitimately beautifully done app whether you've
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:28.440]   got the desktop app or the uh the iphone app or the ipad app it it is the sort of thing where you
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:37.320]   it is one of the most perfect explanations of why iOS needs to exist because it really is a way of
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:43.240]   presenting user interface and a way of interacting with the user's brain that is unique to iOS and
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.520]   is unique to apple there is there would be an imposs i wish that they had an android version
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:52.920]   of this from an android phone but they just could not make it work they would have to duplicate
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:57.720]   everything that apple is done with all their api's and all their interfaces and they've just updated
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:04.840]   it version 3.7 to take advantage of all the new features in iOS 12 and watch os 5 so for instance
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:11.880]   if you've got the new watch watch os 5 new complications it can now project your data your
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:15.720]   to-dos your checklist your things like that inside that complication inside the watch face
[02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:19.960]   that's nice and you can also interact with the watch that's great but the really cool thing is
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:24.440]   it'll it'll take advantage of things like you can it'll work on your phone in landscape mode
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:29.080]   but the big thing is that it'll work with series shortcuts so it really is the sort of thing where
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:34.280]   you can take this really complicated thing like at the very end when i was working when i'm working
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:39.640]   on a book it is like when i was using this as my project management app it really is at the end of
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:44.520]   the day making sure i keep that big tote tote board completely up to date and saying that
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:50.120]   it did not get done has to be has to be moved over here but if it as related to this person here with
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:54.520]   this tag that means i have to move it into a personnel list and i also have to make sure that i email
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:59.080]   this both to a backup site but also remind myself tomorrow morning of something that was really
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:03.160]   important that didn't get done all the stuff that is repeatable thing that i'm supposed to do every
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:08.760]   single night to keep myself in line you can just simply now create a workflow for it and we'll just
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:14.760]   automatically get done and it will also work with with the shlomo so you can if there is a
[02:16:14.760 --> 02:16:20.200]   for instance on your watch or on your phone if there is it's it's so there are a lot of apps that
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:25.720]   will let you add it to add to a to-do list or add to a named to-do list but you can actually build a
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:31.080]   somewhat sophisticated shlomo shortcut when it's something like you're walking you're walking through
[02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:36.200]   a building that you're renovating and you need to do a punch you're doing punch lists for
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:39.400]   things that need that the the car the carpenters need to know about things that the
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:42.760]   plumbers need to know about things that the deck brand needs to know about and now you can use
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:48.040]   shlomo to simply make sure that not only things go to the correct lists by creating in a sense a
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:54.120]   custom shlomo command but also making sure it does more than one thing to it it is gorgeous now the
[02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:59.000]   only drawback is that this isn't one of those things where you get you buy one copy and you get free
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:07.640]   everything else the the Mac app I think is like $40 be which is correct for a professional app that
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:13.080]   will save you this much aggravation if you want it on your phone it will cost you another like 10
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:18.680]   bucks or something if you want it on your iPad as well and it's also a gorgeous iPad app as well
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:24.280]   you have to give them another 20 bucks but you can download the Mac version for free and if you
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:30.040]   if you make the mistake of using it for a full week you'll be like damn it I'm gonna have to give
[02:17:30.040 --> 02:17:34.120]   them $40 for the set because I don't want to stop using it and then two weeks after that
[02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:39.160]   you'll be like I wish I could do this on my phone damn I got to give another $10 for the phone
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:43.880]   version because it's just too damn useful that's it's you you earn it's it's like what we're talking
[02:17:43.880 --> 02:17:49.400]   about about house there's a some there's a weird pleasure we get from being able to say
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:54.360]   hey person who created this album I really like this album here have some money that kind of
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.760]   we're kind of wired up to make that transaction of it's not enough for me to simply tweet and
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:03.720]   and at and at sign you inside the tweet to say hi I just don't I just streamed your album for
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:09.640]   free thank you I really enjoyed it but here here is some money I'm buying a $40 t-shirt not because
[02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:14.520]   I want it but because I want you to have $40 I'm gonna put $40 in your hand that's the sort of
[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:20.040]   satisfaction you get when you buy apps of this quality it really is just absolutely gorgeous
[02:18:20.680 --> 02:18:27.000]   and I can't say enough about it so that the company's cultured code and really if I could
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.160]   authorize a federal grant so that they can consider continuing to work like this I would do it
[02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:35.480]   it would be a national endowment for the arts grant is just such a beautiful app that's great
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:42.680]   yeah the I use that as well so it's it's really cool yeah have you tried agenda that app I have
[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:47.720]   it I just wasn't as happy with it as I was with things I've tried all of them I have them all I
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:53.320]   you do you do wind up trying all them don't you but you you never even with the one you like
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:59.160]   you're looking for everyone's yeah Adam what do you have for us I've got two things one
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:05.160]   I'm looking at a standing desk and I just ran across this in Amazon hopefully pull up the the
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:14.680]   anti-fatigue mat scroll down just a little bit here and you'll see the the price new from $129,999
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:24.520]   or you can get a two pack for $37.95 so I just like you know the best anti-fatigue mat in the
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:30.280]   world please please please buy just buy one just buy one just yes we have two different versions I
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:40.680]   think you want the Colombian design sir the Colombian design it would be funny if it turned out that
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:45.400]   that was some kind of weird money laundering thing that they figured out how to use Amazon to buy
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:50.040]   buy these little stress-free mats and that's how they're moving money out of Saudi Arabia or
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:54.920]   something like or or or something or something like or something like the the or something like the
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:20:01.800]   the the mass cost the mass cost $100,000 but the incredibly elite sex worker comes and delivers
[02:20:01.800 --> 02:20:07.160]   it for you hey and makes love to you for for 14 hours for free well look at the gift card savings
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:16.200]   $10 so it's only $129,89. And you know if you if you sign up for an Amazon they'll give you a $70
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:22.040]   credit so it'll actually be $129,929. How far?
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:30.360]   Now it's each of the go on vacation during the December, you have busy month.
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:37.960]   But this really nice mat to stand on. It's really nice. Okay so any of it my my real pick of the
[02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:46.840]   week this is a beta but it's public beta it's affinity publisher and I'm an InDesign fan I've
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:52.600]   used InDesign for a bunch of years I've written whole books in InDesign I like InDesign but I
[02:20:52.600 --> 02:20:58.920]   understand that people are put out about creative cloud subscriptions and things like that and so
[02:20:58.920 --> 02:20:59.760]   when I saw the the announcement of the
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:05.320]   affinity publisher I thought what the heck I'll take it I'll take a I'll download it I'll take a
[02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:10.040]   look and I had to lay out something so I was like y'all I'll try this this thing I want to lay out
[02:21:10.040 --> 02:21:15.800]   it's pretty good I mean it's a beta they're very upfront about how they're still fixing things and
[02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:21.560]   adding features and whatnot but it's pretty good and as someone who knows InDesign relatively well
[02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:29.560]   where I mostly tripped up was in like trying to find how to you know get tabs you know like
[02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:34.200]   where's the where's the ruler that will let me you know adjust my tabs or where's the you know
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:37.160]   where where are different things and then obviously some of the keyboard shortcuts were a little
[02:21:37.160 --> 02:21:43.640]   different so I was I was you know the ingrained spinal cord motions for how to do things in
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:51.080]   InDesign didn't always work but I was pretty impressed and you know I think they're in for
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:57.800]   end of the year for actual release but you know for someone who needs the power of InDesign or
[02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:03.000]   close to the power of InDesign and doesn't wish to pay up for a full creative crowd subscription
[02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:12.200]   it's as I it's pretty impressive you know master pages full styles tables you know all kinds of
[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:18.600]   stuff I was I was pretty impressed that's great how much does it cost it's in beta so they haven't
[02:22:18.600 --> 02:22:25.400]   actually said I don't think but if you look they also have affinity what is a finney photo and a
[02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:30.840]   public affinity designer it's sort of I think they're actually kind of going for the full
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:35.400]   you know let's create with compete with Creative Cloud and I maybe you can find what the prices
[02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:39.720]   are on those I want to say that they're relatively inexpensive 20 dollars or something
[02:22:39.720 --> 02:22:45.560]   right that was gonna say much like 50 but still you know someone in the range and in the less than
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:52.760]   50 dollars a month yeah well and I know for photo I use it specifically for one thing so I don't know
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:23:00.360]   how to use most of it but it lets you go into a VR mode to paint out the tripod and you can paint
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:04.440]   it because otherwise you have this kind of crazy thing at the bottom of your 360 photo
[02:23:04.440 --> 02:23:09.480]   I mean it just is all stretched out over the Mercator projection so it puts it back in the
[02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:13.240]   sphere and you can look down and paint it out really quickly and easily and it looks great and
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:16.520]   for me that was worth the price of admission like I just have it because I couldn't find it
[02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:22.920]   anywhere else to be able to do that and so so anyway so I use it for for that one I use their
[02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:26.280]   photo one for that tool I have the other ones because I keep on buying them because I keep on
[02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:32.280]   this is a great idea and the hard part that you pointed out was there's so many muscle memory
[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:36.840]   things like for me photoshopped I've been using photoshopped since before they had alpha channels
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:43.000]   and so so the or I mean before they had layers they had alpha channels and layers and so
[02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:47.880]   I remember that being really exciting it was like it was like oh my gosh you don't have to do this
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:54.920]   crazy set of operations to put something on top of something else so anyway but I have to admit
[02:23:54.920 --> 02:24:00.120]   that I've if I do less than four or five pages which is I'm not the most I ever lay out anymore I'm
[02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:03.960]   I've gotten really good at pages what do you now how do what do you think have you done any
[02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:09.880]   layout in pages I you know every now and then I play with it it's like you silly boy what are you
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:17.400]   thinking well so so what I want to say is that there are two classes of layout apps and
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:21.480]   I'm not a huge expert in this I don't I actually like doing layout I don't get to do very much of it
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:26.920]   my and but there's there's there's the high-end stuff the end designs and the
[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:31.160]   Saffinity Publisher and whatnot where they're really assuming that you're going to be doing
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:37.560]   you know very fine adjustments you're going to be doing longer documents possibly and then
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:44.200]   there's what I want to call the like the brochure tools you know pages swift publisher
[02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:50.280]   be lights print works they tend to be more aimed at you want a business card or you want to try
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:55.000]   fold flyer and you know we can help you do that and and those are great don't get me wrong they if
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.320]   you want a trifold flyer that's probably going to be way easier than trying to set up your guides
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:05.480]   and in design yeah and so so I feel like that's the separation and pages for me falls into that
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:10.840]   category of yeah all if I need to do if I need to print a birthday card for someone
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:14.680]   I'm going to pull up pages and throw a picture on and some text and print
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:20.680]   I mean I came from I mean I came from five hard years of Quark Express of publishing you know like
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:26.840]   of ads and publishing I built a whole magazine that was that was run from a like the all the ads
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:30.840]   were all all the ads and classified were all run from a file maker document that we were that we
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:35.080]   scripted into the you know in you know processed it into the into the system so it's not you know
[02:25:35.080 --> 02:25:39.400]   I don't come completely you know flat footed into the into the thing and I and I just know that
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:43.800]   I don't do that anymore you know you know and I don't know why I would do that because then I
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:48.120]   would print it on paper and I don't know when I would because all I send people is at PDFs you
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:52.840]   know like I just like here's a PDF of all I do is proposals and so it's I got where I got
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:58.920]   I got back in into design I do I do volunteer with the local running club and even though pretty much
[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:04.120]   everything is online we still feel like we need printouts of like race entry forms right now and
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:07.800]   these things had been does they were all in word they'd been done looked like they'd been
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:12.840]   designed by squirrels in the eight yeah yeah yeah exactly and so at some point I said look
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:17.800]   I can just fix this I'm you know I'll redesign it we'll have a template it'll look good and so I
[02:26:17.800 --> 02:26:22.920]   got to play with in design again for a while with these things and it was just fun and so yes you
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:27.960]   know I actually do print them and we do have PDFs and that is probably the thing that I spend the
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:32.840]   most time doing it in design and it's just you know it is just an excuse and you know and as you
[02:26:32.840 --> 02:26:37.960]   say those muscle memory things like I started using it again after not using it for years and
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:44.440]   suddenly my hands did the right thing I know yeah I don't even know what this command is and
[02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:48.360]   I'm doing it I know photos I was like it's very much like that if I want to copy a layer or whatever
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:51.160]   I don't even I couldn't even tell you what the keystroke is my fingers know what it is I don't
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:55.400]   know what it is anymore I just and I don't and it has to be contextual like I won't I couldn't
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:59.560]   tell you until I needed to do it and my finger just goes and does it and I was like okay yes
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:06.120]   that's what I wanted so anyway Adam as a non-professional I would love to have clarification on one point
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:13.160]   which was do you think was the overriding preponderating componderating element of that design template
[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:19.720]   the the taste of the squirrel or the 1980s design cues I'm trying to I'm trying to figure out if
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:25.880]   there was a lot of like like checkerboard patterns and like neon squiggles or whether there was just
[02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:33.240]   a lot of like things about nuts I a lot of a lot of hyperactive typesetting with a lot of font
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:39.320]   changes and we're screwing the 80s different than they are now oh it was so no it was it's basically
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:43.640]   so you do this race form and it would you know and have where the race is really is a scar for one
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:49.880]   and then every time someone would make a mistake or get confused the next year the race director
[02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:57.160]   would bold it or put it in all caps or make it red and this continued over decades until it
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:00.440]   mean they really looked like ransom now it's my nest one of the squirrels was like you know you
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:04.440]   could imagine squirrels kind of like you know with little paws on the mouse and you know like oh
[02:28:04.440 --> 02:28:09.000]   I think it was a big go to make it rad you know it's just yeah they were just and every one of them
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:13.240]   was completely different too so you know like you'd get these things and it was like a it was a
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:19.640]   reading exercise to figure out when the race started and then and I know I used I talked to a client
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:23.640]   one time and they had all this bold stuff and underlines and I said I said so why are you doing
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:26.440]   that and they're like because we want it because that's a special part that's important and I was
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:30.680]   like what was this part it's important too and I said have you ever seen the Incredibles and he's
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:34.120]   like he looked at me like huh I was like because when everybody's special then no one is
[02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:39.960]   and so I was just like you can't yeah like you gotta make a decision about what's going to be
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:44.280]   special and then and have everything else just kind of back up a little bit you know so uh so
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:48.280]   anyway yeah all right my daughter is that you see nine years old of course I'm giving her keynote
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:55.000]   because I build decks a lot of decks so we're doing keynote training and part of it was one font
[02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:59.000]   you know like you know like you know one font this white space there's a thing called center
[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.200]   that we want to use you're crushing her creativity she's very creative but it just we just want to
[02:29:04.200 --> 02:29:13.320]   like fit into a little bit of the of the model so anyway my uh my pick for the week is um it's um
[02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:20.440]   the mix pre by sound devices this is the mix pre three um the uh there's also a mix pre six and a
[02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:27.160]   mix pre ten uh and if you're looking for the best interface you're ever gonna have into your computer
[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:32.360]   that happens to also record it also happens to have the best preamps ever and by the way if you're
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:38.600]   wondering what a preamp is that is when you plug your mic into the into your recorder the circuitry
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:43.320]   that records that actually is half the deal you know you know you know the mic the high
[02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:49.240]   mic is great but what it goes through before it goes to the recorder is a huge deal and almost
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:53.240]   everything you get when you don't spend real money or you just kind of buy it it's cheap
[02:29:53.240 --> 02:29:58.200]   it affects the quality of it and it and it peaks and it does all these other horrible things to
[02:29:58.200 --> 02:30:03.640]   your to your um to your audio um this is probably this along with a good mic is probably the the
[02:30:03.640 --> 02:30:06.680]   the biggest investment that you'll make if you're doing podcast or you're doing anything that
[02:30:06.680 --> 02:30:11.320]   needs requires audio um this is probably the most important uh investment that you'll make is what
[02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:14.520]   are you going to record and what is going to interface into your computer and the great thing is you
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:19.320]   don't have to buy two different things now we used to have USB pre-tuse which sound devices also makes
[02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:23.800]   and and where they come from I mean this is a much less expensive piece than what sound devices
[02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:29.400]   has done in the past they are the industry standard in the movie industry um they are this is what
[02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:35.720]   you look at i'm friends with a lot of sound uh sound recordists uh on facebook a couple hundred
[02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:39.240]   and you see all their behind the scenes pictures and all you see is sound devices sound devices
[02:30:39.240 --> 02:30:44.200]   sound not you know and these are these big 788s and and 664s and you know these these much more
[02:30:44.200 --> 02:30:51.000]   expensive pieces but what they did is they made it more more cost effective and gave you a uh
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:55.720]   a USB interface and so you can get those tracks into your uh into your computer so you can use
[02:30:55.720 --> 02:31:01.480]   it as the interface um for uh your your podcast or or a Skype call or whatever but it's going to
[02:31:01.480 --> 02:31:04.600]   sound really good and you just push record and rather than trying to figure out how you're going
[02:31:04.600 --> 02:31:08.120]   to use audio hijack or whatever you're going to do you just can push record and you're going to
[02:31:08.120 --> 02:31:12.440]   record it and it's going to be an incredibly good recording of what you're doing no matter how
[02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:17.400]   loud you go you really you can peek the mic but you can't peek the it's got limiters in it you can't
[02:31:17.400 --> 02:31:23.000]   really peek the uh the recorder um they just really they just released uh the ability now to
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:27.240]   um you can use little control surfaces so one of the provinces you got those little dials
[02:31:27.240 --> 02:31:32.040]   and you know it used to be kind of difficult to kind of get control of that they now have support
[02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:37.720]   for the nano control studio nano control to innovations launch control and and a CHI's
[02:31:37.720 --> 02:31:43.000]   MIDI mix which means that in the USB you can plug in these relatively inexpensive little boards
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:48.520]   with sliders and so you can control the different uh uh you can control the um
[02:31:48.520 --> 02:31:54.600]   uh you know all the channels independently uh the interface is a lot better it's just a great
[02:31:54.600 --> 02:32:01.080]   um it's it's an amazing piece of hardware and so uh what were you saying Andy?
[02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:07.960]   I just want to throw in my opinion as someone who is unlike Alex not an expert on digital media
[02:32:07.960 --> 02:32:14.040]   and not an expert on microphones and not an expert on this sort of stuff just as a dude who like
[02:32:14.040 --> 02:32:21.080]   who forces who thank god almighty makes money off of podcasts and recording things uh it's so
[02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:26.600]   simple it's so satisfying to simply touch a button marked record as opposed to running audio
[02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:31.560]   hijack works great and it costs a lot less a lot less than this but to touch a button marked record
[02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:35.960]   and know that your audio is not only going through Skype but it's also being recorded at very very
[02:32:35.960 --> 02:32:41.560]   high resolution to an SD card and when you're doing like field recordings and field interviews
[02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:48.680]   not only to see to know that you're getting beautiful beautiful audio that you're seeing color LEDs
[02:32:48.680 --> 02:32:53.880]   a color screen that is doing number of things that are numbers getting higher and
[02:32:54.440 --> 02:32:58.040]   elite and view meters going this way to confirm that you are indeed recording
[02:32:58.040 --> 02:33:04.840]   and also that your subject who was accepted the the request for an interview basically because
[02:33:04.840 --> 02:33:10.280]   they're a very nice person but then and thought you're kind of a kind of a you know kind of a
[02:33:10.280 --> 02:33:14.600]   nerd but once you show up with like something oh wow there's a box here with some metal with
[02:33:14.600 --> 02:33:19.320]   metal studs on it and let that screen with VU meters this guy must be a professional okay i'm
[02:33:19.320 --> 02:33:23.320]   gonna i'm not gonna i'm not gonna be a jerk to him i'm gonna tell him all the great stories
[02:33:23.320 --> 02:33:28.040]   yeah it's it's it's it's wonderful i had one i'm loaned for a couple of months i had to send it back
[02:33:28.040 --> 02:33:33.240]   uh when i was done with the review and as soon as i get some mad money together that's probably
[02:33:33.240 --> 02:33:38.120]   the next thing i'm buying for the studio it was such a treat having this box it's just a great
[02:33:38.120 --> 02:33:42.200]   a great box you know and and again it plugs into like if you have it'll actually plug in your
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:46.120]   iPhone if you want to into the into the jack you can i mean you can get a little cable for it and
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:51.560]   but you can also plug it into your the if you have a SLR and has a little audio jack in all those
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:56.200]   things or things that you know putting it be i even if you have mic inputs on your on your camera
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:59.320]   you should use this instead because it's going to sound better uh you know and
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:04.520]   the thing with even if you're doing video for youtube or something or or any kind of video
[02:34:04.520 --> 02:34:09.960]   audio is more important it's not 50 percent it's 80 percent of the of the product because people
[02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:13.560]   will look through a lot of bad video and then they'll kind of put up with frame rate issues and
[02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:18.600]   everything else you have bad audio no one wants to listen to you so um anyway so it's uh it's uh
[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:23.640]   all of them are good they the new six and ten i think or the the 10 the 10 and the six the mix
[02:34:23.640 --> 02:34:29.560]   pre six and ten i think now support the ambio mic which is the br mic which i have i have one and i
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:34.200]   needed something more portable to to get it some probably gonna get those ones too anyway so but
[02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:40.520]   um great so uh anyway that's it i think we're now we've gone a little longer than i expected when i
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:43.800]   laid this out i was like i hope this actually goes for an hour and a half i don't know if this is
[02:34:43.800 --> 02:34:49.560]   gonna work we also we also got an episode of our uh a nerd's cooking podcast and just cut out that
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:53.720]   23 minutes and it's actually a couple of ads for that one exactly oh come on i didn't get to talk
[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:59.400]   about pickles i've been making pickles i was almost gonna do that was my pickle of the week sorry
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:06.280]   i think the show should have a pickle would be good adam working people find you uh tidbits.com
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:11.320]   is where you can find pretty much everything i do uh we've been covering a lot of this new stuff and
[02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:15.560]   that site is completely redesigned as i think since the last time i've been here so if some
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:19.240]   people should come over and take a look it doesn't look like it was designed by squirrels in the
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:27.160]   2000s anymore. Andy where can people find you? As usual spell my last name i'm at an octo on

[02:35:47.640 --> 02:35:52.680]   at the boston public library we have a studio actually there at the library with a coffee shop
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:57.240]   attached so you can actually watch me live and pretend and make sure you tweet to people that he
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:01.240]   did not have pages of notes in front of me he just remembered all those names and quotes and dates
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:06.760]   just right out of his head um and also and also check out uh if you're into opera check out uh
[02:36:06.760 --> 02:36:12.920]   mixuinis.net i've got a humor piece uh on finally sold a piece to mixuinis i've been trying for like
[02:36:12.920 --> 02:36:17.400]   four or five six times for for years uh but yes i've got a piece about the metropolitan opera
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:20.760]   that they tell me is going to run on monday because it's the start of the metropolitan opera
[02:36:20.760 --> 02:36:25.320]   season all right and Megan we're working people find you i know you're not you know you're just
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:30.200]   always right here right here uh in this room where i've been since 8 30 this morning a.m so it was
[02:36:30.200 --> 02:36:34.760]   six seven hours um like i'm never doing this when alex says tell me i didn't expect it to be
[02:36:34.760 --> 02:36:41.160]   due to have hours uh also i just i learned this from which damir o who was from ktla he uh i've
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:46.360]   been starting to put every link of things that i've talked about on my website which seems obvious
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:51.320]   as i started as as a web producer in tech tv but there's really not one place and so um
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:57.000]   meganmaroney.com or you can get there by going to goatswaringclose.com which will redirect
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:04.120]   everything i talk about is there i'm gonna keep it up um will we get the story behind the name
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:10.680]   because i'm headed there right now that's the part we're in close um the story is that i got
[02:37:10.680 --> 02:37:14.440]   there was like a video of goatswaringclose like three years ago and i was like this is adorable
[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:17.880]   i'm gonna create a website all about this and then i bought the url.
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:19.000]   It goes all the time
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:27.240]   and then i just decided to redirect it until i uh decide to really create the the true um
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:33.000]   then give it the the goatswaringclose videos it needs until you got goats yeah i mean i have to
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.400]   get your own goats and start knitting them close with the little goats a little goats running
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:43.000]   around with the wolfwares yeah yeah it's cute i mean that's everyone thinks that's cute right and i
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.680]   hope that that's the last thing i tweet like the pictures that goatswaringclose when i die i like
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:55.000]   this it's sort of the dead man switch on on social media right as soon as i let go tweak this post that
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:02.920]   post the unofficial memoir that i didn't want to tell anybody right this guy did this to me
[02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:06.360]   it's gonna go it's the rant it's like and i've been meaning to say
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:19.560]   all right everybody back to work because break time is over
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:22.140]   (upbeat music)
[02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:24.720]   (upbeat music)
