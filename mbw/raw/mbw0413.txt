[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. The new MacBooks are here. Well, a few new MacBooks.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.180]   Maybe even a new Mac mini. We'll talk about that. Security issues with iOS.
[00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.840]   Shaw. Why you don't need to worry. And a couple of Apple acquisitions that might
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.220]   indicate to some new directions for Apple. It's all coming up next on Mac Break.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.120]   We can stay here.

[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.960]   Let's start right off the bat with Mr. Alex Lindsey in studio with us. Good to see you
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.080]   once again. Good to be here. Taking yourself off the road for a little bit.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.320]   Or today for like a minute. Good to have you. Renee Richie to his right. Hi Renee. Good
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.920]   to see you. Hi, Leo. How are you? I'm more dot com feeling great. Andy was talking about
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.000]   Opera today. I just realized that if he'd gone to dust flater mouse as a child, he would
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.560]   be black man today.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.440]   You would be what today? Batman today. You would be Batman. Was it dust flater mouse that they
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.440]   were seeing with his parents in one of the more recent? It was a mask of Zorro for a long
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.320]   time. And then the more recent movie, I think it was the flater mouse. But in the original
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.280]   D. C. Number one. What was it? Zorro? I think Zorro. Zorro. That's Andy Enaka who would
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.800]   know this as well. Hello. Hello. Also my mother didn't wear pearls. So they couldn't
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.160]   have that beautiful shot of the pearl slipping from her then bouncing along as I got so there
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.480]   are a lot of reasons why I couldn't be Batman. And that's probably the top two. I got the
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.200]   brains. I got the physique. I got the money got those.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.280]   Tate Lee and not co-manner. He's joining us. Hey, this the Yosemite's here. I mean Yosemite's
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.520]   here. I mean Yosemite's here. The public beta. Do you all nation? Do you all have you all
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.360]   on stuff? They said a million people. Yeah. Have they run out? If you went right now to
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.600]   the Yosemite beta page, could you get a code? I think you could. I don't know. I said I
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.400]   reminded myself that I'd signed up for the beta of iOS eight. I neglected to sign up for
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.600]   Yosemite when I found out when it was going to be shipping about a day before I signed
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.000]   up and I got the code. So. But this is one we can talk about because this is not the $99
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.360]   developer preview. This is a public beta. Renee, be my lawyer here. Is it art for us to
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.080]   talk about it? You could talk about it all of it. The end of the year this year is so different.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.480]   You're not supposed to review it or do screenshots because the interface can change. They don't
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.160]   want to confuse anybody. But this year you could talk about anything from the day of
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.840]   WWDC that I think I dodged a bullet because I was going to put it on this computer and
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.000]   use it and everybody could see it. But I shouldn't do that. You're saying? I mean, they never
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.080]   prosecute it that fully. Right. But it might. You know, I like to stay on Apple's good side.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.240]   That way I get invitations to all the big events. You know, the problem is if you're not using
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.320]   iOS eight, a lot of the features of Yosemite are not visible because continuity especially
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.840]   doesn't requires iOS eight. So all I really see is Helvetica, which is pretty. That is
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.800]   a noise desktop. No, no, no, no, Helvetica desktop. Yeah. And there were some rumors when
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.760]   we first saw this at WWDC that this wasn't going to be the final that they were doing
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.240]   a special font. I guess that's not the case. They've made a special font years ago. They
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   had a custom Apple font designed and they have never deployed it. And I still do not
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.360]   know why maybe they're just not ready yet. But as far as I know, the Apple sounds, whatever
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.880]   it's called has been ready for a while. Well, Chicago, you know, the original font for
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.600]   the original Macintosh was designed for that screen for that display to be more legible.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.520]   Now presumably Yosemite's design, mostly for red and displays. In fact, that has been one
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.080]   complaint from some people. It doesn't look as good a non retina displays is as has have
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.000]   you any of you found that to be the case? I've only run it on non retina. And it looks
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.360]   okay. Yeah. All right. I have it. I actually have it on my old generation MacBook here
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.240]   because I don't I don't want to trust a working computer on it. And yeah, I don't know I don't
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.160]   know yet whether it's because it's different or because it's not as good on non retina.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.520]   I will say that it does look a little bit closer. The like thin letters are a little bit closer
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.320]   together. It's not so much that I would call call it a ding, but I would probably go back
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.680]   to the other one if I could. One thing I saw and you know, you have to shoot a close up
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.320]   shot of the screen to see this is the lowercase E on non retina displays. It seems joined.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.280]   It seems more like an Oh, with a thing across it. Yeah, it's not illegible. It's just that
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.480]   they're it's not like for non retina. And I believe they adjusted the font so that it
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.800]   would take up the same space as the old system font. So you would say anything existing dialogues
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.440]   wouldn't look crazy until people updated. Maybe they saw the move. Maybe Johnny I saw
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.200]   the movie Helvetica got all excited and said let's do everything in Helvetica. We are a
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.120]   good movie by the way. Yeah, it's a great movie. Yeah. The sequel objectified is amazing as well.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:45.840]   There's a sequel. Same same thing. Objectify. Helvetica to the font. The syribs. Helvetica
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:56.080]   goes Sarah. No, we didn't raise you this way young man. Anybody have problems with installing
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.000]   it. I I didn't you know Apple really. You know, when you first install it, it says now make
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.320]   sure you're your time machine. Make sure you backed it up. And of course everywhere they
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.640]   say don't put on a production machine backup. I didn't do any of that. I didn't back it up.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.200]   I put it right on my main Mac Pro because I have such faith in Apple and you know what?
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.640]   No problems. We we have some we've had noticed a couple audio issues with video conferences
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:25.640]   software with the new build. So just any particular program or hangouts? So we don't know if it's
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.920]   it's a hangout to use and Skype I think Skype actually does it as well. So I think that's
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.640]   interesting because I hang out to use video and Skype uses its own codec. So right now
[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.760]   I think it's a good all final cut wouldn't work at all. Yeah, now it works. But the original
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.120]   beta like there was several apps Apple apps that would just would remember that. Yeah,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.160]   a lot of the Apple Pro apps. But everything's famous to be fine now. The only thing I found
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.480]   was I use open PGP to do digital signing and it disabled that plug in and mail which was
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.880]   nice. I mean, it actually said, Hey, it's not going to work. So we're going to disable it.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.080]   But everything else has worked. You know, we've had a randomly just disappears randomly.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.440]   That's not the issue. Another problem people should be aware of though is that there are
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.360]   a lot of developers who have already put out the word that said, Look, if you give us a
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.880]   bug report that involves then involves 10 10, we are not going to treat it as seriously
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.280]   as a bug report for 10 nine. We what we are we are appreciative of bug testing, but we're
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.200]   not obligated to fix something that might fix itself in itself in the next version of
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.000]   the beta. So although when you when you install it, it installs a new tool which looks like
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   an email tool, but it's there. What is it? The feedback tool? Bug reporter bug reporter.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.520]   So they are saying give us information. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. That's Apple. Yeah. And
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.760]   it's other people that are saying that I can't think of the IOS third party third party developers
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.880]   part. I've heard from a bunch of them that have been saying that look, we are if you
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.840]   say that your problem, our program crashes in 10.10, that to us is not as big a problem
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.200]   as a crash that happens 10.9. So we're we could we are going to put that into our developer
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.960]   channel and we might address that later rather than sooner. So that's always that's why I
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.240]   make that's why again. I think that a lot of people are misunderstanding what a public
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.200]   beta is. It's not. Oh, cool. I get this awesome new operating system months before everybody
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.040]   else. It means that no, you get something that's not quite finished yet. Yeah. And so it's
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.760]   you even if it runs fine for the first two or three weeks, something might happen in the
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.600]   next week after that. And the day that a mission critical tool fails for stupid reason,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.880]   then you can't get tech support for it. Yeah, that's not a good thing.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.000]   Were there differences between the last developer preview and this public beta? The build numbers
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.800]   are different. So they are. I didn't. Yeah. I have to say it feels like a finished operating
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.240]   system to me. I have that's a danger. That's what Andy mentioned. We had a lot of people
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.560]   who just installed it thinking that it was an early access program and they were getting
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.960]   the final version. And that's never the case. Some people have it. I've had absolutely no
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.800]   problems. It's been fantastic for me, but I know people really, really smart technical
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.040]   people who had to uninstall it almost immediately because it was just not workable for them as
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.200]   a machine. I've had versions of iOS, not the current one, but versions of iOS with a phone
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.600]   just didn't work as a phone anymore. So you you are telling Apple that you are no longer
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.000]   like you're giving Apple care up, you're giving Apple stores up, you're going into a beta
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.440]   program and please most of all be classy. If an app doesn't work, do not go to the app
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.680]   store and give them a horrible review because they are not even allowed updating those apps
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:18.080]   yet. Yeah. Be classy. Stay classy beta testers on the other. So very, very appropriate comments
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:25.680]   Renee, but I still like it. It's awesome. Well, I think it also depends on what you're on
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.320]   what how important it is for your computer to run smoothly and how hard you're pushing
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.160]   in. And we should say you don't gain that much either on the other side of it, right?
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.160]   It's just different looking. It's different. Yeah, we have we have like two computers on
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.160]   Yosemite, two computers on Mavericks and everything else still on. Yeah, you need to
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.600]   eight, eight, eight, you're in a hardcore production. Yeah, because we can't afford to
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.080]   have all because it's not just for us, we're integrating with so much other hardware that
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.240]   we can't afford to know, you not know how that's going to interact and so on. So, but
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.320]   that's when you think about upgrading in, you know, bait and beta testing stuff, you
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.840]   do if you have a machine that you're willing to do that on, it's great to know what's happening
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.520]   next. But but definitely know that you could lose lots of our editors are still using
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.640]   Tiger. We don't get an external drive and food from that. That's it. By the way, I was
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:14.040]   going to do that until I lost my copy. But it's very easy to take the installer. The
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.440]   problem is, as it was with previous versions of OS 10, when you download it and immediately
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.640]   make a copy before you can complete the installation process so that you have a copy because as
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.800]   soon as it finishes installation and erases it to save space, it's five gigs plus. So,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.160]   if you want a copy, do that. And then you can make a bootable USB key or bootable external
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.440]   drive that will allow you to run Yosemite whenever you feel like it. That's probably the best
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.520]   way to do it or make a partition would be another way to do it.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:46.320]   This is also another good time to as always recommend SuperDuber, which is the best image
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.800]   this, giving a bootable backup of this drive as quickly and easily as possible because the
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.360]   easiest way to go from, I wish I hadn't done that thing to my system to having your system
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.800]   back is still this, the free version of SuperDuber. It's free for download for just click
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.240]   this button and back everything up. It's 30 or $40 for the cool stuff like scheduling
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.440]   and selective backups and stuff like that. But again, time machine, if you think the
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.560]   time machine is going to help you here, it will help you, but it won't put you back to
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.800]   where you were as quickly as SuperDuber bootable.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.880]   >> Bootable disk is great. Bootable recovery.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:22.280]   >> Hey, Curtis wants to know if we all can agree that the new finder is too happy.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.800]   >> It is a new finder icon and he's very happy. Is that we agree? No.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.000]   >> He deserves to be happy, Leo.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.960]   >> He should be happy. Why shouldn't he be happy?
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.760]   >> If that persists past four hours, he should definitely call a doctor. I will agree with
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.480]   that. And then Kurt, I'm sorry, that was Brian Elliot who said that. Then Kurt is
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.720]   be wants to know if it'll work on a virtual machine, if you can use parallel's or fusion
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.280]   at VMware. Fusion with it.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.440]   >> Well, there. See, you see how happy he is? That's a much broader smile.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.960]   >> I actually like the new one better.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.120]   >> I like the new one.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.640]   >> I think that extending the curve beyond the square added a little bit of flair that
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.640]   I like.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.120]   >> I think it looks like it's a lightning bolt that's about to strike.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:11.360]   >> But now, I don't know what I don't like. Now it reads like a happy face on a square.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.360]   >> It's true. It does.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.160]   >> Something with a little bit more style. I can't believe we're reviewing an icon.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.280]   >> It's the blue. Beautiful enough, Andy.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:25.120]   >> I just want to grab the course. I hate to jump on that bandwagon. But after this icon
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.560]   thing, I don't think that they can turn back from this.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.320]   >> I looked at this for about three years before I realized it was a face.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.960]   >> What? I had no idea it was a face.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.840]   >> Two faces and a face. It's actually three faces total.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.000]   >> Very percussive.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   >> Left face, right face and center face.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.800]   >> I was like, why is this the symbol for?
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   >> What did you think it was?
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.520]   >> I thought it was a Chinese letter.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   >> I knew that it was Explorer, right? But I was like, why is this symbol for Explorer?
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.960]   It must be some technical specification for coffee.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.440]   >> This actually in Chinese is that your dog.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.600]   >> We should make up.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   >> I don't find it.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.880]   >> People have to check this stuff. When you get tattoos or icons, you really got to check
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   it.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.160]   >> I think so. If you look closer, let's show that again.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:11.640]   It is less flat, more rounded. It's bezel beveled.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.240]   >> Yeah, it's more gradient.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:19.840]   >> This is not the flat OS everybody was saying. This is more 3D. Am I wrong?
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.840]   >> I'll stop.
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:26.800]   >> The rounded corners on the lines, I don't know. The lines separating the front face from
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.280]   the back face, I don't know.
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.840]   >> It's not drop shadow three, my friend.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.960]   >> It looks creamy and I don't -- with so much of my reaction to this new operating system
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.240]   and these new UIs, I have to separate this isn't like the thing that I've been using for
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.080]   the past 10 years from, I objectively don't like it.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.040]   >> I'm reacting negatively, but we'll see how it works.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.440]   >> I just want to make sure our listeners are clear. No where else in the world are you
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:55.240]   going to hear a long conversation about an icon for Apple?
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.240]   If you go to CNN, you're not going to see this kind of conversation.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240]   >> I'm not sure.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.400]   >> In depth discussion you're looking for.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.160]   >> I'm sure there's an icon somewhere.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   >> I'm sure there's an icon somewhere.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.360]   >> I'm sure there's a podcast somewhere where they're saying, only Apple puts this kind
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.720]   of craftsmanship, the umami of user interface design.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.280]   Now, why is it necessary for them to trim the lines?
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:20.800]   Well, because of -- now it's a view portal into the cognitive disruption.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:27.280]   >> I'm just going to say Steve Jobs would never have said yes to that, like God.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:32.200]   Taylor wants to know if he can run it on his hackintosh.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.200]   What are you, nuts?
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   >> Try it.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   >> If you're willing to hackintosh the computer.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   >> Do it.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.200]   >> Do it and let us know.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.200]   >> Good luck.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   God bless you.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.880]   >> You got to get that down on Spyro to do something.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.880]   It's not going to be Lennox.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.800]   It may as well be Mac OS 10.5.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   >> I like the new -- I was not a big fan of notifications in OS 10, but now with Yosemite,
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.240]   I kind of like the notification bar.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.720]   It gives you weather.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.680]   It gives you a clock faces.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   >> Widgets.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.080]   >> It's really basically, I think, to replace the dashboard widgets, isn't it?
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.080]   >> Yep.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.840]   I mean, they still have dashboard widgets, but a lot of that functionality.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.840]   And you can add stuff.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.920]   You can add extensions or whatever.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.720]   >> What are they called?
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.240]   >> Those are today view extensions.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.040]   >> Today view extensions.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.360]   >> Yeah, they're widgets, though.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.400]   And the different thing -- and this is more prevalent in our iOS, but on OS 10, too, instead
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.600]   of going to a separate screen, you can now pull in that notification that are to any
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.200]   screen that you're already on.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   >> Ah.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   >> That's more convenient.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   With -- I have a three-screen setup.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.920]   So, in my case, it is a little -- one thing that's changed very slightly is that when you're
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:40.680]   not -- when the screen is not active, the menu bar -- unholy, it goes dark.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.080]   And it's possible for me to have all three screens with dark menu bars, which just makes
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.280]   it a little weird because you can't really see it very well.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.800]   I tried for a while the dark -- you do now have a new option, a dark background menu bar,
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.080]   but the problem is none of the menu bar icons from any of the third-party developers know
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.080]   about that, so everything disappears.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.080]   So, it's --
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.120]   >> And the doc can run away from you.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.560]   >> The doc actually runs away.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.160]   >> Well, the doc can move depending on what monitor you're using.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.800]   >> So, you get up on a small doc like this.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.680]   >> Once in a while, it seems confused and it moves to the monitor that I'm not on.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.680]   That may be a bug that they're going to fix.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.760]   >> We are on -- multi-use -- I would actually guess probably more Mac users have multiple
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.000]   monitors than any other operating system.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.760]   It's a very -- that seems to anybody who's, you know, using a Mac, it's often used to
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.760]   it.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:25.760]   >> Two, three, really.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.360]   >> I mean, I have a -- I have a glutton.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.000]   A 31-inch 4K display, two 27-inch cinema displays.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.960]   >> Well, you're running your traffic control for Petaluma on your screen.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.960]   >> I am.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.960]   >> I am.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   Flight 73 heavy.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   Come on in.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.560]   >> Let's times -- it gives you an illusion that you're outside.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   You know?
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.760]   >> And it turns out I think you're the hassle of being out there with people.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:47.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.760]   It is.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.040]   In fact, that's -- I have windows behind it, but I can't see them, and that's just how
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.840]   I like it.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.920]   The outside world is scary.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:58.920]   What else -- the notification center is different.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   Again, a lot of the stuff that they talk touted on at WWDC take needs.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.120]   >> Get your messages app where you can actually leave group conversations, label group conversations,
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:12.920]   share stuff with groups.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:18.760]   >> There's a -- on -- I was at 9-5 Mac, there's a little forums thread with -- in fact, they
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.400]   call -- oh, sorry, it's Mac rumors.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.920]   It's all the little things.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.920]   And, you know, it is little things.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.920]   >> iOS inspired boot screen, new finder icon, adorable, flatter system icons, new font,
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:39.240]   new login screen, background, photo booth was gone, but it's now back.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.720]   Bing replaces Google's spotlight.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.920]   This -- I mean, there's a lot of little things, but most of them --
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.720]   >> All of this is nice.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   >> I've been using the spotlight.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:51.880]   I took Quicksilver off and, you know, command space, just like with Quicksilver.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:56.480]   I used control space, but command space, which was still as the spotlight search thing,
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.880]   now pulls up a center thing, which -- and it can put a lot -- anything, and just like
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.880]   Quicksilver, I like it.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:07.000]   >> It's not necessarily a big departure from the feature that we already have in 10.9 before,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.640]   but I was surprised at how much it reminded me of Siri now that you basically -- you hit
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.880]   a hotkey and then this thing takes over your screen.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.680]   It's like, I acknowledge that right now I'm going to do nothing but listen to what you
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.440]   tell me to do right now.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.640]   It seems like a really Siri-esque sort of interface, even though, of course, it has
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   nothing to do with Siri right now, but it does make me think that perhaps we're going
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.680]   to -- we're taking a look at a mechanism when they finally do put that feature in sometime
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.680]   later on.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.680]   >> Calculator apps redesign.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.680]   >> Hi, five.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.680]   >> The chess got to make over.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:42.880]   >> That's actually a big deal because they hadn't redesigned the calculator app since the
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.160]   very first version of OS 10.
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:53.160]   >> I doubt the engines different.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.160]   >> It turns out the ad calculation hasn't changed for --
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.400]   >> Ads plus one is still two and we're happy about that.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.720]   >> Although, according to the movie, Lucy, one plus one does not equal two.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.080]   >> Did you see Lucy Leo?
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.080]   >> I did.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.080]   >> I did too.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   >> I liked it.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.080]   >> I was seeing it.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.080]   >> I'm the only person who did, like 49 on Rotten Two and I won for one.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   >> It was a lot of fun.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.160]   >> I loved it.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.960]   >> I immediately want to do all that stuff.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.400]   >> I love seeing Scarlett Johansson kick some ass.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.880]   >> I was sad it wasn't a black widow movie but it was good for what it was.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.120]   >> It was kind of like a black widow movie.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.000]   >> At the end, this isn't a spoiler.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   It is a spoiler.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Don't listen.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Don't do spoilers.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.040]   This is the first week.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.040]   >> The whole thing ends with a USB key, a thumb drive.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.120]   >> Yeah, so our future now depends on the person being able to know the right way to
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   stick and go computer.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.520]   >> Wasn't that the same thing with the end of the end of what was the --
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.440]   >> It turns out if you have 100% intelligence, you become a thumb drive.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.760]   >> I think I've spoiled it for you.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.760]   >> Yes.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.760]   >> Did you see it?
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.760]   >> No, I haven't seen it.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:53.760]   >> You'll like the special effects.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.760]   >> Okay, there you go.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.920]   >> If it was a lightning drive, it wasn't like Independence Day when they got up there and
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.200]   were able to upload a virus into the main system.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.200]   >> I was telling you.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.200]   >> Man, it's great that code is the same.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   >> God, for you, us, beakies.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.760]   >> Scarlett Johansson, Jeff Goldblum, which one do you want to look at for in for 93 minutes?
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   >> I like Jeff Goldblum.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   I wouldn't mind looking at it for 90 minutes.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.760]   >> I wouldn't mind hearing him play piano.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.240]   >> I bet he's still a better piano player.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.600]   >> He has a jazz date somewhere in the LA area.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.600]   >> He plays all the time.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   >> That's great.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.160]   >> iTunes has been updated.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.400]   >> But it's all cosmetics.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:36.560]   >> There's a new font book icon.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:45.200]   >> Male now says hello from California and Stella from Cupertino, California.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.640]   What could that mean?
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.760]   >> And male has extensions now.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.840]   There's things like markup put right into male.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.840]   >> That's good because one hopes that the way open PGP will fix the incompatibility is
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.920]   now becoming an extension, which would be good.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.520]   Well, it's part of the overall style change of the entire operating system.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.200]   We're from now on, if there's a feature that you want, why would you buy another app to
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.960]   make that happen, just buy a little tool that makes it happen in the built-in apps?
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   >> Yes.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.920]   >> And that's another reason why this isn't going to be a great revolutionary thing for
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:17.200]   people to switch to the beta because so much of what is going to make your 70-grade will
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.040]   come on the release day when you see all of these third party apps and the well they
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   work together.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.720]   >> At this point, it's not that different, frankly.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.800]   >> It's an empty hall without an amusement park inside it.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.640]   >> It's even a haircut.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.080]   >> Did they get rid of the Green Felt in Game Center?
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.080]   >> Yes.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.840]   >> Your great Green Felt nightmare is over.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.840]   >> Someone in Cupertino has an apartment full of Green Felt now.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.800]   Don't worry, it's a ton of Green Felt.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.000]   We could use it for Green Screen.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.640]   We'll just send it over here.
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.360]   We'll cover everything in Green Felt in the whole studio could be Green.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.760]   >> I've been thinking about doing that.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.200]   In fact, then when you want to walk in and sneak up on people, we'll just wear a Green
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.200]   suit.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.200]   >> That'd be great.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   Camo Flage.
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:04.000]   >> Anything else to say about Yosemite?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.920]   You are right to caution people and I will reiterate that, Renee.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:16.400]   Don't do it unless you can afford, do it on a machine you can afford to lose.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.560]   Don't complain in the Apple Store if your favorite third party app doesn't work.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.800]   Of course it doesn't.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.200]   This is a preview.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.760]   This is not a free upgrade right now or early upgrade program.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.760]   This is a preview.
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:32.080]   >> We have an article on how to downgrade back to Mavericks.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.080]   >> You can't.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.440]   >> You can go backwards without losing everything.
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.920]   >> It depends.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.040]   There is some variation.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.720]   Some people can just boot into the recovery partition and Mavericks is still there and
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.280]   they can reinsert Mavericks.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.400]   Some people need to do the Internet boot and have it re-download Mavericks, but yeah,
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:48.400]   there's ways.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.400]   >> Okay.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.760]   Then Yosemite will be the old, the previous system.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.760]   You just pay them over it.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.120]   >> All right.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.120]   More to come.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.120]   The Beats acquisition.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.120]   We're one step closer.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.720]   >> Beat goes on.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   >> Beat goes on.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:09.280]   >> The first word for personal capital.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.640]   >> The guy who started personal capital was Bill Harris was a guest on the triangulation
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.640]   two years ago.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640]   I mentioned this before.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.760]   Former president of Intuit and of PayPal, he really knows money.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.760]   And I think he saw an opportunity here to help people understand their money situation
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.920]   better.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.280]   But unlike some other programs do the same thing, this is with an eye toward planning
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.320]   for the future.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.560]   He calls it wealth management.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.800]   I think that's a very good way to describe it.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   Personal capital.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.760]   It's a free, secure tool.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.520]   You can go to personal capital dot com slash Mac break right now and sign up for it.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.960]   You put all your financial data in there and it keeps it up to date with real time bar
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.160]   charts, graphs, pie charts, you know exactly where your assets are on a single screen,
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.560]   whether it's your computer, your smartphone, your tablet, real time, it's intuitive.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:01.240]   They'll tell you if you're overpaying your 401K fees, if you haven't balanced your portfolio
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:09.120]   right, you haven't allocated your assets right, how to maximize your shot at retiring comfortably.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.720]   Wealth management, building your wealth, I feel guilty even saying that, but it really
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.800]   is true.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.480]   If you don't take care of yourself, no one else is going to personal capital.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.360]   You'll also get tailored advice just for you on optimizing your investment.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   Don't wait.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.360]   And it's to sign up.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.680]   You will achieve big dividends immediately and you'll be glad.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.640]   You'll 20 years from now, you'll look back and say, thank goodness Leo told me about
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.360]   personal capital.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.240]   Personal capital dot com slash Mac break.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.320]   Best of all, this is free.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.600]   It's the smart way to grow your money and I'm thrilled to have them on the show.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.000]   I've been using them since Bill was on the triangulation.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.640]   I've been very, very happy with it.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.800]   It is one step closer.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:58.000]   Europe has now approved of the Apple takeover, the $3 billion takeover of Beats.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.520]   However, Bose is suing Beats saying, hey, we invented noise reduction headphones.
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.880]   You can't, you can't make them.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.600]   Hey, you have real money now.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.080]   Let's get some of that Apple money.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.000]   Let's wait until you're on the hook before we see you.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.880]   Apple's never made noise canceling headphones.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.920]   Is that something that Apple wants to do?
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   I don't really know.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.240]   I guess, but that was, it worked.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   It was very quiet.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.520]   We were impersonating a make all the things.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   Cancellation.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   I don't know.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.480]   I haven't really found, I'm going to try some noise canceling headphones.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.320]   I have a couple of folks in the company that have said they're really good and I'm going
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.160]   to get a shot, but I like the same thing.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:41.600]   We wear the edimatix deep in our ears and that shuts out all sounds.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.640]   We hear the music clean and pure.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.360]   The problem with noise canceling is it's got a little microphone in it essentially and
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.640]   it's flipping the, it's inverting the wave form.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:55.360]   So it mixes the jet engine sound and with the end of the carols it out.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.360]   Doesn't do a perfect job.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.960]   It gives you a very odd effect when you put it on.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.800]   That's been my thing.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.000]   And I mean, I think it's imperfect.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   I haven't trusted it.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.800]   I am going to charge it up.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   Right.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   Well, I'm going to hand in the ass.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.120]   I'm going to try the little bows, I guess, now has in ear versions that I'm going to give
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.160]   it a shot and I'll let people know what I think of it.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.840]   But I've always not liked the sound of it.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:23.080]   I've always found that I, and I also, I only use in ear because I don't like to pack over
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.080]   the ear ones.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   No.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   Usually I'm just stingy about my space.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.960]   Berkeley Steven in our chat room has a good use case.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.520]   He's a helicopter pilot.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.520]   Right.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.880]   And it's true when you get in the helicopter you put on those headphones.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.560]   Noise canceling would help a lot.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.840]   It works best with a certain kind of continuous sound.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.720]   When I love noise canceling microphones when I'm driving.
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:44.720]   But I'm, but that's it.
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.720]   And so you, for a Hello pilot, you want to, you wouldn't want to put it in your, you wouldn't
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.720]   hear anything.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   And you could conch out and you'd go.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:58.680]   So when you're playing your flight of the Valkyries, you still want to hear a little
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.680]   ambient sound.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.720]   You want to hear your passenger screaming because it might be good stuff.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.720]   It was fun.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   We did a helicopter.
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   I had never done this.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.720]   And Lisa, who is a daredevil convinced me to do one on Hawaii.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.280]   And we flew over the island of Maui.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   They're fun.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:15.720]   And like on Magnum PI.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.960]   That's the funny thing.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.280]   The first song is the Magnum PI theme.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.400]   So it lifts up and it's going and you know, it intentionally kind of flies like this.
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.760]   It's the Magnum PI theme.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   That's awesome.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.760]   And I thought, wow, this is weird.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.280]   But you know, that's why everyone wants to go.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.280]   They're like, I just want to be a man.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:36.120]   And then he does, he says, and he says, I know we really love Magnum PI here on the
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   island of Maui.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.480]   And over to your left, your CD, you all came out of the alcohol.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.800]   And then there's pop music going the whole time.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.440]   But they've timed it.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.800]   So like when they fly into a rain cloud, it's actually, you know, going, listen to the
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.320]   rhythm of your song.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:51.320]   He's got a little random selector.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.320]   No, no, no, it's on an iPod.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.040]   It's got a little iPod and they do the same flight every day, eight times a day.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.880]   So they know exactly what they're going to do.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   It's all timed out.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.120]   That shows off another advantage of those, the silicone in air in ear solutions because
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.880]   as often as I use them to listen to music on airplanes, I also use them just simply
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.720]   because I don't want to have to listen to that argument that's happening to Rose.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.560]   I don't even like noise cancellation doesn't work with that very well.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.680]   You still, I mean, this is this is just when you when you don't have music pumping through
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.800]   them, they are just simply earplugs.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.440]   There have been times I've been caught like I didn't know that I was going to be at a
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.480]   movie that was going to be this loud.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.720]   Like when I saw the Superman movie, we came in late.
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.200]   So I was like three aisles.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.520]   I don't know what was the Superman movie or the or the or the or the Pacific Rim movie,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   but whatever.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.040]   I was like so close to the iMac speakers that I just had to like go into my bag, root through
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.480]   them, find my earplugs and put them in just for protection.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:50.880]   And those and on top of the idea that I'm not the person who can be trusted to keep
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.160]   no powered headphones charged in every time I want them.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.960]   And like you Alex, I don't like having a big bulky thing in my bag just because over
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:04.520]   a week long trip, I might use them for four hours during during 140 hours of being out
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.520]   there.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.520]   Well, that's true.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.520]   The edimos are light and simple.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.600]   I have a couple of them usually just because I lose them wash them and but but the but
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   I that's the negative.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.600]   They do not serve a high.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:17.760]   The little ones in case you're wondering the edimos do not survive a cycle of the wash
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.800]   and I've a couple of them gone down that way.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   But the I put them in.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.360]   I don't even plug them in half the time when I'm in an airplane.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:27.440]   I just, you know, I'm not ready to listen to anything.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:28.680]   I may not be set up for anything.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.600]   I just use them as earplugs and they're pretty good.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.760]   I shot a little video.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.320]   This is from the helicopter ride in on Yash a little video.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:45.120]   That helicopter was really low right there.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.080]   It was like right over there.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.800]   It was in the house outside.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   We love back up here in Hawaii and we want to walk to be aboard.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.880]   Actually, you can't be bothered to update on the water for the new Hawaii 5.0 shows.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.440]   So we're going to use the same booth that we've been using.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:08.960]   I thought Hawaii 5.0 maybe but anyway.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   Other acquisitions.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.280]   Apple's getting the apples got something going on.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:17.200]   I feel like there is a there's something we can read into the tea leaves of these acquisitions.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   So you got beats.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.080]   Swell, which is a radio app.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.600]   They got a cheap $30 million.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   Nothing.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   Nothing nowadays.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.800]   That was like a rounding error compared to beats.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.400]   One hundredth of what beats cost.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.200]   Thirty million nothing.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.480]   Pocket change.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:36.880]   And then Pandora for books start up called Book Lamp.
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.280]   We don't know how much they pay for Book Lamp.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.560]   I'm guessing it wasn't 30 million even.
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:46.360]   They say higher than 10 million lower than 15.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:51.760]   So actually Book Lamp was kind of interesting because it was like more like Pandora than
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.240]   anything because it was a genome project.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:31:02.080]   So they would look at books by content and then so their visualization is like here's
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:03.720]   50 Shades of Grey.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:10.960]   If you're looking for the good parts of 50 Shades of Grey, this is how much erotica.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.880]   And then I guess where the stars are is a place you should probably bookmark it.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:24.160]   But meanwhile letters to Penthouse 28.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:30.240]   It's a lot like Amazon's X-ray service, which is really useful for actual Kindle branded
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.200]   I love X-ray.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:37.800]   I love it too because there are times when I've finished a really great 500-600 page
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.240]   book and then there are times where I'm on a plane.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.800]   It's like an hour and 20 minute flight.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.280]   I don't want to read the entire thing, but I really wanted to read.
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.840]   I remember that really great scene with this character and boy, we'll just tell you exactly
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.840]   where to go to see the thing that you want.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.520]   It'll tell you on a longer book, I've never managed to make it through American Gods
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.960]   and like one dose all the way through.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.360]   It's always I'll read it for a day or two and then put it away for a week than there
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   to later.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.760]   But in those gaps, you miss all the fine points.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.560]   The next way we'll tell you, okay, well, if you want to know more about this character,
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.760]   here's what this character is all about and here's where he or she appears in the rest
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.760]   of the book.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.160]   So if they want to try to enhance I books and make it a little bit more, look for opportunities
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:22.120]   for greatness and beguilement, that's certainly a great way to do it.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:29.720]   So Aaron Stanton, who is the guy behind book lamp, had founded a previous website called
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.520]   Can Google Hear Me?
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:43.880]   Leo, who was, I guess, a site that he wanted to get Google to hear his idea.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   So he created this site, Can Google Hear Me?
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.200]   And that was his book lamp.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.960]   Google apparently didn't, but Apple did.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.120]   So there.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:56.520]   So what it's interesting, what Apple's putting together here, doesn't it sound like an interesting
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.680]   content play?
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.640]   Swell kind of makes sense as building out Apple radio with talk.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.560]   I mean, it's one of Apple's problems right now is that a lot of their, some of their tent
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:15.120]   pole features are now commonplace where there was a time when like, when iTunes was a really,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   really big deal.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:21.440]   Now there are a million different music library manager managers on your device.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.400]   And now people are not even so interested in actually manipulating direct media.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.280]   They just want content to come in.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:32.360]   So if you have a device that they don't want the iPad to be a generic book reader that will
[00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.680]   run a number of reading apps, they want to make sure that iBooks is the place you want
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.760]   to go for reading your book because that experience is going to be better than any other Google
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.400]   Play book reader or even the Kindle reader is going to be.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.280]   And if they can do that by adding features, great.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:50.960]   Similarly, if they can, they, they really kicked off podcasting by with that really great
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.800]   podcasting library, but now the Mac and the iOS devices are just other devices that do
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.880]   podcasts.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.400]   So if they simply roll that into the standard music player and say that we will just simply
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.760]   tell us what you want.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.360]   And we will make sure that you will hear hearing the podcasts you like, not just by name and
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.280]   by title, but by simply saying that I like podcasts of this title.
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.720]   And when you skip past things that you don't like after 10 or 50 hours of an hour long
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.080]   show, it learns that, okay, he doesn't like that.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.360]   So I'm a little bit.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.560]   Stitcher, does that there are program this lacquer?
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.960]   I think might do that.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.440]   There are programs to do that.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.920]   I've never seen it work very well.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   I don't know about other people.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.440]   Recommendation engines suck, right?
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.440]   Yes.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.600]   And also, I think it's kind of interesting if they were to with Pandora, you have never
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   heard of this band, you have never heard of this album before, but it's being presented
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   to you.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.320]   You like it and you thumbs up about it, but did you really form a connection, like an
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.240]   audience connection to that material?
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.080]   So I'm wondering if they really do succeed in creating a talk radio, like a Pandora talk
[00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   radio thing.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:56.400]   I'll be very, very pleased when like, answer me, this comes on, but will it be right now?
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:02.600]   I'm such a fan of answering me this that it's a top of my podcatcher is told to whenever
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:07.280]   in a new episode of this comes on, put that at the very, very top of the very next playlist.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:11.160]   I know when they are supposed to drop on a certain day, but they don't.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.120]   I'm wondering if that will change the relationship between an audience and a podcast.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.160]   When you stop being this rabid fan of this can't miss podcast and it simply becomes,
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.560]   you turn on this, you press this one button, you let Apple do the staring for you and you're
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.360]   happy if it comes on, if it doesn't come on, maybe you don't even notice because there's
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.640]   so much else that's coming in there.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:32.720]   And one of the things that I think that we haven't seen yet is we can't really reproduce
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.720]   radio because we have to either all talk or have all music, so we're Spotify or Pandora
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:40.920]   is all music and we're all talk.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.080]   There is the opportunity for a company like Apple or Google.
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.200]   It makes a little music in between the podcasts.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.520]   Well, what if you could create a radio show, like a real radio show, if you could, if I
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:53.360]   could say I'm going to talk through here and then I'm going to play the song.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.600]   Now I'm not playing the song in the stream, I'm activating the song or building a playlist
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   for you essentially.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.600]   It takes you to do that.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:00.600]   That's not.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.880]   Yeah, have you played with a new NPR one, which just came out yesterday?
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:09.640]   This is NPR's app that out of the box has human curated recommendations and then watches
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.640]   you to improve it.
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.280]   I don't think that's the way that computers do it.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.040]   I just don't think the computers are good.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.040]   It sucks.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.440]   So the thing is, is that the idea is that I want, I want to hear, I do want it to be
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.200]   human curated and I want to have, I want to subscribe to some dude that I really trust.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.080]   And so the idea is that's a DJ.
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:33.360]   And the thing is, is the DJs could, if you figured this part out where you could actually
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.720]   have a real radio show that's a mixture of music and a mixture of a new morning show,
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.720]   the issue is you get to a point where it could be live and then I fire a song, but the song
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:46.240]   is being fired by the application, which is not breaking any of the rules.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.560]   Then you get into this whole thing where now you're really taking radio out of the picture,
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.800]   because now you're able to do all the things that you would normally do without breaking
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   any copyright.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.680]   And then we all do that a little bit by, you know, you listen to some music, then you fire
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.520]   up a mono and you listen to some stories and you fire up.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:04.120]   You do, but I mean, the thing is I would stop watching, you know, I mean, you want it to
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.120]   all kind of.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.120]   I just want to have radio.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   I want to have the radio experience without the, the tuner.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   You know, I just want to know.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   There's an opportunity for us there somewhere.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.120]   Yes.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   Well, this is funny is that.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   This is the book lamps team.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.840]   They look straight out of Silicon Valley, the HBO show.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.840]   What kept confusing me is that Pandora, as far as I know, is still a US only.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.280]   So when I woke up and saw these headlines, I thought that Apple was doing streaming books
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.280]   and streaming podcasts.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:28.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.480]   And I didn't even think about the recommendation engine because I never use it.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:35.280]   So that, that mental switch for me took a while to fall.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.080]   It's also Apple's first acquisition from Idaho.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.560]   Do we know that Leo?
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:43.880]   According to tech crunch, and I think they've seen pretty close.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.720]   30 million dollars go a long way in Idaho.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.120]   That's, yeah, I think much more than California.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:53.280]   I feel like it's nice to see Apple focusing a little bit on content.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   You know, and better content.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.720]   I think they should focus a lot on content.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.720]   I mean, there's an opportunity there.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.240]   That's what they do with it though.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.160]   I mean, Chomp has an opinion.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   Exactly.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.560]   They often seem to take this by the stuff and effectively take it off the market.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.960]   Even Siri was more, was better before Apple got it, I think.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.640]   Maybe you could argue that one, but.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   It was better in some ways.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.120]   Now it's better in other ways.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   Right.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:20.040]   It does underscore that Apple's going to have to do more than come up with really cool phones
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.120]   and really cool devices now.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:26.000]   They really have to go back to what they were about 10 years ago where, before the iPhone
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.480]   days where they just had this wonderful system that if you, if you, if you basically bought
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.560]   the golden key that let you into Apple land, you found out that you're, gee, all the devices
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.520]   that I have work great in Apple land and all the, I don't have to, like my computer stays
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.520]   running.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.520]   I don't have viruses.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.320]   Boy, I want to stay in Apple land my entire life.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:48.200]   And now that other companies have gotten almost as good at creating devices, a lot of companies
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.360]   have become much better at creating services.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.440]   And there's still a bunch of software suites out there for which Apple just doesn't have
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.680]   an answer to and their multi platform or their exclusive to Windows.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.960]   They really need to, they're doing a great job of building up this world where come back
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.600]   to Apple land where you don't, you know, don't, don't buy a third party podcasting app.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:09.400]   Don't, don't let, don't let other other people handle your creation.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.880]   We will handle curation for you and it will be awesome.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   Give us a try.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.360]   You can leave whenever you want, but I don't think you'll want to go because we're going
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.680]   to create such a great world for you.
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.720]   I briefly flirted with the idea of making Twitmore varied.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.200]   Remember we did food shows and we did other stuff.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.800]   And what I found is that people who come here want to know what they're going to get.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.960]   So they kind of want to, the stuff that goes best for us is stuff that goes right down
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.760]   the middle of our content, you know, technology news and help and information.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.360]   And so it needs to be something like Apple if you're going to be, if it's going to be
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.320]   this higher level kind of medicuration.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:44.200]   But I don't think people, when people want a channel, they want, they want that to know
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.920]   what that channel is going to do, don't you think?
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:46.920]   I think so.
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:50.040]   I mean, people, a lot of people like to watch, you know, TNT and there's a lot of things.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.520]   Yeah, this all mixed up once I think that it's, I think it just depends on how.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:55.400]   But that, and that used to be because you didn't have much choice.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:59.040]   So you turn on a channel and you get, but now because you have choice and control with
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.760]   your DVR, people don't just turn on TNT and let it sit there.
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.360]   But I think the opportunity though is looking at what people that overlap a certain amount.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.000]   So, you know, I think that, you know, how you, I don't know.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.600]   Well, I always thought that we'll do the geek experience.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.360]   So geeks like comic books, but they, and they like this and that.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.520]   And it's a broader and it didn't work.
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.400]   At least as far as our, yeah.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.840]   But, but now we're not talking about tuning into one broadcast, podcast network and keep
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.200]   in the dial there.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:30.120]   We're talking about every single podcast that there is will be streaming to this one app.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.640]   And whenever you don't like something, you simply say thumbs down.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.840]   And after about a week, it's probably going to start to get really good at finding stuff
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.160]   that you like.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.000]   And this is, this is one of the offshoots of all of these people that are out there on
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.760]   a very much part time basis on a very much not for profit basis, just producing one good
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:52.880]   podcast every now and then that if there's 100,000 of these people putting out shows,
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.760]   there's a good chance that you're going to find a, you know, blind pigs going to find
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.520]   a truffle every now and then.
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.920]   You think about how well this solves a certain problem where if you meet me and we're having
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.000]   lunch and you ask me what kind of podcast I've listened to, I will enthuse, I'll be really
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.520]   enthusiastic about five or six or seven of them.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.160]   But what if you don't meet a person and what if you don't, it's kind of a complicated
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.600]   way to discover great new shows.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:22.480]   Most people are going to think that if the bugle is really good political satire, but
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.480]   maybe there are 10 political satire shows that are almost as good that once every two
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:30.960]   weeks becomes out and rotation is going to be is going to serve that role.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:31.960]   So it's good for discovery.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.880]   But again, I just wonder if there are a lot of people that like five by five podcasts,
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.600]   that like Twitch podcast, that like incomparable podcast, because they agree with you and the
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   people who care.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.720]   I feel like it's up to them though to curate it rather than me.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.400]   You know, and so for a lot of people, it might be frustrating that they don't listen to podcast,
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.440]   not because they don't like them, but because it's so hard to find those shows that have
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:54.200]   that consistent week after week after week hit rate.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.640]   And that's something Apple could do very well.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.320]   Apple has released new Mac and Tush's, but here's an interesting Apple support document.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:08.360]   This is a support.apple.com HT 5634 system requirements for bootcamp.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:13.000]   If you scroll down and thanks to the chat room for this, to all the different Mac models
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.840]   and get to the Mac mini, wait a minute, low and behold, there's a mid 2014 Mac mini.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.840]   Have we seen that?
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.840]   No.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.760]   So we know there's a mid of 24.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.480]   This is mid 2014 right now.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.000]   Apple, you better hurry if you're going to release that.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   It doesn't seem spec wise to be any different from the late 2012 Mac mini, at least in terms
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.360]   of running Windows, but that's that was modified July 28th, this document.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.680]   Just thank you, Chatham, for finding that.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.760]   The new Mac books are here, kind of one of those slipstreamed upgrades.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.120]   It was a press release.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.120]   That's pretty much it.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:54.040]   If you go to the store, prices are pretty much the same.
[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.400]   So a tiny little price.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:01.320]   It's a Haswell bump, more RAM in the stock 15 inch MacBook Pros, now 16 gigs RAM.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.280]   100 bucks off the old classic Mac Pro.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.960]   It's nice that they've kept that alive.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:12.520]   The classic MacBook Pro, which is the last one with a spindle with a DVD CD player, 100
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   bucks less.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.640]   And a spinning hard drive.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.280]   So I think that's education, right?
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.280]   Or people who just for some reason.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.920]   Because people who just have to have an optical?
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.720]   Have to have optical.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:24.560]   Anything to say about these new Mac Pros?
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:26.560]   Could I rush out and get one?
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   The MacBook Pro.
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.560]   MacBook Pro.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:32.080]   If you've been, I think if you've been waiting for one, maybe.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:36.720]   Because this indicates that if you're expecting a really titanic update to existing stock,
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:39.600]   it's clearly that it's not going to happen.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.160]   It could mean that they're simply running out of the old parts and it's just cheap enough
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.280]   to just put the new parts in.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.000]   It doesn't answer the question of whether or not Apple is going to be coming out with
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.480]   12 inch retina models or 12 inch MacBook Air retina models.
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.520]   So if you're holding out hope for that, if you can hold your breath for another couple
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.200]   of months, it might be worth it.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.680]   But as always, there comes a time when you realize that you could have been benefiting
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:06.240]   from this great new technology for the past 11 months instead of waiting, waiting, waiting
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.480]   for something that turned out to be not as good as what you were hoping for.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:13.440]   Is this because Broadwell, because Intel's is delayed Broadwell?
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.760]   I mean, it almost feel like to me, Apple was waiting for Broadwell.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.920]   Yeah, it was absolutely where I agree with that.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.840]   And then they finally, they themselves said, okay.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.840]   We got to do something.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.520]   Well, I mean, they probably would have done that.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.080]   They traditionally do the bump app.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.640]   They do the new architecture, then they do the bump a few months later, and then they
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.200]   go to the next generation architecture.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.440]   It's just in this case that next generation architecture slipped till the fall and that
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.080]   looks like it's slipping till next year.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.920]   Apple is probably big enough and buys enough of the exact same part that they can get.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:42.080]   The dull get those chips first, the same way that it was previous generation MacBook
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.160]   Airs, but it's still probably not a position.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.920]   You know, Apple, if they had their druthers, would probably want to get that out faster.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.440]   What is different about a Broadwell from Haswell?
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.640]   I mean, it's different enough in terms of graphics and power efficiency that it'll allow
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.680]   something like a retina MacBook Air to be built where it would not be pretty to build
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.840]   it on Haswell.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:02.800]   Right.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.480]   Is this the new Mac mini?
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:13.080]   2.3 gigahertz Mac mini, i7, 4 gigs memory, terabyte hard drive.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.080]   That's not.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:15.080]   Is that it?
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.880]   Plus there's a press release.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   It's hard to tell.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.720]   That just shows you that these upgrades, you know, well, you got to crack it open and look
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.920]   for the Haswell stamp inside.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.360]   That's what I want to know is this Haswell, they don't have a Haswell, do they?
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.360]   No, not yet.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.520]   It's the new 22 nanometer process technology with advanced core micro architecture.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.760]   That's what it is.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.120]   The Peter Cohen explained this really well.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:40.440]   That Mac mini is based on that same old MacBook Pro with the DVD drive in it.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.360]   Apple has an update of the architecture to the new Mac Pro architecture.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.600]   And you know, that's the next big one.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.600]   That's what we're waiting for.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.600]   And that would be Haswell.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   You'd know that because it would be a Haswell part.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:53.160]   And maybe on, you know, the SSI, the SSD on the PCIe.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.400]   I mean, all the benefit.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.800]   The new architecture.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.880]   That's what I want.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   Love that PCI.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   Sweet ride.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.880]   It is a sweet ride.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.360]   It's a good way to describe it.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.360]   All right.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:09.240]   So I don't think that if there is a slipstreamed Mac mini mid 2014, I don't think it's there
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   yet in the store.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.040]   We've almost certainly got our options.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.040]   Just watching with interest.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.120]   There'll be some indication.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.520]   Definitely ready for them.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:21.320]   They put a press release out for, again, $100 price drop on a Mac Pro that they're hoping
[00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.880]   that nobody will ever buy.
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.880]   So there's no way they just sneak it in and hope that people sort of discover it.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.160]   And I'm a new Mac mini.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.680]   And I what I'm hoping and I don't have a lot of hope is the big problem that we have
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.880]   with the Mac minis is not that they're the CPU isn't powerful enough, but they don't
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:38.760]   put a GPU that's powerful enough, you know, for a lot of applications.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.480]   You have to buy on the MacBook Pro.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:43.240]   You have to buy the highest in MacBook Pro to have dedicated GPU.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   That's the 20.
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   Yeah, that's all we get.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.760]   I mean, but I think that's all you'll ever get on a mini.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.240]   Really you think the mini doesn't have that.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.680]   So saying you'll never get it.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.680]   You'll always get iris on a mini.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.680]   I never get it.
[00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:57.000]   I know that's the that's the big bomb external Thunderbolt GPU Alex future.
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   Really?
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Yeah, that would work.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.400]   People talk about it's fast enough.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.400]   That's buses fast enough.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   Underbolt fast enough.
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   I'll try that.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:11.440]   Thunderbolt Thunderbolt is kind of a gatekeeper sort of technology because it really does seem
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:15.240]   like there are people who would never ever in a million years think about having a certain
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:19.240]   accessory that works via Thunderbolt and sort of becomes that moment where you ask
[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:24.280]   this user, okay, if you want this sort of graphics hardware, we've got it, but it will
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:29.240]   involve having another box on your desktop that will plug in via a cable.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.960]   And you know, we really do have great graphics acceleration on board.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:37.760]   So but if you really want it, we can put this extra box on your desktop if you really,
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.000]   really want it, I suppose.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.040]   And there are people who really do want that just like there are people who really, really
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.360]   do want certain rate solutions and people who really, really do want certain bizarre
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:48.880]   types of bus standards on it.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:54.920]   So I think that maybe this is providing to be that big hurdle that or to quote a money
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:59.400]   by phone sketch is like, you know, if you the insurance person who has to come in and
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.160]   fill up a five gallon bottle of urine, not because they need the urine, but because they
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.200]   want to make sure you're really serious about wanting to buy insurance before you come in
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.600]   to buy something.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.240]   So maybe this is a way of Apple sort of sort of.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:12.880]   People do that, really?
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.520]   No, no, it's a vivid imagination.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.320]   It's a sketch.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.320]   It's a sketch.
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.320]   I'm sure it's on YouTube.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.320]   It's funny.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:23.320]   Okay.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.320]   Eric, I'll find gallons.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.320]   That's a lot.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:27.520]   Well, and I think that I never thought that.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.520]   Oh, no, heaven's note.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.120]   Why do you ask me to bring it in for?
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.720]   Oh, we just want to make sure you're sure is serious, but why do you buy insurance?
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.720]   It took me two weeks to bring it in.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   No, no, for heaven's sake.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   We're going to wait.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:38.720]   Don't break it.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.720]   It's the last thing we'd want.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.480]   Well, and I think that the, I never thought that I would say, you know, you see these
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.240]   ads and say, the web runs faster on this PC or whatever.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.840]   And the reality is the web does run faster on a MacBook Pro with, you know, than it does
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   on a Mac mini.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.840]   You know, and that's the thing with all the web browsers using.
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.840]   For you, that's something important.
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.520]   And for us, that becomes an issue.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:01.840]   So we want GPU, we want Haswell, and we want, if possible, SSD on the PC.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:02.840]   Well, Xbox.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   Picking and streaming.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.840]   It's 2014.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.440]   Please, Apple, we beg of you.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.880]   Please, all you have to do is buy the old one, Leo, and they'll do it.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.880]   I mean, they're just waiting on you.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.080]   I don't want the old one.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:20.000]   So I don't usually, you know, make much of patents, Apple patents, everything it can.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.800]   But this one I like.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.480]   Smart navigation patent.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:27.000]   They just got it from the USPTO.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   It based on real time crowdsource, stop sign and stop light based traffic analyses
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.560]   to find the fastest path to a destination.
[00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:38.040]   You know, that's one thing.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:42.720]   I don't know of any nav app that pays attention to the timing of stop lights.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.200]   But of course, if you're really, you know, if you drive the same route every day, you're
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.880]   kind of aware of, well, I need to, you know, stick to this speed so that I can go boom,
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.080]   boom, boom through those lights.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.080]   It's always red, Leo.
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.080]   They're just always.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:50:00.560]   You know, I mean, if you're driving a pregnant lady to the emergency room and she's dilated
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.440]   X centimeters, then yes, timing, timing your roots.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.400]   You hit all the green lights.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.200]   I'm sure that's a really big deal.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.240]   There comes a time where you realize that you're not Steve McQueen in bullet, you know,
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.600]   it's okay if you if it's a difference of five minutes is a very big deal or 10 minutes
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.800]   is a big deal.
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.640]   If you can cut.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   I don't think there's a lot of flab that you can get back by by making sure that it's
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.160]   so satisfying when you never have to tap the brake.
[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.240]   You just kind of, even though you're not going as fast as you don't have a good 25
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.520]   miles an hour, but you just motor the funniest one is a.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.320]   At night, Vanessa in San Francisco is actually the opposite.
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.480]   You actually have to speed by five miles an hour to actually.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.480]   It's a little faster.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.480]   But you have to go faster.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.640]   For the example, you want to hit that because you're going up that hill in Venice.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.760]   You just want to hit that.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:42.760]   That's the other thing.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:46.720]   How many of how many of us and how many people listening have almost gotten to a huge accent
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.800]   by somebody who really wanted to make sure they hit that light.
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.480]   They realize that green has been on for a while.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.200]   That doesn't mean and stuff laying off the gas.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.640]   They said, I'm just going to floor because I bet I can make it when I do it.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.640]   Hey, wait, that's me.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.640]   Yellow.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   No, I got re-rated by a guy.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:02.200]   I got re-rated by a guy in San Francisco.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.200]   I got out.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.000]   He said, I thought you were going to go through that yellow light.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   I re-rated the guy.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   I re-rated the guy.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   Not very hard.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.480]   I re-rated the guy and just bumped into it because he was supposed to go through that.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.480]   It was yellow.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.480]   Was that you?
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.480]   No.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.480]   It was Alex.
[00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.120]   But I see he looks out.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:20.480]   He's about to get out of his car and he sees he looks back to me and I'm like, he's like
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   yelling at him and stuff like that.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   He just kept on driving.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   He just kept on driving.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:25.480]   When I get hit on calm, I'm calm.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.480]   It's like it's an accident.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.480]   That was 20 years ago.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:28.480]   I was just for.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:36.160]   The only time I've ever been upset about that was I was giving it.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:39.120]   And we'll never know what that anecdote was.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.000]   The most important thing to understand is stopped.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.760]   The answer is 42.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:50.120]   No, it's all about the number of seconds left for the number one reason to have that
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.120]   little stop.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.200]   Let me hand it shows you the number of seconds before the yellow light turns on.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.200]   The hand's good.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   Pay attention.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   I'm going to ask Ross walks.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   They often give you seconds.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   I know that's what I look at the second.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   That's how I was your town.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   So if I see eight seconds.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   So I'm going three miles an hour.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.080]   He's the worst part of the hill.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:09.360]   Have you noticed that it used to be that all I wanted was green lights and now a lot
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.360]   of times I want red lights because you're not.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.360]   They can check better.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   You're going to check the math.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.360]   Oh, so I can text.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   No, I don't.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   I don't.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.360]   I only text.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.360]   I'm absolutely sorry.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.360]   I'm not what I will.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.360]   Look at this.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.360]   Just look at this.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   They've got satellites, radio towers, a network.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.520]   They've got automobiles.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.760]   They've talking to everything.
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:29.960]   Just talking to one another to help you get through that red light a little bit faster.
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.840]   I don't know if they, but they could do this.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:37.040]   And this is something I feel like there's so much information that that phone is gathering
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.600]   about your position, your speed.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.600]   So useful.
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:44.000]   And of course the privacy considerations might keep us from using this.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.400]   But a lot of that information would actually probably be useful for the, not only for the
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.120]   users, but it'd probably be good for the cities to understand how the flow is working.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.120]   Do they do that in Canada?
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.680]   They have some control, but I don't think they have.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.000]   They would, that kind of big data would be really useful.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Yes, cities.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.920]   That's what they say they do, but based on personal experience, they cannot scientifically
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.160]   verify that they do anything.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.520]   They don't time the lights at all.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:10.320]   And they say they do Leo, but they don't seem to work out and given the terms people.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.320]   Isn't that funny?
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.320]   That's something I really look forward to with driverless cars.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:16.480]   If they have, if there's enough saturation that they can, they can say that here's, they
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.480]   would know.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:22.080]   Yeah, but they can, they can basically say that we're going to actually have you drive, have
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.960]   your car moves more slowly.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.920]   But that means that by the end of the trip, you will get there faster because traffic
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:29.020]   as a whole will be better.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:30.020]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:34.680]   Hey Renee, last week we were talking about, in fact, we didn't, you were very kindly offered
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:41.380]   to get us a call from the guy who did the Hope X talk.
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:46.520]   Yeah, on, on, and I forgot his last name now, but,
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:54.720]   On the 10s across the trash, the trash, on, on, on the security risks in an iPhone, Steve
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.280]   Gibson did do a, and I'm sure you stayed tuned for that.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:05.260]   And I saw some Twitter conversation afterwards from Shadarski and yourself and others.
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:12.760]   Steve's opinion was that Apple very reasonably was balancing convenience and security.
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:17.840]   So for instance, if you encrypt the data on the phone whenever you lock the screen, you
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.680]   don't, you can't get text messages.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.440]   You can't, the phone cannot operate with the data encrypted.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.520]   So of course it only encrypts when the phone is off when you shut it down.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:31.400]   And it can't possibly encrypt wallets on even if the screen lock is on.
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:35.280]   It's useful to know that, but that all makes sense.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.680]   And he, in, in almost every respect, he said, this is not an unreasonable choice for Apple
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:43.920]   to make, they didn't make it to provide a backdoor for the federal government or law
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:44.920]   enforcement.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   They did it for convenience.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.840]   It's a logical way.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:47.840]   You agree with that?
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:51.160]   I mean, there is a, Steve, Steve's thing was fantastic.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.520]   I, we linked to it on IMOR.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:56.000]   It was a really, really incredibly good way of explaining it to people.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.080]   Now you could, Steve had an optimistic point of view and he explained it, you know, technologically,
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.640]   he didn't choose any sides.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.400]   You can have a pessimistic point of view and choose to think that everything that is
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.760]   done, whether it's by accident or not, is ultimately malicious.
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.040]   Yeah, that's more temperament than fact, isn't it?
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.040]   Absolutely.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.400]   One of the, there's two big problems with this.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:16.000]   One is that, like you, you should never yell fire in a burning theater, but you should
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.040]   also, if there are sparks going off on a wire next to a stove, you should tell people, because
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:21.040]   it's useful information.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:23.320]   There is no fire, but you should tell people.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:28.280]   And a lot of this stuff was, again, Steve did a fantastic way explaining it.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:32.160]   The problem was mostly the media reaction, even, even Jonathan, and they would debate,
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.440]   for example, a backdoor.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.440]   He called it a backdoor.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.840]   Some people took issue with it because they believe you have to have malice of intent in
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:38.840]   order for it to be a backdoor.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:44.720]   The key to Steve's presentation, you tell me if this is wrong, is that without taking
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:50.640]   advantage of, none of this stuff happens unless you have a trusted device paired with your
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.640]   iPhone.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:56.480]   So unless you have physical access to the iPhone and a trusted device paired with it,
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   none of this matters.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:02.960]   And it seemed to Steve, and in fact, seems to me, not being a security expert, that that's,
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:08.600]   you know, that's sufficient, and you have some suggestions on iMour.com for how to make
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:13.240]   sure that the trusted devices are really trusted for you.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:17.560]   And furthermore, I think Steve did say this probably, Jonathan Zzodarski would agree,
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:24.440]   it would probably behoove Apple to add a little pop-up each time saying you're trusting
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   this device.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.440]   You're trusting this device.
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   Is that right?
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.760]   Do you want to trust this device?
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.760]   All of that makes sense.
[00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.400]   Because our very security conscious, it would be nice if Apple had an option for you to say,
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:39.360]   always ask me my passcode or always ask me the trusted device thing.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:43.320]   And it's hard to explain this stuff really, because people do get scared.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.400]   And I understand that people in the chat room saying, "How could you believe this?
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.600]   It's obvious Apple's got a backdoor.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:52.040]   How could you explain 600 million packets sniffing phones?"
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.040]   Well, see, that's fun.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.000]   I mean, that's the stuff that you pull out.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.400]   There is a developer tool that does packet sniffing that if you, all of this comes down
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   to physical access.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:03.120]   And a lot of you'll point out, if I have physical access to your phone and your computer, I
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.600]   could probably just think anything I want off of iTunes anyway.
[00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.240]   I don't need the backdoor.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:11.040]   But what security people like, Steven, other people say is that security is, there's depth
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.800]   of security and you want layers.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.440]   So even though, if I have physical access, I can get this stuff anyway.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:18.760]   It's nice if you shut down the multiple ways.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:22.120]   If these things don't absolutely need to be there, just turn them off because it's safer
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.280]   than not having them off.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:27.080]   And when you fix other areas, apparently a lot of jailbreakers exploited this and they
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:30.720]   were really upset that he presented all this information because they had a lot of stuff
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.720]   in stock.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:35.160]   But a jailbreak is the ultimate backdoor for a device.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:36.920]   You can get almost anything off of it.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:41.200]   And media seldom reports a jailbreak as catastrophically as they've been reporting this story.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:44.840]   So it really is, I think, a lack of fundamental understanding of security models and threat
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.840]   models.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:53.640]   I almost always feel like if a attack requires physical possession of the device, that that's
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:58.880]   so much less worrisome because by the time somebody has physical access to your computer,
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.200]   your phone, whatever, you're pretty much screwed at that point.
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   And sophisticated knowledge, it isn't just holding the phone.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.920]   You have to know how to steal the pairing keys.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.160]   You have to know these services exist.
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:14.360]   You have to be a pretty high value target for someone to expend the skill and resource
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.720]   to get this information off your device.
[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:20.160]   And I think the most important thing is that these back doors make a lot of these great
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:21.760]   spy movies more feasible.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:27.440]   Well, and there is no such thing as perfect security, but we're Apple to really attempt
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.640]   perfect security.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:32.680]   You wouldn't want this phone because it would be such a pain in the ass to use it that you'd
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:36.800]   go, well, God, I have to enter my-- it's not-- it doesn't pick up text messages unless
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.800]   it's unlocked.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:41.520]   I have to enter my code every single time I attach it to any device.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.120]   It just would be really annoying.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.120]   It would be painful.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:48.400]   I have a lot of sympathy for Apple and other companies that are put in this position where
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.280]   they have these tools that are there for very, very positive reasons or even because they
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   have no option.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:55.960]   They don't have the option of not putting it on.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.800]   And we're living in an environment where every single thing that can be perceived as
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:04.560]   a security risk is perceived as something of being betrayed by the maker of your device.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.280]   When again, all you did was you put something on there so that later on if a bad thing happens,
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:10.640]   it's easy to find out what happened and fix it.
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.080]   And they've done it with good intentions.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:15.280]   They've also done it the best way they possibly can.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:20.800]   But now they sort of have-- part of the PR nightmare of running a tech company is realize
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:26.960]   that you no longer have the option of simply maintaining radio silence or dismissing a
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   complaint.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:32.480]   I don't know if this were like an "antennigate" sort of thing.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.160]   Apple does not have the option of saying, oh, stop whining.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.040]   I know that the bars are going down.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.880]   But if you were so dumb, you wouldn't realize that this isn't an issue.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:46.440]   Now, not only do they have to-- can't they simply say, look, this is nothing to do with
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.440]   it.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:48.440]   There's not a backdoor.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.920]   This is not us being in cahoots with the government.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.400]   Is it something that's very, very technical that I'm sure the people who are writing about
[00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.720]   this stuff can explain to you if you pay attention to it.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.480]   Now they actually have to sort of come out and say, well, we can't go into every detail
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.000]   of why we secure-- how we secure our phones.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.440]   All we're saying is that we're going on the record as saying that we are absolutely doing
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:05.760]   this in a good faith way.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:10.000]   I would point everyone to Imor's excellent article, how to better protect your iPhone
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.440]   and iPad against back doors and other security and privacy risks.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.920]   In that article, you guys point out immediately Renee wrote it.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:22.240]   So I shouldn't say you guys, you point out immediately that everyone should have a pass
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:24.720]   code on their iPhone.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.800]   And you know, Apple said at the last event, the half of-- when I mean that's touch ID,
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.160]   half of all iPhone users do not lock their phone.
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.560]   So that's step one, right?
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.800]   Now, I think Apple could do a good job.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.800]   I don't think it would be too harmful for Apple to say every single time you wanted
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:47.160]   to pair it to your computer, give us your pass code.
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.640]   I think that would be fair.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.800]   That would ameliorate a lot of this, right?
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:55.840]   Because right now, the weakness is that once you've paired it to a computer, that computer
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.640]   is always paired and automatically syncs up.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:04.240]   Wouldn't it be so onerous to turn that on so every time you had to enter your pass code?
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:05.240]   At least it's an option.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.840]   It is an option, but you have to use this special tool and that's how-- that's one of
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.400]   the things Renee describes how to do.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.400]   Yeah, that configurate.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.720]   I mean, there's a couple of things they could do.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.960]   Like, for example, they could encrypt the diagnostic information.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.160]   They could reduce the diagnostic information to things that-- right now, it just looks
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.920]   like-- you know, and we've talked about this before, Apple is incredibly resource constrained
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.840]   and they have people doing so many things.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.880]   And sometimes it's just easier to turn something on and to go there and create an entire system
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880]   for it.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.840]   So the enterprise stuff could probably be locked on a bit better.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.200]   The diagnostic stuff could probably be locked on a bit better.
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   You could have additional options.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:39.760]   You never want to make it too complicated because then people look at it, they go, "Ah!"
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.120]   and they don't do anything.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:44.720]   But there are a couple-- and to his credit, Jonathan points out a couple of these steps
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.720]   too.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.920]   I think there's some that we don't want, but things like, yeah.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.880]   Or even if you don't want the pass code, have that trusted button put up and you just
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.600]   press yes if you want to trust the device.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.400]   There's a lot of steps they could take, but you can do things now.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.040]   You could make your iPhone pretty secure right now if you want to go through the trouble.
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:04.640]   If you want a 20-digit password instead of a pass code on your iPhone, Apple lets you
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   do that.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.240]   Yeah, and in fact, you might want to do that.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.200]   But you'd also make a lot of time to be--
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.800]   It's incredibly painful for a much more iPhone.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.280]   This is a very good article.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.880]   Recommended to people who-- so there are ways to make your iPhone much, much more secure.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:24.800]   I guess you kind of nailed it when you said it's people's-- it's your temperament.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:29.280]   If you're-- somebody in the chat room said, "Well, does the file of all have a backdoor
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.720]   for the federal government or not?"
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.720]   Of course it does.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.440]   Well, there's no evidence that it does.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:38.560]   If your temperament, your belief system is that of course it does, then that's your belief
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.560]   system.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:44.920]   But if you're going to operate purely on fact, we just don't know.
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.920]   We just don't know.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.120]   And Steve said it so well a couple of years ago when he said it's two expenses make perfect
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.320]   code, even NASA can't make perfect code anymore.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.320]   And humans make mistakes.
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.120]   You have a month to get this out.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.720]   You need this diagnostic running.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:56.720]   You turn this on.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.720]   No one's going to see it.
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.260]   You'd have to-- all the things people have to do to break in and see this, it's almost
[01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:02.600]   inconceivable to you.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.240]   But people break in, so does file fault have any flaws?
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.560]   Not that we've found, but we didn't find open SSL.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:10.760]   We didn't find hard-
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.000]   You can't prove the negative is the problem.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.120]   You can't prove it has no flaws.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:17.440]   You could say we don't-- we haven't found any.
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.200]   But that's not the proof it doesn't have any.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.680]   And all software has flaws, so--
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.680]   Well, and not to let anybody--
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.680]   I think Apple's done it.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:26.880]   Frankly, I think Apple's-- you know, I go back and forth obviously when we first saw
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:30.480]   this Shudarski presentation, I was a little concerned.
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.200]   I think the questions that Jonathan had for Apple, which Apple wasn't really responding
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:39.520]   to in any way, but some sort of PR speak, I think those are legitimate questions.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.360]   But my temperament is I feel fairly trusting of Apple.
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:47.240]   I don't see any reason to think that Apple is intentionally putting back doors in for
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:48.240]   law enforcement.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.160]   And I think that I think this is not that they shouldn't keep on working on it and that
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.880]   we shouldn't always be concerned.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:53.880]   But I mean, I am--
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.880]   Yeah, of course them to get better, of course.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.360]   When I send emails, when I post them on Twitter or Internet or-- and one of the reasons
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.600]   I don't use path anymore is mostly I didn't even want to think about posting anything
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   on the Internet that I'm--
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.600]   Right.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.880]   --that I don't want-- I don't go to sites that I don't think I should go to.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:11.520]   I don't go to-- you know, like all of that is stuff that I just assume is being watched
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.520]   by someone.
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:13.520]   They may not do anything with it.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.520]   But that's--
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.360]   But everybody has to be responsible for their own choices in this regard.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.360]   Yes.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.920]   What I'm saying is that we need to keep on doing all this.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   We need to keep on making it more secure, but you need to understand that when you're
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.600]   on a-- the entire Internet is an unsecure network.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.600]   Right.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.920]   And then you're going to websites, and when you're doing other things, you should consider
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.200]   that a-- you know, you're doing it out in the open, essentially.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.560]   And the minds will be doing it on a street corner.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:37.440]   So just keep that in mind when--
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.440]   There's two--
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:43.160]   This is-- this is why when people complain about the old chestnut that, "Oh, well, you
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:47.800]   know, Google's business model is all about selling your personal information to people,
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.800]   and that's not actually true."
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:54.720]   But the-- it's-- if people are really forceful about that, I say, "Wow, I'm so glad you
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.400]   care about, you know, what this company is doing privately with your data."
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.560]   It must be really hard to never use the web at all or never use phone apps.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.480]   No, I use both those things.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.840]   Oh, so then you're kind of screwing yourself because they're 80 million times more leaky
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.080]   than what's been shown that Google does with their data.
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.080]   But OK, fine.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.920]   Can-- can-- can-- can-- can continue to use your Kim Kardashian fan app that-- what's
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.720]   up-- for some reason, what's your device ID and wants your-- wants access to your contacts?
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.720]   Go ahead.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.720]   There were--
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.200]   There were two things that Steve said also that were great.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.600]   One is that the-- part of the problem with a lot of the articles is that they used very
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:29.120]   provocative of that language, like undocumented iOS features.
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:31.680]   And it's important to remember, all of iOS is undocumented.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.600]   It is not an open source.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:37.840]   So parts of it, like WebKit are, and the mock kernel is, but iOS is not open source.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:42.960]   It is not documented unless and until Apple makes a public version of part of it.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:46.280]   And the other thing is because it's not documented, you need people like Jonathan pounding away
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.280]   at it because that's how we find these faults.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:52.920]   So as much as I dislike the reporting surrounding it, I hope people like him and him specifically
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.720]   keep doing this because that's how all of us get better, including Apple.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   Good.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:06:01.000]   And we want to get better here at Mac Brick Weekly reporting this stuff in a responsible,
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   reliable way.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.600]   And, you know, we can always get better at it, too.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.720]   And that's-- I think we always are working towards that because I don't want to be-- the
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.440]   last thing I want anything I do is be a sensationalistic or clickbait.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.440]   We're trying--
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.440]   My mom can be scared.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.280]   We're trying to get at the truth of it.
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.880]   And it's not always easy.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:24.240]   And opinions and temperament can change how you-- slide it, how you feel about it.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:26.720]   But we're trying to get the truth to the fact of it.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.720]   Let's look also.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.720]   We have a responsibility, too.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:32.960]   I mean, I can't speak for other people, but there are times when I get the phone call
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:36.640]   and say, hey, can you be on this radio show with this time to talk about this?
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.680]   And I make it really clear to the producer that, okay, this is a non-story.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.640]   So Slonzi, you're okay with me speaking for three and a half minutes about why nobody
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.560]   should be worried at all about this.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:50.360]   And I'm perfectly fine to not be on radio when I'm on TV after that.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.840]   Actually, some of them do.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.200]   I mean, there are a couple of Chicago radio stations that I work with and that they really
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.480]   do like to have that conversation.
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:59.440]   But there are times when you have simply have to say, I'm here to tell you not to do this
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.600]   story because it's just of no use whatsoever.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:10.560]   Nobody will ever top Jeff Jarvis who told the BBC on the air that they were full of it.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:14.640]   And to their credit, they keep having him back.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:21.320]   Let's see real quickly before we go to our picks of the week stories that we haven't
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.320]   mentioned.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:27.520]   The Senate and the House have now voted that it's once again legal to unlock your phone.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.240]   It was legal.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:35.360]   And then the exception lapsed and the DMCA took back over, made it illegal to unlock your
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.360]   phone.
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:39.640]   As soon as President Obama signs that law and he says he will.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:43.840]   Once again, it will be legal to unlock your phone.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:50.160]   It's not jailbreak, which I believe is still legal to jailbreak your phone.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.320]   Unlocking it means saying buying a phone to say from AT&T and then unlocking it so that
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.880]   you can use it on another carrier.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:02.600]   Once your contract is up, the proposed law says that once your contract is up, you own
[01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:05.640]   the phone until then you're sort of partly owning it.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.360]   As it should be, of course.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:12.280]   I'm really excited to see these unlocking apps, unlocking services, stop being this weird
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.680]   thing that you get off of eBay and be this sort of thing where go the Verizon store and
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.800]   they will sell that as a side option for it.
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.040]   Either the carrier will do it for free or there will be reputable stores that will say
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.080]   bring in your phone for $15 we will carry or unlock it.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:30.080]   Or even how some banks will actually roll your coins for you.
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:34.360]   They'll have a coin sort of machine to get you into the bank to hopefully have the sign
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.360]   up for their services.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.680]   It'd be great if like AT&T and Verizon and T-Mobile, they all had, look, for free we will
[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:44.320]   unlock any one of these 40 models of phones and with no obligation but if you then decide
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:49.160]   you want to use one by one of our data plans, we will also give you a sign up fee for this
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.880]   that a lot of really great opportunities are presented but now that this is unambiguously
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.880]   legal.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   AT&T has done this for some time.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:58.600]   If you've had the phone for six months, even if you're not out of contract, if you're
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.040]   up in good standing, they'll unlock it for you.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040]   And that's great.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.040]   And our logic has said it for me.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.040]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.040]   It's a US thing and most of Europe, this is the law.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.960]   You can't lock a phone.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.600]   It's only here that this is law has changed a little bit.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600]   Let's see.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:18.280]   You'll be able to check into the Hilton soon with your iPhone.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.840]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.840]   I mean, I mean, get into your room, I should say.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840]   Not just check in.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.840]   Harris is so thrilled.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840]   I get my wallet.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.600]   I'm always like, why is my wallet getting so fat?
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.320]   And then I realized there's a whole bunch of hotel keys.
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:33.320]   Hilton guests will be able to select the rooms online using their smartphones.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.600]   They'll be able to see the floor plan for each available room.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:36.600]   I like that.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:38.760]   Stay away from the elevator.
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.040]   Guests will be able to check in and out using their smartphones, purchase upgrades, mess
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.080]   special items, and unlock the room itself.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:49.480]   By the end of this year's smartphone based check in and room selection will be available
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.560]   for 650,000 rooms across 4,000 Hilton hotels.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.440]   And the technology that allows smartphones to be used as room keys will begin rolling
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.640]   out next year when you want to think about the efficiencies that's going to give Hilton.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:05.120]   It means that that whole line at the beginning of when you walk in at three o'clock and the
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.120]   beginning is gone.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.520]   I mean, you literally just go to your room with your key.
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.000]   Apparently, Starwood is also testing something similar.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.320]   Once one does it, everybody will do it.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.680]   But is this what customers really want?
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.240]   It sounds great.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.120]   The people who use who are most valuable to these hotel chains are the ones who want
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:30.280]   the "I don't have to worry about lines because I'm a Starwood double diamond black plus
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.280]   card holder.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.600]   I go to this person so one meets me at the revolving door and walks me right to my
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.600]   priest.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:42.600]   The best room that's available in the entire hotel because I got the substitute Italian
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:44.240]   or Yiddish word meaning that I've got bigs.
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240]   I've got big big.
[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   I'm a cloud.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.240]   I've got cloud.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:48.240]   Oh, sorry.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.240]   No need to get, you know, get, you know, burn a collage.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:53.600]   I'm going to tell you, I'm a Hertz gold member.
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.360]   And the fact that you get off the bus, you don't have to get in line.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.560]   You just go to the car, you get in the car, you drive off the lot.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:02.320]   And when you're done, you drive it back in the lot and you walk away and you never talk
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.320]   to a human is huge.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.320]   But the other one is charged.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.320]   The same thing with Ava's.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.320]   Oh, what a.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.320]   Same.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:09.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.680]   So obviously there's some value to that at a hotel.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.240]   My issue is that, like, for instance, I'm a hotels.com guy.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.240]   So I don't know.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.800]   I don't have a sizable membership with anyone except hotels.com, which we have, you know,
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.840]   running, you know, lots and lots of rooms all the time.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:25.240]   And so for me, I don't really belong to anything enough to do it, but the thing, I don't need
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:28.880]   to talk to anyone, especially when there's, you know, someone, you know, there's like four
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.680]   people in front of me that don't go to hotels very often.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.680]   We're geeks.
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:32.680]   I just want to talk to human.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:33.680]   I just really just want to walk in.
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.680]   I don't want someone to take my bag.
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.960]   I don't want them to talk to me when I get out of the.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.320]   I just want to be able to walk in and go up to my room and check in the Apple campus
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:42.160]   looking good.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:45.960]   It's starting to emerge from the ground in a muddy ring.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:47.360]   Here it is.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.400]   Looks like the aliens have landed in the paracles.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:57.320]   They've just got a permit for a new $25 million tunnel that leads, I guess, to the underground
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:04.760]   parking garage and a $171 million underground theater, which I will never be invited to see.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.160]   But I guess that's the poll point of that is that and we knew this.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.520]   This was in the original plan that Apple events will now be held on campus.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:13.960]   For about the go cart ring, Leo, is there a hundred fifty million dollars?
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.960]   I've seen it one day of autocross.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:20.760]   There must be employees who are saying, look, just give us one day we can bring whatever
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:25.320]   vehicle we want and just do panic laps around that thing and film it all with your eyes.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.320]   It's like they've been doing it to be.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.760]   It's a very hard for me.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.760]   So I can't.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:31.960]   I look forward to that.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.640]   I hope by then they will have taken me off of double secret probation and I'll be able
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.120]   to actually get a tour of the campus.
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.120]   I'm looking forward to that.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.360]   You know, they've got those baskets of fruit that are shaped like floral bouquets, Leo.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:44.640]   Maybe you just sent one of those to Tim.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.120]   Tim, I love you.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.880]   He just wants that one tangible act of contrition.
[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.880]   Maybe that's it.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880]   I have just, you know what?
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.920]   I think that's probably I have just never apologized.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:55.920]   That might have been it.
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.120]   I should just call them a little letter.
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.120]   I'll put some flowers on Steve's grave and apologize.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:06.080]   All right, time for our picks of the week boy and boy and girl.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.240]   No girls boys and boys.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.360]   Let's start with you, Andy and not co.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.920]   My pick this week is really, really simple.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.200]   We're talking earlier about how as people who travel a lot, our ears really perk up when
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:22.400]   we see something that allows us to replace something big and bulky with something that
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.800]   is a lot smaller that does the same job.
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:29.480]   So I have the problem where I have to make sure that I have pretty much separate copies
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:32.600]   of everything that I use technologically.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:38.480]   And a set of this is in that bag because I'm always just if I can't look around the office
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:42.760]   and look for a USB cable and put that in the bag when I'm packing for a trip.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:48.720]   But that that also said, I am the first person who when I'm in the office and oh God, I can't
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.720]   find a lightning cable.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:50.880]   Well, I know this one in my laptop bag.
[01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.680]   I'll just go get it and then I'll make sure I remember that when I'm done with it at the
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:57.360]   desk, I'll put it right back in that laptop bag because that's where this cable belongs.
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:58.840]   I don't bother to do it.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.840]   And then fast forward to two weeks later when I really need the lightning cable to charge
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.840]   something that's not there.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:04.880]   So that's why I was really happy to find this.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.120]   It's made by Skiva.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:10.200]   This is the two in one lightning and micro USB charge and sync cable.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.360]   This is cause all of my love is I have one.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:19.600]   Yeah, it is a Apple certified Apple certified lightning connector that is tethered to a standard
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.600]   micro USB.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:21.600]   Oh my God.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:22.600]   Should be like this.
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.600]   This is the key to the operation because the power is loose.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:25.600]   The little adaptor.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.280]   I have I've swallowed the adapter.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.320]   I think when I when I talk about this on Twitter, someone said, Oh, big deal, you can get when
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.320]   these little adapters.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:33.320]   Yes, you can.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.320]   And then you lose it.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.080]   And it's not there when you need it.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.600]   And so this way you have all of you have the one cable that will do both of the things
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:40.600]   that you need.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.400]   Also, this is enough of a for me.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:47.600]   This is enough of a freak sort of item that I'm not I can program my brain to say that
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.200]   I can't even I'm not even allowed to use this inside the office.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.080]   This is only something that has to be used when I'm outside the office.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.240]   It only belongs in the bag.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.960]   But even even beyond that, just as I have now have one cable and this is the one thing
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.160]   that does the two that charges the two things I need to charge when I'm outside the office,
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.960]   this is the three foot version, but they also make I think a half foot.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:10.200]   Yeah, just about five or the half foots.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.480]   If you want to be even smaller, it's it's it's really great.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.920]   I like these simple solutions to deficiencies that you might have in your personal wetware
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:19.920]   operating system.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.640]   This is a good patch for problems that I have up here with cables.
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.960]   You know, I bought the the little short one because I just found and I love this.
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.080]   I wonder if it's on my am I have a whole slew of these little six inch ones little
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:31.640]   little ones are great.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:32.960]   I keep them in the top a little.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   Yeah, this is what I bought.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:38.120]   It's from Inetec, which I think is the same name in the company in office space.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:43.760]   But this thing is a USB charger that has five ports.
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:48.360]   Two of them are 11 watts.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:52.680]   So you have the two super ports for your iPad and then three and see if I have five of those
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:57.440]   little cables plugged in there, then any of those ports could charge anything I have.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.440]   Yes.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:15:59.440]   Awesome.
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:05.160]   I think I think I think it was an Alex pick and the Envick was is that the call it?
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:09.400]   The Envick similar like that where it's five ports and they're and they're thank anchor
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.960]   and was so good that I bought a second one, one which stays inside my my my travel case
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.960]   and the other one is actually clamped to my to my desk.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:20.600]   It's exactly as you say, I actually found one that's having to say that, well, look, if
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:25.680]   these Amazon basics, USB cables are only four dollars, I'm just going to buy five of those.
[01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:28.040]   I'm going to zip tie them together.
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:30.960]   And so I don't have the ability and keep them all plugged into this thing.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.960]   So anytime I need to plug something into my desk, there is a cable attached and ready
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:38.680]   to go because again, that those cables are going to walk if they have a ability to walk.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.000]   So I'm such a big fan of finding something inexpensive that works and just buying duplicates
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.160]   of them to make sure that you never have to look for someone because something because
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.120]   no matter where you are, no matter where you need to use it, it is already there in that
[01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.560]   place because you have four or five copies of it.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:56.680]   I just feel like I want to I want everything anchor makes.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.680]   Yes.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.360]   Yeah, that's I just that's good.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:04.920]   I guess Alex, that's one of the most satisfying things I own that it's it's it's small.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.920]   It works beautiful.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.560]   The first the first time I traveled with it and I'm plugging in well kale because of because
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.360]   of testing and also because of stupid things I was doing.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.800]   I had three laptops, excuse me, I had three tablets plugged into it, including like an
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:23.480]   iPad three and I had a phone and like a big like battery charger plugged into it.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:29.240]   And the first time I woke up and saw 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% all right.
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.240]   Right.
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:33.000]   Yeah, right to Amazon.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.800]   I just like one of those.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:39.920]   I never I never want to have to travel without this thing because because I'm so I'm so I'm
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.680]   the number of times when I've traveled with three times too many three three more USB
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:48.160]   chargers that I need only because I'm packing packing packing.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:50.480]   I can't remember how many I put in there and I see another one.
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.760]   So I may just put another one in this bag just in case I'm I'm lose one.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.120]   And then I've got like seven in there.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.120]   Nope problem solved.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.080]   You have this it stays inside the bag.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.040]   It's always this problem is solved for the remainder of my life needing to charge things
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:05.840]   until Apple changes its cabling and then your screw.
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:10.400]   We fix the problem of USB charging.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:12.440]   How long is the lightning cable going to be good for?
[01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.240]   Because I am now reaching the point where I have all the lightning cables.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.560]   I just wish they'd license it out.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.280]   I don't know if they're willing to do the thing is that the one thing after you use a
[01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:22.800]   lightning and a micro USB you really get that the lightning is a lot better than the micro
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:25.920]   USB and you're like, Oh, I got to figure out which side I'm so easy to put in.
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.760]   Delicate and you know the lightning mold is just you just drop it in and you combine
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.760]   it with this thing.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.240]   This is my this is this little monster monster power thing.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:40.080]   It's like I have this in my bag and and it's you just pull it out and it's for it.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.200]   It has USB to that combined with.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.200]   Wow.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.760]   Let's do go.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:48.120]   They make it there's someone else makes one that does international plugs.
[01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:49.120]   But that one's pretty cool.
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:52.440]   That's the problem is this is not another one has international voltage.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:55.800]   Oh, this will do what will do voltage.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:19:00.880]   I had one that didn't and I and actually knocked out the power in two hotels in a cruise ship.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   It's really cool because it's four.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880]   I figured it out.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.880]   It's fire.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.240]   I suddenly realized, Oh, that's why I keep short circuiting.
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.240]   Have an international one.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.720]   This one's kind of embarrassing.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.720]   We're in Venice.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:13.320]   I have to call down this hotel is built out of a 14th century monastery, not the best
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.320]   electricity.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.320]   Right.
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.160]   And I plug the thing and it goes in the whole room is dark and I see you.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.800]   You know, I have noticed though that like we are we are all like imagine like a woodstock
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.800]   sort of experience for all kinds of bands together.
[01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.520]   We're in the green room and all we want to talk about are different drugs.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:32.520]   We found, oh, you got it.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:35.080]   It's a technically it's a horse tranquilizer and you bite you break it in half.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:38.120]   But oh my God, the height people who is probably on technology.
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.120]   Oh my God.
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:42.040]   If you're using that kind of travel charger, let me rock your world.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.040]   It's made by this company.
[01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:44.040]   Five words.
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:46.440]   It's three laptops at the same time.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:48.800]   So pathetic.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:50.320]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, you're pick of the week.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.720]   I have a pick and a tip and a tip and a tip and a pick.
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:56.320]   So my tip, I'll do my tip first.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.800]   So I'm in a lot of conference calls.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.840]   Maybe not a lot of our listeners are in a lot of conference calls, but I'm in like four
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:02.560]   or five a day minimum.
[01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:06.280]   I was on four before I got into this show.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.160]   And here's the problem with conference calls.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.160]   Two numbers.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.760]   You have to dial in a number.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:11.760]   Hate that.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.760]   And you need that stupid code.
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:15.000]   You know, and no matter what you do, everybody's got a stupid code.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.280]   Well, so I was using tempo and I realized that tempo was doing something and I figured
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:21.480]   out that it wasn't just anybody could do it.
[01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.800]   I'm tempo is great, but what's tempo?
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.960]   Tempo is this other calendar app.
[01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:26.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.200]   So the tip you sunrise not tempo.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.200]   Right.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.200]   So but here's the tip.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.200]   Yes.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:36.840]   I've now started to institute this in the company is that if you have the phone number, so 800
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:41.040]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, for like go to meeting and then you do a space and then
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:46.400]   a semicolon and then the code space, semicolon and then whatever that code is, the six digit
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:50.200]   or nine digit number and then a pound sign at the end.
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:55.960]   If you dial that number, it will you'll see a little thing at the bottom that has it has
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:59.680]   a there's a number hidden on your iPhone now down below.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.760]   And when it asks for the code, you hit that and just dials it up.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:06.400]   Because of the space semicolon space, semicolon.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.880]   Here's a so it's a high phone.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.240]   I don't know if it's an iPhone or Android, but I know it works on my iPhone because I'm
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.240]   using it all the time.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.640]   And so so I require now everybody in the company.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:19.160]   If you want me to join a a a phone thing, just send it the invitation with space and
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:24.320]   I sit there and select copy it, paste it into my phone, hit go and it and it will it
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.120]   will dial the number and then wait and then I go wait and I hit the button again and it
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:32.240]   will dial my code, which you know, if you're, comma is pause, right?
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.240]   What is comma?
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.240]   Comma.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.240]   You don't need to comma.
[01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:36.240]   You could do comma comma comma comma comma comma comma comma comma comma comma comma comma.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.240]   You could do that.
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.680]   But the problem with that is that Amelia, the semicolon.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:41.200]   That's funny.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:46.320]   So the semicolon tells you to wait until I hit it puts it into another button on the
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:47.320]   iPhone.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.680]   So it's not just taking a long space.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.760]   So there's this magic hidden button.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.440]   There's a magic hidden button that appears if you use the semicolon because you don't
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:55.360]   know how many commas have how long to pause.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:59.280]   Let's just wait this way you wait till the operator says now, please enter your five
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.280]   digit.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.760]   And then you hit that button and it'll just dial dial it in and the key is put pound at
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:04.360]   the end so it doesn't wait too long and everything else.
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.000]   But anyway, so so anyway, that's my that's my tip now that you know, we know where that
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.240]   comes from where.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.680]   He's robotic styling commands.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.480]   Is it it's an eight part of the AT command set?
[01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:17.480]   I believe on the semicolon.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:23.160]   I remember I remember in red rider having to nine comma comma comma comma.
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.360]   Yeah, six one seven.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.360]   Yeah, I remember that.
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:28.160]   You wait till the customer comes.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.160]   It could be something very standard.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:36.560]   So anyway, so my my pick of the week is my my friends and my brother are making a movie.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.400]   They're making a movie and they finished shooting it already.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.280]   So it's not like it's not one of the things that they said, Oh, we're going to make a
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.240]   movie and you could try to help us.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.480]   They've already shot the whole movie.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:45.480]   I like the name.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:46.480]   Volka.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:50.880]   And it's there's a there's the cool video that they until my brother was the DP for this.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.800]   So all the images that you see here, my brother's about to make become much more famous than
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.800]   I am, I think.
[01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.800]   And what's the premise?
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.800]   I'm not for the famous film.
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:58.800]   It's easy to pass.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:22:59.800]   What?
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.720]   So the this is these these guys suddenly wake up and there's nobody else.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.720]   There's nobody there.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:06.720]   Anyone anywhere.
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:07.720]   I'm Jeffrey Orton.
[01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:08.720]   So that's Jeff used to work work for me.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:09.720]   I used to work with Andy.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.720]   I recognize Jeff.
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:11.720]   Yeah, both.
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:14.320]   And so these guys put put this together.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:18.200]   And I think almost everybody worked on the film as we worked with at some point in time,
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:19.960]   but my brother did all the.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:20.960]   I love this premise.
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.880]   Yeah, I always I wish this would happen.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:26.520]   Like you wake up and you could ride your bicycle on the highway and stuff because there's
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:27.520]   nobody left.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520]   Right.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.520]   Just you and a beautiful girl.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.520]   Exactly.
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.520]   Exactly.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.520]   We are legit.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:36.640]   We've got to reproduce now to recreate the entire world.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:39.880]   I wouldn't sleep with you if you're the last man on earth, but I am.
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:44.120]   You've always been waiting to stay there.
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.120]   So, but look, I can steal any car.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:51.320]   I just want to ride my bike on the interstate.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.640]   Just hope that you don't that you don't break your glasses sitting at the library.
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.840]   That's tonight geeky out there.
[01:23:56.840 --> 01:23:58.840]   Twilight Zone action.
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:03.400]   So but the but the anyway, so they shot this in Iceland.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.400]   And so I was getting all these pictures of Iceland of them shooting and stuff like that.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.400]   My brother did all study.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.080]   He has to be the last man on earth.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.960]   He's very well dressed for the last man on earth.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.600]   I would stop wearing neckties and pocket squares if I were the last man on earth.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.600]   That's true.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.600]   That's true.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.600]   Exactly.
[01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:19.600]   Exactly.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.600]   Lots of study can work.
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.600]   I think it's like tons of it.
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.760]   But this is a full length feature film.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:25.760]   Full length feature film.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:31.400]   And what they're doing, they're doing a kickstarter to do the post production for it.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.520]   So they've already done all the shooting and they're just doing a little kickstarter project.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:36.120]   So people should check that out.
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:40.360]   We're going to do a hangout in a couple weeks with them to have them kind of talk through
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:45.360]   the process of how it got made and and do some behind the scenes and talk to the talk
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360]   to the crew.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:47.360]   So stay tuned for that.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.840]   But you should jump in.
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:53.480]   It looks like a really cool movie.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.480]   And I think.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.440]   Yeah, they both get the OKEH.
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.440]   It's a kickstarter.
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:01.040]   Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.800]   My pick of the week is Revolution 60.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:07.320]   It debuted last week on the iOS app stores for iPhone and iPad.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:11.960]   And it is a game using the Epic Unreal engine.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:16.080]   And one of the inequalities game is sadly that it's inequalities that it was made by
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:18.440]   an entirely female gaming studio.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:20.480]   And it's got an entirely female cast.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.640]   It's really delightfully animated.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:25.560]   It's not a typical fake joy pad sort of a game.
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:29.400]   They've done a it's more like a movie almost like a choose your own adventure where you
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:32.920]   play the game and you get to do actions that have increasing complexity.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:36.160]   And you can choose whether you respond sarcastically or professionally and that's sort of like
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:38.200]   choose your own destiny sort of thing.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.160]   So you can choose to become a jerk in this game, which is a choice I've been making and
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:43.360]   I'm waiting to find consequences of that.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.280]   For you can choose a game they still have Barbie figures.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.280]   So there's a couple reasons for that.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.720]   I mean, I actually interviewed the women who did a Amanda Warner and Brianna Wu.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:55.880]   That was a male thing that like part of it is that it's this design aesthetic they grew
[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:56.880]   up of.
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:57.880]   They love to.
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.160]   I just call Campbell for examples are a lot of the early Marvel and anime stuff.
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.960]   But also because they're still limited with the amount of bones they can put in skeletons,
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.280]   they put most of them into the hair.
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:08.360]   So they couldn't animate any clothing.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:09.360]   The hair is elaborate.
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:14.000]   The hair has got most of the animation and all the bones are in the hair.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.280]   And that meant that they had to be early static bodies.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.880]   So they're not really wearing anything of animated worth.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.880]   Okay.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.880]   Hey, that looks like fun.
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:23.320]   So it's kind of puzzle plus adventure.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:24.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.760]   So you and it's got a great storyline.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.400]   The voice acting is incredible.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:28.840]   The music is fantastic.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:31.480]   As you can see from here, the graphics are great.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.600]   The story is excellent.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:37.040]   If you're like a fan of like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Black Widow or alias or Dark Angel
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.600]   or anything, you'll fit right in here.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.600]   Lucy.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.600]   Yes.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.600]   Or Lucy.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:42.600]   Absolutely.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:43.600]   What's it called again?
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.600]   It's called Revolution 60.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.600]   Revolution 60.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.600]   And it's iOS.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:48.600]   iPhone and iPad.
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.600]   iPhone and iPad.
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:50.600]   Cool.
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:51.600]   I don't know.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:54.360]   I don't like to mention Kickstarter stuff and I don't know if I'm going to make this a pick
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   or not.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.520]   But when I get it, maybe I will because I did order it and I hope I get it.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.520]   This is a it's called the Unity stand.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:07.520]   It's for people who are all Apple all the time and integrated dock and charging system
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:13.640]   that you can charge your iPhone, your iPad, put it underneath your cinema display and
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.760]   it all goes together in some beautiful form.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:17.760]   Ooh.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.760]   Oh.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:19.760]   Hard Trekian.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:21.760]   Start Trekian.
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:22.760]   I did sign up.
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.760]   We'll see if I get it.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.480]   I think it's yeah.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:29.800]   I think this is the one I got 159 bucks for the full set.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:34.320]   You can get just the one thing but I got all of them like that.
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:36.160]   I think it's kind of cool.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:37.880]   Anyway, just thought I'd mention it.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.880]   It's not really a pick because I haven't got it yet and you know me and Kickstarter.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.040]   I'm really good at picking Kickstarter projects and don't ever go anywhere.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:46.040]   So maybe it's-
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:47.040]   They should pay you not to pick them.
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.800]   They should pay me not to.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:54.080]   You know that robot that you see everybody show in the video that follows you ran and
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.080]   looks at you?
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.080]   I bought it.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.080]   Really?
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:01.120]   Hey, did you get that movie from the guy who wouldn't leave his leave the apartment
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.120]   in Palm Springs.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.120]   There wasn't that game.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:04.120]   What about the starter?
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:05.120]   Like it was a type thing.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.120]   You know, salad Leo.
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:07.120]   Did you back the potato salad?
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.120]   Stop the insanity.
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:12.000]   Somebody just time me up and take away my credit cards.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.560]   No, it's, you know, there are people who had to be the first to buy the Mac.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.720]   They were often, they had conversations much like this one.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.560]   Here's to the crazy ones.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.440]   You need an as seen on TV sticker for as seen.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.760]   People who spend money on Kickstarter.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.240]   Oh well.
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.400]   Twilight Zone season three.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:33.160]   I mean, three and forty five's episode one.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:39.480]   September 15, 1961, two survivors of an apocalyptic battle, a man and a woman each from opposing
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:45.280]   sides approach each other suspiciously, starring Elizabeth Montgomery who went on to play
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:48.520]   bewitched and Charles Bronson.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.440]   See, that's the guy you say.
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.280]   I would sleep with you if you were the lat.
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.920]   Well, you are ask yourself a question.
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.360]   That's a bad thing to say to Charles Bronson because then he will kill everybody.
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.000]   And then he is the last man on earth.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for my way.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.120]   No, I'm going to stop with the Kickstarter.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.120]   No more Kickstarter.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:11.560]   Here's a great Kickstarter project.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.360]   You'll lose all your money on.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.440]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:21.720]   We do Mac break weekly at 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern time 1800 UTC every Tuesday

[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040]   Hi, everybody.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.640]   Oh, look, we got a new camera.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:35.640]   Where do we get that?
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:36.640]   Chad, that's nice.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.640]   The audience can.
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:40.240]   We stole it from the technical director shot.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.240]   You know what?
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.240]   I don't like this shot.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.240]   You know why?
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.800]   You don't have more empty chairs than I see here.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:48.920]   Well, yeah, we're not getting the front rows and the side rows.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.560]   So there's even more people than they're.
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.120]   This is the largest Mac break audience we've had in some time.
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:54.120]   So thank you all from being here.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:55.120]   We appreciate it.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.120]   Awesome.
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:58.760]   Usually we get the size audience only once a year after Mac.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.320]   I don't know what happy to be seen.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.320]   The moon is in this.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.320]   And they're not interconnected.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.800]   They're all just a whole bunch of tiny groups.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.800]   They don't know each other.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.800]   Yeah, they don't know each other.
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:08.800]   They didn't plan it.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:09.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:11.360]   Thanks for big here.
