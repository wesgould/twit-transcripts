[00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.680]   We'll take one last look at the Apple Spaceship Campus
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.240]   before all the drones are banned.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.560]   We'll talk about AR kit and how you might be able to use
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.920]   an Oculus Rift with your Mac and Tash.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:18.760]   It's all ahead.

[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.840]   Time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.600]   we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.760]   And we got the whole team, the whole gang together
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.600]   from imore.com.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.240]   In the show, E-me-the-more-al.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.400]   You look like it's humid there.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.800]   You look like you just came out of the shower.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.240]   Renee Ritchie from imore.com.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.880]   Irenay.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.720]   I think it seldom noted that Montreal
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.240]   gets as hot in the summer as it gets cold in winter.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120]   So we go from minus 40 to plus 40.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.400]   I don't know what the math is for that.
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.960]   But it's 100% humidity because it's an island.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.000]   So now I have humid hair or cloud hair.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I don't know.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.240]   That's cute.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.040]   My fingers are barely touch-ideable anymore.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.880]   And the Inacos Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.880]   Renee, at what day during the year,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.600]   can you finally get the frozen bodies out of the bus
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.360]   hoardings?
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.640]   Is that like traditional things?
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.840]   The equinox.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.720]   And then they melt.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.560]   You've got one day a year window.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.800]   By the way, congratulations on the sale of the Chicago Sun
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.120]   times.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.240]   I hope you got a big chunk of change for that.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.080]   I hope so too.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.480]   I don't know if that will change things or not.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.040]   But hey, at least it's still around.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.280]   I'm just-- the amount of office supplies
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.160]   that I've stolen during my visits there
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.720]   mean that I do own a part of the business, I think.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.520]   So I think that if there's a sale,
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.640]   I'm at least 30, 40 grand.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.400]   You own a piece of the rock, as they say.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.680]   I mean, I'm talking about whole boxes of pens.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.200]   I'm not talking about-- ooh, can I borrow that pen?
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.560]   I'm talking about a door is open.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.520]   It's a supply closet.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.560]   I got a backpack.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.160]   Also with this from his lair--
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   is this the new lair or the old lair?
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.160]   Oh, this is the old one.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.280]   It's still in the old lair.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.040]   It's still in the old lair, Alex Lindsay of the Pixel Core,
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.080]   who looks like this.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.800]   Got a little sun.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.520]   Looks like a little sunburn there.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.760]   Yeah, I'm peeling.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.040]   You know what the worst part was?
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.120]   Is that I burned it on Saturday, and I told my wife,
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.760]   I said the biggest problem with this
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.360]   is that on Mac break, I'm going to be peeling.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.160]   Like I just know the--
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.360]   It's still your part of bread.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.840]   --of bread.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.840]   It's part of bread.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   I heard on Sunday.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   It's going to be red on Monday.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.120]   I'm peeling on Tuesday morning, and Leo's going to talk about
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.800]   the fact that I burnt my forehead again.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.000]   Oh, you did it again.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.600]   I went to-- yeah, Stinson Beach is like the worst place
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.480]   in the world to go on Saturday.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.480]   Oh, on Saturday.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.440]   I love Stinson.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.000]   On a Saturday.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.200]   Oh, no.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.960]   On a Wednesday, it's awesome.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.440]   On a Saturday night so much.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.360]   Basically, everyone's piled on top of each other.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.280]   And I should have taken a picture.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.640]   I meant to say, this is what it looks like when everyone goes,
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.200]   oh my gosh, there's too many people on the beach,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.520]   but I spent four hours driving three miles to get here,
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.600]   so I'm going to--
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.480]   They actually closed Stinson on warm days,
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.560]   warm weekends in the summertime, because there's so many people
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   that they'll actually say, you can't go there now.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.480]   Oh, sure.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.240]   I think they tried.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.800]   And we just kept on--
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.240]   Plus, you're the governor.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.240]   My wife is very hard to--
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.800]   Did you see Chris Christie while you were there?
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   I did.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.160]   Yeah, that's like--
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.280]   There was a special area that was all empty,
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.680]   and that was where Chris Christie--
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.520]   We have--
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.520]   Are we experiencing a new renaissance
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.080]   of idiot bad politicians?
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.520]   I grew up in an area where they're all very, very smart
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.240]   and very, very clever, and they covered up their tracks so well
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.800]   that it took years to figure out what they were up to.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.840]   And now it's just--
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.680]   I think the press got better.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.000]   I think the press got better at CNN.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.440]   I don't think you were--
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.960]   I don't know.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.320]   I think back to John Daly in Chicago.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.320]   Very good.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.080]   My favorite from Rhode Island, the great buddy C.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.200]   Nancy, mother of Providence.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.480]   We started this with Rob Ford.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.600]   So on behalf of Rob Ford in Toronto,
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.360]   I mean, I think that this is a longstanding tradition.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.160]   Going back to Boss Tweed in our own.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.760]   But Alex has a good point.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.680]   That picture Chris Christie was the result of a journalist
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.120]   thinking, you know what?
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.400]   I think that Christie is enough of an idiot
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.960]   that he will close all the beaches,
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.000]   but take his own family out there.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.360]   Why don't we just rent the helicopter room?
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.200]   Just on the off chance.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.840]   Yeah, make sure they got a hell of a charge.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   That's a drone.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.400]   I mean, you know--
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.080]   Sure.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.440]   It wasn't either helicopter in order drone.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.480]   It was a Cessna.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.080]   It was a fixed wing aircraft.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.280]   And the poor guy--
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.120]   I mean, this is from the New Jersey star ledger.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.480]   He hung out of the aircraft risking life and limb
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.960]   for like an hour with long lenses.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.920]   And yeah, you're right.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.960]   I know you're worth it.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.520]   Kudos to him for thinking, what if the governor is out?
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520]   He couldn't have thought of my company.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.360]   He's a guy that Cessna, but it's going to be worth it.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.080]   Oh, it was-- oh, I think he'll get a Pulitzer for it.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.680]   Hey, I want to thank-- what's your name?
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.320]   I didn't get your name.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.240]   Sean and Lauren from-- they're visiting us from Honolulu.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.640]   Sean is a genius.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.040]   And he brought me-- this has never been opened.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.560]   I was the first to open it.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.120]   When the Royal Hawaiian Mall-- this
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.960]   was this the first Apple Store in Hawaii?
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.520]   Third Apple Store in Hawaii opened up.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.080]   They made special Apple T-shirts that say Royal Hawaiian.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.720]   Is that cool or what?
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.560]   I'm wearing that to your next barbecue, Alex.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.040]   Yes.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.000]   Your name tag now.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.240]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240]   Thank you.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.240]   That's really nice of you.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.480]   Do they still make like, opening day shirts?
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.920]   Because for the Boston Apple Store,
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.760]   they made like Green Monster Red Sox themed shirts.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.960]   Oh, that's a good idea, isn't it?
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.480]   I don't know.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.240]   I don't know if the Union Square had them.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.160]   He also brought me-- he and his wife brought me a ton of Hawaiian.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.120]   Goodies.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.080]   Did I just give him a name?
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.000]   Did you get a name?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.960]   You get a name?
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.880]   Girlfriend, sorry.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.320]   I got quite a look.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   I'm bird.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320]   How about this?
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.320]   This is-- these are pizza toppings.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   Kim Chi, Mochi Crunch and Nori.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.320]   Mm.
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   Popcorn.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   Did I say pizza?
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   Popcorn toppings.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.120]   Yeah, you could put it on pizza.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.520]   That's a chopped basket.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.320]   Well, why would you when Hawaiian pizza is close to perfect already?
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   Good.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   This is Hurricane toppings.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   Yeah, I know.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   I know.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320]   We have Hawaiian pizza and Quebec.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   Scott pineapple on it.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   Yeah, pineapple and ham.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   But you'll all be happy to know the guy who invented it is now dead.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   He's from Chicago.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.320]   Was he dead or was he killed?
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   No, he just died.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.320]   Okay.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   And which I shouldn't make fun of that.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.600]   One piece is the Phil Collins of pizzas.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.920]   I don't understand why people hate-- I can understand why people don't like it.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   I just don't understand why people hate it.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.320]   It's the nickel back of pizzas.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   Get it right.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.040]   And it's a Hong Kong and the Canadian pizza all had 1,000 islands dressing instead of
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.080]   tomato sauce on it, which we don't do here.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.520]   So it's just-- it's regionalisms that are funny.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.840]   That sounds foul.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.120]   Yes, pizza hut, Canadian pizza and Hong Kong do not order it.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120]   I'm not order it.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.720]   All right, we could talk about some more serious things.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.220]   Ovete.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.960]   What is the least-- I'm sorry listeners, but this is the topics you get in the middle
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   of July.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.960]   There's nothing.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.960]   There's--
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.320]   Unless-- So Australia--
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.960]   Unless somebody leaves something in a bar again.
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.640]   This is what we got.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:30.480]   Australia's fine prime minister Turnbull has proposed new encryption laws that will
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.720]   compel tech companies to give police and intelligence agencies access to encrypted information from
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.960]   suspected terrorists and criminals.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.080]   And of course, as we all know, if that-- if a company's to do that, that means encryption
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.320]   has to be broken.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.600]   Apple says, we're going to get together with the attorney general in Australia to discuss
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:59.000]   this ban on end to end encryption.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.800]   General George Brandes says he'll hold talks with Apple this week in a bid to get cooperation.
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.080]   Because that works so well.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.840]   Now, of course, the British investigatory powers act or colloquially known as the Snoopers
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.200]   Charter does something similar.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.360]   And apparently these Australian laws will be modeled on that.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.400]   Apple hasn't-- I'm sure they don't like it, but I don't know if they've gone to meet
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:28.440]   with Theresa May or anything about it.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.200]   She's got a bigger problem.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:37.760]   But it means that Apple-- well, now, the good news from Apple's point of view is iCloud,
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.400]   they have the key, they can hand it over and they have.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.200]   There's some debate over whether Apple's message is program.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.440]   I think it is not trust no one encryption.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.040]   I believe Apple's message is-- and the reason is you can, for instance, back up messages
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.680]   and restore it on a new phone, things like that.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.200]   You can pull it from the iCloud backup, but I don't believe you can pull it from the
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.320]   iMessage server.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.320]   So what is that?
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.920]   To me, that sounds like messages is probably just like iCloud.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:05.920]   Somebody at Apple has the key.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.200]   I'm sure protecting it carefully.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.000]   Because they've just changed that.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.200]   So iOS 11, it changes because now they do a sync with iMessage they didn't do before.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.280]   Before, every device was treated almost as a unique device and we get a unique copy of
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.480]   that message, which is why if you turn on a device, it wouldn't always be the same.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.400]   And it would try to deliver that message for, I think, for 12, 10 days.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.720]   And if it couldn't, you would just never get that message on that device because Apple
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.200]   didn't want to keep them on their servers.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:35.720]   But now they're doing a sync where it's still end to end encrypted, but those blobs go through
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.720]   a sync server.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.120]   And Apple doesn't know what those blobs are.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.080]   They're just pseudo-random blobs to them.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.200]   But they know that those are associated with your ID and that that blob should go to all
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   of your devices.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.520]   So that's where the problem begins because Apple can't hand over those messages then.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.000]   Yes, correct.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And they prefer that.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.520]   They prefer not to have any knowledge of anything that we do on our servers until you do have
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.520]   as quickly as possible.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   Exactly right.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.680]   It just makes them so much simpler if you say, "Oh, subpoena what we have, we have nothing."
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:06.760]   So we will happily deal with any subpoena you give us for personal data.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:13.520]   However, these laws say tech companies must provide the...
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.760]   Well, now this is interesting and I have to read these carefully.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.280]   If all they have to do is provide the message encrypted, then that's fine.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:25.520]   If they have to hand over the decrypted version of the message, that would be a problem.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:30.320]   I mean, even look at services like Blackblaze where you have the option of generating your
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.160]   own encryption key servers, sorry, client side before you upload anything to their servers,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.280]   they would have to try to crack it the way any other external hacker would have to try
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.640]   to crack it.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.800]   So we know that they Apple has the keys to iCloud.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:43.480]   To iCloud backup, they can...
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:48.200]   I believe in the past they've been able to decrypt iCloud backups for people, which depending
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.000]   on what you choose to backup, everyone can choose different things in their settings
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   to backup.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Well...
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   There will be an amount of data in there.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.400]   But we know it partly because they, when the FBI said, "Help us crack the smartphone,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:03.920]   the cell iPhone and the San Bernardino terrorism case," Apple said, "You dope.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:08.560]   If you had just let the iPhone back up to iCloud, we could have given you everything."
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.920]   Or the phone would have tied everything.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:13.000]   I mean, the simplest thing was for them not to do the reset and just...
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Right.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   ...gone into the phone.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.400]   Yeah, they changed the iCloud password.
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.040]   That was their in line, their mistake.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.280]   Apple is cooperating with China though on this regard.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.880]   They're setting up a China data center.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:32.440]   Well, it doesn't look like they're not giving them necessarily any data in that data center.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.720]   They're simply putting it there.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.400]   I think that there is obviously concerns of...
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.480]   Or good politics anyway of saying that you have to put the servers in our country because
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.120]   if you put the servers in the United States, then everything is in question.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.960]   Which is not necessary.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.760]   I think it's more of a political dig against the...
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   Well, a lot of things...
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.800]   A lot of countries do this.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.640]   This is not unusual to say...
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   ...brushes down a...
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   If you're in business...
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   They want their data on their servers.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   It should be our country.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.920]   However, one has to suspect that the Chinese government...
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.440]   See, what they require a Chinese company work with Apple to do this.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440]   And this...
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:09.760]   Cloud services must be operated by Chinese companies.
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.880]   So they're going with GCBD, the Guijo Cloud Big Data Industry Company.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.760]   Limited.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   And one suspects that Chinese government has a way of...
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.320]   Oh, and operated by.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.800]   Saying, "Hey, GCBD, what's in that?"
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.560]   I mean, the security concerns on their end are genuine given what's going on in the United
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.800]   States right now.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.320]   But it's also concerned about how the Chinese government uses internet services and data
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.160]   to maintain control over its people.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.720]   No, it's just a given that any time there is anything that...
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:52.160]   Anything on the internet that they think is going to create trouble, unrest, or make things
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.320]   untidy as one expert put it to me.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.280]   They have no problems with shutting it down.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.560]   And it's not an evil thing.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.400]   It's not a fist-raising thing.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.560]   It's like, "Well, of course you do that.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.560]   Why do you not do that?"
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.920]   That's the attitude of the people who control those services.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:10.200]   So it does take a different tone in China because now you have...
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.440]   That's what we have access to the power switch for all of your cloud services.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.800]   If we decide that something is getting out of hand and we want to make sure that nobody
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:23.200]   can transact data across these domains, we can just simply shut off this service.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:30.120]   And you need to think six steps ahead in personal privacy and, again, how governments
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.280]   use the internet to control and sometimes abuse its own people when you see a story
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.280]   like this.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.840]   There's another side to it too, which is...
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.720]   When we talk about this when it comes to backups is that security experts will tell you that
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.480]   backups should always be fail secure.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.760]   And if anything goes wrong, your data should be unrecoverable because then it's unrecoverable
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:47.760]   by anybody.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.080]   And a lot of backup specialists will tell you, "You don't want that.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.360]   You want all this stuff to be fail safe so that if anything goes wrong, you can recover
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   and restore it."
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.400]   And Apple has some services that are fail secure.
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.280]   Like the one-to-one iMessage service, even they can read those messages.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.000]   But increasingly they had problems with people losing all their photos.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.200]   And so photos, I believe, now is fail safe where there is some ability to recover.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.640]   And that might be what the iCloud backup is as well.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.560]   And I think they should just have the option, like, backblaze to create our own password
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.560]   if we want.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.680]   And I have to admit that for me, I have things in two different worlds.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.720]   So there are definitely things that are fail secure.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.120]   And then there are things that are fail safe.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.760]   Fail safe are things I'm really not worried about people.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.200]   But it's like things that I really want to keep, like, my photos of my kids or other
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.880]   things like that that are really important to me.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.640]   And if something goes wrong, I do want to be able to get to those.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.560]   Whereas a lot of my documents are in fail secure if I'd rather lose them than have them
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   leak.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.240]   And so those are, I think you can also think about different services and different processes
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.200]   and different password processes for different data.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.160]   And I think that as users, we have to start getting really smart about this.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.880]   I mean, this is a-- it's not just governments that we have to worry about, obviously.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:57.880]   It's hackers and everything else that you want to really think about how you're managing
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.160]   your data all the time.
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:04.600]   Yeah, we talked about this actually coincidentally earlier today on iOS today.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.200]   We did a show on cloud services because of the new file browser in iOS 11, which lets
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:16.840]   you have arbitrary cloud servers as part of your file service, which is great.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:21.560]   And I made that point, not as I think, not as well as you and Renee are making it, but
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:27.600]   merely that you have to understand what the policies are of each cloud provider.
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:34.640]   And while it's convenient, perhaps to use iCloud or Dropbox, understand that they are--
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.800]   what did you call that fail safe?
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.840]   And that stuff that you really want to keep private, you might want to consider using
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.800]   a trust no one service.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.120]   And a lot of this is the way to think about it.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:52.480]   When you think about fail safe and fail secure is what your door will do when you lose electricity.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.480]   So that--
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   Does a pop open or does it lock your mail?
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.080]   And your mail safe is going to come open, fail secure means it's going to be shut.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.680]   And you think about what data sits inside of that that you may never see again, if there
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.680]   was a--
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   Something to kind of--
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.840]   This is another reason to contemplate buying a NAS or a network attached storage.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:16.920]   It allows you to kind of create your own private version of Dropbox and private versions
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.040]   of cloud services right now.
[00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:23.080]   I've been using that a lot for-- I haven't switched over from Dropbox to my NAS, but
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:28.400]   the fact that I have apps on my-- I can access these files through any computer with a web
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   browser.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.200]   I've got-- Synology has provided really good iOS apps and Android app.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.360]   I can access these files with the simplicity of a modern interface.
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:42.720]   If you're concerned about that sort of stuff and you want the ability to-- if you've got
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.720]   data that's so private and so valuable that you need the ability to nuke it from orbit
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.000]   and know that nobody can get-- if I can't get at this, nobody can get at this.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.840]   You might want to consider getting a NAS and sort of shifting a lot of your workflow onto
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.920]   your own-- onto servers that you actually own.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.960]   Yeah, that's what I recommended.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:10.720]   But it's more complicated than that because-- well, for instance, if law enforcement went
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.400]   to Apple, for instance, and said, "Let me see all Leo's data."
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:17.240]   Apple would be forced to comply.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.840]   They might fight it, but they'd be forced ultimately to comply.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:26.160]   And depending on the nature of it, they could be compelled-- they could be gagged.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.240]   They could be compelled not to reveal that information.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.240]   So I wouldn't know.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.000]   At least if law enforcement came to me and said, "We want to see what's on your NAS,"
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.840]   I'd know it, right?
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.160]   But they still could do that.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.160]   They still--
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.200]   That was the old Blackberry versus Microsoft argument that the only had to compromise one
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.600]   knock to get everyone's information where with exchange they had to get every server
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.600]   from every company.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.200]   Yeah, I guess that's really more to be the thing to be worried about is a phishing expedition
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.600]   where everybody's stuff is then thereafter you.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.920]   If thereafter you, that's another matter.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.840]   Then there's another point which somebody in the chat room brought up.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.440]   You could have everything securely stored on an ass or maybe use one of these trust-no-one
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.320]   services like treasure it.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:12.080]   And then-- but the passwords in last pass and last pass could be compromised.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.840]   And you'd be all over everything.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.640]   So there's all sorts of-- there's ways and ways.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.520]   And the nightmare solution is they just accumulate all your data and then at some point in the
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.320]   future is how they want to get you and sift back through years of data to see what they
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   can find.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.480]   Well, and as stuff is being transported, maybe they're cracking it there.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.680]   I mean, there's plenty of places along the way.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.680]   Yeah, encryption over time.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.960]   Maybe they can't crack it now, but in five years they can and they have the data.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.240]   Yeah, that's increasingly troubling.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:39.880]   Given the exponential potential of artificial intelligence, a lot of what makes things
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.040]   secure is the idea that, well, now we know this is safe because it is mathematically
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.600]   impossible for this to be cracked.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.080]   But then all you need is one revolution.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.240]   Oh, by the way, we now have quantum computing.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.560]   We can do things a thousand times faster with the same hardware.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:58.120]   And now this is the sort of computer that maybe can't be owned by an individual but can be
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.120]   owned by a sufficiently well financed organization.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.640]   And now things that-- and now remember the time when we all thought that our bicycle
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:10.080]   locks with those round keys were really secure and then we started wondering, "Gee, why
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.800]   do I keep finding these big pens with like these sort of split out ends of it just on
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.240]   the sidewalks all the time?"
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.560]   It's because, oh, the people who steal pikes realize that you can just jab a big pen in
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.760]   there and twist it around and it would eventually pop the thing open.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:27.120]   All that-- the bad people are very well motivated to keep things working to their advantage.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.800]   The other problem is that ginking back to Australia, that's why you're sort of worried
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.920]   that when a government-- maybe even for completely altruistic reasons, so as a we need to have
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:41.680]   access, there needs to be a way for us to get in there if there is a sufficiently important
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.280]   danger to the community with data that is locked up someplace.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.480]   Again, there are going to be bad people that are going to say, "Great, it looks--"
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:55.920]   instead of-- there is a steel door behind a cement wall that can be opened now.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.280]   And so it's going to be our job to figure out how to open it.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.120]   And when they do that, they're not going to try to claim a $50,000 bounty on a bug
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.120]   report.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.280]   They are going to start selling this tool to people who do very, very extremely bad things.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:12.520]   So that's why in principle, whenever a government creates a policy that says that you do not
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:18.080]   have the right to secure your own data and make sure that it is secured against eavesdropping
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:23.040]   by your own standards, that becomes a huge problem in which basic infrastructure starts
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.960]   to fail, I think.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.920]   What do you guys use?
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:33.640]   What do you recommend if you wanted some sort of fail-secure solution?
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.520]   Andy, you recommend having it at home.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.560]   It's expensive and complicated for a lot of people.
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.000]   Another thing to do is disc utility has let's you create essentially virtual drives that
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.720]   you can totally encrypt without encrypting your entire hard drive.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:55.840]   So create a volume mounted when you need it, unmounted when you don't need it.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.960]   And that's what I trust for stuff that I need to carry from place to place that I need the
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.800]   ability to make sure that it would be really, really hard to get into that stuff.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.760]   But it's not a particularly easy problem to solve.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.680]   Now if you don't want the complexity, you could use a service and there are services
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   that are trust no one.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   You guys have any recommendations?
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.760]   I think even the popular ones, all of the popular ones now let you create client-side
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.080]   encryption keys so you encrypt on your end before uploading to their servers.
[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.040]   And for most people, it's just easier to let the service do the work, sort of like iCloud
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.800]   versus Time Machine even, where it's an incredibly mainstream friendly solution.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.440]   As long as you're encrypting it with good encryption on your end and you have the keys
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.040]   and you maintain them, then again, they're just big blind and slobs.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.240]   So that's why you could continue using iCloud or Dropbox or something and then have a special
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.080]   part of it that is locally encrypted.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.360]   So even though you're storing it on iCloud, it can't be decrypted by anybody except you
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.320]   because only you have the keys.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.000]   Again, until such time that those keys are made by you, you should be re-encrypting those
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.320]   every so often.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.320]   There's Spider Oak.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.760]   We've mentioned this before.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.760]   This is a trust no one or sometimes they call it zero knowledge solution.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.680]   They also have messaging I hadn't realized.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.600]   So that's an interesting way to do it.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:10.640]   Somebody asked me on the radio show yesterday about treasure it so I've been taking a look
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.040]   at that T-R-E-S-O-R-I-T.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.720]   This one is based in Switzerland.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.600]   I don't know if that makes a difference or not.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.080]   They said with Swiss privacy policies.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.200]   Any others that we might want to mention?
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:30.120]   I like your idea, which is to just use whatever you use but have some have been encrypted
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.000]   before you put it online.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.520]   Because anything that's on the internet is at risk.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   Yeah, that's what I do with Disc Images on Dropbox.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:45.480]   I do have a secure USB drive, so to speak, that's inside Dropbox.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.480]   It also makes a difference.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.440]   If Andy's house gets hit by a comet, his backup goes with it.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.320]   So you want at least something that's offsite.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:57.800]   And I have the, not always have luxury, but I have luxury of having an office and a home.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:06.000]   And so I keep important copies of the secure data on both home and office.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.400]   And again, if someone took the drive, they'd get nothing.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.600]   It's just the data.
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:17.800]   And then the stuff that is, I don't put anything online that I don't care what they say about.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   I don't put anything online.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.200]   I don't even post privately.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.520]   I mean, I don't post anything on Facebook or anything else just to friends.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.520]   I don't like, I remember a gut and really, what was the service that we used to path?
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.400]   That we, that we got into a Chinese company.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.560]   When I started getting really interested in path and I started posting things, because
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.280]   I almost, you know, I don't rarely post anything of my kids.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.640]   And I started posting it, and I immediately decided I'm getting too comfortable with this.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:46.840]   I don't want to be thinking that this is going to be safe and immediately stopped and just
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.240]   walked away from it.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.960]   And so like when I post Twitter or Facebook, I don't, on Twitter, definitely, but even
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.240]   Facebook, I don't do anything that I would assume.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.840]   I don't post anything that I don't think that everyone's going to read.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.040]   And I do it publicly more as a mindset than anything else.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:05.560]   But when I put data online, I also think the same thing.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.800]   All right.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.040]   Well, there's solutions there.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:17.400]   I like Andy's idea of having a encrypted USB key or USB drive that you can then put
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.880]   on Dropbox.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.560]   If you really want to, if you spend money and want to do it right, I think what you're
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.200]   doing, Alex is probably the most sophisticated, but it requires a great expense because you're
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.840]   going to have duplicate nasses and that kind of thing.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.200]   It just depends on value, what your data is.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.840]   Also, when we think about all things we spend money on, we pile up how much money we spend
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.360]   on Starbucks or anything else.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.320]   I mean, it all adds up eventually to a lot of money.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.800]   And it just depends on what, you know, when you lose that.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.040]   I mean, I've had a lot of friends and I've even, I mean, I've lost big sections of, I
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.560]   mean, in the past, big sections of things I really wish I hadn't.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.400]   Right.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.680]   Well, remember that whenever anybody's giving you advice about backup strategies and security
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.480]   strategies, it really is about, it really is like advice about health and fitness and
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.040]   diet.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.880]   We're telling you about things that we do that work for us.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.320]   They may not work for you.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.760]   The idea is just to create a plan that you can live with day to day to day, not something
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.760]   that you keep up with for three weeks.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.160]   And then week four, you decide, I really don't want to have to keep tapping in my password.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.640]   I'm just going to copy this file outside of my secure area and put it just in the main
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   Dropbox.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.440]   And then you do another file, then another file, and then it's been eight months since
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.960]   you've even touched your secure area.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.760]   So absolutely just realize that these technologies are out there.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:38.320]   It's okay if you introduce better security and backup practices little by little so long
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.200]   as it's something that you can keep doing every day for the rest of your life.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:48.400]   Eventually, 10 years from now, you will find that you did totally revolutionize and improve
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.040]   the safety of your entire world without ever undergoing a major revolution.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   There you go, everybody.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.840]   We managed to waste 15 minutes on this subject half an hour.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.840]   That's good.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.160]   We're almost there.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.880]   Three more stories and we're out of here.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.600]   No, I think actually that's all very important stuff.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.920]   We're going to take a break.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.400]   Come back with more.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.200]   ReneeRitchie, I'm more.com Andy and not go Chicago Sun times.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   And of course, Alex Lindsey, always a pleasure to have all three of you from the Pixel core.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.920]   Our show today brought to you by texture.
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.720]   I love the idea of texture.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:35.160]   Texture is a kind of like a Netflix for magazines and it is the best thing.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:42.000]   It is the best food to feed your iPad ever, but you can also use it on any device.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.360]   It's the world's most popular magazines, 200 of them for less than 10 bucks a month.
[00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.360]   It is fantastic.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.000]   Actually, they've even got a better offer now.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.120]   It looks like this is great.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.280]   Go to texture.com/twit.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.480]   You could try it free and then you get three more months for another $10.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.120]   So it's a really great way to see all the amazing magazines.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.600]   Now I love magazines.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.000]   I'm a big magazine fan.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.240]   I love the idea that I can read all these magazines without having to subscribe or buy
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.520]   them and get all that coffee table clutter and all of that.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.400]   They also have some great curation.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:29.440]   So if you don't have to know what magazines you want to look at to be able to peruse the
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.080]   magazines, look at all these titles.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   National Geographic.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.920]   Actually, National Geographic is an example of something that really looks great, better
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.080]   on your iPad that it doesn't print because you don't have that disadvantage of having
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:45.360]   to screen it and that really can ruin print pictures.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:50.120]   The images look fantastic on your iPad or your tablet.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.880]   National Geographic Kids, National Geographic Little Kids, National Geographic Traveler as
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.400]   well.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:03.320]   You get all kinds of great magazines, Rolling Stone, Mother Jones, 17, Shutterbug, Sailing
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   World.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.560]   Sailing magazines, I like to fantasize.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.920]   I also like the cooking magazines.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:15.480]   There's so many great cooking magazines, cooking light, clean eating, just some really
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.840]   great stuff.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.440]   Plus stuff that you might say, like for me, you want to read but you wouldn't want to
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.440]   subscribe to.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:28.720]   I love reading the Hollywood Reporter variety, Billboard, all the trade magazines from the
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.560]   entertainment industry.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.760]   But I probably wouldn't subscribe.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.240]   They're very expensive to subscribe.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.640]   The texture lets you read them all.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:41.120]   I want you to visit texture.com best of 2016, according to Apple in the App Store.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.320]   Visit texture.com/twit and get a great free trial for two weeks, over 200 magazines on
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.840]   your tablet.
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:51.800]   And when I travel, I love having texture.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.280]   Lisa actually has a text or subscription but we can put it on five devices so we share
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   it.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.440]   You could favorite a magazine, they'll download automatically.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.160]   You can do pages in the newsstand issue plus back issues plus bonus features like video
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:09.560]   texture.com/twit before you go on your summer break.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:14.080]   I want you to do that free trial.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.440]   We are talking about the Apple World and AR Kit.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.960]   Of course, we're all very excited about.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.560]   We're going to start seeing more demos as developers play with it and then of course
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:30.680]   in the fall when we get iOS 11 and the new iPhone maybe.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.320]   We might see even more amazing stuff.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:38.120]   But here's a new demo.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.720]   This is actually using the Vive.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:47.560]   This is Vive, AR Kit and Unity.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.040]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.920]   It's a magic being that's doing some drawing.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.840]   So explain this to me.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.200]   So you can use the Vive with AR Kit?
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.920]   I guess they're just pumping in the movement data to see the AR Kit.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.440]   Would we call it a projection?
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.760]   I don't know what the terminology is for all this stuff yet.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:11.960]   There's a virtual AR Kit being who's being directed by the input from the VR device.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:19.920]   So they're actually, if you look closely, the Vive is connected to a Macintosh.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.440]   I don't know how they do that.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.440]   I think they're using the DevKit, the EGPU DevKit.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.640]   I think that's what that black box was next to the--
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.640]   Oh, I get it.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.640]   Display.
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.640]   Okay.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:36.480]   So Apple's latest iMacs include VR support once High Sierra comes out, I guess.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   Yep.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   Yeah, we've been testing it.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   It doesn't do very much yet.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.480]   But it's great.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   You can do all the development stuff.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.120]   It doesn't do much in terms of playing games or anything yet.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.800]   But you can do a lot of the developer stuff.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   Steam has a SteamVR software development kit for the Mac, which means you're going to
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   see that's for Vive.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.200]   That means you're going to see a lot more stuff.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:57.480]   Yeah, and I think Oculus might have jumped a little too soon, away from the Mac, because
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.160]   of course it started there.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:07.040]   But what you're seeing there with a mixed reality, or XR is what they're starting to
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   call it, because you have AR, VR, and XR, and XR is kind of the mixed reality look.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.920]   And that's kind of a simpler version of it because you don't need green screen.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.400]   So there's two different ways to do that.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.160]   Of course, you have being able to take the CG elements and throw them in front of people,
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.400]   or of course put people in front of green screen in a variety of other ways and put
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.200]   them into a VR scene so you can kind of see what they're looking at.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.120]   And so that was a very effective version of it.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.200]   Of course, as soon as it came out, it went like wildfire through our company.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.040]   Because we have a whole team right now that's just working on AR.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:42.800]   These are an interesting thing, because you remember that Palmer Lucky, I think it was,
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:48.000]   that Shane Apple doesn't make computers good enough to power VR.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.120]   Maybe they do, because as I mentioned, you can use Steam and this new dev kit with AR
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.240]   kit.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.720]   And there's support there for the Oculus Rift.
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:05.240]   In fact, I'm looking at a comment on the Mac rumors site that says, "Can confirm Oculus
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.080]   Rift works in the Steam VR beta with an eGPU developers kit connected to a Mac running
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.080]   ICRA beta?"
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.360]   eGPU, that was that box you were talking about, Renee.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:20.000]   That's an external Nvidia processor, right?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.200]   It comes with an AD on processor.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.840]   It comes with a Radeon processor now.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:30.040]   I don't think Nvidia, we tried with the 1080 card and there's just your drivers just don't
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.720]   support this configuration yet.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:34.560]   But I'm sure that time heals all combat abilities.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.560]   So hopefully that'll change.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:39.800]   But you plug it in over Thunderbolt 3 right into the MacBook Pro because it's got three
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.760]   ports that'll power at the same time.
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.480]   You've got the card in there and it just offload.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.480]   It detects it.
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.600]   That was one of the big things that previously NoMac understood that GPUs could come and
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   go.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.040]   It just didn't, it had no way of handling that.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.640]   So now it has all this messaging as they knew GPU discovered, GPU disconnected.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640]   Nice.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.760]   You plug it in, it presents itself, it shows itself in system diagnostics and then you
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.440]   can hit that the way you would hit any additional GPU in the system.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.040]   And Thunderbolt 3, what is it?
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   40 gigabits?
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.440]   What's the throughput on?
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:10.080]   So people are getting it, I've gotten it at least to recognize it over Thunderbolt 2 using
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   an adapter.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.560]   So that might just be for a best case scenario.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.000]   I'm not sure what they can do with it yet.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.520]   But some people have got it running on Thunderbolt 2 as well.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:22.320]   So you can get a high end graphics card, put it in the eGPU.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:27.160]   If you have high Sierra on a Thunderbolt 3 Mac, which is the new iMac or the MacBook
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.880]   Pro, that will be sufficient.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.880]   But you do need iC.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   But the iMac doesn't need it.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:35.480]   The iMac has a good, if you have a lot of iMac, it has a high, it has a good enough
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   card.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.120]   You can get the eGPU if you want some flexibility or you want to start doing other stuff with
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.120]   it too.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   So it'll work with it.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.200]   But I believe the highest end of the uiMac is pretty good on its own.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:51.520]   Yeah, and the, obviously the pro will open up a lot of opportunities there as far as
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.520]   that goes.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:58.360]   We have an eGPU here for some reason.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.000]   I think we're doing something for the new screen series.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.080]   We're testing or something.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.080]   How are they expensive?
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.640]   It's a developer kit right now.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.800]   There will be commercial versions available, but you have to have a registered developer
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.200]   account with Apple to order one.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.040]   And I think it's around, I forget what it is American, but it's around $600.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.440]   That's with the enclosure with the cable.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.840]   But not with the card.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.440]   Yeah, the card comes too.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.200]   So no third party makes.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.880]   No, they will.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.880]   Okay.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:32.280]   Well, it's just a kiddio, which makes a, oh, that's a, yeah, no, this is an eGPU.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.600]   So part of what Thunderbolt 3 was designed to address that's becoming really big in windows
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.080]   and windows gaming.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:43.960]   So it's another indication of how a lot of the, a lot of the best stuff coming out of
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:48.480]   WWDC this year were these little things that will make everything so much more awesome over
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.800]   the next year or two.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:55.000]   I was, I was on the radio a couple of weeks after and some, and the, the, the host asked
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.560]   me, so what's the, what was the most exciting thing to come up, come up, come up, the developer
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:00.560]   conference?
[00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.200]   And they thought they were setting me up to talk about HomePod.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.560]   And I said, oh, well VR kit and they're now they can use external GPUs.
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.640]   And I got this really, and I got this really blank expression.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:15.680]   I had like say, but that was, but that was, but that was literally the case.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.960]   It's like the things that are AR kit, all of these demos that are coming out from developers
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.760]   that are just making their first apps to figure out just taking a AR kit through its
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.760]   paces.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.640]   This is such a brilliant mode of any new resource or any new technology.
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.080]   No one is all these demos, they don't reflect a product or a business plan that people are
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   working towards.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:39.880]   It's what, wouldn't that be a cool idea if I could simply walk through a space with my
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:44.400]   camera held out and then every picture I take at that moment will simply hover in space
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:50.680]   and go and revisit that second of this moment or what if I could not just paint in 3D, but
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:55.320]   have an animated figure so I could see this figure painting this 3D sculpture.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.920]   And on and on and on, YouTube is probably the greatest ambassador for the next version
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:03.800]   of iOS than any video that Apple has ever produced.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:09.720]   It really has gotten me super excited about what an iPhone will be able to do in September
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.720]   or October this year when AR kit apps are finally released into the public.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:17.280]   And we've been finding and we're not ready to talk too much publicly about what we're
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.960]   doing just yet, but the results are stunning.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:23.920]   I mean, the phones are amazingly powerful.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:30.800]   I mean, both on the Android side, Android side as well as the iOS side that you're seeing,
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.960]   being able to process over a million polygons at a time, which means that we can do a lot
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:40.760]   of detail being able to put whole environments in front of you and people.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:47.000]   We had someone dancing on our table yesterday and it was like a person that looked like
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.600]   there was a person standing in front of you, that's like three feet high or two feet high
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.360]   standing on your table dancing.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.960]   In 3D, you can walk around them and stuff like that.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:01.240]   And so there's going to be a lot of when it comes to education, when it comes to some
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:07.200]   entertainment, but I think that the education market, the training market, the exploring
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.560]   locations and things is going to be very exciting.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:16.040]   As far as what can be done, the technology, even in its very rough form is working extremely
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.240]   well on a variety of platforms, whether it's...
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.240]   And the great thing for all of us is that everyone's competing pretty rigorously.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:28.440]   So you've got Facebook and Google and Apple, all in Microsoft, all pushing pretty hard
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.440]   on a...
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.720]   Yeah, to Andy's point, it really is a small thing.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:36.120]   You look at AR and VR and then you also add in something like Metal 2, where they deliberately
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.120]   do everything they can to get the CPU out of the way and just let developers hit that
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.760]   GPU as hard as they can.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:46.160]   And things like Xcode, where you have per-eye debugging for things like VR so that you can
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.160]   go through the entire pilot.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.840]   They've got a lot of very clever things there to make it an attractive environment, at least
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.480]   for people who want to develop on the...
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.280]   And all of those little things are really the problem.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:59.240]   I don't know if folks are old enough to remember, I think we are, but when you used to play
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:04.000]   marathon, you had to remember we had to restart your Mac and hold down the shift key so that
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.280]   you could start without any extensions on or you'd lose frames.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:14.040]   And frame rate is really a big issue with AR and VR, but they are losing a frame or
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.080]   two really takes you out of the moment.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.960]   And so being able to get that processing and make sure that it's not chugging through
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.400]   some automatic operation while you're trying to look at what you're looking at, I think
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.400]   is an issue.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.280]   And I think that when we think about the possibilities, one of the things that we've been playing
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.600]   with is I think there's going to be some point in time when you're on your Amazon app and
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:40.120]   you're going to be able to click on, "I want to see this object and that object," just
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.360]   hold your phone up and you can walk around the object that you want to buy instead of
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.360]   looking at a couple of photos.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360]   And I don't think-
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   Like, can I just grab it, Alex?
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.360]   Why can't I just grab it out of the screen and have it?
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   Just one.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.360]   Exactly.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.920]   But I think that you're going to be able to really look at it in the level of detail that
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.120]   you'll be able to look at it is way better than those photos.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.320]   And you'll be able to get up right up to it and look at the things that you want to
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.160]   look at, possibly rotate it around.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:04.000]   And I don't think that future is very far away.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.280]   I'm not saying I've seen anything, but I'm just saying that it's, I think that future's
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.720]   probably, I'm really, I'm not.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   I have.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   No.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.080]   That's not me, but we're not.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:16.800]   Every time you experiment with something where they are, you immediately think of the 10 other
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.320]   things you can use it for.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:20.960]   And so because as soon as you see it, you're like, "Oh, okay."
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.320]   And then this is the next thing we want to do.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   And this is the next thing we want to do.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.800]   Well, give me an example though of something useful.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:29.600]   Ten in our chatroom says, "I've seen dozens of these ARKit demos now.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   They're cool."
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.560]   We'll all agree to that.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.340]   But I don't find them to be the future of anything.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:39.680]   Give me an example of something concrete that we're going to be doing in three years
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   or two years.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.680]   No.
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   Okay.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.600]   We start with Alex and then Annie, you can do it.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   So a couple of things.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.040]   One is that, let's say you're putting together your Ikea furniture, like getting rid of the
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.040]   paper and the Ikea furniture.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.040]   Ikea, that's that, right?
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   Super exciting.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.680]   Well, Ikea, right now what they've announced is being able to visualize the furniture in
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   your house.
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.680]   Okay.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.080]   But the far more useful use of AR is getting rid of those stupid pieces of paper that come
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:06.640]   with it and moving it to a platform that basically says, "Okay, I can show me the piece.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   Okay, that's the right piece."
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.720]   You know, like literally, "Show me the piece.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.600]   These pieces come together."
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:16.000]   You know, like these, you know, that would be a lot better than the little headless man
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.440]   and the thing with the thing and the...
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.440]   You can...
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.440]   Oh, I can never...
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.440]   You know, it's like, you know, and you always end up with six-section screws and you don't
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.560]   know whether they pack them that way or whether you forgot something.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.560]   And so...
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:27.560]   There you go.
[00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:28.560]   So for learning.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.560]   For...
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:34.280]   Well, in all kinds of learning, you know, you know, being able to look at, you know, something
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.920]   that is gone, you know, that there's ruins and being able to see what it looked like when
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   it was at a tight.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   You know, those are the kind of things that you'll be able to do.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.760]   That's going to actually be hard on iOS in the immediate future depending on what happens
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.640]   in the final build, because we haven't seen enough of it.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.680]   But you know, that's something that you can do more easily on the Android platform right
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:02.680]   now with what they're doing because the trackers are better.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.360]   But we don't know what the iPhone 8's going to have.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.240]   And that could definitely change a lot of the stuff.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   All right, Andy, your turn.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.240]   What would you...
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.840]   Give me an example of something that's useful in the augmented reality.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   Uh...
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   You...
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.640]   Well, I thought you had something.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no, I do.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.240]   No, I do.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.960]   But the larger point that I wanted to make is that this is like looking at Twitter and
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.800]   saying how are people...
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.400]   What use possibly uses 140 characters?
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.320]   And well, it's a new form of communication.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.040]   This is what augmented reality really is.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.680]   It's a way of communicating information to people in a way that was unavailable before
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.280]   this technology came along.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.920]   So you're talking about stuff like, uh, I've called triple...
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.080]   I've called triple A. And they can't say...
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   My car's broken down.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.280]   My call triple A, and they say the...
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:56.000]   As soon as we get a truck out there is 90 minutes, but would you like to talk to...
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.840]   Would you like to talk to a diagnostic person over the phone?
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   So yes, absolutely.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.360]   Do you have our triple A app?
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.360]   Yes.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.360]   Okay, turn on the AR feature.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.040]   Pop up the hood.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.040]   And just let us look at your engine.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:12.320]   And it will simply say, "Oh, okay, well, first thing I want you to do is now...
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.880]   I've highlighted...
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.480]   See the battery to your right?
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.640]   It's now colored pink and there's a word called battery on top of it.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.120]   I want you to take a look at that.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.680]   Give me a closer look at that right there."
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:27.840]   Or stuff like, "I don't know why the Wi-Fi in my house is going all screwy."
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.440]   So I can...
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:34.440]   The setup app on Google Home or EVO or whatever now says, "Okay, just...
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.880]   If you want to see what the signal strength is like, just turn on the AR feature."
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:42.800]   And I can simply walk around and I can see pulsating rays of where the Wi-Fi is and where
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   the Wi-Fi isn't.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:47.040]   Just we're not talking about one specific feature.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.840]   We're talking about here is a way to communicate something visually that was inaccessible before.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.840]   So it's...
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.400]   And it is something as simple as...
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.440]   I've used this example before.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.760]   I've taken a step out of the subway.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.480]   I know that I have to go two blocks either that way.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.080]   I know I'm on Seventh Avenue.
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:07.200]   I don't know whether I need to go that way or that way.
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.760]   So I simply take out...
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.920]   Activate Apple Maps and simply there's a big...
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.200]   There's a Pokemon with a big twirling side thing this way, you idiot.
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:17.200]   See this way.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.200]   God...
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.200]   I do think location...
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.200]   Just follow me.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.200]   I'll lead you there.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:25.480]   I do think location and maps are a good use of augmented reality.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.480]   And Apple...
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.120]   No, I guess it was Google did a demonstration of you hold up your phone and on a street
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.560]   and it'll show you can look at information about the shops you're seeing.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:35.560]   Right.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.560]   Stuff like that.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.040]   And another one of these really cool ARKit demos was someone has...
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.600]   A developer has hooked up Strava data.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.400]   So when at the end of a ride, they can actually...
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:51.480]   They can actually just point their iPhone at their kitchen countertop or at their coffee
[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:57.880]   table and they will see a 3D representation of the part of the city that they wrote around
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:04.080]   and out here is a line showing them where they went and also what the stress levels
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:07.600]   and heart rate levels and exertion levels and how fast they were turning the pedals.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.800]   And they can actually visualize that in a way and understand it in a way that they couldn't
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.320]   understand that data before.
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.720]   I mean, I'll just...
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:22.840]   I always think about how envious I am of kids taking math classes today where they have
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:28.880]   visualization tools that let them simply play with cosines and tangents, let them play
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.880]   with four dimensional...
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.880]   Education.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:32.880]   Right.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.120]   Well, not just that, but it's like...
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:38.760]   But don't just visualize that here is a sine wave, a sine wave looks like this.
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.920]   It's like, no, here it is.
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.920]   If you want to push it and pull it this way and basically throw this complication into
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:46.960]   and see what happens to that trigonometry function.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.440]   Again, it's communication.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.440]   It's not a feature.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.120]   And it's going to be like Twitter where it will seem kind of ridiculous.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:55.680]   Actually, I tweeted last night, I had this idea that I want...
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.040]   One of the first million dollar AR kit app is going to be miniature golf courses like
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.680]   Pokemon Go where I can go in the middle of a park and hold up my phone and I will see
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:09.560]   this awesome Game of Thrones death windmill hole.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:13.960]   And it'll be like two or three people with their phones on selfie sticks acting as putters.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:19.480]   They can see the tap and a gallery of people who are just watching through their phones
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:25.320]   and seeing the mountains suddenly leap out of the bushes and then simply eviscerate the
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:28.320]   ball and kill the whatever it is.
[00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:29.920]   I don't subscribe to HBO.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.080]   But it's going to seem like these silly things to begin with until people figure out how
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.160]   they can best use it.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.760]   And now it's basically if you want a breaking news alert to hit the most...
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.840]   The greatest number of people in the most efficient way, you're going to tweet that
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.840]   out.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.960]   You're not necessarily going to post it on the blog or at least you're going to use Twitter
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:49.320]   to tell you about the thing that's been posted on a blog on the Washington Post.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:54.080]   Actually there is a timely story because Google has revived glass.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.680]   Glass isn't exactly augmented reality because you're not...
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.040]   Why wouldn't they revive it?
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:02.040]   I think they never went away.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.840]   I think they're just finally reaching...
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.840]   They have a new version.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:05.840]   Let's put it that way.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:06.840]   Google Glass 2.0.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:07.840]   Like a personal display, right?
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.840]   Is that the nomenclature?
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.760]   Yeah, because you're not looking at the world with stuff superimposed on it.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:18.080]   You have a, well frankly, a screen over your right eyebrow that you can look at.
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.240]   Although it's easily viewed.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:25.800]   The new Glass 2.0 is available to business only.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:27.280]   It's really designed for industrial use.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:33.040]   I think you can wear it with prescription glasses if you want.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:38.400]   And I guess the idea is exactly as you were talking about that you might use this on the
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.200]   factory floor or somewhere where you needed to look at annual or...
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.200]   I think...
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.200]   Now I think of it.
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:51.600]   The things about Google Glass was like it sort of pre-seeded the Amazon Echo.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:57.080]   The idea of I want to have a computer with an interface that I don't have to touch anything.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.960]   I don't have to take my vocal...
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.640]   My visual focus off anything.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.200]   I can simply say something and the computer does it.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:08.200]   In the case of Google Glass, it chiefly uses that screen to deliver any visual information
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.960]   that I can't deliver to you via audio.
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.920]   So Google has always been maintaining Google Glass.
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.680]   They shut it off to another alphabet company but they thought, "Okay, now it's going to
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:22.920]   be about enterprise rather than convincing regular people to wear these on their faces
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:23.920]   every day."
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:25.080]   Here's a factory.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.720]   This is from Wired Magazine.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.760]   Here's a factory on the right, Diane von Furstenberg, in the first iteration of Glass, which really
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.520]   wasn't a fashion setter on the left.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:41.720]   I mean, on the right, a worker at a factory just above the Iowa State line in Sioux Falls,
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.720]   South Dakota, who says he leaves he's at home.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.800]   They look like OSHA safety glasses.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   He begins his day by saying, "Okay, Glass proceed."
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   And he uses this to do whatever he's doing, which looks like a prepare gear for shipping.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.480]   I think that's kind of interesting.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:07.840]   There is an industrial use for it and Google obviously decided that's the way to go.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.040]   Well, there's so much stuff that you're spending time looking down on a screen and then looking
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:12.720]   up and looking down, looking up.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.440]   And when you think about the AR and all of the stuff that we're seeing Apple do right
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:20.360]   now and Google do right now, it's all, I think Google thinks about it a lot because
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.880]   they've got Glass in the workforce.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.840]   But this is all going to end up on Glasses.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.800]   We're going to all be have something or anybody who wants to do this.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:33.000]   We'll have something that is more heads up display and giving you a lot of information
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   about what you're doing.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.680]   So the stuff that we're doing right now with iOS, with ARKit, Apple, I don't, I'd be
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.880]   blown away within five years, Apple doesn't have its own glasses with, and it's throwing
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.440]   that stuff up in front of you and getting that.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.320]   And you can get to a point where you're, we've done stuff where we've done camera training
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.120]   remotely with Google loss.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.880]   Oh, have you?
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:56.880]   How interesting.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.080]   So you both have Glass on and you see what the person's doing.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.080]   You go like, no, no, no, no.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:05.560]   And you get the same camera on your side, you're going to touch this button and turn
[00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:06.560]   this.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.280]   And when the two of them match, it's kind of magical.
[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:12.920]   You're like, I can't believe I'm training someone 10,000 miles away with, you know,
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:17.400]   over, over Wi-Fi, you know, and this was, and so that, and that was in the early iterations
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   of it.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.640]   And that's experimenting, but you know, we're, we're trying to get on the list to play with.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.240]   Yeah, they call this your enterprise edition.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:32.120]   Actually, this was, this is an agricultural equipment company that pictures from Agco.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:37.600]   But according to Stephen Levy, again, writing in a wired magazine, glass, the enterprise
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:43.080]   edition has been quietly and using dozens of workplaces over the last two years, including
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:46.520]   GE Boeing, DHL and Volkswagen.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:51.040]   It sounds like in industrial environments that this is, this is a whole different thing.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:54.840]   These are all environments where people need their hands for other things and they need
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.000]   access information.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.080]   So and something frankly that is AR might even be more useful, but you see how much harder
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.160]   AR is to do.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:05.160]   Well, because the glass is just a screen and it's triggered by your voice.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:10.920]   AR would require camera to see what's going on, a computer to understand what's going
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:15.760]   on, process it and, and then put information on top of it.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.160]   That's a lot harder thing to do.
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:20.960]   Well, I'm glad we're seeing so many different cuts at this idea.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.960]   We're seeing, we're seeing Oculus where it is, we are going to create an entirely new environment
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.880]   that may or may not integrate what's really happening around you.
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.080]   We've got, we've got what Microsoft is doing with Oculus that's saying that we are going
[00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:38.520]   to be able to seamlessly introduce digital constructs, whole screens.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.080]   Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:45.600]   And so you'll still be wearing a Windows computer, but you can see you're seeing what
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:48.600]   you're really seeing, but we're adding stuff to it selectively.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.560]   You've got glass, which is we're not adding anything.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:55.040]   We're just putting a screen up here so that if there's information that a computer can
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.560]   and should convey to you, you can see it without really taking your hands off of what you're
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:51:59.560]   doing.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.800]   And then we're seeing stuff like what Apple is doing and what's happening on other platforms,
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.320]   not nearly as well as what Apple's doing, which is it's okay for someone to take a phone
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:10.040]   out of their pocket and hold it up because we've, as anybody who's walked down a city
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.280]   street and nearly gotten brained by a pedestrian, people are okay with walking around and looking
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.360]   at a screen.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:20.360]   And also people are going to be buying an iPhone anyway, or people already have an iPhone
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.960]   that can do ARKit.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:28.040]   This is such a wonderful way to give people access to the benefits of augmented reality
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:32.800]   without asking them to make that risk saying, please give us $600.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.760]   We promise you that you won't wind up keeping this thing in a drawer.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:45.720]   I wonder though, if one of the limiting factors is people's unwillingness to wear bulky head
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:49.520]   gear, cars can just throw up a picture of the mirror, which we've actually had on the
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:55.080]   new screensavers, the mirror prism, which is an augmented reality that uses your iPhone
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:57.040]   and the iPhone camera.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:04.280]   But I really wonder, I mean, these things make you look dopey, glassy, real public.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.920]   If they look like Raybans, yeah, but remember, you've got to put a lot of processing power
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.920]   in there.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.360]   I think one of the reasons Microsoft has said we're not going to really offer HoloLens
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:18.880]   till 2019 is because battery and processor cannot be miniaturized to the point where
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.520]   it could easily fit in normal looking glasses.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:26.800]   And I think that Apple may be taking an approach that is closer to using your phone as your
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.680]   outboard computer.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:35.560]   So the display information is really being figured out here, but you need an iPhone to
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.560]   actually run the glasses.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.520]   Oh, that wouldn't be so bad.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:43.400]   If I had, in other words, something like AirPods except in your glasses and then that's connected
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.000]   to an iPhone in your pocket.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   That wouldn't be so bad.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Well, look at the rules.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   Go ahead.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.760]   My idea is that what if Apple were to create a product called AirPods with video?
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:54:00.240]   Where there is just, just like there's a little pipe going down this way that has the intent
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.240]   of the microphone.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:05.080]   There's also a little pipe going that way that is like having up almost like having
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.600]   just like a golf pencil behind your ear.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.120]   So it's not, it is, it can see what you're seeing, but it doesn't necessarily put a
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:13.600]   screen in front of your eyes.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:17.640]   You have to wear something, something dorky like Google Glass or HoloLens, but it will
[00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:22.520]   say, okay, you are, you are on 7th Avenue, you're facing north, you need to turn right
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.640]   at the next, at the next, at the next stop.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:29.640]   Or, oh, the, the, the, the story you're looking for is three blocks that way.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:38.000]   Or the, if facial, facial recognition that this person is your uncle, uncle Shlomo that
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.240]   you haven't seen in three years.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:43.040]   Oh, by the way, he insulted your hat the last time you saw him try not to.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.160]   So, so, so don't give, don't give him anything he can use against you.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.240]   That's your,
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.320]   Air, AirPods can do some of that now.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:51.000]   Like AirPods could tell you turn left, go straight.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.480]   I mean, AR is going to be a multi sensory experience.
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:55:00.160]   I think that the, the brilliance of, of the 20 teens, like if multi touch was the brilliant
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:06.960]   change of G.O.I. in the first decade of the 2000s, the idea of a computer that I can control
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:10.960]   without looking at anything without touching anything, all the different ways you can express
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:15.360]   and articulate that be it a smart home speaker, be it a wearable thing with a, with a camera
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:19.080]   on it, the idea that I can go about my day doing whatever I want.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:24.720]   I don't have to use a piece of glass as my go between, between myself and the real world
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:25.720]   anymore.
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:30.800]   I actually, and to, to get to your question from a minute ago, I think that people aren't
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.120]   going to be willing to put this, these things on their faces until there is something that
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:38.320]   is so good and they, they just don't want to be without it.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:42.080]   And I don't think that that's something that AR can provide right now.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.420]   I do, I do still, I do still use my Google glass, believe it or not.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:51.200]   There are times where I really do want to be able to have a camera like right here to
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.760]   take pictures and video as I go.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.660]   Oftentimes if I'm going on a long bike ride, for instance, I'll have Google glass on partly
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:02.360]   to see the person who just tried to kill me with his, with his car, but also because
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:03.360]   you still wear it?
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.360]   You have one?
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.260]   I, I, not every, not every day, but it gets charged up.
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:13.880]   I, to be fair, I usually use it with a external battery like plugged in and trailing to, to
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:17.380]   a battery pack, someplace else, because the battery life, yeah, I mean, if you can't really
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:19.340]   wear it on a regular basis.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:20.340]   But yeah, there are some times.
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.340]   And what do you have on the screen?
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.340]   What are you looking at?
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.020]   Usually it's just feedback.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:26.020]   Sometimes it's navigation stuff.
[00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:30.260]   If I'm doing something that's kind of challenging, but it's mostly answers to questions such
[00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.460]   as where is, where is super deli navigator?
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:35.460]   That's really interesting.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:36.460]   Right.
[00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:42.780]   But also, but also I come, I don't know whether I'm meeting someplace at place X or place
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.880]   wise, so I can bring up a calendar.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:49.000]   Sometimes I will have a thought and I will slow down at a flat stretch where there's no
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.080]   real traffic and say, take a note and then create a note.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.120]   But also, again, sometimes you're just, you're just walking around or you're just riding
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:02.040]   around and you just want to take a picture just to remind yourself of something you saw
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.880]   without having to stop, take out your phone, flip open an app, do stuff like this.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:10.480]   That's not that even though it's only a 30 to 45 second process, that's not the importance
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:11.480]   of what I'm doing right now.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:16.280]   I just want to remember that really cool thing that I saw so I can come back to it later on.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:23.480]   So I'm talking about only wearing it maybe twice a month when those situations come up.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:28.340]   I'll also admit that a lot of what I use it for could be taken care of if it's just a
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:33.200]   simple voice operated high definition camera that can clip to my sunglasses or my regular
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.200]   glasses.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.800]   But it just goes to show you that there's all kinds of ways to implement this.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.840]   I don't think that Google Glass necessarily failure.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.200]   I think it was a research project that led to a lot of interesting observations about
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:50.320]   how we can be using computers, but we can't because we don't have the technology yet.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.720]   We may be saying the same thing about hollow lens too.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:57.160]   I mean, I think all of these are just early.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.160]   Experiments.
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:07.160]   Renee, if you could have the perfect Pokemon go set up with augmented reality like a more
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.520]   sophisticated augmented reality fitted that maybe glasses or something.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:13.880]   It's ironic because I was thinking about this because there's Pokemon Go Fest in Chicago
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.720]   this Saturday where there's going to be thousands of people out there doing the same time.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:19.720]   That'd be so fun.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.520]   I'll be there if there's any Mac break week.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.520]   Oh, good.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:23.520]   I want to meet up.
[00:58:23.520 --> 00:58:24.520]   I will be there all day.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:26.560]   But yeah, right now there's going to be a lot of people.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:28.760]   And I just like this because I play when I'm out.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.640]   I go for long walks and it keeps me busy because walking sometimes is very monotonous.
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:37.440]   And I would love it if I just had sort of like the Google glasses thing where it just appeared
[00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:41.440]   on my glasses and I could see it and I could do air interactions or whatever it was.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.840]   And I had some sort of wristband that coordinated what I was doing.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.040]   For the computer to disappear, that's what makes it really real.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.840]   That's what makes it immersive and puts you in that world.
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:51.600]   And I don't want to be our experience for that because that's a fake world.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.280]   I just want this stuff brought into my world.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.680]   I guess I'm lazy like that.
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:56.000]   I want it all brought to me.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.680]   And if you we could have some combination of AirPods and glasses and whatever it is
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   in your hands or your arms.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.720]   Maybe your Apple watch does all that for you.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   That would be ideal.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.720]   And not just for Pokemon Go.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:10.600]   I mean, that's early stage like Andy said, really beginning stage of this stuff, but
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:15.160]   for all the things and all the sort of gaming and all the education and navigation and things
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.320]   to come.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.680]   This is cool.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.040]   It's sold out, unfortunately.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.280]   Pokemon Gofest Saturday.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.640]   I'm going to press past things.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:24.800]   I'll be there covering the event.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.800]   The Grant Park.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.360]   So this is this is official.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:32.640]   This is sponsored by a Niantic, I guess, or yeah.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:39.120]   And they're going to have special Pokemon that have never been seen before in Grant Park.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:43.040]   It's super interesting because the way it works is that the people at the event will
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.840]   do certain things that unlock things for everyone around the world.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:50.000]   So for example, if you catch more grass types, you'll unlock a Stardust bonus for everyone
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000]   in the world.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   For everybody.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   Yeah, for everybody.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.440]   But then the more they catch in the rest of the world, the longer that bonus lasts for.
[00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:00.720]   So if they forget what the numbers are, but if they don't do this on Saturday at wherever
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.720]   they are.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:02.720]   Absolutely.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.040]   And then if they catch enough, it triggers another bonus back in Chicago where you get
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:09.560]   a, it's called a mystery challenge and people are assuming that's going to be like a legendary
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560]   raid or something.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.080]   Oh, they're clever in how they're putting this together.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   This is brilliant.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:15.240]   Special Pokey stops.
[01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.520]   They've done this for Ingress in the past.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.520]   So this is just sort of a point.
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:22.640]   And I think that was, I think that was the thing that they did the exact opposite of Google
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:29.360]   Glass, which is that Niantic started with something that was fairly geeky with being Ingress
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:34.800]   and then figured out all the details, got a lot of bits and pieces worked out and then
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.000]   rolled it out to everyone.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.240]   And I think that that's part of why Pokemon's been so successful.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:42.880]   I think it would have been hard to do without Ingress.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.960]   And unless you think that this is something for, you know, nerdy fanboys, sponsorships
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:55.040]   on this sprint and boost mobile are allowing their customers in an hour early.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:01:01.480]   And the hotels, the host hotels are the Fairmont, the Swiss Hotel, the Kimpton, the Blackstone,
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.520]   the W Chicago and the Hyatt Regency.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.080]   This is clearly, this is seen as an upscale event.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080]   How interesting.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.200]   Oh, when I, when I go to the US because we don't have it here, Starbucks is a sponsor
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:16.320]   and almost every Starbucks you go in and you see this giant picture of a Pikachu latte
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.000]   or whatever it's called.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000]   Wow.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   Wow.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.200]   Well, how fun a Pokefest.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.200]   Thank you.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200]   And hopefully a lot.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.200]   So hope they'll be a lot of great.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.000]   Well, look for Renee Richie.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Yep.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.200]   I'll be out there and they want the press.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.640]   Like it's funny because the press thing is like they're going to immerse you.
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.800]   They want you to have the whole experience.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:33.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.800]   And this is why they're doing it.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:35.800]   They want the press, obviously.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.560]   I mean, it's, it's a, it sounds like he's like an embedded press in a military operation.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.800]   You're going to get the special helmet, the whole thing.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.600]   Just stay out of the line of fire and Richie.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.600]   We don't want to hurt anybody.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.000]   I just wonder that I might like escalate the geekiness.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.640]   Cause I would like, if it'll be like mainstream press in me, like the Wall Street Journal
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:58.920]   sends like a very traditional reporter and I'm out there just like duck rolling and diving
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.920]   to the bushes.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.040]   What kind of looks that I'll get might be funny, but I'll regret nothing.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:07.960]   Oh, Renee, I do, I do own like an actual like tactical press vist that I haven't used
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   in like five years.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.880]   It's adjustable, but I really watch.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:15.040]   I would, I would love to have a picture of you wearing this at this event, like as a combat
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.040]   reporter.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.240]   But I'm just thinking like we're going to have GPS running all day, data running all
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240]   day, the screen on all day.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:25.520]   So I'm bringing like two of those giant multi packs, a bunch of cables, just everything
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.840]   imaginable for like long term embedded.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.840]   Wow.
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:33.400]   At a trunching tool, a shelter half, five days.
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.840]   I'm telling you, a pit helmet, satellite phone.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.320]   This is going to be amazing.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.800]   I'll be like Alex when he's about to assemble a video rig.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.800]   Wow.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:43.800]   Is this going to be?
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.800]   This is going to be amazing.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.360]   One man mobile unit news unit.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.960]   Now, apparently the concern is that Grant Park is not known for its data.
[01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.280]   Apparently, no, and the Wi-Fi has a low cap.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.120]   So hopefully they're reinforcing all that.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:59.480]   Oh, I guarantee you they're going to be, they'll be trucks out there and all that.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:01.480]   Wow.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.480]   Hopefully.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.480]   Wow.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.680]   Did you see Georgia Dao's magic car Pat?
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.160]   She wore that on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.240]   She has a hat that's a Pokemon.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.080]   I have a Tyrannotear one, but I don't have it with him sadly.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.160]   Her son stole it from me.
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:20.400]   I showed it.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.400]   This is great.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.400]   I love it.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.400]   I showed it.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.400]   I brought to you by WordPress.com.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.880]   I am a thrilled and very happy customer.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.400]   For years, I used WordPress self-hosted.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.200]   And I got, I'll be honest with you.
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.360]   I was spending more time tweaking the software, updating the software than I was actually blogging.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.160]   And I'm thrilled to go to WordPress.com because it's hosted.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.240]   So that means WordPress runs it.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.240]   You're on their servers.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.960]   They keep you up to date.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.520]   There's a great community there.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.640]   It's all the WordPress you love, but much easier to use.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:56.360]   Create your stunning website, whether it's a personal blog, a business site, or both,
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.800]   at WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.120]   You don't have to have any experience.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.320]   It's easy to do.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:03.480]   They have hundreds of themes to get you started.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.080]   You pick a template, you make it your own.
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.680]   But if you're a pro, of course, the developer platform is phenomenal.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.000]   I'm using my, my template is 2017, which is easy to remember.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.120]   Because I wanted full bleed images from our show.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.880]   So I have a kind of a rotating series of images.
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.280]   And then I post my articles here.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.600]   And I just, it's so nice to be back on WordPress.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.320]   It just works so well.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.120]   All your, you see the links to social media.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.840]   All my tweets are automatically imported as are my Instagram images.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:39.360]   When people visit one of my pages, read one of my articles, they can share it easily.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:41.280]   They can comment on it easily.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.760]   WordPress has great anti-spam filtering.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.920]   They're very famous for that.
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:49.720]   And you see how easy it is for them to share it on Twitter or Facebook or Google or like
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720]   it.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.360]   And it can get you up on the front page of WordPress.com, which means you're going to
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.640]   get a heck of a lot more traffic.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:01.600]   It really is the best way to host your content.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:04.960]   I want you to go to WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.440]   We're going to give you 15% off your new website.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.360]   Find out why 28%.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:15.560]   28% of all websites run on WordPress.
[01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:20.480]   Many of the biggest publications in the world are running on WordPress.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.680]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:27.800]   I'm a tip of the hat to all the WordPress guys that people are automatic.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.480]   I am Mount Malloweg.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.160]   I love WordPress.
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.440]   They made great stuff and it's just getting better all the time.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.600]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.320]   That's my home on the internet.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.440]   You should consider making it yours.
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.880]   And by the way, my blog is at leoloports.com.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.600]   You'll notice HTTPS automatically added.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.600]   What else?
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.600]   Oh, I get to AMP.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.800]   Yeah, that's us in the Acropolis.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.800]   There you go.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.600]   That's a sof-potable photo.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:03.640]   You know what I did order books from our last trip.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:09.240]   I got Google Photos book and Google Photos books aren't particularly slick.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.280]   You can't add text and stuff.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.520]   But their claim, their differentiator is that they use AI.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:19.160]   So you just say make a book and it will automatically pick images.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.320]   So your book is kind of done.
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.600]   You can just tweak it if you want.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.960]   I actually got a very nice book.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.800]   The printing's very good.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.880]   I tried another company called ZNO.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.320]   I brought these in on iOS today that does lay flat books for pros.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.320]   They're beautiful.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   And it's gorgeous.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.200]   Yeah, really nice job.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.440]   I've got to do one with Apple Photos though.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.840]   I promise I'll do that.
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.880]   So I'll compare them.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:45.880]   Have you guys ever made books?
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:46.880]   I do.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.880]   I used to do them a year for people.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:51.640]   Yeah, I made my first Google Photos book just to try it out.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.000]   And it just reminded me of how cool it is to like photos.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.320]   I've been looking at like for years and years and years.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:03.240]   But when you have them just like in an actual book that you can flip through, maybe it's
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.320]   just because I'm of that generation that that grew up with paper books.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.160]   That's like, look, legitimacy.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.160]   Isn't it cool?
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:12.440]   I can see these things at such wonderful resolution and stuff.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.760]   Yeah, I really do.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.400]   I have to say I like it.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.200]   Let me just show you.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.000]   So I had made it.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   I'm sorry WordPress.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   WordPress.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   I interrupted.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   No, we're done with WordPress.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   We've moved up.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   Okay.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.960]   And we did a shared photo album.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.480]   So Lisa's pictures are in here along with my pictures.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.720]   And then you put in maps and captions and stuff like that.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:39.760]   So this became like the full blown every picture that we cared about from our trip.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.880]   And then if you want to make a book, it's a really easy thing to do.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:50.080]   You just go to create photo book and then you choose $10 or $20.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.080]   I actually made a hardcover.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.600]   But it only gives you 20 pages for that price.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.960]   You're going to pay for additional pages.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.440]   Let me make a software.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.000]   But you know, this is a big to 100, right?
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.480]   It makes you wonder what the internal logic is.
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:04.840]   Good photo, not good photo, not good photo, good photo.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.520]   I'll tell you one thing I noticed that they like people.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:12.800]   So for instance, on our trip, really, because it's much a peachy and the Galapagos, we had
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   a lot of non-people pictures, but they prefer the people pictures.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:20.200]   So I added more landscape pictures, but they, these are all the pics.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.120]   This is totally automated.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.040]   And I think that they did a pretty good job.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.640]   I mean, you might want to add or subtract.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.840]   They made 100 page books, but I think they did a pretty good job.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.480]   And there are animal pictures in here.
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.680]   It's not like they chew them completely.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.040]   It is kind of humbling.
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:36.040]   It is kind of humbling.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.880]   Like this book is, this book was not automatically created.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.600]   I selected like all the pictures in this.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:42.960]   And so I thought it came out really well.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.400]   And then I did another one that I didn't actually print, but I had it automatically
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.640]   generate one.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:50.320]   And I can't say that I like the automatically generated one as much as I like the one that
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:54.200]   took me like hours to put together to select photos from.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:00.080]   But it's like it disturbs me that this is about 80 to 85% as good.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:06.160]   I think it's a goal of saying that I want my aunt or my sister isn't really on Google
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:11.080]   photos, but I want to share like how good like my holiday was or my Christmas was with
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.080]   my kids.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.920]   So I'm just going to click one button to have it generate an album, look through it to make
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.840]   sure there's nothing nasty in that, click another button to have it automatically printed
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.280]   and sent to my sister or my aunt.
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.640]   Like, okay, that's pretty good.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.760]   I'll tell you what, it's every bit as good as like those albums.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.920]   Remember in the old days when you get the little squares, I mean, it's everybody as good
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.920]   as that.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.560]   When my mom sold her house, we took a bunch of photos from that location and put it together
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.900]   into a book with her because we knew that would even though she would know that house
[01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:36.760]   anymore, she would always have that book to look back on.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.760]   And she really liked it.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.760]   How does it now?
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:42.400]   Part of it is that different companies use different providers.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.960]   Nobody does it by themselves.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.320]   They're all going to somebody else.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:47.120]   Tim Cook is not their assembling your book.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.440]   I think Apple's always chosen very good providers.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.840]   It's my sense of it.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:56.760]   I've taken, I've taken, I've printed a couple books with the Apple service and they've all
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.280]   come out really well and they are huge crowd pleasers.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.440]   It's always, you know, I took one of my, when my son got born, I took one and sent it to
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:08.800]   the parents, you know, and sent them a book because my parents were much more likely to,
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:14.440]   both parents on both sides would be much more likely to look at the book and also, you know,
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:19.280]   Arlene and I went out for a, on a vacation years ago and took it all and it was great.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   I put it together.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   She couldn't figure out why I was getting up early in the morning.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:26.360]   I literally put it together during the vacation and ordered it in like a week, you know, a
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:30.280]   couple days after we landed, there was a book there of the vacation.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:34.080]   And so it's, it's a, it's a, it's a great service.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:38.080]   If you were a pro, you probably, for instance, wouldn't want to use the Google photos because
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.800]   the backgrounds are white, right?
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:46.600]   You might want to use something with a black or a gray background, right?
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:47.960]   Or a full awful bleed.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.120]   The ZNO is awful bleed, which is nice.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:57.200]   I think Blurb does a very good job as well, but it's a lot harder to create because I
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.400]   have ever done these books.
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:03.400]   It's a lot harder to make a Blurb book.
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:09.600]   Lulu will let you do books that you can sell.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.680]   Does anybody have a strong preference or just just go with Apple makes it easy.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.160]   I just use what I just have all my photos in Apple's.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.160]   Right.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.160]   You're a good photo.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:19.120]   If you have all your stuff in Google photos, then you can use that.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.120]   Right.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.120]   Right.
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.120]   Right.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:25.040]   Blurb does have an iOS app or a, I mean, maybe it's a Mac app.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.640]   It looks like it's a Mac app.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.280]   So at least that would save some time.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.280]   I mean, you could, you could do your own printmaking and do this, you know, the real part way.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.280]   Sure.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.280]   What the easy?
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.280]   This is so much easier.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:39.280]   So much easier.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:46.840]   Apple is, if you live in New York City and you're a con ed customer, Apple is doing a
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.040]   test, I guess.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   I don't know.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:55.080]   Apple's home kit tied in with Think Eco Smart AC and Homebridge and you can control your
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.120]   air conditioner.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.400]   This is, this is an article from Apple Insider.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.400]   I don't.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.520]   I said, hold on a city.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.040]   I said, hold on.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.160]   It's a con ed program called the Smart AC Pro.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:13.480]   Always a problem in the major metros with air conditioning.
[01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.320]   And they just, I cannot go below 69 sir.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:16.320]   I cannot do it.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.320]   Do it.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:23.160]   So if you're a con ed customer, the Wi-Fi, you have a window air conditioner, you'll
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:28.840]   be, and what they're going to send you is a kit that works with Apple's home kit.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:34.240]   Just a public service announcement from this station and the advertising council.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.520]   And when we're doing the air kit and HomeKit, then it'll be fun.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520]   That would be cool.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:44.720]   You know, the definitely the way we use electronics in houses is incredibly inefficient when you
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:46.800]   start actually measuring all of those things.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.200]   And so there is this revolution that's coming that keeps track of all of that and makes
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.040]   sure that nothing that is doesn't need to be running is running.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.560]   And so I think that that makes a lot of sense in trying to figure out a way to take, rather
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.280]   than just replace everybody's air conditioners with something smarter, figuring out a way
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:05.720]   to turn them on and off does seem to make sense.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:12.200]   You know, I guess my question when I read that was, are they, do you just leave the air conditioner
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.280]   and just tell it to go to 50?
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:18.080]   You know, like, like, always on.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.160]   And then the phone or the device then decides what temperature it is.
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:25.280]   It seems like just want to set it as low as it can go.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.280]   Right.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:27.720]   So just when it turns on, it just goes, okay, I'm on.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:31.040]   And then I get to 68 degrees or 72 degrees or what.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.240]   I think they suggested 74.
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.280]   I was like, what house have you a bit?
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   I'm going to set my, that's not air conditioning.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.560]   That's not air normalizing.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:47.160]   Well, if it's 98 outside with 100% humidity, 74 is probably pretty, pretty nice.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.800]   That's a problem with the setup of the app, Alex.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:55.520]   Unless you choose a height, weight, male, female or orchid, I think you have it set to
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.520]   orchid.
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.880]   He said to one of the human types.
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:13:59.880]   Exactly.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:03.760]   And he's like, a lot of times, NASA spent a lot of time figuring this out.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.360]   And I think it's 64 degrees.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.360]   Set it by Kelvin.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:13.080]   I guess Conant has had in the past programs that let them control the AC.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:18.880]   Yeah, I make a project telling us in the chatroom is when his father began to suffer
[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.440]   from Alzheimer's, he authorized Conant to control his AC.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.800]   He said when it, when there were power supply issues, you know, when the, the grid's to
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:32.320]   get overloaded, he said it got to a hundred, two degrees in his bedroom.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.120]   So that's like, that's just turning it off, I think.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.680]   And what, and what is managing as AC?
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.680]   Mismanaging it.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:41.520]   What's interesting now in California is is that we're, you know, of course, we're in
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.000]   an issue where we're making too much power.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:47.480]   We're literally paying other states to take our power off the grid because of solar in
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480]   a lot of ways.
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:55.160]   And well, it's cheaper to turn solar off and scale down than it is to turn natural gas
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.920]   off or coal off or whatever.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:02.360]   So, so the, but I think it's fascinating that we may be able to start reacting because on
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:06.520]   really, really hot days, there's a high probability that we're going to be generating a lot of
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:11.000]   solar electricity at the same time, not always, but, but I think that that's going to be a
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.080]   interesting thing where the, where we're actually, our power supply is actually reacting to the
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.080]   environment.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.360]   Oh, very as opposed to just trying to work against it.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.840]   Apple wants every hospital patient to have an iPad, not for entertainment, but for their
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:28.760]   Vitals, this is an article by Sarah Burr in TechCrunch.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.880]   She says she went down to take a tour of Cedars-Sinai's pilot programming.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.360]   It allows patients direct access to their Vitals, their care team and educational tools through
[01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:40.920]   the iPad.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:43.520]   Interesting.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:48.000]   There are other hospitals already using it, including the Jacobs Medical Center at UC
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.680]   San Diego Metro South Medical Center in Chicago.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.640]   Cedars-Sinai's been doing this for a year.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:57.440]   They have their custom software, MyCS link, which allows patients to look up their information
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:01.800]   online, including notes from their doctors.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.560]   So this is, this is kind of cool.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:11.520]   And also, according to Cedars, reduces errors, transcription errors or doctor error.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:16.280]   I had a relative in hospital last week that I was visiting a lot and it was, it was not
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280]   good.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.480]   Like the surgery was good, but the post stuff, they gave them a packet of recommendations
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.680]   and the recommendations were wrong.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.680]   I said, you know, don't eat anything.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.680]   They're like, oh, that's outdated.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.680]   We want you to eat something.
[01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.520]   And I said, don't do this for three days.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.520]   And I said, no, no, that's wrong.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.520]   It's two days.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.520]   And they never corrected it.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:33.160]   And they never, there was different nursing staff that gave them different instructions.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.400]   They said, well, we're not going to give you pain meds until you've asked for them.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.040]   Another one said, well, we're supposed to be giving it to you.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.040]   And it was just a mess.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:40.560]   And I can't help but think because I have a relative who works in the hospital, it is
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.680]   all in on the iPhones, iPads and Apple watches.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:47.760]   And it seems like that system is in way better harmony is way more up to date and actually
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.080]   does better informed consent and better patient empowerment than any of these sort of old
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.080]   outdated.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.280]   This hospital I went to last week didn't even have Wi-Fi.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.000]   And it's, you know, I don't know, you know, 20 to 2017 now.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.040]   So I can't help but think that this is a great way to just sort of empower everybody
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040]   in that process.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:07.680]   In the neonatal unit, the, the preemies who are not able to visit with their parents because
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.600]   the, their immune systems aren't complete are baby timing.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:16.000]   They're using FaceTime to, for parents to visit with their newborns, if they're sick
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.160]   or premature and have to be kept isolated.
[01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:25.160]   I mean, that's the session of the importance of having access to the internet and a device
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:30.920]   in the room is just if you've never had a family member who's had like a serious illness
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:31.920]   like that.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:36.280]   I mean, my, my dad was, had a stroke and was in the nursing home for a year and a half.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.840]   That was a few years ago.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:44.560]   But the ability for me to bring in a computer that had my own like AT&T Wi-Fi dongle on
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.560]   it.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.920]   And so he can still visit his friends and visit his family.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:54.280]   Though they can't come 300 miles to come see him, the ability to, a friend of mine was
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.200]   also telling me about how one of the best things he bought for the room of one of his
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:04.080]   best friends who was, had a terminal illness was, was an Amazon Echo because she couldn't
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:05.080]   get out of bed.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:11.280]   She couldn't really operate things, but she could simply say, Hey, Alia, you know, play
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.480]   my Beatles albums.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.280]   And now she's listened to her Beatles music instead of whatever is on Fox News on the
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.600]   television set that's bolted to the wall.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:19.960]   Oh, yeah, that's true.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.400]   Having that, you know, lockdown TV is.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.680]   So, so we're talking, so we're talking about the importance of having patient records and
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:30.960]   having notes from medical professionals between them and also between the patient to be important.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:35.000]   But we're also talking about this is a window to the outside that people were in the hospital
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   desperately need.
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.600]   It's a, it's a non, it's a non-trivial problem.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:42.120]   I was talking to the folks at that nursing home saying, well, if you'd like, I will buy
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.320]   you, I will buy you Wi-Fi gear so that you can have for visitors.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.360]   And they said, and they, they set it up and down and up and down and they said that they
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.040]   would love the don't, the donation is great, but the amount of money they'd have to spend
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:57.480]   to certify that they're not introducing a vulnerability to.
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480]   Exactly.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:04.280]   And that's, that's another reason why sometimes one database that's used to track medications
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:09.560]   is not allowed to track, to talk to another database that is, is for instructions to
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:14.440]   patients, instructions to other people, because it's one has, one is an old database that
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.440]   hasn't been certified.
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:17.360]   The other one is new and it's perfectly good.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.360]   So it's not about people not getting it, but it really is at some point you have to close,
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:25.280]   at some point you have to get rid of the asbestos, even though it's a huge problem.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.080]   Similarly, the internet infrastructure, as Renee is saying, at some point you have to
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.040]   recognize that this is affecting patient care.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.280]   This is affecting outcomes of surgery and healthcare.
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.640]   And at some point you have to say, okay, we have to do a full audit.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:43.160]   We've got to find whatever money we have to find in order to make this happen.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.360]   Interesting article in Apple Insider about, well, it's adblock.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.280]   The developers of adblock.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:54.120]   Actually, I guess this came to, it was originally from MacRumors.
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:55.400]   So let me give credit where credit's due.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:20:04.920]   MacRumors, FutureMind, which makes adblock, adblocking program for the iPhone, had their
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:12.200]   app rejected by the review board because, according to FutureMind CTO Thomas Kapersky,
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:20.440]   Apple's no longer allowing VPN root certificate based adblockers to be sold in the app store.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.080]   After submitting an appeal to the app review board, a member of the review team contacted
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:29.720]   me directly by phone and informed me that Apple has officially changed their policy regarding
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:33.880]   VPN root certificate based adblockers.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:39.160]   The officially allowed adblocking method is now Safari content blockers and that's it.
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:41.560]   I don't think that's a bad move.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.920]   I don't think that was new either.
[01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:47.400]   They've been blocking things that were potentially invo- it's again the potential for abuse of
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.400]   these things.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.360]   And once you start using VPNs and they can sort of man in the middle anything that they
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.360]   want to do.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.360]   That's the real problem.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.240]   It becomes a man in the middle possibility, exactly right.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:03.360]   And if you're using Safari and an iOS device, why wouldn't you just download it one of the
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:04.360]   things that you're using?
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.480]   Some of them have been bought and are owned by countries that may not have your best interest
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:11.480]   in mind and they insert their own ads instead of the ads that they're blocking and it's
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.480]   and they can change dynamically.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.200]   So it's not like they can say, okay, you're a good one.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.360]   That good one could become a bad one with a flip of a server switch.
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.280]   Right.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.480]   There are more things you can do with VPN based content blockers, but it does require a man
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.880]   in the middle in effect.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:31.040]   And so, you know, that's a fair, that's a fair trade, I think less, less effective ad
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:34.520]   blocking, but more security.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.640]   I think the guitar, the Safari content blockers, they're more than just ad blockers.
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.600]   You can set them to, if you don't like web fonts, for example, if web fonts are draining
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:44.040]   your data and you're in a data-starved area, you can say block, there's all sorts of things
[01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:45.040]   you can do with them.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:48.440]   And I think they cut out the majority of what you want to cut out with an ad blocker
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   anyway.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:51.440]   No, I agree.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:54.200]   I think this is a very sensible decision.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:56.640]   Free beats.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.400]   Free beats are back.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.400]   Free beats, baby.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.400]   Free beats, baby.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   Everybody.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.680]   If you're going back to school, you get a choice.
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:09.880]   If you buy a Mac or an iPad Pro, you get a choice of a free pair of Beats Solo 3, Beats
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.120]   X or Power Beats 3 headphones.
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:17.360]   If you're a student, a parent, a student or an educator, if you buy the Mac with education,
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:19.760]   pricing for limited time, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.080]   They've done this every year, right, to back school.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:24.560]   Well, since they bought Beats, right?
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.560]   Right.
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.560]   It's a good thing to do.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.840]   And iTunes gift card or something like that, forget what it's going to do.
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:32.840]   It has been.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.920]   Well, it's already on.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:41.360]   In September 25th, 2017, started last week.
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:44.840]   You do have to verify.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:49.400]   So don't try to trick them to get your free headphones, kids.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.520]   Well, such thing as a free beats lunch.
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.520]   That's not okay.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.800]   At least trick them into giving you better headphones than beats.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:23:01.600]   If you're going to steal something good, steal something with some treble.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:09.400]   iOS 11 beta 2 came out for the public beta, if you want.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.160]   I didn't notice a lot of differences.
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:14.440]   Frankly, I thought beta 1, the first beta was very stable.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:18.400]   There's all kinds of new stuff.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:25.360]   One thing that we talked about on iOS today is in this new content switcher thing, before
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.320]   you had to press and hold to delete recents.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:31.320]   Now you can just swipe them away like the old days.
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.920]   It's the same as developer beta 3.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:36.400]   So people wearing developer beta 3, it's essentially the same as public.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.400]   Oh, okay.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.840]   I assume that we're one behind on the public.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:42.560]   No, you're at the same.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:44.880]   It took longer to get the first beta out.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.760]   So 3dav is too public.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.760]   Okay.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   Okay.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.200]   And have we gone to 4dav?
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.200]   No, not yet.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.200]   No.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.200]   So we're all in parity now.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.760]   I'm as good as any developer out there.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.080]   What else is tested with developers?
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:00.760]   If we don't scream, then they put it on the public.
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.040]   What else is new in this new release?
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:05.040]   Anything else I should.
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:07.880]   I start to lose track of what's new, but there are things like some of the stuff that
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.560]   people are noticing, for example, is you can no longer do the 3d touch to swipe backwards.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.400]   I don't know if that's because it's hard to implement on unannounced products that are
[01:24:15.400 --> 01:24:16.600]   coming our way in September.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.920]   So it's just either gone or under redevelopment.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:23.440]   There's also, you can also, there's a button for what's using the storage on your iPhone
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.440]   you can look into.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:28.080]   And there's all sorts of really neat little touches on it.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.880]   Apparently, you can stack selections.
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.560]   Evan Dunn saying, okay, grab one, hold it, then tap others.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.160]   Oh, I see.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160]   I have to say that--
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   And you're a step.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.960]   But it's, in some ways, I'm pleased to see that Apple is responding to the user feedback
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:50.680]   in this beta because I think that was one of the big complaints about the new control
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.040]   center is you can swipe away.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.600]   And so that's showing that it's not so done that they can't make minor tweaks.
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.360]   Yeah, they did that before.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.720]   Like when iOS 7 came out and it was just incredibly too light, they made it a little
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:04.720]   bit beefier.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:07.800]   And now they've gone, I think, sometimes a little bit too bold in the new version.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.800]   Right.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:09.800]   But they're definitely--
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:10.800]   I didn't like that super thin stuff.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.800]   I have to say--
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:12.800]   No, it was way too thin.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:16.000]   It's legible.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.680]   We should mention that probably the reason that Apple didn't make it that easy to remove
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:23.880]   recences because there's really no point in doing it.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:28.880]   It doesn't-- it doesn't-- Apple automatically is shutting things down in the background,
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:29.880]   you know, pretty quickly.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.040]   And also, those are spaces now.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:33.040]   Those are supposed to be like the Mac version of space as well.
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040]   Oh, no.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.200]   You have these desktop arrangements that you created.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:39.640]   So you always use Safari and Notes, for example, and you always use maybe messages
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:40.640]   and Slack.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.120]   So it keeps those popular arrangements for you, so you can go back to them without having
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.600]   to rebuild them each time.
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.960]   But don't worry, they're not running in the background.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:51.760]   No, it's got-- it has a thing called Jetson, which is a process that goes through and destroys
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.400]   things that are requiring too much resources in the background.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   That's a shame.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:01.480]   I got to say, you guys are tempting me into installing this latest beta on my 12.9.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:06.920]   I would say at this point, if you have a pro, I can't think of a good reason not to.
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:09.560]   I mean, I presume-- well, I can think of a couple.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:10.560]   One is--
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:11.560]   Any beta is potentially dangerous.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:16.040]   There's always that risk, but there's also some apps that won't work anymore.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:21.160]   I guess I feel like with my pro, I feel like this is the moment when I bought it.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:23.720]   I haven't really put a lot on it that I'm worried about.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:24.920]   This is the time to play with it.
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:26.760]   So I just have the beta running.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.600]   Actually, you know, it just gives me an opportunity to run with it.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.800]   It's great how the brain will let you do whatever-- will justify whatever it is you
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:38.160]   want to do because I'm thinking the exact opposite, saying, "I use my Macbook.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.200]   I use my iPad Pro every single day.
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.240]   It's my productivity thing."
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.040]   And these are features that increase the productivity features of the 12.9.
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.640]   So I should definitely be using these things.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:53.040]   I'm going to solve the beta because the iPad Pro is the important part of my work.
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.720]   It's made for the pro, and I wanted to see these new features.
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:59.760]   And I have to say, at least for me, it's stable enough.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:03.080]   I suppose there are some people who might suffer data loss from app development.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.920]   I always made a three on my phone has been worse than beta two.
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.200]   My iPad has been fine, but on my phone has been worse.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.360]   And again, because there's just so many different settings and it really is butterfly effect
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.880]   now, where it depends on so many different little things you have on every device that
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.720]   it's hard to guess in advance.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.920]   Yeah, I don't know if I'd recommend it for the phone.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:26.920]   I think really the only-- the strongest argument is to do it on a iPad Pro because you want
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.320]   to take advantage of those features in the iPad Pro.
[01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:31.680]   Also, a bit of perspective.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.560]   If my iPad locks up, oh no, I'll have to use my notebook.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.400]   If my phone locks up, that means that I can't use Lyft to get home.
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.040]   I can't call somebody.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.200]   I can't for an emergency.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.760]   I can't get into my banking app to make an important transfer or fund.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:49.320]   Yeah, so be really, really paranoid about phones.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:54.280]   Not this year, but last year at WDA, I installed the beta immediately and lost data for I think
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.640]   six hours until I get to think of it.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:59.600]   And I was walking through this and just go, couldn't do anything.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:03.080]   Just trying to reboot and do everything good to get data.
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.080]   Well, don't be me.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:09.240]   We wondered why it hadn't happened before, but now it has.
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:13.880]   Apple has apparently hired security specifically to prevent--
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.240]   Are they real guns?
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.280]   Are they real guns?
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.280]   Drones from flying over Apple Park.
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:23.160]   This is my last Apple Park video.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.600]   I'm not sure I should look and see which one.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.600]   Come on, man, fight the power.
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.680]   Fight the power.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.320]   This is drone one media's version.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:39.320]   He's saying this is my last one because security guards are coming for us.
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:40.920]   This kind of makes sense.
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.560]   I was surprised they allowed it at all, but it makes sense that Apple, once people start
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.600]   moving in, really don't want drones flying into the circle.
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:55.000]   High-sided launch phase took a while to get active, Leo.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.280]   It is pretty complete looking at this.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.400]   When all the solar panels are in the circle is completed, plantings are-- it looks like
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.560]   completed.
[01:29:02.560 --> 01:29:09.400]   There are a few trucks still in the middle, finishing landscaping.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:12.920]   Even though my hover app gave the all clear and I was across the street from Apple Park,
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:16.440]   a security officer approached me while I was flying.
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:19.280]   So, all right.
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:22.200]   Number five, find out where that drone's coming from.
[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:27.760]   He informed me his job was to spot drones and call the cops on anyone flying them.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.200]   I think it kind of makes sense because you could peer right into somebody's window at
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.200]   this point.
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.200]   There are a lot of people in there.
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.200 --> 01:29:39.200]   The thing is, I don't know this situation.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:45.640]   I've been in situations like that as a photographer and it has taken-- it took me a few years
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:48.400]   to-- yeah, he was nice and so, I guess.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.200]   But I mean, land my drone and leave without contacting authorities.
[01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:58.840]   I've been in New York City and taken pictures of beautiful architectural sculptures on the
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:02.400]   sides of buildings and someone looks at security articles.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:05.000]   I'm sort of going to ask you to not take pictures of the building.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.520]   I said, "You can ask, but I'm sitting here in the--"
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.080]   Yeah, that's a building that's in public.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:13.680]   But this-- yeah, and I'm sitting on a sidewalk and it got negotiated down to, "Can you at
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.680]   least--?"
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:20.480]   Like, if I write a note saying that I told you to go away and you didn't just-- so I
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:22.840]   could show my bosses, I did my job.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:28.240]   So long as he-- if there are-- I'm hoping he's making the decisions that are right for
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.320]   him, I'm not saying what he should or shouldn't do.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.320]   I think there's no question-- it would be interesting.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:35.280]   It would be illegal to fly a drone over this building.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:36.280]   No.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.280]   It's a-- that's not-- I don't know.
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.280]   I don't know.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:44.000]   I don't know what the law is.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.680]   I would be interested in somebody deciding that here is what we can legally do to film
[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:51.720]   this campus and I'm going to keep within that.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:55.400]   If they want to call the cops, then eventually the cops will get tired of being called out
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.640]   and being by someone who has, "Great, here's my lawyer's number."
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.080]   He will explain to you what the FAA's regulations are.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:02.920]   This is a registered drone.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.320]   I'm filing it within the ceiling that is allowed.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:08.920]   There is no airspace restrictions above this facility.
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:11.720]   And if you tell me that there are ones that I'm not aware of, then I will obey that as
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:15.440]   well, but you're not going to tell-- not going to take me-- tell me to not be on the sidewalk
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:19.320]   doing what I can legally do.
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.600]   No flying drones over people, according to the FAA.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.480]   He's in the middle of a city, so that's-- I know that that's a problem.
[01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:34.800]   You know, presuming he's not actually on private property, that wouldn't be the issue.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.760]   But the drone-- and so there would be certain altitude limits, I'm sure.
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:44.200]   But I completely understand why a company does-- or even anybody doesn't want drones
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.200]   peering in their window.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.200]   Absolutely.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.120]   He was changing between a meeting.
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.960]   Well, I mean, there's a lot of proprietary stuff.
[01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:58.320]   My problem would be if someone suddenly decided that-- again, just like that guy who rented
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.680]   a Cessna to find out, I wonder if Chris Christie took his family out on this officially closed
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:03.840]   state beach.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:10.480]   If someone wants to rent a helicopter and obey FAA rules, that's Apple's fault for not
[01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:14.440]   putting a roof on top of things that they want to keep private.
[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.080]   This isn't like somebody undressing in their apartment.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:22.440]   This is a corporation that's doing things for selfish reasons.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:26.480]   So it just depends what the airspace requirements are.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:28.840]   Because obviously, you could fly a plane over it.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.720]   I mean, that's not illegal.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:37.080]   Have we learned anything about what improvements Apple might have made to local infrastructure?
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:43.000]   Like, are they making it easier for people to not have to drive a car into work?
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.880]   Are they adding more-- are they investing in the local community?
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:51.000]   You know, the irony is that it was the city of Cupertino that required them to put in
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.600]   all those parking spaces.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:56.000]   Not Apple.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:02.040]   And I would imagine that Apple's very interested in getting his few car spaces.
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:06.080]   I didn't hear rumors about how you're going to do internal navigation because I was wondering,
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.880]   like, if Leo and I were at Apple, he'd give me a name.
[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:09.880]   How would we give them a half?
[01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.880]   Three degrees north, third ring, fourth floor.
[01:33:11.880 --> 01:33:13.760]   I understand that they're color coded.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.960]   So you'll know why sort of a section that you need to be.
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.480]   Lights in the floor that light up.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:18.960]   I've been to events.
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:24.120]   I've been to events where they project your path and they say, "Follow the red line."
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.960]   But they'll have just so many people walking around.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.360]   Like, how's Craig going to storm into the meeting if there's this like--
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.360]   [CHUCKLES]
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:35.560]   Any predictions about when the phone event will be?
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.560]   September.
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.560]   Yeah, we just--
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.560]   Still September.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.560]   It's usually--
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.760]   I think Apple could just show people how crazy Apple users are.
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:46.760]   And just say, "Here's a deal.
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:48.760]   We're going to release something on September 22nd."
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:52.160]   They should just tell you this on September 10th and just say, "If you want to get in the
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:54.160]   front of the line, just order it right now."
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:58.160]   Here's blank number one, blank number two, blank number three.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:00.160]   And you can just order it right now.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:01.160]   And I guarantee--
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.160]   So number one, you want to do number three.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.560]   No, we're just going to device number one.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.760]   Like, literally, I think Apple could sell 20 million of device number one.
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:09.760]   Like, you just like--
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.760]   And they can say, "There's only one of them.
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:12.760]   It's going to be the best one.
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.760]   It's going to cost you $1,200 bucks."
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:17.760]   And you can order it right now.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:18.760]   And you can be--
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:19.760]   We don't have a lot of them.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.760]   So you don't really have to be committed.
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:24.760]   And I think that many--
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.760]   It'll be like a Kickstarter.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:29.760]   You can get it for $5,000 for the signed picture of Eddy Q.
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:30.760]   Exactly.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.760]   I don't think you need the signed picture.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.760]   I mean, I think Eddy Q is a high-five.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.760]   I mean, I think I just say, and you get to be in the front of the line.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:41.760]   And if you just order it without even knowing what it is, I think that it would be an interesting
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:42.760]   experiment.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.760]   It would be like if it was like cards against humanity where people didn't believe that
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:52.760]   when they're selling you a box of crap, they would literally receive a box containing manure.
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:54.760]   They just spent money on it.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.760]   The money is one.
[01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:03.760]   On the holiday haul last year, you had to give money to keep them digging into the ground.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:05.760]   And all they were doing is digging into the ground.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.760]   And on their FAQ, it said, "Why aren't you giving my money to charity?"
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.760]   And they were like, "The answer was, why aren't you giving your money to charity?"
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:20.760]   But I just wanted to get the-- what was that Nintendo mini?
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:23.760]   The classic edition NES, like last year?
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:24.760]   Oh, the classic edition.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.760]   Thank you.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:28.760]   Classic edition had about 30 classic NES games on it.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:29.760]   60 bucks, hey, great.
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.760]   If I come across and I'll buy it.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:37.760]   And the fact that they were so in such limited numbers and you have to make sure you have
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:40.760]   to know a guy who knows when they're coming in at Walmart.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.760]   And if you give them 50 bucks, he'll set aside some for you.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.760]   But unfortunately, someone got ahead in ahead of you and bought all 100 and other flipping
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.320]   money, and there comes a time where you're just thinking, "I have money in my hand that
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:53.760]   I want to use to buy a consumer product.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:57.760]   This should not cost me my dignity as well as my $60.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:03.160]   You can keep your Nintendo classic edition and I'll keep my $60 if it means that I have
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:05.760]   to think that, "Oh my God, I'm one of the chosen few.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.760]   I got to give somebody $60 for a consumer product."
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:12.760]   So I'm glad that that's one thing that Apple has definitely clamped down on saying, "We
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:16.360]   don't really, we really don't want people camped out in front of Apple stores.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:23.160]   We want to have so many in the retail channel that you can just show up and buy one at your
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.240]   leisure.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:30.080]   And we want the sort of users that understand that we're not making them for like a week.
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:33.560]   We're going to be making them pretty much all year long.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:40.520]   And if you didn't get it the first day, you can still get it a few days later.
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:43.120]   And then according to that video that Megan and Georgia showed, you can pay more money
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.880]   to deny the phone to somebody else.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:46.880]   Because that's a very human thing to do.
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:49.360]   And then you'll just throw it.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:54.320]   I did have a moment like that during the height of the ridiculousness of the app, of the line.
[01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:59.600]   I just felt like if I had that kind of money and I wanted to do like a cards against humanity
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:03.800]   sort of statement, I'd say, I'm only allowed to buy two.
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.640]   I only bought the two.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:07.600]   And now I'm going to smash them with a hammer.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.600]   These are physical objects.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.200]   They're just phones.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.920]   They're not the key to your happiness for the next month.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:16.640]   It means nothing that you're able to buy one of these.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.680]   As long as every monkey got cucumbers, it was fine.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.440]   As soon as one didn't, then they threw the cucumbers at the person.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:23.440]   Wait.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.440]   This is not the arc of the covenant.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:29.560]   The fact that I broke this open did not release evil spirits that consumed me to hell.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.560]   It's a phone.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.560]   It's a high end phone.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.560]   Hey, but you got a minute.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:33.560]   It's really great.
[01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.560]   All right.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:35.560]   Let's take a break.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.200]   You guys performed a little bit better in low light.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:39.200]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:41.800]   We do the emoji before we break Leo because that's just so much fun.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:43.080]   Oh, you want to talk about them?
[01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:45.200]   It was World Emoji Day on Saturday.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:52.840]   Apple celebrated doing some fun things, including changing movie names to replace emojis.
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:56.280]   And they did a replacing movie names with emojis.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.840]   And they did a podcast.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:03.040]   They did a, this is from the Apple newsroom, Apple previews new emojis coming later this
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:04.600]   year.
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.760]   These will be part, well, these will be part of iOS 11.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:09.640]   Scroll down a little bit, Carson, you get a list of all the emojis.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:12.880]   I think there's still no poutine, which is a travesty, but there are a lot of other really
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:16.160]   good emoji, like a sandwich, fire, yes, and download them all.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.160]   See other media.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:21.080]   I don't even know what I would use a poutine emoji for, but it would be great.
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:24.740]   Well, no, I still think you hold, you hold down on French fries and you get the option
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:27.440]   for poutine, tater tots, mashed potatoes, hot.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:33.000]   You know, it just like any kind of ash browns, whatever you want to take it.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:40.240]   Make it as always the real news story about this is the speculation about what what revolting
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:44.880]   sex act will that will that emoji be used to convey in the future of things that would
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.880]   get in conversation.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:48.720]   You know, I realized that they really go.
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:52.320]   Yeah, I had some tater tots last night.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:56.280]   I'm having tater tots right now, if you know what I mean.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.480]   So here are all the new emojis.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:02.600]   Apple has kindly provided them for us in high quality vector graphics.
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.360]   Mine blown is so great.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:07.760]   Mine blown, which is a mushroom cloud coming out of a bursting.
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:11.240]   Oh, I would have a body emoji gives me that emoji feeling.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.240]   He doesn't look.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.240]   He doesn't look happy.
[01:39:13.240 --> 01:39:16.200]   He looks as though this is like there's a sniper from two miles away from the Canadian
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.440]   force, special forces, not pleasant.
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:23.240]   I think that looks like when I explained to him how cassettes work, like music is on
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:24.240]   the thing.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.240]   And it actually, actually seriously, when you scale it, you're like, oh, I'm like, oh,
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:29.040]   the mind blown things down to like what it will look like.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.840]   It will look like somebody's been shot and their brains are being splattered out of their
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:34.840]   skulls.
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:36.320]   Here's the throw up emoji.
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:40.360]   Here's the emoji when you I don't know what I don't know what happens here.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:41.360]   I'm feeling kind of you.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:45.120]   And you don't know how the reflect on access command works in Photoshop.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.360]   That's the best emoji for that.
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.920]   I like Apple style.
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:52.760]   These are nice three dimensional cartoonish, but still realistic.
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:53.920]   I think they've done a nice job.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:54.920]   There's a Zebra.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.200]   These would be super expensive clip art.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:58.200]   Not too many years ago.
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.200]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.520]   I mean, this is very nicely done.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:02.640]   This is getting like Instagram or not Instagram.
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:03.640]   Telegram good.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:05.080]   Have you seen all of the telegrams?
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:06.080]   Oh, telegrams are great.
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:07.080]   I know.
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:10.120]   Look at the elf queen and Galadriel.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:11.960]   Here's a mom breastfeeding.
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:16.840]   There was some I remember in the emoji committee issue about whether that should be gender neutral
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:23.800]   and the original version of this, the mom had no head, but that was so creepy that they
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:24.800]   decided.
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:26.800]   Well, most of the people breastfeeding women.
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.800]   Maybe we'll see guys remember.
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.040]   I don't know if you guys remember the I message in iOS 10 demo, but they had Imran
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:37.520]   Choudhury on stage demonstrating and he was talking yesterday about how he and Steve
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:41.800]   Lamay designed the original Apple smiley emojis that all this stuff came.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:42.800]   Oh, those are amazing.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.600]   Came out of over burritos was the way that all these came about.
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.600]   Over burritos.
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.840]   They shared burritos and they came up with the original emoji set around.
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:54.760]   They had scarf a man with a beard and I guess these are all of them or something.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.120]   Sorry, I had a sandwich.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.960]   This one looks the meditating.
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.160]   So yeah, apples.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:03.000]   This made a press release out of this, believe it or not.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.240]   Well, see, we're not supposed to line up for the new iPhone.
[01:41:06.240 --> 01:41:07.840]   Now we're supposed to line up for the new emojis.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.840]   There's no end to this.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:09.840]   I'm telling you.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.040]   No, but I don't think they were joking when they said that, you know, when they announced
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:15.240]   new emojis, it's one of the most people are just so excited about them.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.440]   It was sort of caught them off guard, but now they're fully embracing.
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:25.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, I show today brought to you by the tracker never lose anything again.
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:28.760]   I have a tracker on my keys and my keys are changing my briefcase.
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:33.080]   So it's doing double duty and I realized that there's some cameras I would just hate to
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:34.840]   lose like my Leica Q.
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:36.520]   So I put a tracker on that too.
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:38.240]   And this is the new tracker pixel.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:43.080]   One of the nice things is this is so light that it just you don't even know it's there.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.440]   But what's great is you pair this tracker with your phone.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.160]   It's a Bluetooth tracker.
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:52.520]   And if you leave your phone behind, the tracker will scream on your camera, your keys will
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:57.240]   scream or if you leave your camera behind, you can set it up so that your phone will
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:00.520]   say, Leo, you really don't want to leave your camera at that coffee shop.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:05.720]   Plus, you can always check the tracker software on your device to find out where your stuff
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.880]   is.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.560]   It's just a great solution.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:14.280]   And because tracker has the world's largest crowd sourced network, no matter where your
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:20.080]   stuff is, you can find it because anytime anybody with a tracker software on their phone walks
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:25.360]   by your tracker, it'll contact you and say, hey, I saw your camera.
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:26.960]   It's downtown.
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:28.120]   I love the tracker.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.920]   And of course, you can press a button if you wish.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.920]   You have to set it up.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.560]   But if you want, you could press a button on your tracker.
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:37.120]   It'll make your iPhone a scream.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:42.040]   Even if your iPhone is silenced.
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:44.040]   That's kind of which it mine is.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:48.120]   You can also make your tracker scream if you press the button.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:52.280]   And this is the tracker pixel, which I like because it not only makes noise, 90 decibels
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:57.240]   of noise, it also lights up the LEDs built in.
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.640]   So a lot of times stuff falls between the cracks that I catch and stuff.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.640]   It's hard to find.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:05.280]   The sound and the lights make it a lot easier.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.280]   Tracker.
[01:43:06.280 --> 01:43:09.560]   You can go right now to the tracker.com and load up on trackers.
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:14.440]   The tracker bravo and its thin, light, anodized aluminum form.
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:15.440]   That's engravable.
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:19.360]   They also can print on it using UV LED printing.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.720]   You can have multiple tracker bravos on a single phone up to 10.
[01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:27.840]   But you can also have several phones tracking an individual bravo.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:31.600]   So remote controls or shared pets, that kind of thing.
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.160]   That's handy.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:34.520]   Tracker is awesome.

[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:03.160]   The tracker.com.
[01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.800]   Don't forget the offer code MAC break.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:07.480]   We thank them for their support of MAC break weekly.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:10.480]   Renee Richie, let's get a pick of the week out of you, sir.
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:15.880]   All right, so my pick is deliberately meant to start a fight or a controversy.
[01:44:15.880 --> 01:44:20.840]   So with just the general discussion, not with any person in particular, so there was
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:25.160]   a bit of a Bruha Ha Ha last week over one password, which is the password management
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.880]   tool of choice for many, many people in our community.
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:31.800]   What happened was due to some bad communication on their part, they were hesitant to sort
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.200]   of address the issues.
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:36.720]   And a lot of people who just took sort of quasi information and ran with it, there was
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:39.880]   a lot of people upset with one password, a lot of misinformation that got spread, a
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:41.760]   lot of release sensational headlines.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:45.960]   The gist of it is that they are moving towards a subscription model and away from per license
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:46.960]   pricing.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:52.080]   And they're also moving towards a cloud based model and away from a local password vault.
[01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:55.120]   And this has upset a lot of people first because some people just want to buy a license when
[01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.600]   they want to buy it and don't want to pay subscriptions.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.960]   And especially now that a lot of services has subscriptions, it becomes expensive to
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:04.200]   sort of have a subscription to every app and totally understandable.
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:07.280]   And also some people just don't want to trust their passwords to a cloud based solution
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:10.200]   for the same reason we were discussing with backups.
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:14.240]   That was one of the reasons I would often recommend one password because last pass does
[01:45:14.240 --> 01:45:15.760]   have a cloud based solution.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:20.440]   If you want to be responsible for sinking your password blob, if you want to keep it safe
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:22.120]   yourself, you can with one password.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:25.400]   I'm sorry to hear this is no, so this that's the thing is that they didn't change.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:26.560]   Oh, they didn't change that.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:29.280]   No, so they are absolutely pushing people in that direction.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.280]   Yes, right.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:34.760]   The majority of people, the majority of time, if you find password managers confusing and
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.360]   the last thing you want to do is maintain a local password database, they will handle
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:39.680]   all of that for you.
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.680]   Okay.
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:44.680]   But you can still create even with the subscription plan, you can still create local password
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.680]   balls.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:46.680]   Still keep control of them.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:49.880]   They will still sync if you want them to overdraw box or over high cloud.
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:50.880]   All of that still works.
[01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:53.040]   You can even go to them and get an individual license.
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.620]   I don't know for how long they'll keep doing that, but at least for the foreseeable future,
[01:45:56.620 --> 01:45:58.800]   you can still go there and get an individual license.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:01.680]   Always thought it was weird that you pay once for last password.
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:02.680]   I mean, for one password.
[01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:05.680]   I pay monthly fee or yearly fee for last pass.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:09.800]   I'm used to the subscription and I want them to stick around and continue to develop it.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:14.600]   So I thought that one password actually was kind of losing out by charging you once.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:16.040]   I'm glad to hear their don't know.
[01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:19.200]   They actually, where they have a really good blog post, this called Happy Password, One
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:22.360]   Password Makers where they figured out that, you know, this is good because they don't
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.720]   have to wait and withhold features to make one big release that they'll hopefully get
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:26.720]   people to upgrade to.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:29.400]   They can sort of put out updates as they have them ready.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:32.240]   They don't have to charge you because before there was a lot of confusion, like, I own
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.240]   one password.
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.240]   Why can't I put it on Windows?
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:36.520]   Well, yes, you own the iOS version or you own the Mac version.
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.520]   You don't own the Windows version.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:38.840]   And it was just it was a lot.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.360]   Right now you pay the subscription.
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:42.520]   You can download it on any device.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:46.280]   And we've been using One Password Teams at Mobile Nations for a long time.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.280]   Before that it was horrible.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:51.080]   We had like Google Docs and we were sending things over Skype and it just wasn't scalable.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:54.840]   And now we just all have a Teams account and we have that combined with local vaults
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:55.840]   and cloud vaults.
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:57.680]   And it's really flexible.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:01.520]   But what I was doing is I was trying to figure out what to do for my mom and my sister because
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:04.320]   they are those people who do not want to do any overhead for this.
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:06.600]   They just don't want to manage local vaults.
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.200]   So I got the One Passwords family.
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:11.080]   I'm in the process of setting that up and you pay the subscription.
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:14.320]   It's about two bucks more a month for the family version.
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:15.680]   And you can have up to five people.
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.000]   So I have my sister and my mother set up now too.
[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.440]   And you can share passwords so I can share some passwords with them.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:22.440]   I can set up their passwords and share them.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:26.640]   Like if I need to log into my mom's router or log into her cable and help her fix something,
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.120]   it's all very easy to do.
[01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:32.360]   It's one gigabyte of storage which sounds small but really you're receiving tiny little
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:33.360]   pseudo-rank.
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:35.360]   Absolutely.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:36.360]   You get every app.
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:39.960]   So if your mom is on Windows, your sister is on Android, your brother is on Windows phone,
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:44.840]   you know, whatever it may be, you get access to all the clients for everybody.
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:48.480]   And if you have at least one person who's a little bit, you know, and to get One Password
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:50.600]   you have to be a little bit concerned about security.
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.760]   If you have just that one person in the family who's willing to do the initial setup, it's
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:57.000]   really transparent and easy to use after that.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.080]   I think, I mean, I use this.
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:02.520]   There's a lot of advantages to having a blob stored in the cloud and it sinks to all your
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:03.520]   devices.
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.520]   It is easy.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:05.520]   I'm not too worried.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:08.880]   I mean, that's the risk with the password manager is there's a single point of failure.
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.880]   If somebody somehow should get your password vault and get it unlocked, well, now they've
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:14.640]   got everything.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:17.440]   So sometimes people say, well, I don't want to put mine on the cloud.
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:23.000]   I want to put it on a Synology or do my own thing encrypted, put it on Dropbox, whatever.
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.320]   But and I always like One Password because it gave you the choice.
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:31.480]   But it also makes perfect sense that the default is, you know, a cloud storage.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:32.560]   And it was the same reason.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.680]   Like they said, the big one of the biggest problems they had is that people would just
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:37.640]   forget their master password or they would corrupt their database and they would and
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.400]   it was not literally nothing they could do to help them.
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.400]   So good.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:43.280]   I think that's fantastic.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:44.280]   I've always liked my password.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:49.280]   It's still a good company.
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:52.280]   It's not owned by anybody.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:55.280]   It's still, you know, they're trying to maintain their independence and do what they want to
[01:48:55.280 --> 01:48:57.280]   do and make it the way they want to make it.
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:58.280]   Yeah, very good.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.280]   A good plug.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:00.280]   I had no controversy there.
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.280]   And I'm just, I'm glad we could set the record straight.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.280]   Some people hate it when things change.
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:06.280]   They just really like they were, they're used to having it in one way and they really
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.280]   want it one way.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.280]   And again, there was a lot of confusion because people thought you couldn't do local vault anymore
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.280]   and that led a lot of security experts to say we can no longer recommend the software.
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.760]   We can find them and find out everything before beforehand.
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:19.140]   Andy and I, your pick of the week.
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:20.140]   For my pick.
[01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:25.880]   I did find my Boyleson Street green day, green monster, Apple store opening day.
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:27.280]   Oh, look at that.
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.220]   And so you see it's not, it is actually my camera color is off.
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:33.520]   It is actually green monster green.
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:39.000]   It's got like the like the sliding like manual scoreboard numbers in there and you actually
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:45.720]   have to flip it over in order to see the actual Apple, Apple logo, Boyleson Street thing.
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:50.320]   This is unfortunately, this is in the category of it's too cool a shirt to wear.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:57.400]   So that's why it's neatly folded someplace and I really, I really need to wear it because
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:02.360]   t-shirt sports cars, high performance cars are meant to be driven and cool t-shirts are
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:03.360]   meant to be worn.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.600]   Nothing, nothing gold can stay pony boy.
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:08.720]   My pick of the week though is one of my eternal favorite things.
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:13.360]   This is the grid it like packing cable organizing.
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:14.360]   I use it too.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:15.360]   I love it.
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.160]   I can't tell you.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.040]   I'm sure that I recommended this two years ago, but I was reminded just this weekend of
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:22.200]   how cool it is.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:27.160]   This is it's just like a grid of elastic straps that are sort of like woven where some of
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.560]   them are like wide straps, some of them are like tiny, tiny straps.
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:35.600]   And it means that every time that I switch from like my backpack for the day to my laptop
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:42.160]   bag for the day to even like the little tiny like army surplus gas mask bag, I sometimes
[01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:46.200]   wear all I got to do is pull this out of whatever bag I was wearing yesterday and put
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.320]   this to the new one.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:50.080]   And I've got like my got my USB charger.
[01:50:50.080 --> 01:50:51.880]   I've got cables for all the things I use.
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:52.880]   I got a pen.
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:53.880]   I got analog headphones.
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:55.840]   And it's just that simple.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.320]   And they come in all kinds of sizes.
[01:50:57.320 --> 01:51:02.240]   This is the grab from wherever I go and put into whatever I need to go size, but they
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:04.720]   also make it in like eight and a half by 11 sizes.
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:10.080]   So when I pack for a trip, that's one of the banes of my existence is that I forget.
[01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:17.760]   I've oftentimes traveled with like one lightning device and like four lightning cables because
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:21.360]   I've I've been packing over the course of a day and I forgot whether I put the cable
[01:51:21.360 --> 01:51:22.840]   in there or not.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:26.360]   So when you have like the eight and a half by 11 version of it, here is like a tote board
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:29.400]   showing you everything that you have packed already.
[01:51:29.400 --> 01:51:31.680]   And so if I think, Oh, I need a USB C cable.
[01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:34.080]   No, Andy see you already have a USB C cable.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:35.920]   You don't need another one of those.
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.040]   And so easy just to keep things organized and more importantly, get at things when you
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.040]   need them.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:42.040]   And they're pretty cheap.
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:43.800]   This is the smallest one they have.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:45.400]   And this is about 10 or 12 bucks.
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:48.360]   They make they makes 12 inch versions.
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:52.160]   They make versions that are for like your car, sun, visor.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:56.880]   They even make versions that are actual like iPad cases, but the outside of the case is
[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:58.200]   this grid it system.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:00.160]   So again, you drop this in your laptop bag.
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:03.600]   You've got your iPad protected, but you also got you got your mince.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:07.840]   You got your lens wipes, you got your pocket camera, you got your spare battery for it.
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.120]   It's I can't recommend them highly enough.
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:15.480]   I keep the the elastic wears out maybe after a year or a year and a half, but you just keep
[01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:18.960]   buying more of them because I got like four or five or different ones of these.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:19.960]   They're not expensive.
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.200]   Yeah, they're not expensive.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:24.680]   And I don't know of anything that does as good a job for its intended purposes.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:28.760]   This thing does what size do you so you have a little one in a medium.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:31.440]   I have I have the
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:36.800]   the extra small, this is the seven inch by five inch version.
[01:52:36.800 --> 01:52:42.200]   And I also have, I think the eight and a half by 11 version of it's 10 and a half by seven
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:43.200]   and a half.
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:45.560]   No, it's it's one's a little bit larger than that.
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:46.560]   It's large enough.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.120]   That's it's about it's about the same like real estate as as a 13 inch laptop.
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:53.880]   That's the one that I take when I'm going to be gone for like the better part of a week
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:58.280]   or so, where this is where everything that would ordinarily be rattling around inside
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:00.080]   my suitcase is going to sit.
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:04.160]   So it might contain might contain my toothbrush might contain my razor.
[01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:10.200]   And it's the particularly when you take things apart because TSA saw something in your bag
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:15.000]   that need to hand inspect like suddenly here is everything sir or madam and then everything's
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.080]   back in there.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:17.080]   So great.
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:21.600]   Also, they'll also saw you a kid of three a bundle of like three different sizes.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:26.520]   I'm if you got if you got the dough to spend 50 or 60 bucks, I say buy the bundle because
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:31.080]   you'll get the size that you actually need and then the size you will come to need and
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:32.280]   depend upon.
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:35.600]   And then eight months later, you'll realize I needed a third one.
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:39.600]   Oh, wait, no, I still have that medium size one that I never got around using.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:45.480]   From cocoon grid it it's on Amazon as well as at the website.
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:48.120]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:53.840]   So we we've been doing a lot of software development recently and one of our things that I was
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:57.040]   never very good at is trying to figure out how to keep all those conversations going
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:58.880]   and keep them working when you're trying to do development.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:02.560]   You're finding bugs and you're finding other things that are working and not working.
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:09.600]   And one of the one of the guys here suggested we start using a thing called pivotal tracker,
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:14.480]   which is pivotal is the kind of I mean from what I understand they're kind of the secret
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:19.600]   weapon for a lot of these a lot of companies building apps and they're in San Francisco
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:20.600]   and natural.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:21.600]   Yeah.
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:28.320]   And they so this is I'm told is their internal tool that they use for this.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:32.000]   They made more kind of more public and it is awesome.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.200]   So pivotal tracker is you can work on your phone works on a you know, on a web page.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:42.000]   And what you can basically do is just really it has all the tools that you need to if you're
[01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.920]   a developer to really just track what's going on.
[01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:49.040]   You know, so you can be filing bugs, filing feature requests, keeping track of them.
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:51.280]   The developers on the other side are developer.
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:53.400]   Our main developer is in San Diego.
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:54.640]   So he can sit there and work on that.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:56.800]   And he kind of works on a shifted schedule.
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:59.240]   A lot of programmers like to work at night.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:04.440]   So so I said there are I and a couple of other folks here bang on the on the product,
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:09.200]   you know, here and then he is, you know, you know, we I see a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:11.920]   And for some reason there's this lower brain thing that I see a whole bunch of things that
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:13.120]   I have to do something with.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:17.120]   I have to go up to the app and start hitting and going except, except reject reject, you
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.040]   know, like, I feel like I need to move it forward.
[01:55:20.040 --> 01:55:24.720]   And so anyway, that was more powerful than just using Slack or whatever we were doing
[01:55:24.720 --> 01:55:25.720]   before.
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:29.880]   And so if you're, you know, if you're doing development, I would highly suggest taking
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.120]   a look at it.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:35.240]   It's a I don't think I think I'm scratching the surface of what it actually can do.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:39.120]   But it is a super powerful thing that I'm kind of now using.
[01:55:39.120 --> 01:55:44.480]   I was a man, kind of a can band board that lets you track projects.
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:46.080]   I'm a big believer in this technology.
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:49.280]   This is how we did our webpage with the folks at Four Kitchens and it worked very well for
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:50.280]   us.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:51.280]   Yeah.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.760]   Anyway, so I'm super happy with it.
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:55:54.760]   Nice.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:55.760]   It's super expensive.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:55:57.000]   It's easy to use.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.040]   From pivotal, it's pivotal tracker.com.
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:05.400]   And that my friends concludes this thrilling gripping edition of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:56:05.400 --> 01:56:06.760]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey for being here.
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:09.520]   Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel Corp, Pixel Core.com.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.680]   Follow him on Twitter at Alex L I N D S A Y. That way you can see what he's up to and
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:16.920]   he announces stuff there.
[01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:24.240]   Fund seminars and things, especially if you're using Final Cut Studio, Final Cut Pro, you
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:26.480]   will want to know what he's up to.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:28.880]   We have cleared our current space.
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:30.680]   So it's mostly empty right now.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:34.040]   There's just a big motion capture studio there at the moment so that we can do some
[01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:35.040]   tests.
[01:56:35.040 --> 01:56:38.120]   And so once we get that done, we're going to probably do some actual events in this space
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:40.800]   that we couldn't do when we were doing builds here.
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:43.520]   So that space has gone somewhere else.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:48.840]   So we should be doing some more public events from here in the next month or two.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:49.840]   Great.
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:50.840]   Thank you, Alex.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.640]   Andy Naco Chicago.
[01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:54.480]   Sun times.
[01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.800]   C W O B dot com.
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:57.800]   Bicycle rider.
[01:56:57.800 --> 01:56:59.560]   Be careful if you see him running down the road.
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:02.320]   He's looking in his glass.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.320]   Do not.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:07.960]   I'm also I'm also collecting evidence still that my my estate could use against you.
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:09.160]   So don't don't get any ideas.
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:10.160]   Don't get any ideas.
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:11.160]   Bust it.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:12.680]   I know I look like a dork.
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:13.680]   You don't have to yell at that.
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:16.680]   I mean, that's the voice inside my head every single second is I'm pedaling.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:17.960]   So don't think you're being so clever.
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:22.520]   Andy, you and and Alex have convinced me to go the sous vide route, the prime day, a
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:23.520]   Nova.
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:24.520]   I got it.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:27.680]   I did my first sous vide last night.
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:30.680]   I kind of went a little crazy.
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:38.440]   Got a chamber vacuose dealer got a burns all T eight thousand years old.
[01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:39.440]   Sears all.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:41.440]   No, I got the burns.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:43.320]   Oh, mad with the Sears all.
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.480]   I don't know.
[01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:51.280]   But then last just last night, I had a half pound cheeseburger that was about an inch
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:54.040]   thick and with a perfect char on the side.
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:57.440]   So that's that's when you all take any joking people.
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:58:01.240]   How do you char yours on burger?
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:04.840]   Actually, the best way to char is cast iron skillet with like a tablespoon of butter in
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:05.840]   it.
[01:58:05.840 --> 01:58:07.960]   I smoke and hot and just like maybe a minute on a side.
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:11.880]   The Sears all works well, but it's really I really only use it.
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:14.320]   I can't I'll admit that I kind of like the gadget.
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:19.840]   I like that idea of taking this plumbing tool that I've had for about 10 years and bringing
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:22.960]   it into the kitchen and just go.
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:24.600]   It's really kind of fun.
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:27.840]   It's it's also great for lighting fireworks.
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:33.800]   Yeah, it's it's also yeah, it's so you can tell yourself it's got a million household uses,
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:38.000]   but yeah, I will say that it's the cast iron skillet is the way to go though.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.640]   Yeah, I think it probably tastes a little bit better.
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:45.560]   I actually did my first sous vide last night with chicken breasts and I fired up the grill
[01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:47.640]   because I wanted that a little bit of that smokey.
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:49.120]   You got it's the best of both worlds.
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.920]   Yeah, it is.
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:56.440]   For me, the big green egg is the yeah, I fired up the big green egg, which is not an inconsequential
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:57.440]   amount of work.
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:01.200]   Although it's a lot easier to get started with the Benzomatic TS8000.
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:05.600]   Let me tell you.
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:10.080]   And then I don't I don't think I really need it this year's all attachment that goes on
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.480]   top of it, but it is pretty cool.
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:16.080]   It looks like a shower head, but instead it's infrared heat at a thousand degrees.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:20.880]   It shoots a shower head that showers you and violent heat.
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:24.880]   I'm going to go.
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:26.960]   Renee Richie, I'm more calm.
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:28.360]   Nice to have you as well.
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:29.360]   Stay cool.
