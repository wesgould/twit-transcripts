[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.280]   again on assignment. Good news. Doc Rock is here. Rock in the house. Hello, Doc Rock.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:54.000]   Oh, Loja no Kaku. Oh, wow. You even got a purple. Sure SM7B mic muff.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.800]   Yes, I love these things and everyone always asks where to get it.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.920]   Well, we're at the sure store probably or no. No, it's a place in the Netherlands called
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.680]   reporterstore.com. The shipping is incredibly crazy because it's in Netherlands, but I just
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.920]   it was worth it. Now you're all purple all the time. It's actually great because black
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.840]   and purple is a nice combo. I like it. Yes. Yeah. I mean, you're black shirt, your black glass is
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.840]   gray graying, but going easily. I don't want you canceled after 18. I know. I didn't mean you.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:35.200]   I realized there was a pause there that oh my god, what have I just said? I mean,
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.040]   your shirt and you know, a technical care. We only have six colors. I know. Yeah. Yeah. They're
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.200]   all right. They're all Apple. That's right. That's Jason Snell. Perfect to college. Good to see you.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.640]   Jason Snell six colors dot com. Good to be here. Yes. Absolutely. I don't I have the stock
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.720]   just boring, although I have the big since we're talking about Mike wind screens. I have the big
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.280]   one though. I've got that's a nice one. I got the giant. Now I'm really. I got the giant one.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.480]   Got the giant one. But now I yeah, I might have to call it. There it is. Look at that.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.400]   The other one's stock. Leave it to Doc Rock to make us all invasive to set up. I am so sorry.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.720]   Surprise. This is your better than I said, all of this. I was tired of Doc's black.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.400]   I think it's time. Just gonna ride on over that one. I don't know what I Leo, you're breaking up.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.000]   I think that's the new sound system and something wrong with it. Andy and I co with WG.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.880]   Hey, you boss. Hello Andrew. We are very close to losing our liquor license. I'm just saying.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.720]   They're going to shut us down. They're going to shut us down running close to the quasar.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:53.120]   As I was preparing for the show moments ago, I saw some very disappointing news that DP review,
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.240]   which has long been the best photography review site. I present people there. I read their stuff
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   before I buy a camera. I absolutely check DP review is shutting down April 10th. What
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.960]   the? I mean, technically Amazon, which bought DP review and seems to not care about it,
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.600]   has told the people who work there that they're going away.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.680]   And they're going to lock the website and then shut it down later because Amazon
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.480]   you know, can't find a way to keep a website up and running for history's sake, either.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:34.000]   So Scott Elvrit general manager, DP reviewing.com, writing on the front page of DP review.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.040]   The site will be locked with no further updates after April 10th. It'll be in read only mode for
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.720]   a limited period afterwards. We don't know how long because Amazon can't figure that out. But
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.840]   yeah, that's a bummer. And I know probably Doc Rock, you're a photographer. Did you
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.480]   trust DP review? 100% for you know, I remember stumbling upon this site.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:06.240]   Ions ago and the first time I stumbled upon it, I was listening to a podcast with like Scott on
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.640]   it or something. And I went to go look at the site and I said, man, they covered all the details.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.920]   They get into like the C mall stuff, which nobody was really talking to back then. But as I was
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.480]   selling broadcast equipment, it was something that I was interested in and what was happening
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.760]   with sort of the new format digital cameras and how they're, you know, upgrading the way
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.320]   chips record images and things like that. I mean, we were still taking photos on the
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.760]   Mavica with a little CD in the back. You guys remember that. So the site was just always good
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.240]   in detail. The amount of stuff that they got into and the way they did their test.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:51.200]   It's going to be hard to replace. So hopefully someone picks them up or they still have access
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.760]   rights to their YouTube channel because that's there's so much great content there.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:03.200]   I just hope maybe the fans can start emailing, you know, at Amazon and tell them, listen, people,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:10.800]   you have the ability to leave this live, like Jason said, and at least leave it live, you know,
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.640]   for a while because even the vintage camera collectors will find things there that they need,
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:27.440]   you bet. You bet. Although here's the YouTube DP Review TV thumbnail. The end is nice.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:33.600]   I feel like, I don't know. I mean, you know, these big companies can be kind of
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.560]   dickish and. Yeah, well, and it's not their focus, right? Like, I mean, I've seen,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.320]   so Amazon's owned them for 15 years, right? So it's been a while. It's been a long time.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.600]   And obviously when they bought them, the whole idea there was like, oh, it's help
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.080]   strive camera sales or whatever. And I'm sure that in 15 years, Amazon's interest in a product
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.960]   like this is totally drifted. The problem is that they kept them around, probably underfunded,
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.400]   probably didn't give them any motivation or opportunity, the people who work there,
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.040]   opportunity to make the site, you know, continue to be relevant into the modern era or anything
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.520]   like that. And so you end up in a situation where you've got to, you know, whoever owned them 15
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.560]   years ago got to sell out to Amazon. Congratulations to those people retroactively. But you end up
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.760]   with an owner who kind of doesn't care and kind of doesn't need to. I mean, like, do you think anybody
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.000]   at Amazon really has been paying attention to like, well, what are we going to do to keep DP
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.120]   Review on the cutting edge, even though it's the best at what it does in the world. And so it's a
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.080]   sad but inevitable. I'm glad they lasted 15 years. I mean, we saw what happened with comexology,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.280]   right? Where it just got completely absorbed and ruined by Amazon. And you know, and again,
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.400]   it's almost like a wild animal killing something for food. It's like, I understand Amazon,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.960]   like, I get why Amazon shouldn't care about this and doesn't care about it. It's so huge. It's got
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:57.040]   other things to worry about. But it is a shame that this thing that so many people valued just
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.560]   gets cast away. And the fact that they're just saying, we're going to stop posting on April 10th,
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.880]   and then we're going to shut it down at an undetermined time. And then like what the archives
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:12.400]   disappear, it's just ridiculous. Yeah, there's such a database of knowledge. There's such a shared
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.200]   experience in those forums. Every time I was considering buying a lens, every time I was confused
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.080]   about whether this camera body is better than this camera body or what, you get people who wouldn't
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.360]   you wouldn't get into like brand name flame wars, you wouldn't get into people who are just, well,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.840]   let me tell let me show you the histogram of that versus the histogram of that other one. And I think
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.560]   the answers will be very, very clear to you. You get you get people who basically who start the
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.800]   response by saying, well, I have this one and here's my experience with it. And here's what I've
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:49.840]   been able to do with it. And it's like Jason says, it's it's a shame that when once a user base like
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:55.600]   that, once a once a community like that breaks apart, it never comes back together again. And once
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:01.360]   a corpus of messages and threads and information like that goes away, it never comes back. So
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:08.640]   I really, really hope that that some way of preserving all of these messages and all these
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.200]   threads and all these all this information can be preserved. Because I mean, this is this is
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.920]   exactly the nightmare with when a big company buy something that you really, really enjoy.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:25.360]   Sometimes it's like Apple needing a music player. And so they buy they buy sound jam and they turn
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.600]   into iTunes, which is an upgrade. Sometimes it's like they bought a classical music service and it's
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:38.560]   not really a priority to get done really, really fast. And remember that Amazon also also has a
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:44.400]   good reads. They also own a books, all these sort of things that as they're cutting another 9,000 jobs,
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.760]   they're going to start thinking about this one costs $800. And that's it's not helping us sell
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.160]   cameras, not helping us sell books. Let's just cut it loose and just forget about the fact that we
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.760]   basically bought something wonderful and unique and destroyed it.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:04.320]   Amazon cut 18,000 jobs. November through January of this year. Yesterday they announced 9,000
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:11.600]   moist 27,000 job cuts. I imagine the staff at DP review is included in that 9,000.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:19.200]   It kind of baffles me that companies, these companies are still highly profitable. Amazon didn't lose
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:26.800]   money. But they're laying off like crazy. And is it preparing for
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:34.640]   doom or do they just have to keep those profits at a high margin for Wall Street or.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:43.920]   The explanation from financial analysts that I really like is that it's largely because
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.800]   well everyone else is cutting staff. And so that makes management think that should we start cutting
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.480]   our staff as well. And it's true that over the past three or four years there's been a lot of
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.480]   fluctuations in hiring, particularly after COVID forced a lot of companies to decide that, oh, well,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.920]   we need to staff up for this now. We have some we have some we have a depression to get ourselves
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.840]   through. So we'll have to figure out what kind of new businesses we have. And maybe they were a
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:16.480]   little bit too to enthusiastic in hiring. But most for the most part, these aren't companies that
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:22.480]   are on the ropes. These are companies that again, they are now the fact that every other company
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:28.160]   besides Apple is hiring, excuse me, is firing people in the thousands. It makes them think that
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:36.160]   if I'm a C suite executive, maybe I should be trying to cut jobs to a before my own fears and
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.080]   also to keep stockholders happy because the stockholders are going to ask, well, do you have the
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:46.240]   perfect number of employees? Labor is always fungible. You could always basically tell yourself
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:53.120]   that I bet that the 800 people working in this division, we need 400 people can do it, can do
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.760]   the job of 800. And they can say think they can tell themselves things like, you know what, we've
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:03.360]   got too much invested in QA right now. I think it'll work fine handling customer complaints doesn't
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.160]   make us money. Let's cut some jobs there too. It's easy to when you have when you have tens of
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.560]   thousands of people on the payroll, it's easy to find 20,000 people that you think you can get rid
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:18.720]   of. And this is as easy as it can possibly get. I guess we could to some degree blame Apple
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:24.320]   because after all the success of the iPhone camera and now Google and Samsung's camera is kind of,
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.800]   I would imagine eating into sales of cameras. Doc, is it? Do you still need a camera?
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:38.400]   Okay, there's a huge difference between either one Leo, we've been taking guys for years.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.240]   Well, I'll give you an example. I'm going to Europe in a week. And I am really on the cusp about
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:52.800]   whether I should bring my Sony a seven R or my Leica Q2 or just, you know, the Samsung S23 Ultra
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:59.520]   and my iPhone Pro Max. Probably don't need that. You say that. Super funny that you said that I
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:06.400]   in in January, I'm sorry, December last two weeks of December, I went to Kyoto. It's Kyoto, not Kyoto.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:15.440]   And while I was there, I said, I am literally because I'm taking the M.I.L. I don't want to make
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:22.480]   her stop and wait for me to do all of my photography stuff, right? So I legit took my phone rig and
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.160]   Insta360 X3. Oh, I was thinking to bring him my
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:32.160]   two. Yeah. Oh, you have to. That's automatic. 360 camera. That's all I took. Yeah. And I feel
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:40.400]   like I took just as good a pictures, but that's a lie. I took great pictures. If I had actually
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:48.480]   brought the a seven four and my Temron, Trio and my tripod, I would have took epic pictures. Okay.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:55.280]   But it's either have, you know, wifey's mom peed off at me because I would finally get to go to Japan
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.040]   together. And I'm making her stop for my long setups and my exposure. And, you know, busting out
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:05.120]   my card as you have to, you have to have, you know, your white balance card, you got to do all these
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:11.040]   things that would have ruined the experience for the old lady. So I'm like, I am not going to make
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:16.480]   her pushing 80 sit there and wait for me. I'm just going to do everything with the iPhone and the
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.080]   Insta360 and make myself enjoy it for sharing it on the web and sharing it with the family. It's
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.520]   absolutely perfect. My professional space is yeah, there's a lot of us in our industry has grown.
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:35.040]   So if anything, once you get good with your iPhone camera and things, those limitations have actually
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:40.960]   woken people up to wanting a good point and shoot. The rain finder point and shoot has found
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:49.280]   that Renee Sonus, right? So many people are looking for the new Fuji's or the new smaller Sony that
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:55.200]   just takes really good filmic looking pictures. And I think it's actually grown the space,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:01.360]   not shrink the space. Plus the creative space is booming right now. Do you think I should bring the
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:08.000]   Insta360? You really got something? I will not leave home without it. I hate to say this in live TV
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.680]   and hopefully no one ever sees this. But of all of my Sony's that I own back here in this gigantic
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:23.760]   cabinet, my favorite camera par none right now is the Insta360 X3. It does some amazing, incredible
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.200]   I have an older one. Should I upgrade? I have an older one. I think it started.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:38.560]   I have some freaking lutely. It is so much fun. And you know, again, one of the great things,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.200]   like if you're traveling or you just walk doing a walkabout, you don't have to point it. You just
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.400]   put it up, right? And you can come back and reframe everything later. So the idea that you won't lose
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.160]   anything is fantastic and it's waterproof. And yeah, but it is a great. We actually use it in
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:16:00.800]   production. When we do a car, like when we reviewed my Mustang and just now we have a new
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:07.120]   advertiser that's an e-bike, Anthony puts the Insta on a long tripod. We were basically down the
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.400]   road drove ahead of us in a pickup in the sitting in the bed of the pickup truck with a thing just
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:19.360]   stuck out like this. And then he edits it into, you know, nice, because nobody can look at the 360
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.520]   stuff unless you're wearing those VR elements. But you can edit, I guess their software lets you
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:30.880]   edit it. And now it looks like just nice 4K footage. But he can chew. There it is. There it is.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:38.400]   This looks like we had a drone. I mean, this isn't a drone. This is not a crane. This is not a
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:46.000]   jib shot. Oh, that was the drone. Oh, I guess it had to be a drone. No, I think it was all the
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.400]   Oh, no, that's a stick. We did everything with a 9-inch time. Long stick. Yeah. And that's
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:59.200]   spur dropping all of the new gear. Yeah. It really, it was amazing. We should did a whole shoot
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:05.920]   with that 360 camera. And it looks like we had a crane and a drone and a jib and it was amazing.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.440]   All right. So you think I should get the, what should I get the latest one?
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:16.320]   The X2. The X3. X3. You want to add three? That just came out. And you want 450 bucks.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:23.360]   And now my fault. Or should I get the full? See, I never use it. That's the funny thing.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:31.440]   But I, but you should use it. And how do you edit it? Do you do you turn it into 2D or do you
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.200]   post 360 video? No, I do everything into the, I do most of the editing on my phone, believe it or
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.680]   not, because it's, you know, the app is fantastic. If I need to do some of the production work,
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:46.480]   it does work directly in Final Cut Pro and Premiere and the Lead Resolve, of course.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:53.120]   And yeah, it's just, it's just fantastic. The stabilization is amazing. Yeah, it came out like
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   maybe October. And do you have that long, that eight, nine meter pole? Yes. The nine meters takes
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.840]   100% that big is life. And you the nine meter stick. Okay, I got to get to work.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:09.360]   You know why? Because that allows you to do drone shots in places where you can't drive.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:15.600]   Yeah. It looks just like a drone. So it is, look, Andy is looking at his cart right now. I see him.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:23.440]   I'm just thinking because when I, I'm just checking on the last time I donated blood because
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:29.680]   that's probably not what I got to do. It's good to say the, uh, uh, Sistine ceiling, the Sistine
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.560]   Chapel, they don't let you use drones in there, but I could get right up there with a nine meter pole.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:40.560]   And you get the low Euro shot. Before we turn this into an instant 360 shot, give you one other
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.320]   trick you can do. If you needed to take something like the Sistine Chapel, would you can't bring a
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:50.400]   stake or whatever that on the law? All you do is press record. Yeah, toss it in the air. Oh,
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:56.320]   and then stop the recording later on. It will turn it into a wrap. And what it does is it uses the
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:03.760]   accelerometer and it knows where it is at this highest point and it basically runs a 360 video,
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.920]   basically a full pan. It does a 360 degree pan at its highest place on the accelerometer.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.800]   And then it comes back down. So you can basically go up and look around and then come back down
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   like you were that little thing in the needs. What's that thing about needs batteries? Batteries
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.760]   required a little. Yeah, no batteries required. Yeah. Yeah, there you go. Thank you Andy. Wow.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:31.360]   All right. You got you know what? It's funny. I buy it and we use it once in a while for studio
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:38.240]   stuff and I never use it anywhere else. But maybe you know, I do it on the phone, huh? And that way,
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.280]   so now I only I definitely don't need to bring the Sony. Right?
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.320]   Oh, you're killing it. Yeah, it's just a way to actually be on vacation because if I if I go
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.520]   on vacation with my gear, I go on vacation as a content creator. Yeah. And that's okay when it's
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:00.320]   just Karen and I, but when I'm dragging her mom with me, I'm not having her mad at me. Yeah,
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.840]   mother-in-law like you. She loves me. We have the same birthday. I'm the best friend. Let me
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:10.080]   put it in the wrong way. I'm bringing her with us. Let's put it that way. That's crazy talk.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:17.040]   Yeah, I know. All right. That's our camera. See you. We got Doc Rock. Much better.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:19.760]   Hey, DR review. Let's go. DR review.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:26.480]   I was checking just to see if in an archive, his archive did and I can't really tell, but I'm
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.440]   sure they have because they archive everything. And so I guess there will be a way of looking at
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:40.400]   old stuff. But come on, Amazon. Yeah, I'll give you my my photo tip because we were in New Zealand
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.800]   for two weeks. Yeah, what did you do? I did not bring a big fancy camera because I thought I want
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:50.880]   to travel light. I brought the iPhone Pro and that was it. Yep. Did you regret it? No, I didn't
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:57.040]   regret it, but I will give you a tip, which is a lot of I did some, I turned on the raw mode for
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.280]   some of the shots. Yes, I should everything. I shoot everything on the iPhone 14 Pro is
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:05.440]   spectacularly good. Although I don't do it. I don't shoot everything that way, but when I'm
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.680]   was in a good spot, I did. And then the other thing I want to say is action mode, which they just
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:17.440]   added action mode. If you're on a boat or a bus or a tram or anything like that, like we were in a
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:24.160]   on a on a like a zodiac going over ice filled glacial lake, right? And that video I was looking
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:31.600]   at it yesterday, I shot it in action mode. And it is like I am using a steady cam. All the all
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.160]   of that kind of stuff that would be bumpy action mode just clears it all out. So if you've got a
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:41.200]   modern like the iPhone 14, turn on action mode when you're doing anything like that.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.600]   It's magical. The bumps just vanish. I bought and I'm now regretting it. I bought the
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:54.320]   OM fifth generation, sixth generation, the new DJI gimbal. And I think action mode is probably
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:03.200]   just as good. Doc, what should I do? Action mode is amazing. I agree with Jason. I'll save it for
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:08.640]   my pick, but I have a cool little rig that I bought from my iPhone just to make it, you know,
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.280]   more nerdy. And I was just at social media conferences, weekend and everywhere I walked with
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:17.120]   that thing, everybody kept stopping me like, what is that? Like, Oh my God, does the pictures come
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.960]   out straight? And I was like, yeah, watch my content. They're like, Oh my God, it's perfect.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.560]   So yeah, I'll save it for my pick. So that way I can play. Okay, good. That's all you need. And
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.480]   Jason's 100% right. The actual mode is pretty incredible. So I really need to do
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:40.160]   spring my iPhone and that Insta. And I have a S 23 Ultra, which has a very nice extra long zoom.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.720]   Maybe I'll bring that say, okay, there's a something real far away. And I'm sad.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.440]   Should I not bring good to go? Really?
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.760]   There they go. It's breaking my heart. I spent a lot of money on that. Oh, God.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:59.040]   Apple has managed to save money without layoffs. We've talked about that before.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:08.320]   Mark Gurman in his newsletter inside Apple's company wide cost cutting push to avoid layoffs.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:13.040]   Now I'm thinking this is mostly propaganda to reassure the stock market. No, no, we're not
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:17.760]   laying people off, but we're doing all the cost cutting you want us to. We're very responsible.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:25.280]   We're very responsible. So what are they doing? You know, 30 billion dollars a quarter. It's not
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:32.080]   like they're hurting. 165 billion dollars in cash in the bank. It's not like they're hurting.
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.000]   Stock price up 20% this year. It's not like they're hurting, but
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:44.080]   they do want to cut costs because well, everybody else is doing it. 5% drop in sales last quarter,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:49.920]   maybe because of it. So bonuses are being delayed for corporate teams that previously received payouts
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.680]   twice a year. It's good to be the king. These teams are going to get the entire bonus once in
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:04.240]   October, which is what others in the company get. It actually they're not going to give them less.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.560]   They're just going to do it once instead of twice. They're going to.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:15.040]   It's amazing. All of this stuff, it's like attrition and bonuses deferred, but still paid out and
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:19.440]   like it is the gentlest. I mean, this is the truth is they've got, we talked about it last week.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:24.720]   There was a little bit of a disparity. They've got about 50, 60 billion in cash net. They actually
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:30.640]   have about 160 billion in cash, but they've also got some debt. So the net out is like 60 billion in
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.880]   cash and like they're doing fine and their sales are fine. So what do they do? It's like
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.040]   they could lay people off performatively, but I think that they don't want to.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:43.200]   And I do think that that's behind a lot of this is reassuring Wall Street that they're
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.480]   responsible with their money, all the tech sector. And so the layoffs as gross as that is for people
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.440]   to lose their jobs from big companies that could keep them but are going to sacrifice them on the
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:59.120]   altar of look at us. We're being competitive and we're being responsible during an economic
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:05.280]   question mark period. Apple's like, I mean, in many ways, Mark, Mark Herman's report here does
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.760]   Apple's job for it, right? Which is what it really wants to do with a massive
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:15.680]   via Bloomberg.com saying, look how responsible we are. Also look how great we are. We don't even
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.440]   need to lay people off. We're so responsible. Mark, what's going on? Good morning.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.760]   Mark, I've got some news I'd like to share with you, but you didn't hear it for me.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   I'm not saying they leak this to Mark. I don't know that, but I will say this. It does what they
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.080]   want. We just send that message out there. Some projects, including new home devices like that
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.880]   HomePod with the screen we've been talking about, have it pushed back to next year at the earliest.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:43.760]   This allows Apple to allocate its research and development budget to more pressing projects.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:49.280]   This is the verbiage that Apple or whoever gave him, right?
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:55.840]   And it feels very much like, I think a lot of us have been there if we've been in organizations,
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.160]   sometimes an economic downturn or even a fear of an economic downturn. What it ends up becoming
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:06.160]   is like a it's an opportunity to do things that you've been meaning to do, but you kind of need
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.560]   an excuse. And when I was reading Mark's report here, that's what it sounded like too, is like,
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.800]   we could use a little time for that HomePod. Why don't we just delay it and say that it's
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.600]   part of this? And we could lay it. That person's going to be replaced. We decided that we didn't
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.760]   really need them. And then they left. And now we can say it's because the economy we're not
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.880]   replacing. It's a good excuse. There's more boilerplate from Tim Cook. The company has
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.680]   reigned in budgets across several teams and is now requiring senior vice president approval for
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:39.280]   more items. Doc, go ahead. Now, I was going to say one of the other things that happens,
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:45.120]   and nobody wants to tell the truth on this, but like Jason said, here's an opportunity
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:52.400]   to take some of the people in the company that are longer in the tooth, but aren't load bearing
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.640]   walls, if you will, they do excellent job. They do their work, not saying they're bad employees,
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.360]   but they're not the load bearing wall. It sounds like me. I'm long in the tooth and not a load
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:06.720]   bearing wall. We just hit me on the head. Can you come see me when we're done here, Leah? We just
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:14.640]   just hit the top. So you're not going to lose a whole department, but now if I can use a slow
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:20.000]   market or a slow economy as a chance to get rid of them, you know what I can replace them with?
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.240]   Two other fresh out of college dying to have this job people. Not one, I can replace them with
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:33.200]   two people and still save money because of their increase every year. They've been there 15 years.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:39.760]   Maybe they're coming in at 250. I can bring in two brand new guys at 80 apiece, saved almost 90
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.320]   grand. And now I have a bigger team. And those other guys are hungry.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:49.760]   Also, I would say, you know, what Mark Herman reports is that they're doing things like the
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.600]   people who haven't kind of gotten with the program about returning to work three days a week.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.960]   And they're apparently using this as one of those like, well, now we can say it's about the economy,
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.400]   but we're really just using it to lean on them and make sure that they either need to leave or
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.800]   they need to be in their seats three days a week. And then again, what does that have to do with
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:12.560]   the economy? Well, I mean, it just means, hey, in this economy, do these things we want you to do
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:16.160]   that we have an excuse for now. And that's really what it is. So Doc Rocks right.
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.600]   And there's also a reason to say if we're going to guess and speculate, which is all we really can do,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:26.960]   yeah, as long as we label it as such. It's also it's one of the things that goes through my mind is
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:33.920]   that, okay, so we know that the home pod people don't have a really strong voice. I'm sure they
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:39.520]   weren't begging to please please back burner us for another year, assuming that these these quotes
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:45.920]   are correct. It's but nonetheless, they did have time for their $3,000 VR guard VR goggles.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:51.360]   So that team was able to make a pervasive a persuasive argument with Tim Cook to, yes, keep us on
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.360]   track, even though there is some device devices, divisiveness within the company
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:02.640]   whether or not we should actually be shipping this year. It's it's it's weird. Also, Apple's
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:08.560]   never been thought of as a company that over hires, if anything, to the absolute opposite.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:13.040]   They're the famous company that, oh, why aren't we getting this feature in macOS that we've
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:18.160]   been promised? Well, because iOS is a little bit late and they pulled some engineers off of macOS
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:23.280]   to work on an iOS project. Say you can't hire extra people could vote.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.280]   Yeah, it takes forever for Apple to hire anybody who's been through it or had a friend who's been
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.320]   through it. Apple's a very slow hire and you end up in situations like this where all these other
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.840]   companies were fast-hiervers. They hired a lot of people and now they're throwing them on the
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:43.200]   sacrificial altar and Apple gets to again point to their past and say, see, look how responsible we
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.040]   are, which is that message that they're sending. We didn't hire willing millions and we don't need
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:52.560]   to lay people off. We'll just tighten our belts a little bit and that'll save us some more money
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:59.040]   on top of the on top of the pile. Oh, my carrot weather started talking to me.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:11.440]   Oh, Sassy Pants today, Leel. It's Sassy Pants. Why did I make it rain? Because frick you, that's why.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:20.080]   So this is the new feature in carrot weather. They've added chat GPT. Oh, it's talking. It's
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:27.280]   talking. Oh boy. Is that new or is it? Where's the chat? It always talks, but it's swear. So be
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:41.040]   careful. I know. It's like a sailor. If you're listening live, sorry. Okay. I, well, I just so
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:47.520]   how do I take advantage of this though is new feature. I think you go into the I think there's
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:52.640]   like the is it the about screen or there's there's a screen where you can actually enter in text.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:31:00.080]   And it'll chat GPT you back. Okay, it's everywhere. This morning, I got up early with my
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:10.800]   sergeant and we did the NVIDIA GTC keynote from Jensen Wong. And boy, oh boy. They are really hot
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:17.200]   because they are on top of all the biggest, you know, they're not doing VR goggles. They're doing
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.640]   they could. It's not that they're not they could, but but they are doing, you know, self-driving cars.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:29.920]   They are in every chat and and image AI out there practically. They're talking about stable
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.440]   diffusion runway, which own stable diffusion is doing video now and that's using NVIDIA chips.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:43.200]   They're showing their, you know, high-end processors designed for network operations centers so that
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:49.680]   you can have massive, you know, you know, giant super computers analyzing data to create the next
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:56.320]   big chat GPT. It's it was interesting. I don't know if he recorded it earlier. I think he did
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:03.920]   because he mentioned chat GPT three, but miss chat GPT four somehow. They've I guess either
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.440]   they're not involved, which I think is unlikely, or they recorded it just, you know, a few days ago
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:15.520]   before everything changed. One of the problems with talking about AI. Carrot weather is using
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:22.320]   four, I think, right? They're using the new. Yes. Because a new platform is 10. I mean, it's 10 times
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.520]   better, they say. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of incredible. I was playing with it last week
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:33.360]   about and giving it a lot of the same prompts. I gave it to I gave 3.5 and it really is kind of
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.240]   night and day, both being able to understand the context of questions, being under able to
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:44.960]   understand follow up questions and not getting quite so mental quite so quickly. It's pretty darn
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:50.080]   good. I've got although I do have I just got access to Bard. So I have to try that later on.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.640]   Yeah. That's another thing that happened. Yeah. Google has announced invites for Bard. If you go
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:03.920]   to bard.google.com, that's their large language, Matt model AI. You know, did you notice Andy that
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.720]   Nest was co branded with Google on that, which makes me think the Google Assistant.
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:14.800]   I'm this is what I'm really waiting for. Neither Siri, no, the Google Assistant or Amazon's Echo
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:22.560]   use this kind of AI. They're pretty much deterministic trees. Like if he says this,
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.200]   do that if he says this, do that your responses can't. If we start adding
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.960]   and tell some artificial intelligence to this, I think suddenly these voices
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.280]   assistants become much more interesting. You think apples? I know Google's going to do this because
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.560]   they because they mentioned Nest. Do you think Apple's going to do it?
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:48.640]   I hope so. I mean, there's AI is the is one thing that Apple is it's not it's not one of their
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:52.000]   signature strengths. Doesn't mean they're not doing a lot of work on it. Doesn't mean that a lot of
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.880]   their products don't benefit from their work in AI. But you can't point to anything that seems like
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:04.480]   an AI feature. And if this really is turning into the magic wiffle dust, that can take a good
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:10.560]   good and useful feature and turn it into something that you don't think you can live without over
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:15.600]   the course of the day because it's so damn useful to you. Apple has to make sure that they got their
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.080]   thumb in that pie. I mean, you've heard me talk before, I won't go into the whole thing, but I've
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.800]   always thought that the most powerful augmented reality device is a simple Bluetooth earbud.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.840]   The ability to simply talk to an assistant, get information from it, put information into it,
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:35.280]   just as is is pretty darn powerful. When you add to it having a conversation, not just simply
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:42.480]   being able to have a fake conversation of what's the weather? What about tomorrow? What about Saturday?
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.080]   But simply saying, well, how much snow are we going to get? Like, is it going to change over
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.040]   the course of the afternoon? But and when you add things like you're in the kitchen, and one of
[00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:59.840]   my test questions has been making red beans and rice. And because that's a really good way of
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:05.440]   exploring stuff where I know what basic red beans and rice recipe is, but I might have to ask a
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.120]   follow up where what if I'm making it in an instant pot? How does that change? Like, well,
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:14.480]   what happens if I add tomato sauce to it? I want to, how do I thicken it up? And having these
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.480]   interactive conversations that make you get to the place where you're ready to cook this thing,
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.080]   because you've basically pre-solved all the problems that you've had, you've got all the
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.320]   information you had that you could not do with a simple query, even if you're typing it into Google
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:32.320]   search. So this really is a place where Apple could seem really, really dumb. Oh, and don't
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.440]   and don't forget that Adobe also had their generative AI announcement today, where they're
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.640]   adding generative AI features the Photoshop where presumably, according to the demo, as soon as when
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:48.800]   this is released, you'll be able to do things like say, take take the lighthouse in this picture and
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.280]   make it look like it's being it's in moonlight, or make the make the lighthouse look a little bit
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.960]   more weather beaten, or hide the third person from the left and cover it up with some of the background.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:04.720]   And being able to do that magically, if Apple is the only product where you still have to mouse
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:10.720]   click everything, you still have to do natural queries where this magic thing just like it could
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:15.680]   be it could almost feel like having a phone that doesn't have access to the mobile to mobile broadband.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:20.560]   It's like, why can't my device not do this wonderful thing that I can do with all these
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.400]   other services on these other platforms? This is Adobe's Firefly Beta,
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:30.880]   Firefly.adobie.com and Huang did mention that at the GTC keynote as well, that they were,
[00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:39.120]   Nvidia's working with Adobe to do this. Wow, we are we are living in interesting times and even if
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:44.480]   and I think we all agree, this isn't art of general artificial intelligence, this isn't
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:51.600]   thinking machines by any means, the stuff you can do with it is pretty mind-boggling.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:56.640]   I keep thinking we should probably call it, I know the the horse is out of the barn, but we
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:00.320]   should probably call it machine learning models, right? Because that's really what's going on here.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:05.200]   I agree. I always thought of AI as doing a very different thing that we're not good at, but
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.800]   and yeah, you know, Apple's been doing machine learning models and their software for a while,
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:13.040]   photos, identifies all the objects and all that. They've been doing that for a while, but to Andy's
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.320]   point, there is a difference. I find with most voice assistants right now and anybody, you know,
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:23.280]   I think would probably join me on this, it's like you're doing a command line command, right? Like,
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:28.960]   if you give it exactly the words you need, you can get something out of it that is, you learn like
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:34.720]   how to phrase things, but what you don't have is like a conversation with a person. It's like one
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.040]   one statement and you get your answer. And what Andy's describing is so exciting because it is
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:45.520]   the conversation. It is at least in the context of that moment, you know what I want and are going
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:50.560]   to give it to me. So like I did that today with GPT four where I said, can you write a Python script
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:38:00.320]   that will display my will use a Swift bar for Mac OS to display my next fantastic calendar event
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:06.240]   in my menu bar. And I sat there and watched it write a pretty good, although not entirely accurate,
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:11.680]   but a pretty good Python script to do exactly that. It didn't choke on any, it gave me some
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:16.160]   installation instructions. And then, you know, then you can say, could you do that as an apple
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:22.160]   script? And it will do it, right? Like, because it knows all of that context, or you could say,
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:27.040]   by the way, use the Google calendar API instead, and it will do that last time I checked, it doesn't
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:34.000]   do lists. So unfortunately, it has to be a modern language apple soft basic, it's going to happen,
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.040]   it's going to happen. Jason check this out. I use a program called the script to basically transcribe
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:48.640]   our podcast, right? And then my my partner on our podcast for Ecamm, she basically was turning it
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:55.440]   into a blog post. And I was like, Katie, I want to try something for you. But we cannot summarize
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:39:02.400]   our podcast transcript directly with, I call them Chad, right with Chad, because Chad could only take
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:10.000]   4,000 ish words or so. I go, let me try something. So I, my Python is crusty. I mean, like super
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.920]   crusty, like not even good. Anyway, so I go in there, I says, listen, I want to summarize this
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:23.360]   text into chunks. I want to hold the chunks in an array. And then I want you to summarize the
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:29.520]   chunk stack after it's all put back together. And after you're done that, give me the blog post,
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:37.040]   skeleton with H1's H2's, give me the key takeaways and write me five social media posts that will
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:43.520]   port back to the podcast so that people can see the actual episode. And it did it. And I was like,
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:48.800]   wait, my Python is horrible. But I was able to make the minor changes that I needed to do.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:54.400]   And then I followed a bunch of tutorials online. But it basically takes our transcript now
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.800]   and generates all of what I need. And recently, because of four, I said, now give me some mid
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   journey prompts based off of my key points to kind of generate images. And it works. It like 100%
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:15.600]   works in it's yeah, it's been in mid journeys, progress to version five came out. It can do hands
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.480]   live as gory. You can do hands. That's kind of amazing. Here's Brad bit wrestling a bear.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:27.440]   It can also do biceps, triceps, pecs, and forearms. Yo, I'm going to a mid journey, make me a
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:35.280]   buffetal the poor. Well, somebody somebody in ours on our staff did do that. They put me in
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:41.360]   only murders in the building. And I don't know if that really like that. I'm like, Oh, yeah. And
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   Andy, I meant to ask you, are you making Louisiana version or the obby 12 version? Because there's
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:49.200]   a Puerto Rican I have to ask that question. I'm starting with Louisiana. Because I like the Creole
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:58.000]   seasonings. No, no, no, I'm out, man. I am out. What kind of red beans with rice do you make, Doc Rock?
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.760]   No, it's very, it's very similar. I was just diesel, Leo. I mean, teasing Andy, but look,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:09.440]   I just go over to pop a Louisiana kitchen and get their red beans. Yeah, it's it's very similar,
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.080]   but you just add a little extra so free to enter the game. Oh, yeah. Yeah, no, you got
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:20.240]   it. Oh, I don't make anything. I'm so free to first. My problem is the consistency. I've made
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:26.480]   it like twice so far and it's tasted wonderful, but it's like come out more like a soup, you know,
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.440]   than so I don't know if I should be mashing more of the beans or whether I should cheat and add some
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:36.960]   as well. Listen, there's plenty of us in Boston. So just go find your neighborhood
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:41.280]   Puerto Rock restaurant and get to a real deal. I'll be trailer and adjust accordingly.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:52.320]   This is a mid journey five picture of Mike as Chihuahua's doing their podcast. And I think it's
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:58.480]   quite good, actually. Yeah, that is great. The the bouquet now the everything that it's just
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.720]   incredible. In fact, number of the prompts I've seen people will actually say what camera,
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:07.920]   you know, they'll say Sony a seven. This is where DP review is handy right now. Yeah,
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:14.000]   because I can say I want to pull off a Fuji X 100, but I'm a Sony shooter. I don't know all
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.320]   the right Fuji lenses. That's right. Fuji has a different type of style, right? So I would be
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:24.880]   able to go to DP review and like what are the best like really expensive Fuji lenses. And you can
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:32.160]   call up the exact model of like a foodie and it will simulate it. It's kind of like one of the
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:40.800]   best resources Amazon. Tarn you. Here's a Sony a seven R 485 millimeter F 1.0 picture of a kitty cat.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:46.320]   This one I really like I did this one without telling it the camera I just said is a black and
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.640]   white cat sitting in San Francisco fire engine. I think they're getting good enough where you
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:56.960]   can't really tell if that's a real photo. And so instead of going to Europe this next week,
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:05.120]   I'm just going to sit at home and do mid journey post my pictures and I hope you enjoy the trip.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:11.840]   It's funny. It doesn't you know, I mean, there's some things that's still not good at.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:19.840]   But it's pretty amazing what you can do. And Jammer Bee's been making rugs out of his cat.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:24.640]   It's good. I like that. And maybe we can tell it to make us a picture of the red socks
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:29.360]   winning a pen and again. Oh, that'd be good. It's getting far from my memory.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:33.280]   If Brad Pitt can wrestle a bear, the red socks can win the pen.
[00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:43.680]   All right, where were we? Apparently, according to Mac rumors last week,
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:50.880]   Apple engineers are working on a chat GPT like AI. Not maybe for Siri someday. Maybe not
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.240]   actually this New York Times. It's New York Times saying it.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:01.440]   Let me let me go back here. Siri Alexa and Google Assistant lost the AI race,
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:07.760]   according to the Times. Yeah, but the race ain't over yet. And I think it's just a matter of time
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:14.560]   before we could get something pretty amazing. They have Scott forestall back in the day
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:22.240]   asking Siri to define the word mitosis. I don't know if today, I think that was 12 years ago.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.840]   I think that you asked Siri today, it'll say, here's what I found on the web for that.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.160]   But it would be kind of cool if we could get, I don't want him to be chatty.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.680]   But some like summarize yesterday's news would be interesting, right?
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:43.440]   Yes. I just don't want to be like go, you know, like, hey, I was saying, what's the weather?
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.560]   It's like who you live in Hawaii, go outside and check for yourself.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:52.160]   I'm waiting for sassy serious. That's care. I would say that. Yeah, that's care.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.880]   You're going to look for yourself. Me bag. I'm busy.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:01.120]   Meat bag. It loves to call us meat bags. You're the one who thinks it has free will.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:06.560]   So Andy, you got into the bard. When did you, when did you ask for an invite? How long ago?
[00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:12.960]   I don't I asked for an invite at around 10 a.m. I also fired off an email to
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:20.080]   like shortly after that, I don't know which one hit, but I'm still on the wait list.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.920]   So I think that second move was a good. Yeah, it's pretty good. Tell them, can you
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.360]   invite my friends to like?
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:34.480]   How can I get more invites compared to a chat.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:43.760]   It's similar. It's you know what it. I like the fact that it doesn't try so hard to sound
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:47.840]   like a human being. It doesn't sound like a robot, but it's clearly here is the information
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:52.560]   that you've requested, summarize and formatted in a way that you that you've asked for it.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.600]   For instance, I just asked, how do I get more invites into bard?
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.040]   Says there are a few ways to get more invites into bard. And there's one, two, three, four,
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:04.320]   five bullets, sign up for the Google AI insider program, follow Google AI on social media.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.960]   Oh, interesting. Keep an eye on the AI website. Ask your friends and colleagues if they have
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.800]   any invites. If you know somebody's one. Hey Andy.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.160]   So you'll be getting invites, I guess.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:21.280]   Patient. Yeah. Yeah, beep. Hopefully. Well, yeah, they just put this online today as far as I know.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:23.760]   And so they're getting in the game too now.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:31.360]   And it seems to be wired up like a, you click through a couple screens where it says,
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:36.960]   yeah, this is this is this is an experiment. We're not it's not ready to ship yet. Help us to help
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.120]   us to make this work. And underneath every single thing, there is a thumbs up, thumbs down. If you
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.760]   give it a thumbs down, it will let you explain exactly how it got that wrong or was disappointed.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.560]   And there's also just a button says Google it, which is very, very hysterical.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   Well, I also noticed that when I asked it for that recipe, it didn't just give me the recipe.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:47:00.400]   It also gave me or excuse me, I asked for a factual information about no, both of them.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.840]   It for the recipe, it gave me a link to all recipes.com.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:08.880]   For when I asked about a comic book character, see, okay, do you understand the origin of this
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:14.240]   character? It gave me the Wikipedia explained it and then linked me to the Wikipedia page.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:18.640]   So basically, it's it's really is presenting itself as high. I am a piece of software that
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.840]   helps you to look to get information. Ask me a question and I will, I will, I understand that
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.000]   the humans enjoy English language. So that's why I've been programmed to do that. It's not like,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.040]   I'm sure that you can't say, I'm sure that you can't get it to like pretend that it's a real person.
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:40.080]   Well, don't don't think people won't try. That's oh no, that's part of the fun of chat.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:44.400]   UBT is the jail breaks, right? And the biggest the biggest value of this test is
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.200]   everyone's going to try to break it because we're Americans. So it's only available in America,
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:53.280]   in the United States and Canada, I think right now. And we're the jerks. We're the ones who say,
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.360]   hey, here's a clean piece of wall. Let's spray paint something on it. Hey, look, there is a bike
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.160]   chained to a tree. I can't steal the bike. Why don't I just bend the tires? God bless America,
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.480]   let freedom ring. It grows up on the streets is what I'm saying. It's tough.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:12.000]   All right, let's see. What else was a rolling stone wherever he hanged his hat was his home.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.200]   All it left, Bard was alone. Sorry. I think they can't ease glitching a little bit. Why don't you
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:25.040]   press the reset? Let's see. It's fine. Sorry. Close my window and reopen it. The Kremlin has
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:35.680]   informed officials. Stop using iPhones. Actually, if you look at the information, it's any smartphone,
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:41.920]   they even Putin doesn't use a smartphone. Yeah, yeah, a little extra hype there about the iPhone.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.560]   Yeah, iPhone or Android, and the argument is basically like, look, other countries,
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:52.880]   intelligence, communities have exploits that they can use. So you probably, if you're running
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.600]   Russia or you're a high up in the government there, you probably shouldn't be using a compromise phone.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:03.840]   Yeah, you probably shouldn't, especially with operating systems written by American.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:12.080]   If your phone does not run on vacuum tubes, it is a tool of the enemies of the appeal.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.600]   Most in squirrel are listening.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:22.880]   Commerce, a Russian newspaper quoted officials at a Kremlin organized seminar
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:29.040]   for officials and domestic policies as saying, it's all over for iPhone. Either throw it away
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:35.440]   or give it to the children. Give to kids, give to children. Everyone will have to do it in March.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:41.600]   Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Piskov said he could not confirm the report,
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:47.840]   but smartphones should not be used for official business. Any smartphone has a fairly transparent
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:53.280]   mechanism, no matter what operating system it is, Android or iOS. Naturally,
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:59.440]   and the most important thing is the more secure the phone is, the more often it is limited in
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:05.760]   functionality. The main thing is that it doesn't work out like, doesn't work out like with super
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.520]   complex passwords that are impossible, not only to crack, but also to remember. So you have
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.080]   to stick a cheat sheet in the back of the keyboard.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.240]   Mary, just like Henry from Barry Barrie.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:25.920]   That was a very good Henry. I love Henry. I tell you how many track suits I got hanging up in the
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:31.520]   closet. Just ask me. This is Mac Brick Weekly.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.720]   Mac Brick Weekly.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.520]   Mac 911.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:42.080]   Bad Russian exit.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.120]   Don't use an iPhone. I wonder if they're banning TikTok.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:51.920]   No, no. Chinese are our friends. They're helping us to spy.
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.240]   Please, please use TikTok, but not on phone.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.680]   Not on phone. Yes. Don't use phone. Use on the special. Apparently, I did read an article that
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:04.400]   said they're working on their own phone operating system. That'll go well. That'll be good.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.320]   Yeah, that's OS.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.400]   Let's take a little break here. More Apple News still to come, but I want to tell you about our
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:17.120]   great sponsor, Melissa. It's funny, as I've gotten to know Melissa over time, I've really
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:21.760]   being more and more impressed by the range of things Melissa can do. We always have talked about
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:26.480]   Melissa as the address experts who can take your contact list and make sure everything's up to date
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:32.320]   all the zip codes are accurate and emails and so forth. But really, Melissa can do so much.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:36.560]   More effectively, they finally put out a solutions catalog with a list of all the things they can do.
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:41.600]   One of the things you might want to know about this is a new functionality that Melissa is adding is
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:48.720]   verification, authentication. Digital onboarding and ID verification in business these days is
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:55.120]   absolutely necessary, not just to reduce fraud, but to ensure the peace of mind of both you
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:52:01.920]   and your customers and your suppliers. You'll also be able to improve customer engagement with
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:07.600]   Melissa. Melissa verifies the authenticity of ID documents. It does it fast too.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:15.520]   Let's customers securely submit identity verification anytime, anywhere on their preferred device,
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:22.800]   if you wish on it with an easy to use mobile app. So there are four things that Melissa does that
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:27.120]   you want to consider when you're looking for a digital onboarding and ID verification service.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:35.040]   Of course, ID check. Today, machine readable zone or MRZ and optical character recognition,
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:42.000]   OCR technologies can instantly identify document types such as passports, drivers, licenses,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.560]   other country IDs. So in the ID check, step your solution, Melissa does this, of course,
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:54.240]   should extract client data and populate data into your relevant systems like CRM platforms with
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:59.360]   no manual entry. No manual entry means no silly fumble-fingered mistakes, right?
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.960]   Accurate all the time. Also, a biometrics check. That's another item to consider. Make sure your
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:11.360]   perspective customers who they are, who they say they are, biometric checks can use smart facial
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:16.400]   recognition comparison algorithms to recognize a match between a selfie and an ID image. For
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:22.240]   instance, the check should also distinguish changes like facial hair makeup, hairstyle and more.
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:27.520]   How about a liveness check? That's another of the four things to keep in mind. Along with a
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:32.800]   biometrics check, a liveness check needs to be present. Apple does this, for instance. This check
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:39.120]   determines if a person is live instead of just a picture of the person, right? It distinguishes eye
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:46.480]   movement, other small changes to ensure the user's authenticity. And finally, the fourth most important
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:51.440]   tent poll in all of this is compliance reporting. Make sure your digital onboarding partner
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:58.080]   keeps full audit trails. Customer due diligence reports. These reports are critical for your business.
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:02.000]   They should be organization controlled with the ability to evaluate any time you want.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:07.600]   Along with compliance reporting, you should be able to review and approve customer submissions
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:14.720]   with these. Needless to say, Melissa does it. Melissa does it all. Get all this and more with

[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:30.240]   We thank them so much for their support. Have you heard Steve Jobs AI voice?
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:40.080]   But they do know. Let's play a little bit of this for you.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:48.560]   This is from Forever Voices, I think. Hello? Make a sound.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:53.280]   Oh, maybe I'm not getting sound. Oh, I know what's wrong.
[00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:59.600]   However, we have a doubt. There we go. Let's go back. I'm gonna have a chat with Steve. Steve.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.880]   Undoubtedly, the biggest global event that occurred in 2020 was the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:10.720]   It has affected millions of people worldwide and brought about significant changes in the way we
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.960]   live, work, and interact with one another. And of course, that's important because he passed
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:19.920]   in 2011. He didn't know about COVID-19. What else can you tell me about?
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.880]   How will COVID-19 impact Apple?
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:34.800]   I was slow. Sorry about that. Yeah. All right, let me play. I got another one.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:39.440]   They take time and money. People forget about that. Yeah, you got to think. This is actually
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:45.920]   somebody's recording. COVID-19 has had an impact on Apple. It led to the closure of some of our
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:52.160]   retail stores and disrupted our global supply chain. However, we have adapted quickly and
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:58.160]   continue to innovate. This is somebody named John H. Meyer who trained in AI on Steve Jobs' voice
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:04.080]   and connected it to chat GPT using the API and then connected it to Facebook Messenger.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:14.000]   So he can message Steve Jobs. Somebody else has done something similar. Richard Stalman's Ted Talk
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:23.760]   was turned into, well, basically it took Richard Stalman's Ted Talk, took the transcript and got
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:30.160]   Steve to narrate it, which by the way, makes it much more compelling. And it's fun to hear Steve
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.120]   promoting non-proprietary open software.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:40.720]   Listen, this is very convincing. This is 11 Labs, which does a very good job, I think.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:47.600]   Thank you. Thank you very much.
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:56.000]   We have some great philosophy for you today. I'm really excited to introduce the importance of
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:03.360]   free software and the liberation of cyberspace. Now, a computer is a universal machine. You can
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:10.320]   make it do anything with the right program. Most of these programs have two forms, the source code
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:16.160]   that programmers write and change and the executable, which is a bunch of signals for the process.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.640]   And that, of course, should be executable. But that's the kind of mistake humans make.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:27.600]   That makes it more human, right? That's really impressive because if you've heard,
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:31.360]   if those of us who've heard Cliff Stal speak, he has a very, very,
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.440]   not Cliff Stalman, who is even, I'm sorry, Richard Stalman.
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:43.200]   Even for weirder diction, yes. This is clearly trained on, it sounds like on jobs as keynotes,
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.520]   right? So it's got that keynotes. It has that keynotes thing.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:50.560]   We've got this great philosophy for you today. It's funny. I wonder if you trained him on the,
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.800]   he used to be on the the analyst calls, the financial calls. If you trained him on that,
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:59.840]   I wonder if he'd have the talking to a Wall Street analyst, but I really don't want to be here for
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:03.280]   ways that he had on those. Anybody got a recording? Let's try.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.680]   Now we dig that way. It would have been great to have the voice of when,
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:12.960]   so we used to get these calls into retail, like once every quarter or whatever, we would just have
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:16.800]   like a family meeting and all the employees sitting there, we're on the floor and they would pipe
[00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:22.640]   the chats in. It'd be really cool to hear those talks because they're not intended to be outbound.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.440]   So you just hear him talking like a normal person. Yeah.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:31.360]   Normally excited about something that we were doing in retail, but the best one was in
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:37.280]   June when he came and says, "Hey, I'm going to send you guys all the present. You'll find out about
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.040]   it in two days and everybody in the company is getting one and we kind of didn't know what it was."
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:48.000]   Was it an iPhone? It was iPhones. We all got our OG iPhones, but Stephen Ron came on the
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.040]   Wall. That's what it was in the store. They came in the Wall. We're all sitting on the floor.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:58.880]   We're all like making guesses. At that time, a rumor mill wasn't very rich like it is. There
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:03.600]   was a couple of people that guessed iPhones, but yeah, it was incredible when we all got our first
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:07.760]   iPhones. You should have saved it and it's sealed package. You'd be worth a little more money
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:13.440]   right now. Another sealed, there seems to be a lot of these original iPhones. Another one just sold
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:25.360]   for $50,000 in a recent auction, $54,904 and it marched 16th. It also had Apple, co-founders
[01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:32.480]   Wozniak and Jobs signatures on an Apple. Let's see. Variety things. An Apple Lisa one owned by
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:42.800]   Dell Yocum, former Apple executive. A Apple One computer autographed by Woz. Believe it or not,
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:49.760]   I can't believe this. Somebody bought an iPhone 11 with Tim Cook's autograph for $4,000.
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:59.360]   Next time I see Tim, I'm going to have him sign a few things. What else sold? I think Steve Jobs'
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.720]   business card sold for $6,000. There's some collectors out there. I love this.
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.800]   Anybody want to buy some business cards that have my name on it?
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:15.520]   I got a stack. I got a stack. I got a stack. I got a stack. I got a stack.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:22.160]   I was doing deep, deep, deep house cleaning and I had this. I'm talking about a huge
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:26.960]   boot box full of business cards I've collected at trade shows since the 90s.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.400]   And now, damn, I'm going to see if there's a Mickey-Mantle rookie card in there.
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:39.920]   Here's Bill Gates, personally used TRS 80 model 100 computer with an autographed note.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.480]   Well, I don't know if it's autographed. It says, "I don't need this anymore. It's Microsoft property.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.080]   I'm going to start using the model 700 bill."
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.800]   Property of Microsoft Corporation. But here's a big one. This is the big,
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.240]   the biggie. This is the original X, Y, axis, mouse and coding.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:07.680]   Cording, I think they got that wrong. Cording key set used by Doug Engelbart in the mother of
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.840]   all demos. I think it was a reproduction. I don't think it was the actual one, but
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.760]   it was like contemporary. Yeah, because I've seen the original one was made out of wood.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:21.360]   But 178,000 dollars. Yeah.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:27.360]   I think, I don't know if it's the original one, but it's pretty close to it.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.600]   I got a press release on that the other day. Oh, okay.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.200]   And it wasn't the one.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:38.320]   Doug, we interviewed Doug on Tech TV many years ago, and he brought the wooden mouse that he used,
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.000]   looked just like this, but was made out of wood. That was pretty remarkable.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.840]   By knowing it would be worth $178,000, I'm going to have taken it from him.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.960]   Oh, more, yeah, far more than that. You don't think the only thing I top that is the actual camera
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:55.440]   that Steve Jobs threw at an engineer's hand when he came up with a demo with myself.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.600]   I 128.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:00.800]   Still see bits of hair on it.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.480]   Mac prototype, 16,500. I like the buckle. This is the Hermes version.
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:08.320]   Should the buckle is nice.
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:13.840]   I don't understand that. Jason has one of those. I put money on it.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:18.080]   This was given to it says, according to the auction house, a limited number of Apple employees.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:23.120]   So, yeah, you got a phone, but somebody got one with the leather buckle.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:31.680]   I've got some stuff, but a leather belt for my Mac 128 is not one.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.480]   No, it's not.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.240]   Strangely, I don't have that.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:39.680]   Steve Jobs, a business card. Is it signed? It's not even signed.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:46.800]   $6,188. It's just a business card from 1983.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:54.960]   Man, I have like a 2010 Leo LePorte card from Mac.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.240]   What can I give for now?
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:56.880]   Nothing.
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.520]   Nothing.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.640]   I got to hang over from the chief in one night. What does that count?
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.040]   There you go.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.240]   Really an interesting auction. A lot of interesting memorabilia.
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:14.960]   I'm glad the very least that because of these auctions, we're getting like high resolution
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.400]   imagery comprehensive imagery of historical items and artifacts that otherwise aren't being
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:27.840]   documented. And so, yeah, I mean, I would never be able to. If I wanted one of those input sets,
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.640]   I would probably hire someone to make me a reproduction for a lot less than that.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.760]   But I want a picture of exactly what seems to be a working version of these.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.000]   It doesn't look like it was built for display.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.360]   You can actually see where on the corded keyboard.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:50.160]   And I've never seen that before. There's how many people will ever get to actually see
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.760]   what a lot of these devices look like. Just the other day, I was excited because a version of
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:03.520]   the RCA CosMac home computer that I'd never heard of was a production development unit.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:08.080]   And again, I'm not, I'm thank you. That's probably worth $3,000 if that's what you're asking for,
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.640]   sir. But thank you for posting high resolution pictures that I'm now saving to my hard drive
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.720]   because now I get to look and see an examine and have a little bit more understanding of
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:22.000]   what this really prototypical home computer of 1976, 1977 looked like.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.520]   All right. I have a story from Giz China. I don't know whether to trust it or not.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:37.360]   Somebody named Effie Ooden wrote European Union, Hertz Apple again, cannot limit USB type C charging
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:43.120]   speed. So what Apple does, correct me if I'm wrong, if it's a MyFi made for iPhone
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:51.120]   charging cable, it could charge faster than a generic lightning charger. Is that right?
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:56.160]   Well, this is, well, this is concerns of the switch over to USB-C to comply with the EU's
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:01.440]   new edict that the EU has said that no, Apple, you absolutely do have to create you can't
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:06.160]   pack in a dongle to comply with this new rule next to starting next year, you will have to create
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:14.000]   USB-C iPhones that will sell in the EU. And there is some, I read this, that was actually
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.520]   put the article in the notes. So I thought it was an interesting question. I didn't really think
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:22.800]   about it until I started reading the EU rules myself. And it does seem as though if Apple,
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.680]   there's been a lot of news in other tech press about how Apple tends is going, intense,
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:33.920]   the sort of sour the milk of USB-C charging by saying, yeah, but it's not going to be totally
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.640]   standard USB-C. It's not going to, you know, it's kind of not going to support fast charging and
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:44.560]   basically all the really good features of USB-C 2023 charging unless you use an actual certified
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:54.720]   by Apple MIFI cable. And according to the text of the edict from the EU, if it if plain English
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:07:00.720]   is the actual truth and is it ever in an illegal document, it says that no, you can't you can't
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.360]   fudge this, you can't force people to get a special cable in order to use this. Just having a USB-C
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:10.320]   shaped connector is not enough. You have to have a USB-C connector that features all the charging
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:16.960]   capabilities of any standard USB-C cable. So if Apple, if the rumors we're seeing elsewhere are true,
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:23.120]   Apple might have to defend that choice in the EU. And I'm sure they must have had this discussion
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.840]   before because I can't imagine that they would want to take that risk if they're folding on putting
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:33.760]   USB-C on the on the iPhone. I can't see why they would want to take a chance that they're still
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:39.520]   going to be baninated from the market. I Samsung does this. I don't know if Apple does it but Samsung
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:45.600]   allows higher charging speeds with Samsung made devices. I bet Apple's excuse to be similar to
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.160]   Samsung's which is well, we don't want you to do fast charging if it's not something that we
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.880]   really are sure is well made. We don't want the battery to explode. This is for your safety.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:02.720]   You're not letting us innovate. Stinkers. Yeah. So the EU is apparently saying, look, it's got to,
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:10.560]   you can't do the made for iPhone certification gives you better charging than just some
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:18.960]   you know, PD device. You have to adhere to the USB-PD specs. And so well, I don't be, you know,
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:24.000]   that would make sense for them to do that. It'll be interesting to see how Apple gets around it.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.720]   I bet you they can. Somehow. Maybe you put it in the box but you offer it faster charging for sale.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:38.560]   How could the EU stop that? If it were better than standard USB-C charge,
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:44.880]   better than standard power delivery fast charging, I think probably get away with it. But I think
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:50.240]   that the wording of the law is saying that you can't simply say, okay, guess what, you're going to get
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.880]   5 watt charging if you don't use an Apple branded charger and Apple branded cable.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:02.960]   So offer PD capability charging in the box but doesn't mean they couldn't do something better.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:08.400]   You know, there's some, there's circuitry in those Apple cables, right? There's all sorts of
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:16.800]   stuff going on. Somebody has got the Half-Life 2 engine running natively on Apple Silicon.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:24.000]   That is a good, that's a big deal, right? This is from Reddit. Half-Life 2 source engine running
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:32.320]   natively on Apple Silicon. Now this is admittedly not a modern engine but still widely used.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:39.120]   So that's a large library of games. Like to get Portal running natively under Apple Silicon would
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:45.120]   be pretty interesting. Whether this could be adapted to whether the people who own Portal would be
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.440]   interested in actually doing that sort of port. That's another question but the fact that it's
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.400]   on GitHub so it's not something that someone in a lab did it just to prove that they could do it.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.360]   So that's good news. People, if Apple tells these engineers that here are things that we're not
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:03.760]   supporting in Apple Silicon, they're saying, well, let us demonstrate whether or not we can do this
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:10.800]   on Apple Silicon and then tell us. Right. At least I can play my Gary's mod. My new MacBook.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:20.800]   Let's see. What else is going on? Apple seeks Indian labor reform because they'd like to
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:32.160]   manufacture in India. But right now, labor laws in India are perhaps not as palatable to the
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:37.120]   Western taste as Apple would like. They've had success doing this in China though, right?
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.440]   Yeah, and that's exactly what they're trying to do. They're basically saying that if you're
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.800]   going to be making Apple products, you have to at least have the labor laws have to at least
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:52.880]   come up to the standards of what we've got going on in China. So that's a positive thing. There was
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:59.360]   very, very reassuring because a couple of weeks ago, there was another news item that said that
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:07.120]   Apple was also lobbying to have certain laws relaxed saying that we need workers to be able
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.520]   to work longer hours and more shifts. So we would like you to roll back some of these protective
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.000]   laws for labor. So if they are legitimately saying that we want to have parity with China,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.120]   not that not the Chinese workers have it as well as an American work would have, but it's still
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:24.720]   an upgrade over what they would have if they didn't stick their nose in.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:29.760]   And also shows one of the interesting features about India. We view as Americans, I think I know,
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:36.080]   I always view India as this monolith, right? It's this big country, world's largest democracy,
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.040]   all of those things. But the fact is it is a federal system and it is a strong federal system.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:47.280]   And this Bloomberg article, it's interesting. Like one state in India has already passed
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:58.080]   some legislation about this. That's Karnataka, but they want this change in Tamil Nadu, which is
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:02.720]   where Foxconn operates, the largest iPhone plan. So it's one of those cases. And I've heard this
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:07.280]   before when we talk about and apologies for pronouncing away. I said, I didn't even understand
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:11.280]   how strong the federal system was until a few months ago, where it came out that Apple,
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:16.720]   that's one of the hurdles in Apple expanding in India, is that they go to China and basically say,
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.200]   hey, China, this is what we need. And yeah, they can go to the Indian government and say, hey,
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.960]   this is what we need. But what the Indian government basically says is don't look at us.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:31.200]   That's the state's job. And then they have to lobby in the individual states, ideally,
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:35.040]   where there are already factories that they could use with their manufacturing partners.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.280]   And it gets really complicated. So that's, it's interesting that Apple is basically going from
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:45.600]   state to state now in India in order to get labor laws changed so that they align with what Apple
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.960]   is looking for in it. It doesn't sound like they're trying to do anything like, as far as I can tell
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:56.880]   anything evil, but it is much more about like flexibility of shifts and being able to do over time
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.280]   where people get paid for overtime and they do two shifts of 12 instead of three shifts of eight
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.360]   and stuff like that that is just not allowed in certain states in India right now.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:11.920]   So good thing Alex Lindsey is in here because he'd be apoplectic if he saw this next story.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:18.400]   Microsoft assuming that the EU is going to enforce its rule, allowing third party app stores on iPhones
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:24.320]   and Android phones. Microsoft preparing to launch. They're working on already a new app store
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:33.200]   for their games on iPhones and Android smartphones. The new law would, the Digital Markets Act would
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:40.240]   come into effect next March a year from now. Phil Spencer at Microsoft talking in an interview
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:44.800]   ahead of the GDC conference, the game developers conference in San Francisco says we want to be
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:51.200]   in a position to offer Xbox and content for both us and our third party partners across any screen
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.000]   where somebody would want to play. This was the big battle with Microsoft. Apple said, well,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.480]   you can't do a store with a bunch of stuff, but you could do one by one, which is of course,
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:07.440]   I'm kind of absurd. So, you know, I imagine they're not alone in this that everybody,
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.520]   Epic and so forth, they're preparing their stores.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:15.120]   Andy and I have been doing this a long time. I know you have to Leo, but like,
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:20.720]   doesn't it feel like almost warm and cuddly to think, oh, Microsoft is an antagonist to Apple.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.800]   It's like the good old days. Good times. It's good old days. Yeah, look at that.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:31.680]   It's good times. Actually, it's funny because that came up on Sunday, we were talking about the
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:38.640]   imminent banning of TikTok and how companies like Facebook have been using the existence of TikTok
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:46.000]   to say, we're not a monopoly. Look, there's TikTok just as Microsoft when Apple was this
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:52.400]   close to going under in the mid 90s, gave Apple $150 million. Bill Gates, remember showing up in the
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:59.040]   keynote giant looming over Steve Jobs because Microsoft didn't want to be a monopoly and they
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:04.480]   were being investigated by the Department of Justice who sued them a couple of years later
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.360]   for being a monopoly. So they said, we need a strong Apple.
[01:15:07.360 --> 01:15:13.760]   I think I don't think Microsoft's trying to put Apple out of business. I think they're just looking
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.400]   forward to selling their games on the... Apple has stymied them at every time.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:22.800]   It's so frustrating. The idea that Apple's like, oh, yeah, you can just put every single item in
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:26.880]   your streaming service in the App Store and it'll be reviewed individually. And it's like,
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.320]   that's... They know what they're doing there. So I'm happy to see that Microsoft's fighting back.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.280]   Are you saying they did that on purpose? That was a big fat middle finger. Are you saying that?
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:47.040]   There is some peril for Apple. I think it's been a while since Apple has really boasted about
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.880]   how many billions of dollars that they've generated for developers at the App Store because by now
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.480]   everybody knows that the people who are making money, the fact that are making money on the
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:16:04.480]   App Store, are games and games through in-app purchases. So if the major flow of cash were to be
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:11.600]   diverted because Microsoft can now have their own App Store and all these other games houses
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.480]   can have their own App Store. They don't necessarily have to kick in in-app purchase money to Apple.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:22.000]   That could hurt that bigger, bigger piece of the pie. The services wedge of the pie keeps
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.120]   getting bigger and bigger. That could really take some wind out of the sales of services.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:32.320]   By the way, Andy, here's the problem with your red beans and rice. There's no rice in there. You
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.200]   put some rice in there. All that liquid is just going to get sucked right up.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:41.440]   That's obvious, right? I know how to make rice. I wasn't practicing rice.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:49.520]   But thank you. Thank you. That is a good observation. You put a little...
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:54.080]   Just maybe don't have it cooked all the way. That kind of thing. You get some
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:59.920]   delicious... Or maybe like a loofah sponge at the bottom of it. That looks really good. I'll be
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:08.160]   honest with you. It was damn tasty. It doesn't... It's like a lot of amateur cooks where it's like
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.360]   it doesn't look like the picture. It doesn't look like picture. It's like a close-up.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:20.320]   Yeah. I make most of the appreciating a ramen bowl game. That is legit ramen bowl right there.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:28.080]   Very nice. It's not like water to the person in the chat. It is like a thick sort of like...
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.880]   It's almost like a chowder-y sort of soup. There is a trick you can use. You can take some of those
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.800]   beans out, use an immersion blender to blend them and then put it back in. Mash them up and
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:44.480]   put it back in. I do that. I love that. That makes it give it a little... I make beans almost
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:49.600]   every week. I usually use black beans because it's such a good flavor. So anyway, that's our
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:54.400]   cooking segment. I hope you've enjoyed it. We are really light on news today. I swear to God, I got
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:00.400]   nothing. You can make red beans and rice in the rice pot, Leo. Oh, I never thought of that.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:05.200]   You just put the dry beans or you have to cook them at a time. I would... I would
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:10.480]   put them overnight and they're kind of wet or just cheat and use canned beans. Yeah, you can
[01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:21.040]   totally do that in the rice cook. I'm trying to figure out... I've been using a staple of any
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:26.320]   good kitchen. It's like canned red beans, canned black beans. I'm like, maybe I have never tried
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:33.200]   making red beans from dry. Should I try it? Just to see if it's very easy and it's actually
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:37.280]   a lot tastier and it costs a lot less money. Just between us kids, you don't have to soak them.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:45.920]   That's over written. Over just... Yeah, I think that's true. Yeah. I believe you got... I don't
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.640]   want to kill my grandma. Well, the problem is you have to think about it a day before. You got the
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.880]   cult cooking device, the Instant Pot, that then it takes about an hour. It's easy. I made black
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:01.440]   bean soup yesterday and that was it. Yeah, super easy. I have a bean recipe book called Cool Beans.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:10.560]   So they got it a title and then had to come up with what I do now. But one of the things that he
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.720]   says, I'll tell you a secret, I never soak my beans. You just cook them a little bit longer
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:19.680]   and they come out great. You know, it's the most incredible bean thing that I started making and
[01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:23.360]   I actually have to do it again this weekend because we're a little bit late getting started.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:29.040]   But I get soy beans from Amazon and I normally on my Japan trips, I bring back Koji,
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:33.600]   which you can also buy from Amazon. I have to go get it from Japan and we make our own miso now.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:39.760]   And it's so freaking good. And the dope part... So you just basically, like Jason said, you
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:44.320]   instant pot your soy beans until you get them soft enough to smash and you want to smash them
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:49.360]   almost like mashed potatoes and you put in some salt and some Koji and you got to use your actual
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:57.360]   hands because your hand flora fauna is what starts the sort of bacterial process, the micosis, if you
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:03.760]   will. You smash it all up, you get it nice and going and you just put it in a bucket airtight
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:08.880]   with a layer of salt and plastic and just hide it from four months. When it comes out, you've got
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:15.520]   like perfect miso. It's so good and it's much, much better than the stuff you buy from the store.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:21.440]   I'm getting texts from my buddy Patrice. She's saying like, this is like a foodie flashback
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:28.320]   movement because we always talk about foodie stuff, right? Andy would never be doing your show.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:33.920]   So yeah, we get hungry towards noon around here and that's just what happens.
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.800]   There are a number of times on the show because here on the East Coast, like we're over, we're
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:46.560]   over to around 4.35 and between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. My dirt plans go from, well, I bought a salad
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.560]   and I'll put maybe some Italian dressing on it too. Maybe I'll get a double bacon cheeseburger
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:55.920]   from the restaurant in the neighborhood. The double bacon cheeseburger, that's always a good out.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:03.600]   All right, I swear to God, I don't have anything else. Anybody want to throw anything in? Is there
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:09.920]   any breaking news? It's a very light day and I guess we shouldn't fill. We don't need to fill.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:17.120]   So you just had a curiosity. I'm really trying to decide if I should take this trip. We're going,
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:22.480]   we're going in a week, we're going to Lisbon, spend a few days there, going to cruise a little bit
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:27.600]   around the Mediterranean, ending up spending a week in Rome. And I'm really trying to decide
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:33.920]   because I know if I had, maybe I'll just take the Leica, this because that's a street photography
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.320]   camera maybe, just take that. That's just one thing. It's not even interchangeable lenses.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:47.600]   The Insta360 and you got to have the 9 meter carbon fiber. The regular one is fine. I just
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.360]   really enjoy the 9 meter because it allows you to pull out drone shots where you're not supposed
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:55.840]   to fly a drone. Yeah, that's what Anthony did. I could believe it when I saw the footage. It was
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:02.880]   amazing. Half the time, I just haven't mounted either to my chest or sticking out of my backpack,
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:09.120]   you know, full law and Mando style. Yeah. Just having grabbing shots. Yeah. And you just as you,
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:12.480]   as you're walking around, you just shoot it. And then if you see something good, you could just
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:18.000]   say, I want that frame kind of thing. Right. Right. And because it's so light, oftentimes what I
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.560]   kept doing while I was taking shots is I just put it on the normal stick. There's a battery
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:27.120]   stick which comes in handy if your phone starts to die. And I put it on the battery stick and I
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.520]   just handed the Karen in like here, hold this. And then she just starts aimlessly walking around,
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.040]   not realizing that it's recording, but I'm getting great footage while I'm doing something else.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:42.800]   All right. Okay. You know, the one thing that's changed for me, I still take a good camera if I can,
[01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:48.560]   but my attitude has changed from I'm here to take the most brilliant, wonderful picture as I can.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:54.000]   It's that's changed too. I'm here to capture as much data as I can to bring back home and create
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.920]   a really good picture, whether it's I want to just get the most pixels I can and the most
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:04.640]   valuable pixels I can to in a raw file. A lot of it is now, Hey, this is a really good space.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.160]   I'm going to just take random pictures from lots and lots of angles. And in case, a piece of software
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:14.320]   I have now or piece of software I'll have three years from now, can assemble that into like a
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:21.920]   3D VR image in case I can finally get the neural radiance field software working on my Mac and
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.160]   can basically turn this into something that is that can put into blender, then relight and
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:32.560]   re-scape and things like that. So that's that's the that's one of the reasons why I take at least a
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:38.560]   good pocket camera because I know it grabs a lot more data per pixel than my phone can. Hello,
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:44.000]   no depth data. So I wonder if I'm losing out on there. Decisions, decisions. I know it's hard.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:50.560]   It's hard. I also realized that I don't need to take an already a great piece of art every time
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:58.720]   that sometimes just reporting the experience and having it is is all I need. In fact, that's
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:04.160]   going to be my pick of the week. I'll show you that in just a second. But before we get into our
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:10.480]   picks of the week, I would like to give if you don't mind a little plug for our club. We love
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:18.320]   the club club twit. It is it has become a great refuge. There's about 7,000 of us in there now.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:25.760]   There's several reasons for the club's existence. One is, well, we you know, it helps us to fray
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.480]   the cost of the shows. And because you're giving us seven bucks a month, we don't need to play ads
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:35.280]   for you. So people want to add free versions of the shows, track or free ad free versions of the
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.960]   shows. That's one way to get it. Every show plus shows we don't put out anywhere else. The members
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:46.400]   only shows includes a hands on Macintosh with like a sergeant home theater geeks is back. Thanks
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:54.000]   to the club. Scott Wilkinson's AV show. We also have hands on windows with Paul Therat, the untitled
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.800]   Linux show with Jonathan Bennett. The Gizfiz with Dicty Bartolo Stacy's book club is coming up April 6th.
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:07.760]   Sea of Tranquility is the book this month. We also have inside twit coming up with one of our
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:14.000]   great editors, Victor Bognot, Alex Wilhelm doing an Ask Me Anything in May, Sean Powers from Floss
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.280]   Weekly in June, and we'll have other events as time goes by. And Pruitt's our community manager
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:23.840]   does a great job putting those together. The discord is a place you can go not only to talk
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:29.520]   about shows as they're going on. And of course they are a haven for animated gifs or gifts.
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:35.840]   You can also talk about other things geeks like because we have sections including cooking I might
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:43.920]   add and coding and comics, fitness, gaming, hacking, ham radio, movies, music, pets, sci-fi,
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:50.880]   software. There's a lot to talk about and all of that is because it's only people who paid seven
[01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:56.480]   bucks a month in there and are hosts. I think the conversations are fantastic. They're really good.

[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:32.720]   So we thank the club members and invite you to join go to twit.tv/club.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:40.800]   Hey, everybody, Leo LePort here. I'm the founder and one of the hosts at the Twit podcast network.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:44.800]   I want to talk to you a little bit about what we do here at Twit because I think it's unique.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:53.040]   And I think for anybody who is bringing a product or a service to a tech audience,
[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:58.960]   you need to know about what we do here at Twit. We've built an amazing audience of engaged,
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:06.320]   intelligent, affluent listeners who listen to us and trust us when we recommend a product.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.040]   Our mission statement is to build a highly engaged community of tech enthusiasts.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:16.800]   Already, you should be, your ears should be perking up at that because highly engaged
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:21.440]   is good for you. Tech enthusiasts, if that's who you're looking for, this is the place.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.800]   We do it by offering them the knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's world.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:32.240]   And I hear from our audience all the time, part of that knowledge comes from our advertisers.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:38.640]   We are very careful. We pick advertisers with great products, great services with integrity
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:46.480]   and introduce them to our audience with authenticity and genuine enthusiasm. And that makes our
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:51.520]   host red ads different from anything else you can buy. We are literally bringing you
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:58.560]   to the attention of our audience and giving you a big fat endorsement. We like to create
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:04.320]   partnerships with trusted brands, brands who are in it for the long run, long term partners
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:09.920]   that want to grow with us. And we have so many great success stories. Tim Broome,
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:16.400]   who founded ITProTV in 2013, started advertising with us on day one has been with us ever since.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:22.000]   He said, quote, "We would not be where we are today without the Twit Network."
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.520]   I think the proof is in the pudding. Advertisers like ITProTV and Audible that have been with us
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:33.920]   for more than 10 years. They stick around because their ads work. And honestly, isn't that why
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:39.440]   you're buying advertising? You get a lot with Twit. We have a very full service attitude. We
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:46.080]   almost think of it as artisanal advertising, boutique advertising. You'll get a full service
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.000]   continuity team. People who are on the phone with you, who are in touch with you, who support
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:59.360]   you with everything from copywriting to graphic design. So you are not alone in this. We embed
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:05.840]   our ads into the shows. They're not added later. They're part of the shows. In fact, often,
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.240]   they're such a part of our shows that our other hosts will chime in on the ad saying,
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:15.840]   "Yeah, I love that." Or just the other day, one of our hosts said, "Man, I really got to buy that."
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:21.760]   That's an additional benefit to you because you're hearing people, our audience trusts,
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:28.000]   saying, "Yeah, that sounds great." We deliver, always over deliver on impressions. So you know
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:33.760]   you're going to get the impressions you expect. The ads are unique every time. We don't pre-record
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:39.120]   them and roll them in. We are genuinely doing those ads in the middle of the show. We'll give you
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:45.280]   great onboarding services. Adtech with pod sites that's free for direct clients gives you a lot of
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.760]   reporting, gives you a great idea of how well your ads are working. You'll get courtesy commercials.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.640]   You actually can take our ads and share them across social media and landing pages. That really
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:59.520]   extends the reach. There are other free goodies too, including mentions in our weekly newsletter
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:06.000]   that sent to thousands of fans, engaged fans who really want to see this stuff. We give you bonus ads

[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:40.160]   Picks of the week. Let's start with Mr. Doc Rock, our guest for the week. Filonin for Alex
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.840]   Lindsey. Hi, Doc. What's your pick? Is there something else I need to buy now before the trip?
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:50.560]   Well, yeah, but I forgot if I'm going to be Alex, I should have bought something expensive. What the
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:59.280]   heck? Okay. Okay. All right. So this is it. Right. So I was telling you that you don't need to
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:03.680]   send a ring. Actually, you don't need you don't need any handles. But I put the two handles.
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:09.760]   The cage itself is like 40 bucks. Right. It's just a simple really light. This is very Alex.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:16.240]   This is very Alex. I think you nailed it. Sorry. Video guy. This was casted out of a single piece of
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:21.440]   aluminium and it's made by Small Wrig. It's called the universal smartphone rig. And the reason why I
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:27.920]   started buying this as opposed to the ones that used to fit perfectly is I am on the switch phones
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:32.880]   every September, October cycle. And I was having to buy a new $40 cage over and there's not
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:38.560]   the five of them I gave up and finally got universal. End up liking it better because it has quarter
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:45.760]   to 20 holes on every single side and cable management little events on every single side.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:51.360]   So then you can pick up the handles for about 20 bucks a piece. So I have a perfectly good,
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:56.720]   you know, steady hand. If I need to do vertical content, I can still hold it, you know, tightly
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:33:02.720]   like such when I'm doing vertical content. And what I've added to it, which is also in my link,
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.880]   I just put all the parts you can build and how you want to skeleton it. This is the DJI mic,
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:12.640]   which allows me when I'm doing an interview, I'll pull out his twin brother and I'll face one
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:19.840]   towards myself and then one towards the interview. I got perfect sound at 32 bit float. The other
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:25.360]   thing that I do with it is when I'm doing something where I know I want a vertical content and a
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:32.720]   horizontal content, I will pop this bad boy on the top and then put my iPhone 13 here and run it
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:38.640]   in vertical mode like such, right? So I keep the 14 pro max in the body, but I'll put my 13 pro
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.680]   max right there and I'll shoot both horizontal vertical at the same time because it just saves
[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:48.960]   and because of the offset with Apple camera, it happens to end up in the center. And I mean,
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:56.320]   again, you know, $40, 2020, 2020, and then yeah, we won't get into the DJI mic at 329.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:00.880]   The last thing I add to this to make it really good is I have a hummingbird clip on the bottom
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:06.240]   and that's so when I need to tripod it, I can just take my mantis pod, do one of those and now it's
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.840]   you know, ready to go into sun kakumu, aka tripod. And then it's good to go.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:18.960]   You know, this is a funny bird clip. So on every single tripod, I even have this hummingbird clip
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:25.680]   on my Insta360 stick. So if I were to grab my Insta360, I can pop it right here, you know what I mean?
[01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:30.240]   So I just use the hummingbird clips because it's a great way to interchange smaller devices.
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:37.520]   So anything from a small camera, like the ZV 10 or the ZV one, you know, they don't really
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:43.120]   weigh a lot. These work perfectly with like this mod. I could even click it right to the top of the
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:48.800]   small rig mod and shoot both, you know, point and shoot and iPhone at the same time. So it's a
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:54.560]   really great setup. It makes life easy. And you can start it as low as 40 bucks and just add what
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:35:03.280]   you need after. So rather than a single link, I put in a link to just my whole shop. Yeah,
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:08.240]   it's a collection and you just build it as you need to according to your phone. This will support
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:12.240]   pretty much all the phones on the market today. Thanks for putting this together. This is awesome.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:20.800]   Doc rock.live/mobile rig. Is that it? Mobile rig. Yeah, mobile rig. And it's a it's an Amazon
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.720]   wish list or whatever shopping list. But this way you can buy it from him anywhere else. I don't
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:32.480]   care if you buy it this way, you get a little something, something which is nice. I think I
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.120]   will suggest that if nothing else, you get this because a lot of times, which was cool for us in
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:42.480]   Japan, this one is cheap, right? This one is like 20 some of my books, but we would go somewhere
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:47.360]   and I would clamp this baby to the fence. And then I would tell Karen and mom, let's run back.
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:53.440]   And I would just click the button on my phone and you know, a great shot without having to worry
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:59.200]   about anything and not set up a tripod, especially in places where tripods are frowned upon,
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:04.160]   like at a temple, I can mount this on a tree and then just back up and get great shots, you know,
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:08.480]   at King Kakuji or whatever. So I can't I can't say the truth of it. I can't second. I can't
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:15.280]   second. I have enough in terms of payoff for it takes up such little space in your bag. And yet
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:19.040]   it is this every time that you're about to say, ah, I'm screwed. There's no way I can take this.
[01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:24.320]   Oh, wait a minute. I do have a clamp with the tripod mount on it in my bag. And suddenly,
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.800]   congratulations, you can get the shot you want. Yes, you can get the stabilized, long exposure
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:34.240]   thing. Yes, you can get like all four people in the picture at once. And these things, the really
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:38.720]   good professional ones cost like 90 bucks, but I can't tell the difference for my use between those
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:44.400]   and the cheap knockoffs that go for like 10, 11, 12 bucks bucks. So this small ring is 20 because
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:48.960]   it's metal. That's you can get the plastic one because I'm not heavy at all. But the small rig is
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:53.600]   like 20 bucks because it's metal. And a lot of times all I'll do is put a stand any phone mount
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.720]   you already own that came free with something else. Just take that and stick it to the small rig
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:05.760]   and then just bite it on anything and you're good to go. Very good stuff. Doc Rock dot live
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:14.960]   slash mobile rig for a whole thing. Oh, a bunch of them. Yeah, and I'll probably add more stuff.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:19.840]   If anything new comes out, so if anything just pay attention to the list because if somebody
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:23.920]   makes something cool, I'll just add it to the list because everybody has different wants and needs.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:30.880]   So I just try to keep it, you know, keep it functional. I, as I mentioned, we're going to go on vacation
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.800]   for April Fools. I'll be gone for a few weeks in April. And one of the things I like to do
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:42.640]   as I'm traveling is keep track of my travels. Of course, I take a lot of pictures. And
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:47.040]   there is a really cool app you could put on your iPhone called Polar Steps. This is
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.960]   one of a whole category of travel journaling apps. But this is the one I've used
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:56.720]   for some time and has a social aspect you could follow me. I can follow you. It automatically uses
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.400]   location tracking in your phone, which while you may not want that on day to day is great while
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:08.400]   you travel because it makes a map of everywhere you've been gives you some travel tips while you're
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:14.320]   there. All the pictures you take that go into Apple's photos can go in there as part of your trip.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:19.520]   Not all you know, you get to choose obviously and then you look and even and this is how they make
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:24.560]   money on it afterwards because it's free for the app. Make a book out of it, which is really,
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:31.680]   really cool iOS as well as Android as well as iOS. Polar Steps. So I just I want to tell people
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:37.120]   that's what I will be that's what I will be carrying with me on this trip if you want to follow
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:46.560]   along. I mean, I just don't actually don't know what my handle is on there. Is it chief twit?
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:53.120]   Let me check just to see. I'm poking it right now. Does it grab data from the trip last week?
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:39:01.520]   Uh, well, I've got my my my my Mexican vacation on there. So it makes it's really fun. You can plan
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:06.240]   it. Uh, actually, that's the one coming up. There's the Mexican vacation. You could plan it. It
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:11.840]   makes a photo book, but it also sure has a nice map of where you're being and where you're going.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:16.400]   Let's take one where we did a little more traveling. Uh, let's see. Here we go.
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:21.520]   So you the map is kind of cool because you can see all the places you've been
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:28.320]   as you're going there and it has all the pictures you've taken and it makes a book afterwards and
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.800]   it shares it and so I can follow you and you can follow me as you're traveling around as well.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:37.440]   There are other apps that do this, but this is the one I've used before and it's the nice thing
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.560]   is they are keeping it up to date. So it's been around for some time. Polarsteps.com.
[01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:49.920]   If you want to know more, Andy and I go pick of the week. I thought it complete the little journey
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:56.560]   we've been taking over the past few weeks about mutants like me who I like streaming services,
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:00.560]   but I also like having like my own audio and video files. I can play this locally because I
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:07.040]   control my library and I found this really nice video player that essentially works just on.
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:12.960]   It's exclusively for again, the stuff that you actually own. It's called infuse, I N F U S E.
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:19.600]   It's been around for a while. I only came across it about a week or two ago, but man, is it ever
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.800]   feature rich? There are I mean, there are a bunch of really good apps like VLC that will
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:30.080]   play multiple flat file formats and they're okay. They're very, very decent. This one really
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:35.600]   takes it up to another level. Yes, it will play pretty much any file format, any video file format
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:42.400]   that you throw at it. Yes, it will automatically scan your drive for video files that can play,
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:49.120]   but also it will essentially stream files from wherever you've got them. So if you have like,
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:56.800]   I've got most of my really all my video on a on a NAS server as part of my Plex library, I can
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:02.480]   this app can actually just simply connect to it as an SMS volume and then stream all that content
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:08.080]   as a nice little as a nice self contained library. If I have if I keep video files on Dropbox or
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:14.400]   Google Drive or any other web dev sort of service, I can stream it right from there too.
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:21.280]   I can do playlists, I can do collections, it will automatically get get metadata. So I'll get nice
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:28.400]   data about what's with this these files are. On top of all that, it's for Mac, it's for iOS,
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:34.640]   it's for the iPhone, the iPad, Apple TV. And if you pay for the non free version, which costs 10
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:42.880]   bucks a year, it will sync between like all of those devices. So sometimes Plex, I love it. I
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:47.280]   think it's the best in its category, but there's still times when it drives me up a frickin wall,
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:52.560]   where I've got the Plex app on Apple TV and it works, but sometimes oh, I can't find it on the
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:58.240]   network because it's business. It's my NAS is busy doing something else. But but infuse will
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:04.400]   always work perfectly fine because it's not trying to run an entire DVR and file management
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:09.600]   system. It is just simply saying, Oh, here is a source of video files. I have I have seen this
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.440]   this directory before and created a directory of that directory. So I'm going to grab that
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:19.120]   directory off of I off of iTunes and simply mount it in this Apple app, excuse me, Apple TV app,
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:24.480]   and let you play all this stuff. And if you quit in the middle, if you stop in the middle of
[01:42:24.480 --> 01:42:28.640]   a while you're watching something on your iPhone, and then you pick it up later on in the day on
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:33.920]   your Apple TV, it'll pick up right from you started from really, really, really sophisticated. I'm
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:37.920]   very, very impressed with how well it works. This is clearly not just something a weekend hobby for
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:46.000]   somebody. This has been stewing like a good red bean red bean pot for all afternoon, if not for
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.520]   for five or 10 years. So 10 bucks a year firecore has been one for more than 10 years. Firecore has
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.000]   been around for a long I know they're going to see them growing up. They do some other stuff.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:03.840]   Yeah, back in the day, they were a good player for Plex. When we first got like,
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:10.160]   fire sticks and the original like Apple TV. So they've been around for quite a minute. It's
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:15.840]   cool to see that they've grown up into something. Yeah. They were support still be utmost supports
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:19.680]   again 10 bucks a year. Boys, I don't like a lot of great stuff. I'm very, very happy with it.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:23.440]   Oh, I'm gonna have to try that. That's really cool. I feel I feel dumb for as Doc says, been around
[01:43:23.440 --> 01:43:27.520]   for a while. How come I'm not coming across this until just now, it just goes to show you this.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.840]   Some of the best apps out there. They're just not on your radar. And then you find out, wow,
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:34.160]   my life could have been a lot better starting at least seven years ago.
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:44.160]   Firecore comm slash infuse also available on the app store. So nice. Mr. Jason Snell, pick of the week.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:50.320]   So there was an app that was really great called Camo and what it did is you ran it on your iPhone
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:54.480]   and then you ran it on your Mac and you got to use your iPhone as a webcam on your Mac,
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:58.160]   which was great. So great. In fact, that Apple said that's a good idea. And they
[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:02.320]   converted continuity camera, which actually doesn't want better because it builds in
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:07.680]   auto connect, right? Well, Camo Studio two is now out and like any great Sherlock product,
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.680]   they have updated themselves in order to do more because Apple doesn't want to give you any
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:17.600]   control over your webcam. So it's basically a great webcam settings app. It works with continuity
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:22.880]   camera. It works with just about any other webcam that you can connect to your Mac. And then,
[01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:28.800]   and I'm actually using it right now. Oh, what a reveal. And one of the things that it can do
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:35.440]   that I love is it Apple won't let you control the zoom. So I'm zoomed in on my image here.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:41.280]   I can zoom back out. I, I'm not quite on center for my wide shot. So I zoom myself in and then I
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:47.840]   move it a little bit. It also has adjustments. It has its own version of portrait mode that actually
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:53.840]   works better than Apple's portrait mode. It's more consistent with what it shows in the background.
[01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:58.080]   It's got the little spotlight mode. If you want to highlight the foreground, you can do that.
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:02.080]   Everything has sliders that are more adjustable than anything Apple offers,
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:06.400]   because all Apple does is let you toggle it on and off. And then a bunch more white balance
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:10.960]   controls, all sorts of brightness and contrast and color controls. They have a whole catalog of
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:17.520]   overlays. They have a whole catalog of filters. And you can import LUT profiles to change
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:23.280]   your particular image to whatever kind of color profile you want it to be. And yes,
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:26.960]   they still have an iOS app. And if you run that app, then you get complete control over all three
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:31.120]   cameras on your iPhone Pro. And you can choose which one and then you can zoom in on that. Like,
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:36.480]   it's got its own center stage that is actually better because it will not only track you, but
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.880]   they've got a mode where it'll hold the zoom and it won't, it won't zoom in and out. It'll just
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:45.200]   slowly track you, which is really nice. Apple doesn't give you that either. So if you've got
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:49.280]   a studio display, it's not going to make the camera better, but it'll let you control that crop. So
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:53.200]   it doesn't look like you're peeking over the edge of the bottom of the screen when you're sitting in
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:58.320]   front of it. It works with continuity cameras. You can use it with any iPhone that supports
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:04.080]   continuity camera. Beauty of that is there didn't used to be good mounts to put iPhones on laptops
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:09.680]   and on desktop monitors and on iMacs. And now thanks to continuity camera, Apple got at least
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:15.440]   Belkin to build some. And so the experience is actually way better than it ever was with camo.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:20.480]   And yeah, if you've got a 4k webcam that you've been frustrated about how lousy the setting software
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:27.280]   is, camo will probably do the job just as well, if not better. It's not cheap. This is something
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:32.080]   that if you're using video all the time and are frustrated by your inability to control what
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:38.720]   your webcam looks like, it's $40 a year or $80 for a lifetime. But I'll tell you, if you know,
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:43.120]   you know, because you're going to have that moment where you're like, I just want to crop my video
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:52.080]   in the right place. And camo will let you do that plus a whole lot more. So it's just it's the video
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:57.760]   settings that Apple won't give you. And they did a great job. And it just came out version two. So
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:04.000]   highly recommended who need this sort of thing, like people who do two hours about Mac break,
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.360]   you know, on Mac break weekly every week. I like it. It's good.
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:12.720]   I had to get up at eight this morning to do the GTC keynote. And that's what I used to
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:17.920]   home on my on my Mac. But I know it would work with continuity camera. That's kind of nice.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:23.600]   That's good. And the 2.0 added so much cool, cool stuff. Now you say that, but you are an
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.600]   Ecamm guy. Does it compete with Ecamm? No, we can partner with camo. Oh, I didn't.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:36.720]   The version of me at camo is Eden. And she is one of my best friends in the planet. We love
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:42.400]   Ali and the guys over at camo. It's amazing because so many people want to get into this game,
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.960]   but they can't afford to go buy a bunch of cameras. And we always tell them start with your phone
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:52.400]   and the basic phone. We really work. We can just take a phone from a cable,
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:56.640]   but we tell everybody go through camo because it's so much better. So yeah, we love camo.
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.040]   All right. And Doc Rock actually just showed the little camo watermark. That's one of the
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:05.200]   nice things about it. It's not cheap, but you can use it for free with the watermark. They've
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:09.120]   got some limitations, but you can at least try it out and see, is this going to work for me?
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:14.560]   Is this going to do what I needed to do? And so you can try it out and see. But yeah, it's great.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.960]   It really is. I don't know why Apple doesn't give us webcam controls, but they don't.
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:23.040]   They just don't think absolutely. I don't know why I like shooting guys at the top of my dome,
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.960]   but they have really cool overlays like I can put in things like, you know,
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:30.160]   I think arguably that app that iPhone is better looking
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:36.320]   image to be honest with you. This is the Insta360 link. Oh, you're kids.
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:42.960]   The Insta360 links because it's my overhead camera. Look at that. Look at the book. Okay.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:46.640]   I'm going to do this. And of course, well, I should turn that off in this point,
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.520]   because in this particular situation, like Jason saying is when I'm showing somebody something
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:57.760]   from my overhead cam, I normally want to have it, you know, face the right direction. Right.
[01:48:57.760 --> 01:49:04.000]   Right. So I can just easily pop in and flip that bad boy around. That's the standard Insta360
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.200]   link version. And then that's the camo version because I have the stupid book to turn down. But
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:16.800]   I can now look at that. That's a great shot. Yeah. Then what's built into the standard Insta360 app.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:22.320]   Right. And yeah, it's really set. The best thing they did was add ability to fix things
[01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:25.280]   in the app. So I don't have to do stuff like show up on screen like this.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:31.840]   Oh, yeah. Arbitrary rotation. Green screen. Also, if you use a green screen,
[01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.080]   they've got like a green screen filter that actually like makes it. So if your green screen's
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:40.240]   a little bit weak, like it's a few different kinds of green. They have a filter that sort of
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:43.920]   like takes the greens of a green screen and flattens them out so that you'll get a good
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.320]   green screen effect and whatever app you use for that. It's just, yeah, it's a great webcam toolkit.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:52.560]   If you're frustrated by what you can't do with your webcam camo, you should use it. Yeah.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:57.440]   100%. Oh, man. Oh, there's a lot to buy today.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:04.960]   Alex isn't here. Right. We can't. We get that $100. Almost as much. Thank you, Jason.
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:10.560]   Thank you for seeing that. By the way, here I'm I meant to show you the polar steps has a web
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:15.360]   interface too, which is kind of cool because you can see all the places you've been all around
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:21.200]   the world and Leo, it's scrubbing my old pictures. So it's pulling all the people.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:26.560]   Yeah, if it would get it. So it's working and I'm loving it because that means all of my Japan
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:31.600]   stuff and you haven't lost anything. All the places you visited, as long as you have pictures
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:37.120]   in your Apple photos will be part of your, you know, trips. I have looked at all the flags I've
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:40.320]   collected over the years, all the places I've gone. Wow.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:51.520]   I travel 37,692 miles, 29 trips. It's the farthest place I went was Yemen, 8,848 miles. I don't know,
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:56.320]   it doesn't have my Australia trips. It doesn't. So I'm going to have to, some of the trips are
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:01.440]   missing. It's work. Yeah, I got to get to put it to work here. So it's pretty tight myself,
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:05.840]   not until then. Yeah, not now. But isn't that nice? I think I just like the map alone.
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:09.280]   Leo grabs a bag on her desk, Jason, and takes off and like, see you guys.
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:14.320]   See ya. I'll be back next week. I'll be back next week. Michael will take over the week
[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:20.320]   following him gun from April Fool's Day through April 21st, three weeks in April. Sorry?
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:26.800]   Jason, Jason's taking over. I'm taking over. Oh, thank you, Jason. Even better. That's really cool.
[01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:33.680]   Good. That means all. Yeah, good. I can leave it in capable hands. It also means I'll have to do
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:37.360]   the ads, but that's okay. We don't make you do the ads.
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:40.160]   Look at Michael do the ads. Yeah, maybe Michael do the ads.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:48.160]   I'm actually bringing a kit with me so that I can do the ads on the trip if I have to,
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:53.840]   because there's new advertisers coming on. Nice. So you may see some ads from me and
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:52:01.280]   Monte Carlo or somewhere. I don't know. I'm going to, Leo, you just gave me a good reminder.
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:08.800]   I have to invite Ashley, John, to my, um, polar steps because I swear like four times in the
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:13.200]   road. No joke. John's like, Hey, can you come on this week? Hey, I'm traveling. Dang. Okay. How
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:19.360]   about next time? Hey, doc, will you add? I'll send you a go. Okay. I'm in Japan. Like,
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:24.480]   I swear to you, like four times in a row. I'm in Japan or like Seattle somewhere. I'm traveling.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:29.280]   And John's like, Hey, man, you want to come on? I was like, listen, John, look, I'm gonna send you
[01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:34.560]   my, I'm going to add you to my trippin pro. So you know, that's what I use. Yeah, I use trippin pro.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:39.040]   And I say, you just follow me there. You'll know where I am or not. So yeah, John, when you get
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:44.240]   that invite today to Doc Rock from trippin pro, just go ahead and say, yeah, yes, say, you'll know
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:50.000]   he's in town. Yeah, I, you know, it's funny. I didn't travel much. Obviously in the last three
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.200]   years. So this is our first. This was a trip we planned. Yeah, it's kind of fun to be back in
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:01.280]   1820. This is a three year old trip that we're finally getting to take. Thank you, Dr. Rockter.
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:08.960]   It's so nice to see you, Doc Rock. Of course, is on the YouTube, youtube.com slash Doc Rock
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:15.680]   at Doc Rock on Twitter. Follow him. He does lots of great stuff. Especially for creators. He's a
[01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:21.280]   really great resource for anybody who's doing, you know, videos as you can tell, obviously.
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:25.760]   It's always great to see you. Thank you. Thank you, Doc. It was really fun. Really, really fun.
[01:53:25.760 --> 01:53:31.200]   I enjoy catching up with you guys. Yeah. And I get to just totally nerd out at people who are at
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:35.840]   actually above my nerd level, no, I'm talking to people who are on the nerd. So I like, I like
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:40.160]   talking to you guys better. What's your handle on a polar step so I can follow you there?
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:47.120]   Oh, let's go. Doc Rock. Of course. I try to get everything first before somebody. Some geologist is
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:53.680]   raising me now. He's pissed. Damn it. I'm the Doc Rock. Thank you, Doc. So great to see you.
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:54:00.320]   Thank you. Always a pleasure. Mahalo. Mahalo and aloha. Mr. Andy and I go, when are you going to be
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:07.840]   on GBH next? I'm on Friday at 1230 in the afternoon, and that's happening live at the
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:14.080]   GBH Boston studios at the Boston Public Library. So come on in, get yourself a, excuse me, pay for,
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:19.680]   buy a coffee and a, you know, grab it. They'll chase you down. Yeah. There's a cat. There's a
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:24.880]   very lovely cafe there that has lovely, lovely sandwiches. And watch me again, pretend not to be
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:29.680]   reading from notes, even though I'm totally reading from notes. And if you can, if you can,
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:35.120]   if you can't be there in person, you can stream it at wgph news.org for the audio live or later.
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:39.280]   And because we're at the big, huge, wonderful Boston Public Library studios, this actually
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:45.360]   can be streamed on YouTube. So you can stream it on YouTube live or later at wgph news channel on
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:50.720]   YouTube. So just be clear, the, the radio is public, the library is public, the sandwiches are not.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:58.080]   It's a very late stage capitalism buffet. Let's say, let's put it that way.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:03.920]   All right. We tell us more about what's going on at six colors.com, Jason.
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:08.560]   You know, Dan Morin is on vacation this week and nothing is happening. So I'm
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:12.160]   searching through the couch cushions, trying to figure out things to write about. We'll write
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:18.400]   about something somewhere somehow. But you know, it's just like podcasts are you just gotta find
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:23.520]   something to say about something. I got a list of evergreen stories for a rainy day. And it is a
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:28.080]   rainy day today. So I'll be using that list. Yeah, six colors.com. Check it out. All my
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:31.760]   writings there links to all my podcasts are there. So that's the best place to find.
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:37.520]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here. And of course, if you go to six colors.com/chason.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:42.720]   That's Leo mandated page. I made made and make that page. Leo wants that page.
[01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:47.280]   You thank me later. Okay. Lots of great stuff. Lots of great stuff.
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:52.560]   Thank you all for joining us. We do Mac break weekly. It's my first show of the week. So it's
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:58.880]   my Monday, but it's Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern 1900 UTC. You can watch us to
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:03.760]   it live. That's why I tell you what time it is on the streams, which are at twit.tv/live. There's
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:09.600]   audio and video chat with us live in irc.twit.tv. Of course, club members get to chat in our
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:19.280]   lovely discord. Always great fun. And after the fact on demand versions of the shows available
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:28.400]   at twit.tv/mbw. There's a Mac break weekly YouTube channel, which has the video. And you can
[01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:33.040]   subscribe in your favorite podcast player to the audio or video version and get that the minute
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:38.320]   it's available. There we are all wearing our weird glasses. That's interesting.
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:46.640]   That was last week with Zach. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody did that to us. I don't think we were
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:54.240]   all coordinated. Very nice. I had the perfect smokey eye that week too. I don't always wake up
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:58.080]   really enough to get my whole face on. We're going to get on red. I mean, that's fine. I
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.320]   mean, it's fine. They should have put the red noses on there. We're wearing our AR headsets.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:07.840]   That's what it is. They're up. I see. That's it. So we will see you next time. Now I must tell
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:14.160]   you get back to work because break time is over. See you next time. Bye bye. Hey, we should talk
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.480]   Linux. It's the operating system that runs the internet, but you game consoles, cell phones,
[01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:23.440]   and maybe even the machine on your desk. You already knew all that. What you may not know is that
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:28.400]   Twit now is a show dedicated to it, the Untitled Linux Show. Whether you're a Linux pro,
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:32.720]   a burgeoning Sisitman, or just curious what the big deal is, you should join us on the Club
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:39.520]   Twit Discord every Saturday afternoon for news, analysis, and tips to sharpen your Linux skills.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:44.720]   And then make sure you subscribe to the Club Twit exclusive Untitled Linux Show.
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:53.280]   Wait, you're not a Club Twit member yet? We'll go to twit.tv/clubtwit and sign up. Hope to see you there.
