[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.480]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.880]   where we cover the latest Apple news,
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.440]   and there's a lot of news.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.040]   Fortunately, there's a lot of people here.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.440]   I'm going to start all the way to the right.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.720]   Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.240]   Time's great to have you here.
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.720]   Hey, Lou.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.160]   You're kind of out in right field today.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.800]   That's OK.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.000]   This is where the deep flies hit and also
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.200]   where you can get a good nap.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.000]   And you can talk to the fans out there,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.720]   as long as they don't throw hot dogs at you.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.560]   You're OK.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.200]   To your right is Jason Snell.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   I'm a first base today.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.480]   First base.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.000]   Say it's baseball season.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.600]   Sixcolors.com.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.360]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.040]   Yeah, welcome.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.880]   I'm so thrilled.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.760]   I didn't realize this.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.920]   We'd never met in person.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.400]   I know.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   It's great.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.040]   It's Randy Caldwell's here.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.640]   I'm very happy to be here.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.560]   From I'm more.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.080]   Yes.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.440]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.440]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.960]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.160]   And Boston.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.160]   It's nice to be in weather.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.960]   Oh, I bet.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.080]   Doesn't require a park up.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.760]   I bet.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.480]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.120]   Same with you, right?
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.880]   Renee Richie from I'm more.com.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.560]   This is summer.
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.040]   This is just wonderful.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.360]   We're actually having chilly weather.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.200]   I hate to say it.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.880]   I was hoping we'd have nice warm weather for you guys.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.280]   We're running down the street in short sleeves.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.080]   Yeah, I went to the beach on Saturday.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.800]   I'm happy.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.520]   From our Yinzan Bob way or Pittsburgh.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.160]   I'm in Rwanda, actually.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.320]   I try.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.440]   But it's hard to keep track of him.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.440]   Alex Lindsey.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.520]   Parapatetic.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.040]   Alex Lindsey from pixelcore.com.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.560]   I knew that.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.120]   Rwanda.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.120]   You're in Kogale again.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah, I've been banished.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.400]   I got banished to the studio today.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.320]   So they were doing work in the classroom.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.120]   Actually, it looks cool.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.040]   I got a jib coming out of your ear.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.680]   It's nice.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.440]   Yeah, I know.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.400]   They were working on something.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.240]   They were working on some--
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.720]   Oh, I love it.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.480]   --at furniture in here before.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.400]   So that's funny way.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.920]   It's like I'm talking to JJ Abrams in the set of Star Wars.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.320]   Just polish up your R2D2.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.400]   So three out of the six here, half of the panel,
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.600]   was at the event yesterday.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.920]   Jason's, Serenity and Renee.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.200]   And really, the event isn't such a big deal,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.520]   because we saw that all on streaming.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.960]   But you got to handle stuff.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.400]   Right.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.200]   Fondle maybe.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.320]   Fondle it.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.160]   I want to start with not the watch,
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.000]   because that wasn't-- there wasn't much new there.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.360]   But with the MacBook, which was rumored,
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   but the rumor came true.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.000]   All my dreams came true.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.720]   And I was having a little fight in the chat room
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.040]   with some people in the chat who said, oh, that's
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.000]   a crappy computer.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.520]   Who would want a computer?
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.880]   We're talking about the new MacBook.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.080]   Two pounds, 16 millimeters thick, which is not much thicker
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.200]   than an iPad, really.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.080]   But one connector, the USB-C connector.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.920]   Jason, is that too few?
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.840]   I mean, I actually use you as an example.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.360]   I was running the SEU2.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.880]   Both of you.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.280]   All of you, chairs, and loungers.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.640]   I would say-- I'm going to go out on the limb here
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.920]   and say that anybody who's in an IRC chat room watching
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.480]   a live stream of this weekend's tech shows--
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.080]   It probably has a lot of wires coming in.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.160]   Maybe not the people who this product is for.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.520]   I mean, this is the iPad of laptops.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.640]   It's meant to be super simple.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.120]   It's meant to be the laptop that's
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.240]   at the edge of Apple's product line of laptops.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.200]   The MacBook as a product means there's room for the MacBook
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.160]   Pro, right?
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.800]   I mean, that's the--
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.960]   Well, it is actually the name.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.120]   Either the Air or the Pro.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.440]   That's right.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.960]   Will they, Serenity, is this the beginning
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.920]   of the end for the year?
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.600]   This might be the burgeoning of a new MacBook empire.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.360]   But I don't necessarily think that it's
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.360]   going to come in the next six months.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.560]   Apple spent a surprising amount of time on wireless specs
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.040]   during their presentation on how, oh, wireless is the future.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.600]   You don't want to be tethered to wires.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.960]   You want all day battery life.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.840]   You want wireless beats, headphones.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.720]   You want to live a wireless life if you're using a laptop.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.760]   But they're right, I think.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.160]   No, I think they're absolutely right.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.920]   I don't know if we're quite there yet.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.040]   We were talking before the show.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.920]   You were taking photos, and then you were tapping using NFC
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.680]   to tap them to your phone.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.200]   Wireless?
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.480]   Yeah, wireless, which is great.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.680]   But it's a little bit harder to do that with a DSLR
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.520]   to a Mac right now.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.200]   You know, there is an NFC support.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.080]   An AirDrop doesn't exactly work with a Sony or a Canon camera.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.520]   So there are still things that you might need some wires for
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.120]   currently.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.400]   And also, at the event, Apple's like, all day battery life.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.080]   And I'm like, wait, is this true?
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.800]   Are we going to get 12, 14 hours?
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.280]   The day just got shorter.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.160]   It's the same nine, 10 hour battery life of the iPad.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.280]   And also the 11 inch share with the 11 inch share starts
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.840]   at nine hours.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.200]   Now, the 13 inch MacBook gets more 13 hours.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.880]   But an Apple usually is a little more conservative.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.040]   You know, it's funny.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.360]   Somebody was comparing it to the Dell XPS 13.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.120]   It said, but the Dell XPS 13 gets 15 hours in your dreams.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.040]   That's Dell's spec.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.800]   It gets much more like five or six hours.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.880]   And Antech is really good about busting those sorts of ways
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.520]   because they have really good battery tests.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.080]   But I forget the manufacturer.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.840]   It was one.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.280]   It was one of the Korean manufacturers.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.040]   They included you being asleep for 12 hours.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.440]   That's when you see that a lot of the phone specs where--
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.880]   oh, yeah, but you never turn it on.
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.920]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.600]   24 hours battery life if you're sleeping for 12.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.040]   Stand by.
[00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.760]   Apple's usually pretty right on, I think.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.280]   Yeah, they get scrutinized heavily for it.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.080]   So if you're in the crosshairs, you
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.280]   have to be really honest about that.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.720]   A few years ago, they changed their testing methods
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.640]   to be much more based in reality.
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.800]   And they're the people who do a lot of their performance
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   testing or people who used to do performance testing
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.040]   in public for computer magazines and things.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.360]   And they're real numbers.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.440]   I mean, they're never going to give you
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.560]   a number that really makes them look in a bad light.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.880]   But I think the numbers they give you
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.920]   are based on tests that are fairly real.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.240]   Even yesterday with the event, they
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.440]   for the watch, they put up a page explaining exactly what
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.240]   they meant when they said--
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.040]   -- battery life, yeah.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.760]   --almost like a power like, wait, before you get angry at it.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.280]   This is exactly what you're doing on that.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.400]   Andy, I think it was you who said it
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.840]   would be nice to have a 4G solution in the MacBook.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.320]   It does feel like that would be you.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.800]   That would really put it over the top.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.200]   It feels like that would be a natural thing.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.000]   Given that it seems as though the design aesthetic was,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.400]   let's make an iPad only.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.800]   Let's find a way to split it into a MacBook, an iPad Air,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.400]   and fold it open.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.920]   And so you really kind of feel like you
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.520]   want to have mobile broadband in there.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.040]   When you look at the internals on it,
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.440]   you wonder, a SIM card is this big, after all.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.960]   Where would they find room for inside there?
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.000]   They could squeeze it.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:57.480]   It's--
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.240]   They have an issue with the licensing, too,
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.040]   because especially if you want to use it in the US,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.240]   you need CDMA still for Verizon.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.200]   That means you've got to double the licensing fees.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   You paid a Qualcomm.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.560]   And Qualcomm's licensing fees.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.080]   It's a rumor.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.280]   No one's ever confirmed it.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.760]   But you pay on retail, not on wholesale prices.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.120]   And so it could be up to $100 or more per computer.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.840]   This is why iOS 8 and Yosemite added this super fancy,
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.320]   friendly, tethering feature.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.360]   I think Apple's official policy now is--
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:24.920]   Use your phone.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.600]   Use your phone.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.280]   It's really easy.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.600]   Once you set it up, it just works.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.520]   It's that you don't have to worry about it.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.200]   This is the adapter Apple's going to sell you.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.880]   And I think if you take a MacBook home,
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.440]   you probably want to take home the $79 USB-C digital AV
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.280]   multi-port adapter, which gives you HDMI, full HDMI out,
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.880]   full USB and power.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.160]   So basically, now with this little dongle,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.560]   you plug this into the Type C and you can power up.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.480]   You can have USB and you can have--
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.880]   Oh, crap, is that elegant.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.480]   Yeah, it's like an--
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.600]   It's an adapter.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.800]   I mean, I'm a little surprised that they didn't come out
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.800]   with a really nice Apple design hub that sort of like--
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.440]   Like a dock.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.160]   If you want a dock this, here's a dock.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.560]   It's Powerbook Duo style.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.680]   Yeah, I know.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.200]   That would be nice.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.400]   I'm sure some third party will.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.280]   But it would be nice to have something that plugs in there
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.680]   and will throw out video and a few USB ports and--
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.680]   I'll tell you why Apple did not do that.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.320]   They want to really emphasize the idea that some people
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.000]   will compute this way.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.240]   I notice I rarely plug in-- well, this is an exception here,
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.040]   but this is an unusual situation.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.400]   But with my laptop, I rarely plug anything but power into it.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.840]   I think only when I'm docked somewhere
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.000]   and I think is that a really common use case where
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.960]   you're docked somewhere and you're sitting on a table
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.680]   and you've got a bunch of drives plugged in.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.120]   And I think they would say, well, we got a MacBook Pro for you.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.960]   I'd do it for the show.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.560]   I'd plug a mic in and a camera.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.560]   But that's for the show.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.920]   Yeah, and so those of us who do that will buy a Mac Pro
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.040]   or a Macbook Air even.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.720]   I think it's a big market for people
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.760]   who are never going to plug it in, Alex.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.720]   Yeah, and I have to say the thing that concerns me
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.520]   was a real naysayer when Andy said
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.120]   that you'll really miss the ethernet cable.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.640]   And I miss the ethernet cable about once a week.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.520]   And so I guess I'm just always like, I can't believe they
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.960]   got rid of the ethernet cable.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.040]   And so it is something that--
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.280]   what's going to happen is that we're
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.200]   going to forget the dongle.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.360]   The dongle is going to be in the other bag.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.080]   You're not going to be able to connect to anything.
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.520]   So I think that that's a big concern for my perspective.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.600]   I have to say they also spec it out.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.360]   I mean, it starts at 8 gigs of RAM.
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   It starts with a 256 gig SSD.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.560]   They said new two times faster SSDs in all of the Macbooks.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.040]   What is that?
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.680]   E-M-M-C or M-M-C or some other sort of SLC?
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.240]   I don't know either.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.800]   Twice as fast.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.280]   And they also announced that there
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.360]   was options for the higher end Mac Macs as well.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.640]   And I think that one of the things nobody's really
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.600]   said much of, but as huge is that Apple didn't develop
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.040]   for proprietary single port solution.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.160]   This is a standard.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.360]   And USB Type C, I think this is going to jumpstart that.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.440]   I hope it jumpstarts out.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.240]   My only concern is that like you and I
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.080]   have gone back and forth about our cinema displays,
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.480]   because the original one was the LED display,
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.000]   and that just had display port.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.480]   And then the new one was a Thunderbolt display,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.640]   and he used Thunderbolt.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.600]   And now the Type C connector supports DisplayPort,
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.680]   but not Thunderbolt, which is DisplayPort plus PCI.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.360]   And it's my guess that the video on that
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.200]   has been in the past non-standard.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.080]   There is a video standard for Type C,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.440]   and I guarantee you Apple's not using it, is what I'm saying.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.360]   Well, it sounds like it can transit DisplayPort,
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.360]   so the video should be fine.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.120]   And I believe that it's just a password.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.840]   So you can throw up to 4K video from this computer.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.520]   Nice.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.120]   It's just, I don't know why my Thunderbolt monitor
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:39.960]   is going to work now.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   Am I not going to get sound?
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.800]   And is it going to pass through the sound over you?
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.360]   Apple has never had a problem killing.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:45.800]   You know.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.520]   Products that they have still in the store today.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.480]   Or like Firewire 400 and 800 and then nothing.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.360]   And Thunderbolt did not get traction.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.200]   And I think taking a step back and saying,
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.920]   well, let's use just a standard USB Type C.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.520]   Maybe then we'll get some help from PC makers.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.560]   I, I, for one thing you know, Intel will release in a few months
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.480]   a reference design of an exact clone of the MacBook,
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.680]   just as they did with the MacBook Air.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.920]   And then PC makers will make it, and we'll see Type C everywhere.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.960]   And this might be a much better thing.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.400]   It doesn't do everything Thunderbolt did.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:18.920]   No.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.520]   It's just because Thunderbolt was the hub,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.240]   the Thunderbolt display was Apple's version of the hub.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.160]   You know, I'll get to that.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.360]   It didn't do power, which is interesting.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.000]   No, it didn't.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.120]   But it would give you the ethernet adapter on this display.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.960]   It would give you the multiple USB ports.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.760]   It would do all this stuff.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.760]   And you could daisy chain multiple devices.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.080]   And now I'm wondering if the next Thunderbolt display will
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.520]   be that for the new MacBook.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.240]   It'll be as a Type C that'll go in.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.440]   It'll have some of the Apple's--
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.000]   4K USB 3.0 display.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.640]   I think Apple's out of the display business.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.360]   I think so.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.560]   I think they're out of the desktop business.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.080]   I really do.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.360]   I feel like this is--
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.000]   Retina 5 came iMac.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.680]   I love that.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.120]   But that's not a standalone display because it can't be.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.720]   No, not yet.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.200]   Not yet.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.680]   Maybe not ever.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.840]   The new display's port standard is going to support that,
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.560]   you know, in a single cable monitor.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.080]   You Apple doesn't care.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.360]   I thought we'd have 4K displays from Apple by now.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.520]   I think they could make a display with really nice margins
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.000]   that they'll sell to people with a Mac Pro.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.720]   Yeah, they have those.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.200]   I think it'll happen.
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:10.840]   They have those displays.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.400]   They just need the chipsets and the computers
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.120]   that support them.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.240]   And that's why I think Thunderbolt isn't
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.200]   going to completely vanish.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.000]   But I think Thunderbolt's going to still be on a lot of systems
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.800]   as a super high--
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.920]   you know, it's way faster than USB 3.1.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.240]   That you can put a whole bunch of other stuff off of it.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.640]   I think it'll stick around.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.280]   But, you know, we'll see how USB-C goes here
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.640]   because we may see a lot less of it.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.400]   It may become like Firewire did at the end.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.200]   And we should say this is not a new USB spec.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.240]   This is just a new USB connector.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.440]   So it's no faster than USB-3.1, right?
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.600]   No, it's USB-3.1.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.480]   I have helpful people in the chat room pointing out it is--
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.200]   And one of the things--
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.000]   And one of the things that we've noticed--
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.200]   I mean, we're very touchy about the performance.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.320]   And we do find that there's a certain level of overhead
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.280]   with USB that you wouldn't normally
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:59.320]   have with Thunderbolt or HDMI.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.120]   So this is--
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.400]   Right, so it's going to put more pressure.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.480]   This is going to put more pressure on a small computer
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.400]   than a raw HDMI cable would.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.120]   But I do have to point out Thunderbolt has just not
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.800]   taken off, right?
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   I mean, it's not--
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.300]   True?
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.100]   It's expensive.
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.200]   It's hard to license.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.180]   Yeah, I have a Thunderbolt dock at home that I use for this.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.100]   And it's super expensive.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:19.700]   And it's great.
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.260]   And I hope that there's something like that for USB-C.
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.580]   But it's ridiculous.
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.740]   And I really-- we all hope that Thunderbolt would be much more
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.860]   readily available than it's become.
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.280]   It just-- I think someone that has to--
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.860]   I'm the idiot at the bottom.
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:36.260]   I'm one of 10 idiots that bought the little big disk for $1,269
[00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.260]   for a terabyte.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:38.660]   Perfect for your micro.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.900]   It looks good with the Mac Pro.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.820]   Yeah, it does.
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.900]   And it's a 10-state.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.700]   So--
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.780]   Yeah, you know, I don't like--
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.860]   OK, this is really 1%er.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.220]   This is 1/10 for 1%.
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.140]   I don't like using spinning drives because I hear them.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.220]   And the Mac Pro is silent.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.940]   And the Thunderbolt 2 is silent.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.460]   And I put a spinning disk and suddenly, what's all that noise?
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.180]   It's a drive.
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.820]   And I think that it hasn't been successful in a consumer
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.780]   level or a prosumer level.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.660]   But on the pro level, Thunderbolt is everywhere.
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.820]   I mean, you have--
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.660]   Oh, yeah, we just have an enormous number
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.500]   of our pieces of equipment that have Thunderbolt built in them.
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.620]   And we couldn't do what we do without something that fast.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.620]   And it's really changed--
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.340]   But it's got to be a small part of the market.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.260]   And Apple's turned its back on the Pro market, haven't they?
[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.340]   It was telling when there was a big deal that
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.340]   focused the new movie that just came out,
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:30.260]   was the first movie edited on Final Cut in Hollywood and--
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:30.780]   Final Cut.
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.140]   Oh, but first, the main software market--
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.300]   There's the Pro software market.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.420]   The Pro hardware market.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.300]   I mean, the Mac Pro is a really good popular professional
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:38.820]   tool in it.
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:39.820]   The MacBook Pro is great, too.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.740]   And it got the new trackpad, too.
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:41.940]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.100]   It wasn't ignored.
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.060]   Oh, the force--
[00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:45.100]   The Pro was terrible.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:45.700]   What is it called?
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.780]   The Force Touch.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.940]   Technically, it's the trackpad powered by a Taptic Engine.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.220]   But it comes with Force Touch, which
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.980]   is a fancy way of saying that the trackpad, despite not
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.780]   having physical components, is pressure sensitive
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.740]   and tries to fool your brain into thinking
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.620]   that you're actually clicking.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.380]   It doesn't try.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.020]   It succeeds.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.540]   It does.
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.040]   It does.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:06.500]   So you guys tried it.
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.300]   It makes you think that physics has been alive.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.740]   Because you know that you're not pushing anything.
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.580]   But your brain knows that it's not.
[00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.020]   But your finger feels like it.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.060]   And you know, actually, it's moving sideways.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.940]   But it feels like it's moving up and down.
[00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.140]   And your brain just wants to melt.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.820]   Because if you stop thinking about it, it's fine.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.940]   But you start to think about it, it's just complete--
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.620]   New Mac Pro.
[00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.620]   --new Mac Pro.
[00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.460]   Haptic interface and brain--
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.060]   I want to know how seriously--
[00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.140]   I would really like to see a magic trackpad with this.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.100]   The exciting thing to me is not so much the trackpad.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.780]   I mean, the trackpad's about this big.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.100]   But the fact that they jumped so quickly from the watch,
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.300]   which is here, to the trackpad, which is here,
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.420]   they've been working on this technology for four or five
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.260]   years--
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:42.760]   Force touch.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.380]   --force touch and haptic feedback.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.380]   Is it hard to do?
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.540]   No.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.540]   Well, hard to do well, I think.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.660]   They have been working on it for quite a number of years
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.180]   to really, really make it feel like something--
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:55.780]   It's just a button that you press hard.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:56.780]   But it's not a button.
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.460]   It's not a button.
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.620]   That's a tricky thing.
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.540]   It's glass.
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.420]   And what it is is basically vibrations
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.580]   that make you think that you're pressing further down.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.340]   So it's not a whack-em tablet that
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.780]   has pressure sensitivity to it.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:07.940]   It's pressure sensitive.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.460]   But then what your pressure will kick off this little vibration,
[00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.340]   and it makes it feel like you click down,
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.300]   except it didn't move down.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.500]   Oh, oh, the vibration is what's tricking your mind.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.500]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.900]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.300]   And the really cool thing, at least on the Mac,
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.820]   is that they're going to open that up as an API for developers.
[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.260]   And they haven't officially revealed
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:30.060]   how many levels of pressure sensitivity on whack-em tablets
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.500]   you hear, like 10, 24, 2048 levels.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.100]   Apple hasn't really done anything specific with that.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.900]   But they have a couple of examples,
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.900]   especially what they were showing at the event.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.780]   They showed off, for instance, QuickTime, which
[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:47.460]   had, I think, four or five different click levels,
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.780]   where you were fast forwarding or rewinding through a video.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.420]   And as you pressed--
[00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.500]   Hard to harder you press.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.340]   Yeah, you could feel each individual click.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.900]   And it's like a gas pedal where you start to press down,
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.340]   and you can see it going further.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.100]   And you can feel as you go like ramp, ramp, ramp, ramp.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.300]   And then as you let up, it slows down again.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:05.820]   It comes back.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:07.980]   See, I think that's a very interesting idea,
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.780]   because it does give you some physical feedback.
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.220]   The developer can make little curves.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.820]   And whenever a curvature is, you have to press harder
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.420]   to go through it, and they can set those in the--
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.340]   Andy, I think you were a little skeptical
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.540]   about losing the physical click.
[00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.420]   Well, I was reacting back then to Mark Herman's report
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.580]   about this device, which was very incomplete
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.420]   in a couple of important places.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.580]   It only mentioned that there was no more clicky button
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.500]   underneath the trackpad, which would
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:36.820]   have implied that it's going to a 100% tap to click interface,
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.100]   which would have been a bummer for me,
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.300]   because I just can't get used to tap to click.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.460]   I'm always misfiring it.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.820]   Another thing that he didn't get correct,
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.740]   if I'm assuming that I was reading his piece correctly,
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.820]   is that he seemed to be saying that the physical keyboard was
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.380]   going to be narrower, and they were putting the keys closer
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.540]   together to make the keyboard fit on the plane
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.020]   that they're putting it into.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.700]   As a matter of fact, the opposite is true.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.580]   It's the exact same width as a standard keyboard.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:05.300]   But they changed the gap between keys
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.580]   to make the keys actually physically larger and easier
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.340]   to hit.
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.020]   So overall, my reaction to that definition
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.580]   was that I wouldn't have liked it if they were making
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:18.820]   a $3,000 professional notebook that you have to really make
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.060]   a lot of adjustments for.
[00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.420]   The fact that they're making something that
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.540]   is so radically slim and so radically light,
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.940]   that means that some allowances are allowable in even
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.900]   the lack of ports.
[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.500]   But I'm so appreciative that Apple said, well,
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.460]   it won't do to simply make everybody switch to touch to click.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.020]   We're going to give you something that will trade off
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:38.500]   on that.
[00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.700]   It wouldn't be OK for us to force people
[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.860]   to adapt to a smaller keyboard, even if we
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.860]   have to create an entirely new type of key switch
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.380]   to give somebody something like the feel
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.020]   that they would have on a regular keyboard,
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.100]   we're going to do that too.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.580]   So there's practically nothing about this design
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.460]   that I don't like overall.
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.500]   I noticed that I actually turn on the tap to click anyway
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.300]   on my MacBook, on all my MacBooks.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.540]   I hate tap to click, and I can tell you this is not tap to click.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.220]   This is--
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:07.820]   No, not even remotely.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.780]   So something you didn't know happy with tap to click
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.460]   will be even more happy.
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.700]   If you didn't know that this was a fraud perpetrated on you
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.780]   by pressure sensitivity and a little vibrating engine
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:20.500]   under the thing, you would not know that they took out
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.740]   the push down click.
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.180]   You would not know.
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:25.260]   And now if they tell you, then your brain melts.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.940]   But you wouldn't have to click.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.300]   Because I just do--
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.740]   I miss tap all the time.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:30.220]   I miss tap.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.300]   I'll give you a great example.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.860]   When I have tap to click on, especially on my Magic Trackpad
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.100]   on my iMac, when I'm typing on my keyboard,
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.500]   if I even remotely brush the Magic Trackpad, yeah,
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.780]   it thinks you tapped and it'll move.
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.140]   I'll be typing and it'll jump three paragraphs up
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.700]   and then all of a sudden half of a word
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:47.780]   I was typing ends up in another word.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.980]   And it's a nice idea, but it doesn't feel concrete.
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.180]   And this really feels concrete.
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.500]   And it's a very polarizing thing,
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.860]   because I see other people in the chatroom saying,
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.140]   I hate tap to click.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:56.700]   But I love it.
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:57.620]   And I turn it on immediately.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.100]   And when I can't turn it on, I get pissed off.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:20:59.700]   I have a--
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.020]   And then tap to click is still there.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.340]   I mean, the important thing here is--
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.820]   No, but this sounds like this is perfect for me.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.100]   This is a good help.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.620]   Are they going to put this in the iPhone?
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.820]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.740]   So this is what I'm really excited about,
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.420]   is that we've got this technology.
[00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.820]   They've finally kind of ironed it out.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:16.020]   There are all these rumors about an iPad pro
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.540]   with pressure sensitivity.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.380]   And this is--
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.100]   I mean, if they-- if they institute force touch
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.820]   in the Taptic Engine in an iPad, think about this.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.820]   Imagine a keyboard, a virtual keyboard on your iPad,
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.180]   that when you tap the keys, it feels like you're actually
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.420]   tapping keys.
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:32.020]   And when you're drawing, you can actually
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.140]   tell the line differentials.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.900]   And certain developers can put in things
[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.780]   that when you tap a button, a physical button,
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.740]   it actually gives a reverberation.
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:41.060]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.580]   So you could do it for the full screen?
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.580]   In theory.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.580]   I mean, it's not necessarily--
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.860]   I just don't like-- I think physical home buttons
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.820]   are a throwback.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:50.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.260]   That was my first thought when I saw this one.
[00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:52.820]   It was a home button.
[00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.340]   You could get rid of the home button on the iPhone
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:54.860]   with this technology.
[00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.220]   Which is where people complain that we want smaller screens,
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.300]   actually want smaller phones.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.780]   And then you can liberate a lot of the space in the casing.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.820]   Well, and it's also your eliminating a point of failure,
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.460]   because anything that moves--
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:05.980]   Right.
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.540]   It was reassuring for a generation of people
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.340]   moving to touch-screen technology.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.020]   It gave them something big and clicky to target.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.260]   But the cool thing with this is,
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.980]   they were showing an icon on your desktop.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.780]   You press a little bit, and it just gets bigger
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.300]   so you can see what the document says.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.980]   You press a little bit harder, and it gives you a preview,
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.460]   a little bit harder, and it goes to the preview app.
[00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.940]   It's just on how far you're pressing into it.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:25.780]   So it's like multi-touching.
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.540]   We're going to have to get used to this.
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:27.140]   It's like multi-touching.
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.660]   It's going deep instead of just being all around you.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.660]   You can now multi-touch into it.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.180]   But you guys were using it for the first time,
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.580]   and you only use it for a short period of time,
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.700]   and you still felt like you kind of--
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.540]   It was a big learning curve, and then it got OK.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.420]   That was OK quickly.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.060]   Yeah, I think it's definitely something
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.540]   that's going to take some getting used to.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:41.140]   But I noticed on Twitter, a lot of people
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.020]   have been like, oh, people are apologizing for Apple making
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.020]   things that are half-hearted.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.460]   Oh, we're going to have to get used to this.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.900]   And I'm like, no, it's just so different and so completely
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.820]   unlike any trackpad you've ever used.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.180]   And same thing with the keyboard.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.220]   The new slimmer design keyboard is so--
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.100]   with the butterfly design is so different than your traditional
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.140]   Cesar keyboard that the first time--
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.420]   a couple times you type on it, you're like, whoa.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.260]   There's no wobbly.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:04.700]   Well, exactly.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.980]   It's just-- it's very different.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.060]   And I feel like I was counting it.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.420]   So you actually felt like it was--
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:09.500]   I guess my keys wobbled.
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:10.260]   I never noticed that.
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.860]   I mean, it just wasn't like little teeter-totters.
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.780]   You don't at all.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:13.860]   But you're kind of now--
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.700]   It feels different.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.500]   It definitely-- so the first couple times
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.660]   that I was typing on it, I realized that I was actually
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.660]   shaking the 12-inch MacBook because I end up counting.
[00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:23.420]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.260]   Because you hit-- especially with the MacBook Air Keys,
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.860]   you hit it the wrong way.
[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:30.500]   And I could hit the R without actually hitting the R.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.180]   You know, this is going to be a problem, though, because now
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.180]   you have a product line that has radically different user
[00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:37.620]   interfaces within the product line.
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.260]   You've got a MacBook Air and MacBook Pro,
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.460]   which works completely differently.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.580]   Well, the Pro's going to have--
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.660]   The Pro's going to have--
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.860]   The trackpad, but not the keys.
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.360]   Or will it?
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:44.900]   Will it have the new keys?
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:45.700]   No, just the trackpad.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.620]   But it's a turbulence.
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.300]   It is during a time of change.
[00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.620]   This is very similar to the MacBook Air when it first came out.
[00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.860]   It gives you a glimpse of what the future-- and like,
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.580]   Broadwell's not that powerful right now.
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:57.220]   Broadwell-wide that they're using this.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.860]   But they're getting this product out,
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.860]   and then you and I will buy it, and normally we'll get it
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.780]   in the year or two.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.340]   I think it's-- no, I think it's going to be a hit,
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.980]   because I think most people don't need the high-end power.
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.820]   I think most people, if they think about it,
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.860]   don't plug in a lot of cables into their stuff.
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.860]   My camera card, I'd like to be able to plug that in,
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.860]   but you can get an adapter to do that.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.980]   I think Apple's-- this is what happens when you innovate.
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.460]   People go, oh.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.300]   And then--
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:24.620]   My mom texted me during the event.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.340]   My mom has had an iMac that she's never used in two years
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.500]   since she got her iPad.
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.460]   She said, this is the first laptop I actually wanted to buy.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.740]   It just looks so simple and easy.
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.660]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.460]   Alex is obviously not the market for this,
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:37.020]   and yet I bet you--
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.140]   I bet you at home might use this, right?
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.900]   You know, I was secretly fearing
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.580]   that they would make me feel bad about buying a Surface 3,
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.380]   and they did not.
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.500]   Oh, ow.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:47.940]   Yes, sir.
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:48.980]   God.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.980]   Geez.
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.220]   First a Windows phone, now a Surface 3?
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:53.660]   What is wrong with you?
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.380]   I don't have a place of love and safety.
[00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.460]   I don't have a Windows phone.
[00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.260]   I don't have a Windows phone.
[00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:00.900]   I just have the Surface 3, because I got tired.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.700]   I'm sorry, an Android phone.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.220]   And then--
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.700]   Oh, yeah, I have an Android phone.
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.700]   You're slipping.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.740]   You're sliding in the other--
[00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.340]   They still got-- I still got a lot of iPads.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:14.460]   So anyway, I just really feel like I get the whole argument
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.460]   that they have to redesign the whole interface
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.460]   and everything else.
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:20.100]   But I'm using Windows--
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.740]   regular Windows interface and touching stuff
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.540]   and being able to draw on things and being able to--
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.540]   It's on touch.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:26.180]   And for me, mostly.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:28.020]   From a business perspective, I just
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.420]   want to be able to mark up PDFs.
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.420]   Like, that's all I want.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.380]   Like, if people send me stuff and I have to draw on it
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.180]   and say, don't move the cameras over here,
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.740]   and this is the way this is going to go.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.420]   And I just want to be able to write on it.
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.660]   And I do all of that now on a Surface 3.
[00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:45.020]   And I was looking at this going, I just got one.
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.940]   And I know what they're going to do.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.460]   They're going to put something out with a touchscreen.
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.340]   And then I was like, OK, well, I can wait now.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.900]   I don't think you have--
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.020]   I was never going to do a touch screen.
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.940]   I really feel like this is not the part.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:53.860]   Well, they've done it.
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.380]   They've tested it.
[00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.260]   They don't like it.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.180]   Yeah, I mean, I think if there's going to be a touch screen,
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.260]   it's going to be an iPad Pro.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:00.140]   It's going to have force-touch technology.
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.300]   And then that allows you to--
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:01.820]   I want that.
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.580]   Yeah, I'm really excited.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.580]   Yeah, I never even thought of that.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.420]   But if they do that, I want that.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.340]   And the problem for me is that I don't like the iOS file
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:10.060]   structure.
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.580]   So from a professional's perspective,
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.100]   I just can't move things quickly from one app to the other.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.020]   I mean, I know they're working on it.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.220]   But it's still like this rigmarole,
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.700]   rather than I just save it out and then I open it up.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.980]   And I have a lot of trouble with that process
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.820]   of getting things done in iOS the way I need to get them--
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.580]   at the speed that I need to get them done--
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.500]   and being able to touch.
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.220]   And so I think that they will eventually do it.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.540]   But I think that as the two OS is kind of
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.700]   keep on moving closer together, eventually we see something
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.060]   that you can touch and you can type on.
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.260]   But it's probably still another year.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.300]   People complain when you start having a floppy disk.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.060]   Then they complain when you stop having an optical disk.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.660]   And the truth is, I never use optical disks.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.740]   And now there's no one left to complain.
[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:52.900]   I think that's one of the great things
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.900]   about a product like this from Apple
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.300]   is it bugs the crap out of people, right?
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.180]   But at the same time, I love that Apple is saying,
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.100]   what's a laptop going to look like in five years?
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:03.100]   Let's start that now.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.700]   It's like the cow nice to innovate, I think,
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.540]   and to take a chance.
[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:05.740]   Right.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:07.660]   And like the original MacBook Air,
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.580]   this one is probably not going to be 100% of the way there.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.700]   I use that original Air.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:12.660]   It was really painful.
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.980]   They said the same thing at the time.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.420]   It was painful because it was underpowered, right?
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.580]   It was underpowered and overheated and all these things.
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:18.460]   It was too early.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:20.460]   It was too important for you to do it with a MacBook.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:21.660]   I think they've learned some lessons there.
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:22.900]   I don't think it'll be the same problems.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.660]   But there's going to be this time of transition pain
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.900]   where somebody says, oh, I need to charge my laptop
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.980]   and plug in this, oh, I can't do that.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.100]   So I need to do a lot of video at a matter of end.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.420]   I need to connect to a projector.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.540]   Do you have this adapter?
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.820]   No, nobody has that adapter.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.300]   It's only on this one laptop.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.940]   All of that stuff is going to happen.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:45.620]   But I love the fact that Apple is taking the bullets
[00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.300]   on stuff like this and saying, look,
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.900]   we want to make that laptop that does some stuff
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.060]   that other laptops don't do.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.900]   And it is going to cause pain in the short term.
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.860]   Andy, one thing that strikes me, Andy,
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.260]   and I'd like to get your take on this,
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.140]   is this is part of a move all along from Apple
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:03.940]   to expand its consumer to kind of more appeal to real people.
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:07.380]   Apple's always been for the rest of us computer.
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:09.980]   This MacBook seems like it's for the rest of us.
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.860]   It's for the vast majority of people
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.940]   who don't need all that superpower.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:16.580]   I agree with that.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.300]   That's also why after my initial reaction
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.780]   to the proposed idea of a shrunken down keyboard
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:27.100]   a little bit, it made me think that maybe the people
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.740]   who are going to be buying this are people
[00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.340]   who are already typing on smaller keyboards for their iPads.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.820]   The idea of having a full-size keyboard
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.500]   might be something that people are just going to have to deal with.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.780]   And you're right.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.220]   I mean, Apple has to start addressing the market
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.100]   that is going to be spending money next year,
[00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.820]   the year after that, five years from now,
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:47.460]   that people who already have a MacBook
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.900]   they're very, very satisfied with,
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.300]   they're not buying Macs for the next two,
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.700]   or three, or four, or five years.
[00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.380]   My only, I do have one objection though,
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:59.380]   and there is something laudable
[00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:03.140]   about Apple always having an idea of,
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:06.620]   look, this feature that we're working so hard to implement
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.860]   is going to be completely irrelevant in three years.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.540]   Let's save ourselves a lot of trouble.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:15.340]   Let's also help the obsolescence of this thing
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:18.420]   by not supporting it in this new generation of hardware.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.780]   That's very laudable.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.140]   But the thing is, if you want to buy a laptop
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:26.860]   that runs Mac OS, you've got three choices.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.580]   And if one of them is completely unsuitable for your use,
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.340]   33% of every Mac laptop everywhere in the world
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.940]   is unsuitable for your use.
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.940]   It's not like the situation in Windows
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.540]   where someone could,
[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.060]   someone who could do something as weird as,
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:43.540]   you know what, we've got a super slim Windows notebook.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:46.460]   We're going to find a way to wedge a standard VGA connector
[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.300]   onto the side of that.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.140]   We're going to angle it.
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:50.260]   We're going to have this really weird Cesar Valve,
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.180]   but we just, this thing, there are a lot of people
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.780]   who really don't want to have to travel with special adapters.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.300]   They can make one of these weirdo one-off machines,
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.660]   and there's going to be a small percentage point
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.820]   that's going to really, really love that.
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.700]   So let's praise Apple for doing that.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.780]   But let's also acknowledge that when they ship a Mac Pro
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:10.420]   that has a lot of deficiencies, you're screwed.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.740]   If you need a pro level Mac laptop, you're screwed.
[00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.860]   You have to get used to the idea of it
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.060]   that it has a really bad keyboard.
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.940]   You have to use the idea that you have to travel
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.780]   with lots of dongles.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.700]   You have to get used the idea that you can upgrade it
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.500]   because that's all you have available to you.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.500]   - It's kind of interesting.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.220]   The chat room is very negative on this,
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.620]   which kind of surprises me a little bit,
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.020]   but the chief complaint they have is $12.99.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.780]   - See, I actually think that that's a perfectly acceptable
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:38.220]   price when you think about what's being built in the machine.
[00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.020]   - I think it's fine.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.460]   The problem is the PC manufacturers have established
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.300]   this ridiculous price point of $3 to $500.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:46.140]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.500]   And Apple will never make a net.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.940]   You know, Apple's never going to make a net book.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.860]   - Apple's never going to do anything like that.
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.020]   - And when you look at that,
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:54.820]   I mean, that's how you get Lenovo
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.460]   putting stuff into your computer.
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.860]   They're trying to figure out somewhere other place
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.740]   to find a margin because they created a number
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:01.300]   that isn't workable.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:04.060]   - Yeah, no, I'm $12.99 again.
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.340]   - That's when you get Lenovo and Komodia
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.700]   superfishing.
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.980]   They have to make some money.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:12.060]   - Let's remember that the MacBook Air started.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.820]   That first one was like $2400.
[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.180]   And if you wanted to add an SSD,
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.780]   it was an extra thousand on top of that.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:18.620]   - It was like $8.99.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.060]   - And now it starts $8.99.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.740]   - And there's eight gigs of RAM.
[00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:22.580]   It is a $200 to $10.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.400]   - It's a $10.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.240]   - It's a $8.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.080]   - It's a $10.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:25.900]   - It's a $10.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.140]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that's the big thing.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.020]   The big complaint that I've heard
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.020]   is that the 13 inch MacBook Pro
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.340]   and this new 12 inch MacBook start at the same price.
[00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.180]   And the argument is,
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.500]   well, why wouldn't I just buy a 13 inch MacBook Pro?
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.500]   - Now if you ask that question,
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.740]   you should buy a 13 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.580]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:41.420]   It's not--
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:42.260]   - Absolutely should buy that.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:44.980]   - But a 13 inch MacBook Pro is a pound and a half a heavier.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.820]   And I mean--
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.340]   - If they didn't like, you know--
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.180]   - We were talking to this yesterday.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:50.340]   If you take an original iPad in its case,
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.420]   it's about two pounds, it's about to stink as this,
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.900]   and you basically split that in half and it runs OS 10.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.980]   - Yeah.
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.580]   But let's not have an equivalency
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.860]   between these two devices.
[00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.660]   I fully support the new MacBook
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:03.820]   because it exists, at least for now,
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.300]   between the less expensive, very light machine
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.340]   and the as expensive or slightly more expensive machine,
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.860]   that's a little bit more convenient to use
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.460]   and requires for your sacrifices.
[00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:16.820]   I think that that's a really good sort of portfolio
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:17.860]   of laptops to have.
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.220]   I do think that in the next two or three years,
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.420]   the price of the MacBook is gonna drop down
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.100]   to replace the MacBook Airline.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.740]   And when that happens,
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.380]   we're gonna start to have these problems
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.500]   where people are gonna be gonna be saying,
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.660]   gee, Windows 10 is now really, really good.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.820]   I can buy a not a $300 or $400 Windows notebook,
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.540]   but a $700 or $800 notebook that is as good
[00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.260]   as this $1100 model that Apple is doing.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.780]   And because I'm not the same kind of user
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:48.460]   that the people that in this conversation are,
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.780]   I can easily adapt from one machine to another.
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.380]   And I just don't like this thing
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.220]   that is the only thing that's available to me.
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.460]   - What about the processor?
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.300]   I think that that may be some reason people are concerned.
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.980]   So what do we know about this M process?
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:02.020]   This is, it's Broadwell.
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:03.420]   It's 14 nanometer. - It's Broadwell as far
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:04.260]   as I know.
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.700]   - It's why, which in fact is,
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.900]   I don't think anybody's using that yet, is, are they?
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.740]   - No, it's hard.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.900]   It's so hard to keep talking about it in team.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.740]   - Because the Broadwell is supposed to be out so long.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.220]   - So the U came out at CES.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.020]   And I think the Ex-Dell and the Lenovo
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.980]   and the HP are all using the U.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.220]   So this is the first time we've seen this mobile part.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.140]   - And how did it feel?
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.900]   Did it feel snappy?
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:22.860]   Did it feel slow?
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.620]   - So again, what I do with my computer,
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:26.660]   I don't know if I'll be able to do it
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.180]   like all the Final Cut Pro and things like that.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.060]   But for web, I took it, I shook it around.
[00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.900]   There was no lag.
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.660]   - For what most people do.
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.620]   - And most of the 8 gigs of RAM is more important
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.460]   than the process.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:36.300]   - And most people were asking me like,
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.140]   does it scroll smoothly?
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:38.140]   Because for them, that's like,
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.380]   that's what nails on a chalkboard
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.740]   is if the scrolling is off.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.620]   - And I scroll through Safari, I scroll through.
[00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.460]   - No hesitation.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:45.460]   I was going to the Verge site to see.
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:49.820]   If I could scroll the Verge, that's gotta be fast.
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:52.020]   It is, in fact, on a lot of the early Chromebooks,
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.620]   I could not scroll the Verge smoothly.
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.940]   And that told me this is underpowered.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.380]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't, again, I think it's a compromise,
[00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:59.220]   right?
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.260]   I don't think that the Core M processor
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.940]   is the processor that they really wanted
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.380]   in that 12 inch retina MacBook Air.
[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.180]   But for what they were able to afford
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.940]   and put into that machine and thinness that they wanted,
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.340]   it was the right move.
[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.140]   - Not just the dollar budget, but the power budget.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:14.460]   Five watts. - Absolutely, yeah.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.300]   - It was amazing.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.100]   - And I mean, you think about how much of that computer
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.740]   is shoved full of batteries
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.540]   and the battery improvement technology
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.380]   that they made for that computer.
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:22.220]   - Terrace. - They're terroced.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.420]   - Yes, the terroced batteries.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.900]   - By the way, as usual with Apple, they're not the first
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.940]   laptop even to use that.
[00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:30.260]   That's been around for at least a year.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.540]   - I think they've used it previously.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.340]   - Yeah. - So that's marketing.
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.620]   But you understand why this more looks,
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.820]   if you look at the layout, more looks like an iPad
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.420]   where the tiny motherboard and a lot of battery.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.500]   - I think unlike Broadwell, I think Intel is on track
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.460]   for Skylake, which means that Skylake Y
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.700]   will probably make an appearance not too far.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:49.940]   - So that confirms what you're saying, Jason,
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.220]   which is don't get the first one, get the second one.
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.420]   - Well, you know, if you buy the first one of anything,
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.700]   you're gonna be living on the cutting edge
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:56.700]   and you're taking a risk.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.540]   - Well, your pain's getting--
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.420]   - It's the same thing with the watch and with this.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:01.740]   If you can buy it now and all you're doing
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.540]   is getting it earlier.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:04.260]   Like you don't want the final version,
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.220]   you won't be part of the process getting there.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.340]   - I just, you know-- - Early believers,
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.340]   not just early adopters.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.660]   - I know that Chatham's gonna castigate me and say,
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.220]   "Oh, you're just a 1%er."
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.860]   But I look at it and I do feel techno lust.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.180]   I think that thing looked--
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.380]   Now you actually touched it.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:18.700]   - Hashtag Maclust, remember Phil Schuller?
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.740]   - Yeah, he even said that.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:22.060]   And you know what, when he said it, I was kind of, I agree.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.420]   - That's very dignified.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.540]   Don't let Jimmy Fallon do Jimmy Fallon, okay?
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.540]   (laughing)
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.660]   - We'll decide who the hashtags are.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.500]   - Yeah.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.100]   - It's incredible though, I mean--
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.980]   - So when you touched it and held it,
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:36.820]   did it feel great?
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.860]   - Yeah, well so I was able to take out
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.140]   my 11-inch MacBook Air, which I have here,
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:44.020]   and actually put it alongside the 12-inch.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.060]   - The fact that you and Jason both carry around 11 inches,
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.060]   it means that you're the natural audience for this.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:51.140]   I mean, 'cause you've chosen that laptop
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.260]   and made many sacrifices because it's small and light.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.700]   - Absolutely, and I wouldn't go back.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.140]   You know, I have an iMac at home,
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.980]   and that machine is great if I wanna do
[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.860]   any kind of high-power video editing.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.300]   But this machine is so eminently portable,
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.860]   like that's something that's a big concern for me.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.100]   And the 12-inch MacBook makes this feel fat.
[00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:11.780]   It makes it feel fat, it makes it feel bulky,
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.780]   which is, it's not that much thinner,
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:14.780]   but it's just, it's the same thing.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.780]   - You're telling me it makes an 11-inch Air feel fat bulky?
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.780]   - Yeah, it does.
[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:20.860]   - You look at the percentages of the shrinking
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.140]   that they did in the thickest point,
[00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:24.660]   and of the motherboard, and it's like,
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.620]   I didn't know you could get those kind of percentages
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.980]   off of an 11-inch Air, and they did it.
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:30.820]   So it's kinda--
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.860]   - It's 67, but I think there's no,
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.860]   I think that's why I think this is the end of the Air market.
[00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.780]   And how do you even sell something called Air,
[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.620]   if it's heavier?
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.580]   - It's just gonna fade, I think it'll fade away gradually,
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.060]   but it's the low price MacBook.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.380]   It's the low price MacBook.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:44.660]   - They still sell the optical disc,
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.380]   'cause it's on the MacBook Pro for people who really want it.
[00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.260]   Like it takes a while to get--
[00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.220]   - No, the Pro's not gonna go,
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.620]   I think the Pro will not go away.
[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:50.820]   - Yeah, but they have a non-retinable Pro.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:51.660]   - Yeah, they have a non-retinable Pro.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.180]   - Yeah, they still sell it.
[00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:54.020]   - Yeah, I think this is the most--
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.260]   - You know who buys that schools?
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:56.100]   - Yeah.
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:56.940]   - And so I think--
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.020]   - 'Cause that's my nine or eight or nine or nine or nine.
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.860]   - Something, yeah.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.820]   - Until they can get a MacBook down to eight,
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.660]   ninety nine or nine, ninety nine, the Air will kick around.
[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.500]   - My big concern is the same one reason why.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.420]   Like I love this computer,
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:08.540]   I don't have it because I like vertical pixel height.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.740]   And the retina display on this means we're pixel doubling
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.540]   and that gives you about effective 720 of vertical height.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.020]   - Yeah, so it's actually gonna be a tighter fit
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.300]   than the 11 inch Air, but retina.
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.940]   Unless you put it in scaling mode.
[00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.260]   - Yeah, and then you can see how fast that--
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.780]   - Will the GPU be fast enough to handle
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.740]   the three and a half megapixel screen?
[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.820]   That's a lot of dots.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.660]   - So I-- - So I--
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.180]   - Yeah, I think it will be able to handle the retina screen
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.020]   to a certain extent.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.860]   - Did you guys do the work,
[00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.540]   the sliding around work spaces and all that?
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.380]   - Yeah, so I did.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.940]   - 'Cause that's really challenging on the old one.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.780]   - Spaces.
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:42.420]   - First one. - Spaces, there was no lag.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.380]   I-- - Spaces, there was no lag.
[00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:46.220]   What was this?
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.220]   Mission Control, there's no lag.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.180]   Quickly scrolling through web pages,
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:54.140]   throwing out so that you could see everything in spaces.
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.860]   It's quickly scrolling, so these MacBooks were running 10, 10,
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.020]   two, they're not, they don't have photos for Mac,
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.220]   so we were actually running through iPhoto,
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.820]   which is anyone who's used iPhoto knows.
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.660]   There are lots of-- - It's a page.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.100]   - Yeah, there's lots of memory leaks there,
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.820]   and there are about 4,000 photos in there, no problem.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.580]   Again, this is a machine that for basic tasks,
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:12.340]   I think will be fine.
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.620]   I would not, I would not bring a 12-inch MacBook
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.500]   to an Apple event to live blog it.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.700]   I would not run Aputure on a 12-inch MacBook.
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.620]   I would not run Final Cut on a 12-inch MacBook.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.340]   I think that for now, I would keep my 11-inch MacBook Air
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:29.060]   for those kinds of travel tasks.
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:32.660]   If I was just using it for writing and web browsing
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.500]   and quick travel, quick and light travel,
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.460]   absolutely, I would get a 12-inch MacBook.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.020]   If I needed anything super hardcore,
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.580]   it would be a MacBook Pro.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.100]   That's kind of my life. - That makes sense.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.780]   - And I think one of the, as Jason pointed out,
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:48.260]   the chatroom is the exact wrong audience for this.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.380]   'Cause even-- - We love them, but--
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.020]   - They've got eight things going on,
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.060]   and they got five screens.
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:54.500]   I think a big audience for this,
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.300]   and I think you speculated this, Andy,
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.740]   before the announcement, is the audience
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.060]   that has a pro-Mac of some kind,
[00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.300]   whether it's a 5K iMac or a Mac Pro,
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.660]   and wants a portable kind of device
[00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:09.420]   that you could take to the Boston Public Library
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:10.340]   and things like that.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:11.700]   Does this fill the bill? - Does this fill the bill?
[00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:12.940]   - Exactly true.
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.700]   I mean, there are expectations that are absolutely appropriate
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.060]   for the hardware they've put into it
[00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.380]   and the features they've put into it.
[00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.740]   That's why, as much as you've heard me complain
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.820]   about certain hardware decisions over the past,
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.060]   I'm perfectly fine with all this.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.820]   That's exactly the sort of thing people want.
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.380]   It also creates, I would say,
[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.180]   more than that, a little bit of a problem for the iPad,
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.740]   'cause it puts more pressure on Apple
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:38.140]   to produce a more professional 9.7-inch iPad
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.460]   or a larger iPad, because a lot of the people,
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:43.420]   myself included, we're buying and traveling with iPads
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.300]   alongside having a really good desktop Mac
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.740]   and a really good notebook,
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:51.100]   because I do not need to bring the entire Ringling Brothers
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:53.260]   Three Ring Circus with me to the coffee shop
[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.060]   or even for a weekend trip someplace.
[00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.900]   I just want to screen a keyboard
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.260]   and enough basic apps and functionality
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.900]   that I can just keep on top of the work that I need to do.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.820]   So this is a really, really big thing.
[00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.060]   It's hard to look at some of the hardware in my office,
[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:11.180]   though, and not realize that, you know what?
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.660]   When I look at the things that I like about this new MacBook,
[00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:19.100]   they are also the things I like about the $249 Samsung
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.420]   Chromebook that I bought last year,
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.140]   because it's super tiny, it doesn't have everything I need,
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.100]   but it has enough that I need,
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.940]   and for the stuff that I trust it to do,
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:29.420]   it works perfectly fine.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.180]   - And for the people in the chat room who are like,
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.620]   oh, well, this isn't a $1,300 computer,
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.220]   this is a $1,000 computer or a $900 computer,
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.660]   and I would say, if you were just talking about internals,
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.980]   yes, it's when you incorporate the retina display.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:41.900]   - It's made of gold.
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:42.740]   - Yes.
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:43.740]   - It's made of gold.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:44.580]   - It's made of gold.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:47.620]   - No, no, the retina display is the big price point.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.140]   Well, I mean, again, you look at,
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.740]   you look at comparability here
[00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.940]   and you look at the 13-inch MacBook Pro,
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.660]   and what the MacBook Pro has in,
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.460]   and it's the retina display and it's the thinness.
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.860]   - I'm excited, 277 DPI is nice.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.700]   - It's beautiful.
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:06.660]   I mean, we could see the picture crystal clear perfectly
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.100]   from our seats halfway back in the auditorium
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:10.500]   when Tim brought it out on stage,
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:11.980]   and was just like, look at this,
[00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:13.900]   oh, I'm gonna laugh and like, jump over the hood.
[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:14.740]   - And it's glossy?
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:17.660]   - No, it's not glossy, it's edge to edge glass,
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:19.220]   but it's not glossy kind.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.580]   - Okay, so that's good.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.180]   - And for comparison, I mean, we always go back to print,
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:29.180]   225 DPI was not bad for magazines.
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.100]   - The laser right, it came out at 300 DPI.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.620]   It was like, oh.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:33.860]   - Right.
[00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:34.940]   So this is close to that.
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.180]   I mean, and it's at arm's length.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.460]   You're not gonna see a dot on a 277 DPI screen.
[00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.060]   - I certainly noticed the difference in the Apple logo
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:43.780]   on the back, 'cause they got in the screen, so then now.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:44.620]   - Oh yeah?
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.820]   - Does that light up?
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.900]   - The Apple logo is mirrored like the iPad
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.540]   and not light up like previous laptops,
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.380]   because there is physically no room
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:53.020]   to put the electronics for light up the laptop.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.340]   - That makes sense.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.860]   - I thought it's just like a hole
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.940]   where the back light comes through, that's not it.
[00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:58.780]   - I, yeah.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:41:59.620]   - Is that all that is?
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:00.620]   - Yeah.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.580]   - I'm fixing a hole.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.540]   - I love to show anyone.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.300]   And when it's gold, cuddly.
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.100]   - That's great, but the gold is not terrible.
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.580]   - I want the gold.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.060]   Do you have to get the gold phone?
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:14.460]   The gold watch, the gold phone, the gold iPad is.
[00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.300]   - Yes, I have the magic.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.140]   - And the gold back, you switch them up.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:16.980]   - It has opulence.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:17.900]   Can you switch them up?
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:21.340]   - You know, I really don't like lots of gold,
[00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.700]   but the gold laptop is nice, but the space gray,
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.820]   the space gray reminds me of like the old power box, right?
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.300]   - It has that beautiful, it has that beautiful,
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.460]   cold, bright color.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:31.300]   - Best in my design.
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.620]   - Yeah, no, space gray gold.
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:33.500]   - Space gray look really good.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.780]   The gold, I got the gold iPad Air
[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.980]   just because I wanted to photographically show
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.460]   that it was new, because you know,
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.820]   all the other ones had been black or were silver.
[00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:43.180]   And with this, you have that same urge
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.340]   because it owns obvious that it's a new MacBook.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.620]   But then I saw the space gray and it's just really lovely.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:48.620]   - It's made of carbonite, right?
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:50.100]   That's what space gray is, right?
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.820]   - It's very science fiction-y.
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.340]   - Carbonite. - It feels like,
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:54.860]   no, it feels like Han Solo should be.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.780]   - They said that for the watch though.
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.780]   They said we have the stainless steel watch
[00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.420]   and we put a special carbon finish.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.020]   - Yeah, no, no, it wasn't as black.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.180]   - It wasn't carbonite.
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.300]   They were little like selenium buds or something
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.340]   that they put on there to give it a texture, right?
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:07.180]   - Well, I've just done that.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.060]   - They were off for the positive,
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:09.940]   but to make the stainless steel one into black,
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:10.940]   they used some carbon-clank.
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.500]   - Oh, to make carbon coating to make the space black, yeah.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.100]   - Like you just hear, you know, laughing.
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.620]   - So space gray?
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.620]   - I think space gray too.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:18.620]   - Space gray. - Space gray.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.980]   - I'm going old, so I don't look like you guys.
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.380]   - Yeah, smart move.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.380]   - Smart move.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.820]   - You're gonna match Andy's hat.
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.140]   - I wanna look like an Eastern European plutocrat.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.140]   All these boots.
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.140]   - Yeah.
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.500]   - I'm really expecting Andy to go on one.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.460]   - Once you get the Swatski crystals glued onto that
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.500]   ton of a gun, I can have a glass coming out your butt.
[00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.660]   - Is that called McDazzled?
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.140]   Is that a McDazzled?
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.500]   - It's not even talk about whatever
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.180]   anidization firms are gonna do too.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.660]   - I wanna bedazzle it.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.660]   - All right, anything else to say before we move on?
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.420]   'Cause there's other things to talk about,
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.820]   but I wanted to lead with the Mac because I thought,
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.780]   this is classic Apple where they put a flag in the sand
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:58.300]   way beyond what anybody else is doing and saying,
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.100]   look, this is where computing is going.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.620]   And I think this time they nailed it.
[00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:03.420]   - Yeah, it was interesting to me
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.140]   'cause we did a thing we did quick interviews
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.660]   with people during the event.
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.940]   And I spoke to Ben Beherin, Ben Thompson, and Horace Dedja.
[00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:11.140]   And they all led with the Mac.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.140]   That was the exciting thing.
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:12.980]   - Yeah.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:14.540]   - And when Horace-- - Say.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.500]   - The video we have a lot more right now,
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:18.820]   but it was just like the ability for them
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.780]   to look at this market where it's been declining
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.980]   for so many quarters and the Mac is growing,
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.300]   and they're not just happy with that.
[00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.700]   They're doubling down on what they think they can go with it.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.940]   And Ben Beherin thinks they can get to 20% in fiber.
[00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:30.860]   - It's really interesting.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.700]   - 20% market share for OS 10.
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.740]   It's interesting because they've done so well with mobile.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:38.100]   I mean, that's now the business of Apple is mobile,
[00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:39.380]   and the rest of it is kind of like a side line.
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.380]   - Remember Steve Jobs came out and said,
[00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.420]   if you count MacBooks, we're the biggest mobile company.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.780]   (laughing)
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.940]   - Yeah, they sort of think about MacBooks now
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:46.860]   as being one of the most-- - This new MacBook
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:48.220]   is a mobile device, isn't it?
[00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:50.140]   - Yeah, I mean, I think the--
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:50.980]   - Oh, go ahead.
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:52.860]   - It's an Amtrak device for Andy.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.220]   - It's also a great statement about a policy
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:59.180]   that a core philosophy of design that Apple's been following
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.580]   for at least since the iPhone,
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:03.420]   that they really wanna say that it doesn't,
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:06.300]   you've got the new MacBook, you've got a watch,
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.140]   you've got an iPad, you've got an iPhone.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.700]   It really is all the exact same experience,
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.860]   only the device you have most handy to you
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:14.220]   is going to be a different,
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.060]   it's just a nearby articulation of it.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.860]   The fact that they're gonna take the same
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.700]   haptic responses that you have in the watch
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.220]   and put this into this trackpad,
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.700]   they're gonna be in other devices,
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.140]   is just part of that.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.860]   The fact that they really have,
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:29.780]   I don't know why,
[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:33.260]   what, if they could have made the Apple logo
[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.580]   illuminated on the back of it,
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:37.780]   but my idea of this is that once they saw that,
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:38.660]   okay, we got a problem,
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.180]   this is so thin we can't possibly illuminate the logo,
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.700]   I believe that they didn't even consider solving that problem
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.620]   because nope, we already got a great design,
[00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:48.020]   a mirrored logo that's already on the iPad Air,
[00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.420]   this is beautiful, it's perfect, exactly right.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.660]   We'll make the most iPad-like MacBook ever,
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.260]   and it's gonna really bring home the idea
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.860]   that we are selling you a constellation of hardware
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.460]   that will all work together to improve your life hopefully.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.980]   - Yeah, I really don't, you know,
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:04.620]   this MacBook is a flag in the sand,
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.540]   in terms of this is where we're going,
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.260]   this is where we think the future of MacBook computing
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:11.140]   is gonna be, we're putting in Force Touch,
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.060]   we're getting rid of fans in laptops.
[00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:13.900]   - Love it, yeah.
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.540]   - Like, we're doing a bunch of these really innovative things,
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.500]   is this laptop gonna be perfect for everybody,
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.740]   not by a long shot?
[00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:22.660]   Like, if you don't, if this isn't perfect for your work case,
[00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:24.540]   if you don't wanna pay $12.99 for a laptop,
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:25.540]   don't. - They give you choices.
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.220]   - I'm gonna stick with my 11-inch probably
[00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.980]   for another year, like I really like the 12,
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.740]   but it's not quite right for me.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.580]   Will it be right in a year or two?
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.780]   Quite possibly, do I love the fact that Apple
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.620]   is actually making these adjustments ahead of time
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.420]   and saying like, oh, we're not gonna wait
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.420]   until we have the entire line, you know,
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.340]   polished and slim line and all of that.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.500]   We're just, we're gonna go with it.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.980]   We're gonna go line by line by line
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:46.940]   and we're gonna polish this up.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.180]   Same way we did with Retina,
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.380]   same way we did with taking out optical drives.
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.980]   It's just, it's how they roll.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.100]   They go incrementally and that's okay.
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.300]   - I think what's so interesting too
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.900]   is this acknowledgement that we're basically
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.140]   in a wireless world now and that all your data's wireless.
[00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:02.580]   - Okay, but let's point out the one big,
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.180]   the one comment that was made by anybody on that stage
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.580]   that made me think, it's made actually safer in the livecast.
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.980]   No, you're wrong about that.
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.500]   - Is when Phil's like, let's face it,
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.060]   the best notebook is naturally gonna be wireless.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:16.380]   I say, yeah, and also the best salary
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:18.620]   for a public school teacher is gonna be quarter million dollars.
[00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.100]   (all laughing)
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:22.700]   Okay, that doesn't mean it's actually happening, Phil.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.860]   - I'll point out that-- - You need to have
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:24.700]   buyers in places.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.060]   - Five years ago when they did the first MacBook Air,
[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:29.820]   they made the exact same claim.
[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.700]   They said the same thing. - They didn't have a CD wrong.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.260]   - Well, I had one USB port and they said,
[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:36.140]   oh, but it's wireless, you're just gonna wanna do it wirelessly.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:37.500]   - And then the wireless CD technology.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.060]   - That didn't support-- - I remember a lot of people upset
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.620]   about ethernet disappearing, and as you said, Alex,
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.220]   you kinda get over that.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.140]   - No, I'd haven't, I haven't.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.100]   - Except for Alex, yeah.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:49.940]   - Alex is the one who hasn't.
[00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.100]   - I'm just ethernet. - Where is that dongle?
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.140]   - He can also do it. - I did not know.
[00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:54.340]   - But I never use it.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.900]   - I mean, I was a constraint to making it thinner.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.220]   Like, they have to start getting rid of ports,
[00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:58.900]   and so, frankly, we have to-- - I have to, I have to.
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.020]   - I had to know 3.5. - So was a mag safe adapter
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.220]   for the right hour. - Yeah, you know.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:05.540]   - I think that the Apple not doing a proprietary power cable
[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.740]   is a revolutionary step around.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.820]   - That should be the headline.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:09.740]   - That's the headline.
[00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:12.020]   - I have a Pavlovian response right here,
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.820]   both of those things, say that they had,
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.820]   they made it thinner, they didn't have to make it thinner,
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.740]   because the MacBook Pro is not that much too thin
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:21.180]   to have to accept a standard ethernet connector.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:24.380]   And also, the mag safe, the mini mag safe connector
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:27.940]   is the worst component design Apple has come up with
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:29.100]   in 10 years.
[00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:32.580]   It is crap, it is borderline defective.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.300]   - What's wrong with it? - And there is no way to just,
[00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.500]   it pops off, if there is a mouse,
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:40.340]   trespassing in the backyard, and he twitches his ears,
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.020]   pop, goes with my mag safe connector.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.340]   I adjust it like this, and the moment,
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.620]   now the mag safe connector has just come off.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:50.700]   I put it down on my sofa, it comes off.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:53.700]   I try to close the, I close the, it just keeps--
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.260]   - I miss the elbow though, it's not something
[00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.460]   that it's supposed to do.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:00.100]   - So I would have to take another mag.
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:02.580]   - I like it.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:06.860]   - Andy, I agree with you, it's way too quick to pop off,
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.420]   but also having an 11 inch air,
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.100]   if I had a power cable that actually connected to that,
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.660]   and I was working on the house, this MacBook would go flying.
[00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:16.540]   - Maybe it just popped off.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.660]   - Yeah, well no, I'm saying like, if it wasn't mag safe,
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.940]   yeah, it wasn't mag safe, this thing would go flying.
[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:23.260]   - Well that wasn't at the selling point,
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.060]   and mag safe, Steve said, "Oh, you're gonna trip over,
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:26.500]   "you don't have to worry about tripping anymore."
[00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:28.700]   - So my thought was, when I first heard,
[00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:30.820]   I was like, "Oh, you're changing the cable."
[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.220]   If the battery life is long enough to warrant
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.460]   the Mac only being plugged in at the end of the day,
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:37.500]   then there's not a problem.
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.340]   Nine hours of battery life, I'm still thinking
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.420]   that's not quite ready.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:44.940]   But like, if we start getting up to 14, 18, 20, like,
[00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:45.780]   that's--
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.860]   - I think 90 to 20 for me.
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.140]   - That's the problem we were talking about earlier,
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:52.500]   that I'm glad that people who want MacBook Airs
[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:54.180]   have that kind of connector that is thin enough
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.580]   to allow the MacBook Air to be thinner
[00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.180]   and allow this lighter weight thing not to cut fall off.
[00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:59.700]   I chose not to have a MacBook Air
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:01.620]   'cause I don't want one, but I have to suffer
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.340]   every single time I'm attached to power
[00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:06.740]   because of this stupid design
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.740]   that should not have ever left Cupertino.
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.500]   - I think Jason Stell is right.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:14.060]   He observed in the chatroom that it's socialism.
[00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:14.900]   - Yes.
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.820]   - And we must stamp it out.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:18.460]   - The chatroom is the side of the song.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.300]   - It's the bottom.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.500]   - It's all like communism now.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:21.660]   - We're gonna take a break.
[00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:22.500]   - Come back with more--
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.060]   - How much socialism, I think, Nadion.
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.060]   - Says the Canadian.
[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.580]   How do you like your national health care?
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:28.820]   Is it working for you?
[00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.140]   - It's great, I can do this because I want to know what else.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.620]   (laughing)
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:34.340]   - Oh no, that's going to work.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:36.540]   - Oh, it's my--
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.580]   - What a great panel.
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.940]   I think we should just bring out some whiskey and celebrate.
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:46.940]   A wonderful group here from Canada, Mr. Renee Ritchie, I'm more.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:49.740]   And the Mobile Nations crew has done a bunch of videos
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:50.980]   and stuff, is that at i'more.com?
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:51.820]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:55.180]   - Okay, also from I'more Serenity, called Alex Lindsey.
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.700]   Not from I'more, Montreal, he's from
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.660]   Rwanda, the man--
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:01.900]   - For the moment, for this week.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.460]   - The man from Rwanda.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.940]   Also here, Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:10.780]   What a great crew, I'm just loving this Jason Snell,
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.780]   from sixcolors.com.
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.380]   We're all sad about Giga Oum.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.700]   - Yeah.
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:18.900]   - I just gonna mention that briefly
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.980]   before we go into the app, but Giga Oum,
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:22.780]   which was one of the great tech publications
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:23.740]   started by Oum Malek.
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.660]   Oum had left it about a year ago to become a VC,
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:30.540]   although he's still doing his newsletter and stuff.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:33.420]   They had taken a significant amount of venture funding.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.580]   - Eight million.
[00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.540]   - And I don't know if that's related to it,
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.020]   but for some reason, something happened yesterday
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:41.540]   on the Giga Oum site, they posted,
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.580]   we run out of money, we owe money to our creditors,
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:46.700]   they now own the assets, bye bye.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:48.260]   - And they were at the event with us yesterday.
[00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:49.100]   - Yeah.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.140]   - I saw Kevin Tofel, which is the,
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.140]   I think the last post on Giga Oum
[00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:54.220]   is his review of the Apple Watch.
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.620]   - It's just, it's funny because today is a six month
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:58.020]   so today that all the Mac...
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.540]   - Oh, the Mac Oum is a six month ago today, yeah.
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:03.780]   - And so Giga Oum happening six months directly after that
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:04.940]   is, I don't know.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.100]   - So many people say no more Apple events.
[00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:07.220]   - Apple events, yeah.
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.860]   - Stay away from Apple events, that's why I haven't gone
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:10.180]   for years.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.060]   No, as Jerry said, and I love Oum Malek,
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.300]   I don't think this affects particularly Oum Malek,
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.820]   but it does affect some of our great friends
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:21.300]   like Matthew Ingram and Kevin Tofel, Stacey Higginbotham,
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:24.060]   but a bunch of great people work there, Yanko Wreckers,
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:28.660]   and I hope they all find work and if you haven't called me.
[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:30.260]   - Or, you know what, just call Renee,
[00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:32.900]   he's got so much more money than I do.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:35.540]   - Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom,
[00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.340]   it's National Start Your Own Business Month.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.860]   That's something, maybe just start your own business,
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:43.140]   you guys are good enough.
[00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:46.460]   At LegalZoom.com, you have the wherewithal
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:48.020]   to create the business you've always dreamed of.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.180]   Now LegalZoom's not a law firm,
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:52.900]   but let me tell you, when I started Twit 10 years ago,
[00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:54.900]   Kevin Rose said you ought to be an LLC,
[00:52:54.900 --> 00:52:59.380]   don't just be a company, protect yourself, $99,
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.700]   I think it was, now it's a little more,
[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:03.460]   but that's 10 years later, it's $150.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.100]   That's the starting point to create an LLC,
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:07.700]   you can also do it chapter S or C Corp.
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.580]   LegalZoom really gives you the power
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:11.460]   to do what you need to do.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:13.140]   Trademarks did that too.
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:15.900]   Patents if you need them.
[00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:19.220]   There's a lot of stuff there, LegalZoom.com.
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:20.860]   If you use the offer code MBW, by the way,
[00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.860]   you could take 10 bucks off at a checkout.
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:26.460]   Now would be a good time to start your own business.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.980]   And as I said, LegalZoom's not a law firm.
[00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:30.500]   If you need some legal advice,
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.300]   they have built a network of trusted attorneys
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.460]   to provide the guidance you need
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:34.540]   for your specific situation.
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:39.300]   That's really great, because things come up,
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:42.260]   little questions, but you don't want to spend $350
[00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:45.220]   or $450 an hour, you don't have to.
[00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:47.700]   These are pre-negotiated flat rates with attorneys
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.620]   in almost every state.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:52.020]   You can look at their profiles online
[00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:54.300]   and unedited customer reviews to get an idea
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.780]   of what they can do for you.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.100]   And here's the best part, during National Start Your Business
[00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:00.620]   Month, LegalZoom is offering an attorney consultation
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:03.300]   for 50 smackers, $50.
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.260]   Yeah, that's a really great deal.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.020]   If you're unsure about the best way
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.020]   to start your own business,
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.100]   or if you've already run a business
[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:13.900]   and you need some advice, trust me, that is a great deal.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:16.060]   I would have called him immediately and said,
[00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:19.020]   "Okay, should I start it in Delaware?"
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:20.660]   Somebody said, "Somebody, just somebody,
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:21.820]   "probably on Twitter said,
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.420]   "Oh, no, I'm being Delaware."
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:24.860]   Actually, there was no Twitter at the time,
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.860]   but somewhere like that.
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.180]   And it'd been nice to ask a lawyer,
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:32.220]   California Delaware, what's the difference?
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.700]   Go to LegalZoom.com today,
[00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:35.180]   you can find that out and more.
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:38.380]   Attorney consultations are provided by independent attorneys
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.900]   available in most states.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.100]   You can get the legal help you need
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.820]   for your business at LegalZoom.com.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.260]   And of course, all the forms,
[00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.940]   everything you need to do at your own direction,
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:48.860]   it is really great.
[00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:51.100]   It is really like having your own law firm,
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.060]   except they're not.
[00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:53.940]   LegalZoom.com.
[00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:56.020]   And they don't charge the same prices either.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.740]   Get $10,000 off when you use the offer code,
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:01.460]   MBW, and don't forget that $50 consultation
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.380]   for this month,
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.220]   only national start your business month.
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.780]   What a team of people,
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.580]   when we booked this, Jason Halstead,
[00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:12.860]   we've never had six people on any show before,
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.140]   at least not as I've been producing.
[00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:16.780]   It's possible that this might rival.
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:19.140]   I'm sure we've had six on before.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:20.060]   When we've gone out in the field,
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:22.620]   like at Apple stores and stuff, we've had this many.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.660]   But we don't have our camera barrier.
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.700]   I wasn't sure if the wide camera was gonna be able to fit in.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.420]   I was like, I don't know if we can do any more, Leo.
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:31.420]   Yeah, this is the limit though.
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.540]   We can't do seven unless we sit in my lap.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:35.860]   Anyway, great to have you all.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:37.820]   Thank you for coming up, making the trip,
[00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:39.420]   or coming in on Skype.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.140]   Before we get to the watch,
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.860]   let's just briefly mention a couple of the other things
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.700]   that were announced yesterday.
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:50.580]   They led with Apple TV and HBO now.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:54.100]   And somebody on Twitter pointed out that HBO and OW
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.340]   has Bono in the name.
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:56.260]   So Bono.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:56:00.140]   Tim Cook trolling the audience once the time.
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.540]   Bono.
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:03.260]   $69 for the Apple TV.
[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:05.220]   I think it was you, Andy, who said this is a sign
[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:07.260]   that they're not getting traction.
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:11.100]   It's certainly, I mean, this is the conversation
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:13.900]   that you have with your kids saying, "Son, I'm not angry
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.500]   with you, I'm just disappointed with you."
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.700]   And that's when Apple drops the price on anything.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.500]   It means that it's getting really good competition
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.540]   from someplace else and they're starting to feel the pain.
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.540]   It's not possible that maybe they're clearing it out
[00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:25.900]   to do a new Apple TV.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:29.460]   I suppose it's possible, but they have ease.
[00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:31.900]   I feel like they'd have easier ways to get rid of them
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.060]   than to do a simple price reduction.
[00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:37.420]   That would indicate they've got so much stock on hand
[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:39.340]   that they need to start clearing things out.
[00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:42.220]   And that doesn't sound like something that Apple generally does.
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.380]   I don't think it's a clear out sale.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:46.340]   I think that this product is so old and the hardware is so old
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:48.180]   that the margin's on it have to be so great
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:50.260]   at this point that they can afford to cut it.
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.620]   And if there's a new Apple TV,
[00:56:51.620 --> 00:56:54.060]   they're probably not going to be able to price it at 69.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:58.420]   So, you know, I'm hopeful that this means there is a new Apple TV
[00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:02.020]   that is on more modern hardware with perhaps some revised software
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:03.820]   that we'll see sometime this year,
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.780]   but that one's not going to be able to go out there for 69
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:07.100]   and they've got this HBO deal.
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.180]   So the old hardware, they can sell cheaper.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:12.060]   Yeah, I don't think it's necessarily a close out sale
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:15.060]   so much as it is that they've got room to cut the price
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:15.900]   and still make money.
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.820]   Yeah, they got to give people a reason to buy it.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:20.820]   Yeah, well, and I think that you want to,
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:22.740]   I think we may see start seeing more and more rumors
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:25.180]   about Apple TV as we get closer to something like WWDC.
[00:57:25.180 --> 00:57:27.100]   I think there's a real opportunity there for them
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:29.180]   to open up the architecture a little bit,
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:31.180]   which I say every year when WWDC comes out.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.020]   I say the same thing.
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.380]   There's an opportunity for them to create games
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:36.100]   and so on and so forth that are run from your iPhone
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.300]   or other things that they haven't really utilized.
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.780]   They also think that there is,
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:44.220]   it'll be really interesting to see how HBO, CBS, Netflix,
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:48.660]   Amazon start moving towards these boxes
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:51.540]   and whether when we see 4K, for instance,
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.820]   this is going to be the first place
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:54.780]   that's going to be easy to distribute on the box
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:55.900]   in mass consumption.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:59.020]   And I think that it would be crazy to see another Apple TV
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:02.420]   that wasn't 4K coming out in this year.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:04.220]   So I think it'll be interesting to see
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:06.580]   whether this price drop represents, you know,
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:08.860]   this is 1080p and the next one.
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.180]   I think there's 50/50, maybe 60/40 chance
[00:58:12.180 --> 00:58:16.020]   that we'll see a 4K box, you know, in June
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.620]   where you give the developers enough time,
[00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.940]   especially if they open it up a little bit
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.500]   to have some fun with it.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:23.780]   - Yeah, I can't imagine HBO being like,
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.540]   "Yes, we're going to sign an exclusive at least
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.740]   for a couple months deal with Apple
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:33.740]   because, you know, as they have no new hardware."
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:36.380]   - Ping like, yeah. - Well, and if you look at what--
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.260]   - There's three months, there's three months
[00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.900]   and three months ends right when WWDC starts.
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.500]   So, you know, there's an exclusive, you know,
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:44.900]   of, you know, in that process.
[00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:48.340]   And so, you know, I think that there could, you know,
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:53.260]   again, 4K is interesting because it allows them
[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.420]   to, allows people who are unboxing,
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:57.660]   they're unbundling their service
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:01.260]   to basically upsell a lot of people away from cable
[00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.540]   because it's the only place you can get it.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.940]   Everyone's buying 4K, you know,
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:06.100]   'cause now you can go to Walmart and buy a 4K,
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.020]   monitor for $800 or $700.
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.300]   And so, that's become the next thing,
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:11.660]   but no one has any content for it.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.100]   And I think that the first place to do this
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:16.220]   is the unbundled, you know, services.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.300]   - The other thing that's interesting is,
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:19.700]   like, if you just look at the products that they're working on,
[00:59:19.700 --> 00:59:21.580]   if there is another Apple TV and they're making it
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:24.060]   dependent on content deals, those content deals aren't signed,
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.780]   but they have an HBO deal that is signed,
[00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:27.540]   they want to get ahead of that.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:29.260]   That probably didn't come really cheap
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.340]   to get an exclusive on HBO for several months.
[00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.700]   So getting as many Apple TVs into people's hands
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:36.500]   as possible is a good thing, at least for now.
[00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:39.140]   And also, Apple can build stuff,
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:42.820]   like they might announce a new box at WWDC that is 4K compliant,
[00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:44.500]   but they might not have 4K iTunes by then,
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:45.940]   so, because of broadband,
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:47.740]   because of getting the content, remastering,
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:49.420]   and all those things, but it'll be compatible
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:50.300]   when it's compatible.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.700]   And I think that's the most interesting thing
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:54.100]   when you start putting like a cyclone chip in it,
[00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.180]   you start putting metal in it,
[00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:58.420]   you start having a game store or an app store on it.
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.340]   It's, Apple was very, Tim Cook said this is the beginning
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.500]   when he announced that Apple TV,
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.940]   and I think that's the interesting thing.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.740]   - Would they ever license it for TV manufacturers?
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:08.820]   That's a big thing now, smart TVs,
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.020]   and they're all crappy.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.020]   I'd love to see them. - It's a good question.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.300]   I mean, you look at what Apple's doing with CarPlay.
[01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.540]   It's something, I mean, it's-- - Right, it could be just like
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.940]   that, wouldn't it? - Yeah, I don't necessarily think
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:20.260]   that will happen, but I can't entirely rule it out
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.260]   because of what they're currently in with CarPlay.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.500]   - I think that may end up being the way
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.940]   they get into people's hands.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.500]   - They don't, like CarPlay is not,
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.660]   like CarPlay, they still own the technology,
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.260]   it's just being broadcast on the screen,
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.380]   and I think that's already AirPlay.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.220]   - Right. - They have the--
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.460]   - It gets-- - Like the boxes,
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:35.580]   they're controlling my mechanism.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.380]   - I would sooner, I don't know whether,
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.700]   either will happen, but I would sooner expect to see
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:43.660]   an Apple TV built into a TV that Apple sells,
[01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.460]   a monitor that Apple sells than before,
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:47.380]   before they would, I think they'd sell their own monitor
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:51.540]   before they'd sell it as an add-on to Sony's TVs or Samsungs.
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:54.260]   - Yeah, I could only really see it as a booster
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.100]   from the iPhone, a la CarPlay,
[01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:59.540]   where it's the majority of the software hook-ins are there,
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.100]   and maybe television support the AirPlay standard.
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.780]   - Apple TV direct. - Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:06.340]   - You know, I mean, LG bought WebOS
[01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.620]   to put that into their smart TVs.
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:12.420]   I've tried Samsung, I've tried LG, I've tried--
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.060]   - They're all terrible. - They're all crappy.
[01:01:14.060 --> 01:01:18.500]   - Visio is arguably the best, but of Mung terrible.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.420]   And I think if somebody came along and said,
[01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.140]   "Now with Apple TV," Samsung, now with Apple TV,
[01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:27.940]   that might be a great way to get into people's, you know.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.540]   - So, aren't we the right people to talk about this?
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.540]   I mean, they see the Netflix logo
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:34.460]   and their Samsung Smart TV, and say,
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:37.500]   "Well, it's gonna be a nightmare for 20 minutes to set it up,
[01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.420]   but once it's set up, it's gonna actually work."
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.220]   Meanwhile, they're more averse to having to plug
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:46.940]   in another box and put in another power strip behind that desk,
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:49.700]   or that sofa table than anything else, I think.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.820]   - It also could be that what an Apple TV changes
[01:01:51.820 --> 01:01:54.180]   become just a small HDMI thing you plug in
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.180]   and all the logic stays on your phone
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:57.700]   instead of being a separate box.
[01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:00.180]   I've talked, at CES, we interviewed a bunch
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:01.940]   of the telephone manufacturers, and their interest
[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.820]   in having a good user experience is negligible.
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:07.860]   They're like, "We're putting Tizen on our computers
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:08.940]   because that's the key."
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:09.780]   - It's the key. - When you walk in
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.300]   with your Tizen watch and your Tizen phone,
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.940]   it creates a great Tizen experience.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.100]   - Yeah, cheap is what they want.
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:15.500]   - Yeah. - And they want it to be
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.500]   their stack and their tradition
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.380]   to have no strength in software programming.
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:20.980]   - I am thrilled though at HBO now,
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.860]   and maybe I shouldn't be, because it turns out
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.220]   it's a push for a cord cutter.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.540]   It's the same price as if you got HBO from your cable company.
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:30.540]   - Although, I think as you can register three devices
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.740]   at the same, you can have three devices
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:33.060]   running at the same time.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.220]   - Yeah, so you can put it on your iPad,
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.060]   your iPhone and your Apple TV.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.380]   - Yeah. - Also--
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.740]   - So this is, for those who don't know,
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:41.140]   for $15 a month over the top HBO,
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:43.660]   so you don't have to have a cable subscription.
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:46.820]   You can just get HBO for that price,
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:47.660]   and I think that's pretty good.
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.700]   - It's pretty, they're marketing it as a premium service.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.540]   They don't want to discount,
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:51.540]   they don't want to race to the bottom.
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.660]   They want to think that HBO content is valuable,
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:55.020]   and you're paying for that.
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.860]   - Well, and also, $15 a month,
[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.820]   maybe what you're paying to your cable company for HBO,
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.740]   but you think about, as somebody who tries their hardest
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.060]   to not pay for cable television--
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.420]   - Your cord cutter, I would guess.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.460]   - Oh yeah, I'm largely the,
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.820]   I currently have basic cable subscription
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.380]   because I tried to get rid of it,
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.180]   and they gave me HBO for free.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:13.020]   And at the time, I was like,
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.580]   "Oh, you really want what was Game of Thrones?"
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.420]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.820]   Game of Thrones, newsroom, and all of those things.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:19.260]   I'm like, "Yeah, finishing watching the wire."
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.980]   But for people who never want to subscribe to cable
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.580]   and their internet is maybe only 40 bucks a month,
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:29.220]   that now is $55 a month for HBO and their internet
[01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:32.780]   rather than $85.94 cable.
[01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:33.700]   - And the other thing to remember is,
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:37.460]   is that HBO is one of the most expensive channels on there.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:40.220]   So while it might be $15 a sub,
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:45.260]   as you know, many of these cable networks are $1 or $2
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.100]   or $4.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.380]   And so if other ones start to peel off,
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.380]   this starts to be successful, it really becomes complicated.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.260]   - It could be the crack,
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.020]   it could be the crack in the ice, couldn't it?
[01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:53.860]   - Yeah.
[01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:55.180]   - Yeah, I mean, CBS is a bigger crack
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:58.820]   than HBO, bigger cracks would be other networks,
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.380]   you know, and then Discovery Channel.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.620]   I mean, Discovery Channel breaks away
[01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.220]   and that's really where bad things start to happen.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.020]   - Well, ESPN has already broken away
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:08.340]   'cause if you guys, you know, pay for the,
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:11.100]   what do they call it now?
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.140]   I've forgotten the name.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.780]   And they are a sponsor too, I'm so sorry.
[01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:17.340]   You know, the $20 a month.
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:20.060]   - Same thing, thank you, Slingbox TV.
[01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.460]   Okay, I'm getting old.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.620]   Slingbox TV. - Slingbox TV.
[01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:24.580]   You get ESPN and that is the most expensive,
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.780]   that actually is the most expensive cable channels,
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:30.180]   rumored that the cable companies pay $16 a month
[01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:32.580]   per subscriber to ESPN.
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:35.220]   - I think the big problem that HBO wants to get ahead of though
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.420]   is that it's not just people saying, you know what?
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:39.860]   I shall rise up against the hegemony of cable television
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:41.380]   and I shall cut the cable.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.260]   It's that you're getting generations of people
[01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.980]   that don't even think of television in terms of
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:46.980]   a cable subscription.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.940]   They think in terms of Hulu and Netflix
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.980]   and just paying for a digital subscription to what you want.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.980]   So that's money they're gonna be leaving on the table
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:57.980]   in five years if they don't have this fully spun up by then.
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:02.660]   - I actually thought Serenity would be
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.700]   because she's just, 'cause she's young.
[01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:06.660]   But also I thought you might not have cable
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:09.180]   'cause you live in a metro and you can put an antenna.
[01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.500]   - Yeah, well, I'm in an apartment
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:13.820]   and unfortunately the digital, excuse me,
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:17.220]   the digital antennas are a lot sketchier
[01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:21.380]   and not as reliable as your traditional pre,
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:22.940]   say what you want for the digital switchover,
[01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:24.420]   but it actually, it becomes much harder.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:29.260]   If it wasn't a, I wanted HBO and if it wasn't a,
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.620]   like I can get HBO on the side,
[01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.300]   I wouldn't have gone for cable.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:35.700]   And the only reason I have cable right now
[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:38.340]   is because of HBO and because my cable company
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:41.300]   was basically like, we'll allow you to pay the exact same money
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:43.540]   that you would for your super high broadband.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.740]   - Yeah, but we'll also throw in basic cable and HBO
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.180]   and I'm like, all right, well,
[01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:48.540]   - But you know that's gonna run out.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:49.900]   - Oh sure, and then when that does,
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:53.660]   I'll probably cancel and I'll go to a different competitor
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:56.220]   that has better internet and no cable
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:57.100]   and I'll be fine with that.
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.540]   - Do they say, am I gonna get,
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.140]   like, am I gonna get an Apple TV update now
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.820]   and HBO now will be on there?
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:04.660]   - Well, Apple TV updates over the year,
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:06.140]   they don't have to push you backwards.
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:06.980]   - It just happens.
[01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.820]   - Yeah, they update the firmware,
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:08.660]   but they can also add channels,
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.300]   it's basically like a webpage and they can edit it way
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.140]   - They said, sometimes in April
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:12.940]   because that's when Game of Thrones.
[01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:14.460]   You can start subscribing now.
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:17.220]   And if you subscribe before, I think what, April,
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:18.940]   - Yeah, it was like, - Fifth or something.
[01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:22.460]   Yeah, if you subscribe before the beginning of April,
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:24.820]   you will be able to get the first month free
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.500]   so that you can enjoy all of the fun
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.900]   Game of Thrones content.
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.460]   - And somebody asked and I think that we can answer this
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.140]   that what's the difference in HBO go and HBO now?
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.940]   And I think they'll probably be exactly the same
[01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.100]   except one will be over the top
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.740]   and one will require a cable subscription.
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.580]   - Yes.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.060]   - I don't imagine they'll create a new app for that.
[01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:41.900]   - Well, for HBO go,
[01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:44.340]   you need to log in anyway that you create by selecting your--
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.500]   - Once you log in, you don't log in every time you're done.
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:48.340]   - Yeah, correct.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:51.620]   - And then you get everything just as you will with HBO now.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:55.260]   You get all past shows, you get all current shows.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.300]   He said all future shows,
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.500]   but I don't see how that could happen.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.660]   - So the end of time, all future shows ever.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:01.500]   - I don't know.
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:02.340]   - While you subscribe, yeah.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:04.300]   - That would be impressive.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.940]   - I think this is also using that technology,
[01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:07.100]   they stop doing their own license,
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:08.420]   they don't technology for this video.
[01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:09.580]   - Or use MLB in that working.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.420]   - Yeah.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:11.260]   - Okay.
[01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:15.060]   All right, watch.
[01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:16.500]   Let's talk the watch.
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:17.820]   - Good old watch.
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.500]   - Are you putting your watch away now?
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.140]   You don't want us to know you have one right?
[01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:21.980]   - No, wait.
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:22.820]   Where's it?
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.660]   What, everybody?
[01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:25.300]   - We went to a cupcake out in a--
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.260]   - What is that, a pebble?
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.980]   Somebody pointed out the new pebble
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:29.980]   that they're kick-startering
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.500]   and they've raised $17 million for,
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.140]   looks almost exactly like the Apple watch.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:35.980]   - Interesting, isn't that?
[01:07:35.980 --> 01:07:36.980]   - And this certain light.
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:42.620]   Did we learn anything about the Apple watch
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:43.460]   that we didn't know?
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:45.220]   I don't think they said before
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.500]   that you could talk on the phone.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:48.340]   We knew that.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.540]   - Yeah, well, we did, but it wasn't.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.020]   So I think they watch word in terms,
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:55.100]   for the Apple watch event
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:59.540]   is specifically that we saw more of what it could do.
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.820]   You know, in September,
[01:08:00.820 --> 01:08:04.140]   we saw a very tightly controlled demonstration.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.500]   - You guys got a slideshow.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.340]   - Yeah, pretty much.
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:07.820]   - This time you actually got to use it.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.740]   - Yeah, we got a complete free for all.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:11.460]   I was able to try a couple different watches,
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:12.460]   including the edition,
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:14.220]   and I was able to, you know,
[01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.940]   they tried to guide us through,
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.140]   but there was very much like,
[01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:19.260]   "All right, I'm just gonna go into settings."
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:21.260]   Let's see what kind of settings are on the watch.
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.260]   - So it's stable, and it's really good.
[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:24.780]   - Oh yeah, I mean, I'm glad that it's gonna have another month
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:27.340]   because there are definitely like little bugs here and there,
[01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:30.460]   but it's nothing that I'm worried that Apple won't be able to fix.
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.700]   It's just like a little bit of stuff.
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:35.700]   - So the big revelation then was date,
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:38.500]   pre-order April 10th, deliver April 24th,
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:41.060]   and price anywhere from 3.49,
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:43.220]   which we already knew up to $17,000.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.220]   - Yes.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.380]   - I was, you know, and if you dig into the price,
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.300]   some of the things are strange.
[01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:51.300]   For instance, the rose gold edition with a rubber,
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.660]   I'm sorry, floral last month.
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.660]   - Floral last month.
[01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:55.660]   - Yeah, Krista Terlinson said rubber band on stage.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:56.500]   - I know, Krista!
[01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.140]   - Didn't you get the brief thing?
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.220]   - It's a floral last month.
[01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.180]   - And even see it right in the supermodel, sir,
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:03.420]   I'm bound by no earthly team.
[01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:07.860]   - So that one, the least expensive edition is $10,000.
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:09.780]   All you have to do is put a leather band on
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:10.940]   and then it goes up $7,000.
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.500]   Is that a $7,000 band?
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.620]   - Well, it's not quite the band
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:17.420]   because the band also has an 18-carat gold clasp
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:20.060]   and an 18-carat gold side clasp as well.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.980]   So you're talking about a fair amount of extra gold.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.220]   I think it's still ridiculous.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.580]   - That's seven, Leo,
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.260]   like that price point, there is no connection between it.
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.300]   - Well, that's what was clear.
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.140]   - It's like bizarre.
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:31.220]   - If you buy a Lamborghini,
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:32.580]   you do not care what the price of gas is.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:35.260]   - For instance, it's 50 bucks more to get a 48,
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:38.140]   42 millimeter than a 38 in the sport model.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:40.500]   In the gold model, it's $2,000.
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.940]   - Because the price is irrelevant.
[01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:42.780]   - That's not that price.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.420]   - No one buying that watch is gonna miss that.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.620]   They'll buy seven of them.
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:46.500]   They're not gonna miss the money.
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:48.900]   - You buy it to demonstrate your ability to earn
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:50.740]   so that you can get a girlfriend.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.420]   - Well, no, so when they announced it,
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:54.580]   they didn't say these are the three models.
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:57.140]   They said the gold is a limited edition.
[01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:59.140]   It's gonna be available at select retailers.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:09:59.980]   - Not stores, yes.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.740]   - And is it not Apple Store?
[01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:02.940]   - They just had select stores.
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.700]   They were in the dirty-- - Select retail stores, yeah.
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.420]   - So Tiffany and Nordstrom, I asked a follow up
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.860]   and they did say select Apple stores, huh?
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:09.740]   - Okay. - Okay.
[01:10:09.740 --> 01:10:11.620]   - But still, you're talking about probably
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:14.740]   the flagship stores in Boston, New York, Los Angeles,
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.140]   maybe Paris, you know, people,
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.940]   places that we associate traditionally
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:22.060]   with high-end fashion celebrities, that kind of a thing.
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:25.340]   - But not Neiman Marcus, Andy, or Apple Store's plus
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.740]   other retail.
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:29.220]   - I only ask for clarification on whether it was going
[01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:31.540]   to be available in actual Apple retail stores,
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.660]   and I confirm that yes, certain select Apple stores
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:34.580]   will have the gold watches.
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.500]   - But it's like, the important thing is it's not,
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.220]   it's not like these aren't three ranges of watches
[01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:39.220]   and you use twos when you want.
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:41.140]   There are people who only wanna buy a gold watch
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.700]   and they're interested in the Apple watch,
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:44.580]   and yes, we'll make one, like we make, again,
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:45.940]   make a match. - They're horologist.
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:48.900]   - Yes, and they want one, but they would only ever consider
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:50.540]   a gold watch and it's not that far from--
[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:53.260]   - You can lead a horologist to a watch,
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:56.260]   but you can't make them think or something.
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:57.420]   - Yeah, I-- - There would be a good--
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.260]   - That's a good family, family-fue topic of names
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:03.020]   to describe people who are buying the $17,000 Apple watch.
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.300]   - So-- - Number one answer.
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:06.700]   - So the Apple watch-- - Did they watch?
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:09.900]   - Yeah, you guys are in the room, so we're watching on TV
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:12.620]   and the price went by so fast we thought
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:15.260]   he actually didn't say it.
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.900]   Did it seem like the $10,000?
[01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:18.660]   - Oh no, it was not on the slide,
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:21.100]   and he sort of moved past it and there were gasps in the room.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.420]   - What? - I never thought it was for bid.
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:24.780]   - You know, a grouber nailed it, right?
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:26.340]   - Yep, yep. - In fact, you gotta think
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.180]   grouber had a little leak 'cause he even nailed
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.700]   the price difference for the 38 to 42 millimeter.
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.140]   - Oh, well, so he wanted 30, didn't he?
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:34.500]   He wanted a 30 dollar difference?
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.340]   - I think that's two with the-- - Yeah, no, I mean--
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.780]   Honestly, we've heard rumors for the last six, seven months,
[01:11:39.780 --> 01:11:42.060]   especially when you factor in price of gold, blah, blah,
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.340]   but I think it comes down to Apple wants,
[01:11:45.340 --> 01:11:48.460]   as Renee was saying, Apple wants the people
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.100]   who would normally buy high-end watches
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.660]   to be able to consider having an Apple watch on their wrist.
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.700]   - Right. - And in order to do that,
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.140]   they needed to make that tier.
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:58.420]   Is that tier designed for 99% of the population?
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:00.620]   No, should you consider getting it?
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:03.500]   If you are not in that 1% that it can afford it
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:06.540]   the way that we just afford iPhones every 18 months?
[01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:08.180]   - No. - Probably not.
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:10.980]   Like, the Apple watch edition is designed
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.660]   for a very sub-select group of people.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:16.620]   It's not Apple saying we're not interested in anyone
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:18.380]   but luxury people anymore,
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:21.460]   because clearly the vast majority of Apple watches
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:24.300]   that they are going to make are going to be 349
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.500]   to about $700, AKA. - Wow.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.620]   - That's about what most of their other,
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:31.820]   smart products cost at this point.
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.500]   - And I think maybe this is the point
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.100]   of having a 10 to $17,000 watch.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:39.860]   I was pleasantly surprised by the mere $800
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:42.180]   to steal with a Milanese band would cost.
[01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:45.900]   - Yeah, you're like, oh, that's a good deal, $800.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.980]   - And I think it's interesting that Apple
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:50.500]   has somehow once again gotten people to think,
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.340]   wow, only $350 for a watch.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.100]   - I mean, it took me a long time to think about a watch
[01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:56.940]   that cost that much.
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:12:58.740]   And now I'm not like, ah, it's pretty expensive.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.580]   That's not a problem.
[01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.740]   And I think that, you know, for the edition,
[01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:05.140]   I think Lady Gaga wearing it or, you know,
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.260]   someone like that, the question is really
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.540]   how many of the aluminum versions does that sell?
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.580]   - Yeah, well, and good logic from the comments
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:15.100]   was bringing up, you know, $10,000 watches,
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:17.420]   the majority, like the normal $10,000 Rolex,
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.980]   you can pass that on and wear it for 60 years.
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.700]   And this is probably going to be 18 months.
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:24.220]   And I had that thought and that kind of complaint too.
[01:13:24.220 --> 01:13:26.220]   I'm like, but what about the people
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.060]   who want to hand it down?
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:29.220]   And the answer is, this is not an heirloom watch.
[01:13:29.220 --> 01:13:31.900]   This is a watch for celebrities, models, et cetera.
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.180]   This is the watch for people who upgrade
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.500]   their fashion accessories the way the majority
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.060]   of us upgrade their phones.
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:41.260]   - There are people who are rich enough
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.860]   that a $17,000 watch is like $20 to you.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:45.220]   And it's like, oh, I'll take that.
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.060]   - And we heard that during the event,
[01:13:46.060 --> 01:13:47.260]   there are people who are like, oh,
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.980]   there are people who are much better dressed
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.220]   than we were standing in the corner of the night.
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:51.740]   - Oh, this feels like a fashion event.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:52.940]   This feels very much at home.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:53.940]   - Oh, you saw people.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:54.780]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:55.620]   - I know it's a fun game.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.060]   - It's hard to believe that there were people
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:58.220]   that are dressed better than us.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.300]   (laughing)
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.420]   There were a few.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.700]   - There's Prince Media Hill.
[01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.940]   I didn't tell her to be Prince Media Hill.
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:05.980]   - No, it was a very fun game at the beginning
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:07.500]   of the event being like, all right,
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:11.100]   journalist, engineer or fashion model.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.060]   - I think you could use the Christian Terlington
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:13.980]   stand out a little bit.
[01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:14.820]   - Yeah, a little bit.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.420]   - Even the reporters in Russian history
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.460]   were immaculate with like special hair and colors.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:20.300]   - Wow.
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:21.780]   - Yeah, very, very manicured.
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:23.740]   But I mean, going back to the original question,
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.140]   like how many normal, you know,
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:28.740]   how many sport and normal Apple watches
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.340]   are they going to sell with this?
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.820]   I think having it in the media
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.900]   and having it so prominently in fashion magazines
[01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:35.900]   will encourage a certain amount of, you know,
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:37.380]   me-tuness is where it's like,
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:38.740]   oh, Lady Gaga's wearing a watch.
[01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:39.580]   I want a watch.
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.780]   - It's no accident that Chinese Vogue and Vogue
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.300]   were the first places to do layouts with Apple watches.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:46.060]   - And the fact is, the watch is the same.
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:48.100]   The material is different, but the watch is the same.
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.500]   - And that's, let's make that clear.
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.420]   Except for the Sapphire crystal.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.260]   - Yeah.
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:14:54.500]   - All of them are the same, right?
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:55.900]   There's no special version.
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:56.740]   It's just the-
[01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:57.140]   - There's no pro-versa-
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:58.500]   - Software is the same.
[01:14:58.500 --> 01:14:59.340]   - Software is the same.
[01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:00.180]   The hardware inside.
[01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:01.780]   - The materials vary.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.380]   - All the bands will fit on every casing or the hardware.
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.260]   - Okay, so bands are completely interchangeable.
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.060]   The 38's and the 42's will go with 38 and 42 cases
[01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:09.980]   and you can swap.
[01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:11.980]   - And then it'll look great if you're a combination.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.500]   - If you're smart, you'd buy the Plastfloro Elastomer edition
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.220]   and then go down market and get a cheap buckle.
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:20.780]   - Yeah, it's entirely, I mean-
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.620]   - The silly spend 7,000.
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.100]   - Those people will not do that though.
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.500]   - Oh yeah, there are people who want those.
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:26.340]   - There are people who want those.
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:27.180]   - No, they're not real ones now.
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:29.100]   - These bands look like Mark Newson's old watch bands.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:31.500]   I mean, these are very particularly designed and-
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:33.260]   Like you read the thing that Gruber Link II
[01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:35.660]   where he said, "It takes nine hours to make the link bracelet
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:36.500]   "and then they hand polish it."
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.500]   - Yeah, we mocked it.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.820]   - Yeah, I mean, that is what-
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:40.980]   - I thought this was designing for.
[01:15:40.980 --> 01:15:42.300]   - I thought I wanted the link bracelet,
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:44.460]   but then when I saw how inexpensive the Milanese was,
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:46.020]   I thought, "I like the Milanese."
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.180]   - The Milanese is actually really, really nice.
[01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:49.020]   I did.
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:50.420]   So I was expecting that the Milanese
[01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:51.980]   was gonna like pull on arm hair
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.820]   and like be really cold and uncomfortable.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.220]   And I tried it right at the end before we were walking out
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:57.420]   and I was pleasantly surprised.
[01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.500]   It fits really nicely.
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.460]   - And its size is automatically 'cause it's a magnet.
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:03.580]   - It's a magnet, which also means that you can play with it
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.180]   and be like, "Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude."
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.300]   Which is probably really bad for me.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.860]   But I actually- - You too, I click things.
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.060]   - Exactly, but the leather band,
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:13.660]   the modern buckle is the one that I was really interested in
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:15.780]   and after playing with the Milanese,
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.460]   I'm like, "Maybe I want a Milanese
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:21.780]   as the fancy non-running roller derby band that I use."
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.020]   - What are you gonna wear at roller derby?
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.580]   - Oh, I'm gonna wear a sport.
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.220]   I'm gonna wear a sport for the first two months.
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.220]   My goal is to see how hard I can push it
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:30.940]   without breaking it, which I'm sure it made a lot of,
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.620]   when I was talking to Apple PR about this,
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.940]   they were like, "I don't know if this is a good thing
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.500]   or a bad thing."
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.740]   But yeah, I really like the bands.
[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.300]   The one thing I should say about the bands
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:44.500]   is that they all have different length sizes.
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.500]   I was talking to a friend of ours who was like,
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:49.300]   "I have a really thick wrist and I actually don't know
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.540]   if the length of any of these bands will be big enough for me."
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.980]   And that is a question.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:55.580]   And whether or not- - There's a sizing chart
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.780]   on the line. - There is, yes.
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:59.380]   - Not to size, which bugs the hell out of me.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.740]   My inner geek says, "Why don't you make this to size
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.300]   so I could print it and check my wrist."
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:06.140]   - Although in the Apple Store- - They'll do that.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.740]   - There's a thing where you can put the phone down
[01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:11.060]   on your wrist to properly size the 38
[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.060]   or the 42.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.740]   - If you got 8.2, you got the new watch app.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.140]   - The watch app. - Yeah, the watch app.
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:19.380]   So there's a scizer in here?
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.220]   - I don't think it's in the watch app.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.580]   I think it's in the Apple Store when you're looking at like,
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:27.220]   "I'm gonna buy this size versus the size."
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.500]   - What will availability be like?
[01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:30.020]   Should we get in line now?
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.220]   - Well, so they're not gonna take pre-orders
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:33.620]   for a little bit. - April 10th.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:34.460]   - April 10th, correct.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:37.420]   And the really cool thing that I was kind of hoping
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:39.780]   that they would do is that they are gonna have
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.460]   trions basically available.
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:43.900]   They're gonna have, the Apple stores are going to have watches
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:47.340]   starting April 10th and they have these beautiful tables
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.580]   that are like special unlocked by employee badges
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.500]   where you can go and make an appointment and try on
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.260]   whatever watch you want and really decide ahead of time,
[01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.100]   "Okay, this is the Apple watch."
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.620]   So you're not blindly ordering online being like,
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:02.220]   "I don't know if the 38 or the 42 is too big for my wrist."
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:05.140]   You actually get the chance to go in to try everything on
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:08.940]   to figure out what's best for you.
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:12.020]   That said, how tightly demanded--
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:14.420]   - Would you help me take my phone off?
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:16.900]   - Using the silly thing you talked about last time.
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.820]   So this is the Apple Store app.
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:22.740]   In here there is something that will let me pick your favorite,
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.660]   I already picked my favorite model by then.
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:25.620]   - Oh, it's so easy.
[01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:28.060]   And there's a great third party site that someone put up
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:30.300]   called Mix Your Watch that allows you to kind of
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.740]   - To match and mix and match. - Mix and match.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:32.580]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:33.660]   - Where do I get the size here?
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.740]   - I think you go to the Apple Watch page.
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:36.980]   I only saw a screenshot of it.
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:39.540]   So I'm designing you blind here.
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:40.380]   - I'm gonna learn more.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:42.020]   - Let's find out together.
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:42.860]   - You pricing?
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:44.100]   - Shop.
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.020]   Let's shop.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.180]   - Let's shop for the Apple Watch.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:47.820]   - I want a shop, Apple Watch Sport.
[01:18:47.820 --> 01:18:48.780]   I want the addition.
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:49.620]   No, no, no.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:50.460]   - Oh, crap.
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:51.460]   - You see how easy that is.
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.620]   - I'm absolutely absolutely.
[01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:53.460]   - Go so easily.
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.300]   - I'm like, what did I do?
[01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:55.300]   - I accidentally spent 10 minutes.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.420]   - You thought it wasn't available yet.
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.740]   - You pressed the wrong button.
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.580]   - I did that.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.420]   I've done that.
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:00.540]   Let's put it that way.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:01.380]   - Yep.
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:03.540]   - Overview, maybe, and it's in the overview.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.620]   All right, well, I'm at one waste everybody's time.
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.060]   - We'll fiddle around.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:07.900]   Figure it out.
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:10.940]   - If April 10th, could I order online?
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:12.260]   Do you think, or do you're gonna have to go
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:13.300]   to a store to do this?
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.460]   - Oh, I think you could order online.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.060]   You can already click around online now
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:17.180]   and pick which one you want.
[01:19:17.180 --> 01:19:18.340]   You just can't put it in your heart.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.180]   - I hearted it.
[01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:20.020]   - There you go.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:20.860]   - Same with the MacBook.
[01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:21.940]   - I want, oh.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:23.500]   Actual size.
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.460]   Wow, well, that's kinda cool.
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.540]   So now I can kind of see what that's gonna look like.
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:29.700]   Do you think Serenity, having tried these on,
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:31.620]   I'm looking at your wrist.
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:32.460]   You have normal wrist.
[01:19:32.460 --> 01:19:34.500]   - Yeah, so my wrists are pretty tiny
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:35.820]   as wrist sizes.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.140]   I mean, I can do that.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:37.980]   - Okay, you can put your fingers on the camera.
[01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:39.140]   - Yeah, in the camera here.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:41.300]   My wrists are pretty small.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.140]   - Which one would you get?
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.780]   - But that said, I tried on both,
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:46.940]   and I think I slightly prefer the 38 millimeter.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.980]   The 42 actually fit better on my wrist than I thought it was.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:50.820]   - It doesn't look that big.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:51.660]   - It's not that big.
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:52.500]   - No, it's really not.
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.940]   I mean, I tried on a Motos 360 before the September event,
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:58.220]   and it felt like it was basically dwarfing my wrist
[01:19:58.220 --> 01:19:59.060]   to make it look like it.
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:19:59.900]   - Important thing to remember,
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.220]   so the 360 actually, if you put them together,
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:04.020]   this is the 42 millimeter.
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:06.700]   - Oh, the Apple's measuring the height
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.500]   with the millimeters, not the width.
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:12.740]   - So the problem for the 360, for the 360, for me,
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:15.260]   is that when I try and put it on,
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:17.780]   the roundness of it actually looks like
[01:20:17.780 --> 01:20:18.900]   it completely dwarfs my wrist.
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:21.260]   You can't tell that there's a wrist there.
[01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:23.460]   - But the little golden pillow doesn't look that way.
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.300]   - Yeah, no, the little golden pillow actually,
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.740]   no, it felt quite nice.
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:29.060]   The height is the real thing.
[01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:32.260]   It's like the first edition Apple watch is fairly,
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.700]   I think it's about the height of the Motos 360.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.260]   It's not super high off your wrist,
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.100]   but it's high enough that anybody who's used to
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.900]   a very thin, tiny little watch.
[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.780]   - Half one under your cuffs.
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:43.740]   - Yes, it'll be a little bit strange.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:47.140]   So the 42 plus that height felt a little bulky to me.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:49.180]   The 38 felt just fine.
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:51.740]   - And UI-wise, are you gonna miss those extra little,
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:52.820]   four little millimeters?
[01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:56.100]   - I don't think so, but again, my fingers are small.
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:57.380]   - Or the battery life.
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:58.700]   - Yes, or the battery life.
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:20:59.540]   - The battery life, that is the one.
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:00.380]   - That is the one, yes.
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:01.380]   - Oh, I guess it would be.
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:03.540]   - Yeah, they're quoted battery life.
[01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:06.260]   The 18 hour battery life is actually for the 38.
[01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:07.500]   And then in small print, they're like,
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.500]   the 42 millimeter is expected to get slightly more
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.820]   battery life. - Slightly.
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:13.540]   - And that was one of the things that we learned
[01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:14.740]   was the battery life stuff.
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:16.140]   We didn't know that.
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:17.580]   Six months ago, all they said was,
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.940]   "At the end of the day, you can charge it."
[01:21:19.940 --> 01:21:21.140]   And we're like, "I guess that means
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.340]   you don't charge it during the day."
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:23.180]   - Hopefully not.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:24.500]   - And they came out and said,
[01:21:24.500 --> 01:21:25.860]   based on our tests, we're talking about
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:27.580]   Apple Performance tests again here,
[01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:28.900]   that you can get through a day.
[01:21:28.900 --> 01:21:32.340]   - And 18 hours based on their very specific usage.
[01:21:32.340 --> 01:21:34.420]   - One thing that Motorola did right
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:39.420]   is that the band is really close to the bottom of the watch.
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:41.500]   So that's more comfortable.
[01:21:41.500 --> 01:21:42.820]   Of course, it means the watch is more likely
[01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:44.260]   to catch in a cuff.
[01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.540]   Where does the band sit on the Apple watch?
[01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.780]   Is it kind of more in the middle?
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:50.900]   - It depends slightly on what band you're using.
[01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:53.060]   Some of the bands, like the Sport Band,
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.140]   does sort of like that curve into the Apple watch.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.500]   But I think it sits about, I don't know,
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:02.100]   two or three millimeters off the bottom of the watch.
[01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:03.860]   And it cooks in pretty nicely.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:04.700]   I didn't find it.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:07.820]   I was wearing long sleeves and I did the pullover
[01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:09.820]   and the pullback test and I didn't really have
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:11.060]   any problems with it.
[01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:12.380]   - And the fits are really exact.
[01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:14.380]   And even with the buckle, when you close it properly,
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.180]   it just feels stuck.
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:17.940]   - Let's talk battery life real quickly.
[01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:19.260]   - Thank you.
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.180]   - All day!
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.020]   - All day.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:21.860]   - All day.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:22.740]   - If you go to bed.
[01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:24.060]   - Yeah.
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:25.580]   - Yeah, they're not including sleep-free-
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:26.740]   - They do expect that you need to sleep.
[01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:27.900]   - We know Tim Cook sleeps for very long.
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.380]   - Dracula would not.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:31.060]   - I've heard off the record that people are like,
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.420]   people, you can use it for a day,
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:33.620]   like it'll last until the next morning,
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:34.940]   but then you have to take it off and charge it.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:36.820]   And that's inconvenient because you wanna be using it.
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:38.780]   So it just makes sense to charge it at night.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:40.100]   - I think we're gonna, you know,
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:42.860]   I've never understood why people are so worried.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:43.740]   Of course you're wearing a pebble.
[01:22:43.740 --> 01:22:45.540]   You get seven days, it's on all the time.
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:46.460]   - Sure, I actually think it's a problem
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.420]   because I never bothered to charge.
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:49.260]   - Oh, you forget.
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.100]   - You have pebbles.
[01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:51.420]   I think one day is good because you just train yourself
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:52.260]   to charge every night.
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.100]   - I'm gonna plug in my MacBook.
[01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.100]   - That's exactly my phone and my watch all at once.
[01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.620]   I go to bed in the morning, they'll all be ready to go.
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:58.460]   - Andy, did you say so?
[01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.780]   - I think, I think one of the products.
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:02.580]   - Hold on a second, Alex, Andy.
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:03.860]   - No, I was agreeing with Jason,
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:04.900]   that was exactly my experience.
[01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.660]   I was, oh, my pebble was always running down to zero
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:10.540]   because I was not in the habit of charging every day.
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:13.060]   Whereas the, after the first software update
[01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:16.540]   on the Moto 360, it gets easily a one full day
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:18.660]   and then easily into the next morning.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.100]   And you know, at the end of the day,
[01:23:20.100 --> 01:23:21.060]   you're gonna take this off
[01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:23.140]   and you're gonna put it on your nightstand anyway.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:25.660]   And because it's not a plugging thing,
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:26.700]   it's not even a magnetic thing,
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.780]   it's just dropping onto this cradle,
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.860]   you may as well put it in and get it recharged again.
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:31.700]   - Yeah.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:35.580]   - All right, so how do you think it's gonna do?
[01:23:35.580 --> 01:23:37.540]   Is it now based on every, oh, go ahead, Alex.
[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:38.580]   I'm sorry, you had something to say.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.900]   - All it's gonna say is I think that,
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.660]   there'll be a lot of charging opportunities.
[01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:43.020]   I think that people who are commuting
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.100]   are gonna end up having something
[01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:45.580]   a little charger in their car,
[01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:47.580]   that they possibly pop it on,
[01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.300]   for long commutes and so on and so forth.
[01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:51.300]   If they're, I think if they're like me,
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.100]   they'll throw chargers everywhere.
[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:56.660]   - The chargers are not super expensive, I think.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.660]   They're $30 or $40. - That's the $40.
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:01.300]   - Depending on how long the cable is.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:02.580]   - There's a nice accessories page.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.540]   Again, for people who are looking to see what bands
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:07.340]   they can afford for the watch,
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:09.300]   it's all in the store,
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.740]   although none of them are currently available.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.860]   We were told by a couple Apple reps that--
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:13.860]   - Not even the accessories.
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:15.820]   - Yeah, the accessories will be available,
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.980]   but they may not be available immediately
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:19.620]   with the pre-order of the watch.
[01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:22.540]   So you may have to wait to get your fancy band.
[01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:23.380]   - Get the band you want.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.220]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:24:24.220 --> 01:24:25.660]   Get the band you want with your collection
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.860]   and then purchase the other thing.
[01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:27.700]   - Well, that's another thing.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.820]   When I go, when there's iPhone shortages,
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:31.100]   sometimes you get a Sprint phone
[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:32.420]   and you wanted a T-Mobile phone.
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:33.740]   Will there be like,
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:35.700]   oh, if you really wanna watch today,
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.900]   you're gonna have to buy this steel one?
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:39.140]   - I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:41.380]   Although, again, if it may,
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.180]   they're talking about having reservations
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:44.420]   for the try-on process
[01:24:44.420 --> 01:24:46.100]   and it may be once you try something on,
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.140]   you have the option to put in your reservation
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:49.620]   and they give you a like,
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:51.020]   come back at this date
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.540]   and we will service you with a watch.
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:56.860]   But that, I mean, I think it really depends
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:00.140]   on, again, what you're getting,
[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:03.660]   if you're even considering something outrageously expensive
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.260]   and what the popular models will be.
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:08.900]   I think Apple will sell quite a few sports,
[01:25:08.900 --> 01:25:11.980]   but I also think we'll see a lot of demand
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:13.260]   for the regular watch.
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:16.220]   - We were talking yesterday with a near-aisle
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:21.220]   who is an expert in the psychology of game addiction
[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:22.700]   and app addiction and so forth.
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.180]   And we talked about something called price anchoring
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:29.380]   and I've talked about this also with Daniel Arielli
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:31.300]   who's the author of "Predictably Irrational."
[01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.340]   Wall Street Journal does this.
[01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:33.900]   They have a low price item
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.820]   that they don't expect anybody to buy,
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.900]   but they put it there to establish that,
[01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:38.660]   oh, this is a pretty,
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:39.580]   the second item is a pretty good deal.
[01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:40.660]   - You can't see in the door.
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.780]   - Is that what's gonna happen with a sport watch?
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:43.900]   Is that the anchor?
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:45.500]   - You ever bought on a Mac online
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:46.340]   when you go in there and it says,
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:47.340]   "Well, just for a hundred bucks more,
[01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:48.740]   you can get this just for another hundred."
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:49.580]   And then you start adding
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:50.420]   and it starts going,
[01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:53.020]   - We see you built a $30,000 Mac Pro.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.740]   - The old joke in marketing was that you always have
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:25:56.260]   a low price item to get someone in the door.
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:57.820]   You have the middle price item that everyone gets
[01:25:57.820 --> 01:25:58.780]   and you have the premium item
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:00.500]   that the people who think they're too good for the middle class.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.340]   Like the middle,
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.220]   so the steel really is the item.
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:04.060]   You think now,
[01:26:04.060 --> 01:26:05.300]   I now may be revising,
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.820]   especially now that we've seen the price,
[01:26:06.820 --> 01:26:09.180]   that they're gonna get a lot of sales on the steel
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:10.260]   that they may end up being,
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:12.100]   except for roller derby queens.
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.100]   - The price is close enough.
[01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:14.940]   The price is closer than I think we feared.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.700]   I think a bunch of us started to panic and think,
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.460]   like, "Oh God, it's gonna be $1,000."
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.740]   And it's in the ballpark.
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:21.260]   In fact, if you bought a sport
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:22.900]   and then added in a leather band,
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:24.460]   you're within $100 of money.
[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.500]   - Just $100 more Jason.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.660]   - The blank one with the leather band.
[01:26:27.660 --> 01:26:28.500]   - Isn't that the key?
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.340]   - It's small increments.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:30.180]   - Now, I have to tell you,
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:31.140]   I won't tell you who,
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:32.540]   but a friend of mine said,
[01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:35.420]   "Oh, I want the one with the Mickey Mouse face on it."
[01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.020]   And so they're gonna have a problem here
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:38.700]   because people go there and go,
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.660]   "Well, I know they all have the Mickey Mouse face,
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:42.500]   but that person said,
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.340]   "Oh, but I like that."
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:45.140]   And it was gonna order that one
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:46.140]   'cause it has the Mickey Mouse face.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:47.220]   - It was John de Vorak, wasn't it?
[01:26:47.220 --> 01:26:48.220]   - It was, it's very accurate.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.740]   - And I think they have a step in the buying process
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:51.540]   where it shows you the faces.
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:52.380]   So you, like, I think--
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:53.580]   - But this explains why Apple wants you
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:54.420]   to come into the store,
[01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:56.260]   where they've trained their people.
[01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.460]   There is a little bit of a learning curve here.
[01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.340]   This is the one I want,
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:00.500]   the 42 millimeter, which is--
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:01.940]   - Beautiful, Johnny Ives style claws,
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.940]   grab you by the ankles, lift you up and shake you
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:04.980]   and shake you and shake you,
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:06.540]   which all your money drops down
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:08.620]   the well of that beautifully designed table.
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:09.700]   - I gotta measure my wrist.
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.740]   I don't know how many millimeters my wrist is.
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:12.580]   - Fabric tape.
[01:27:12.580 --> 01:27:13.420]   - You'll be fine.
[01:27:13.420 --> 01:27:14.260]   - Yeah.
[01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.100]   - 'Cause I only had fabric tape.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:16.020]   - No, it's--
[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:17.540]   - You're a thespian, you make costumes,
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:18.380]   I don't have a fabric.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:19.460]   - You can buy 'em for like a dollar in CBS.
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:20.460]   - I know, I'll get a fabric.
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:23.100]   - But yeah, the one thing that kind of bummed me out was,
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:24.860]   you know, there is a fair amount to be said
[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:26.460]   about the retail experience.
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:28.980]   And Tim Cook says a little bit at the end of the,
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:31.340]   at the end of the presentation,
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:32.820]   oh, the retail's gonna be this way
[01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:34.620]   and we have special tables.
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:35.860]   And I was like, all right,
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.580]   this is a perfect introduction to Angela Arrence
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:40.580]   and then she did not appear.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.060]   - Well, they were,
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:43.740]   and it was not any minute event
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.220]   and they had a front row and Eddie Q was there,
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:48.380]   Craig Federighi was there, Angela Arrence was there.
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:49.220]   - They were all there, yeah.
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.420]   - They were all in the front row,
[01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.540]   but I think that they were there in state.
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:56.100]   And I think it would have been nice to get her up,
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:58.100]   but frankly, they had a lot to say
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:27:59.380]   in a short period of relative issue.
[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:00.740]   - Yeah, but they could have said something else
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.460]   that was very important by not having
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:04.060]   an all male presentation.
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.820]   - Well, that's true and Samsung did so well with that,
[01:28:06.820 --> 01:28:07.660]   didn't they, on the end six?
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:08.860]   - Yeah, well, Kristy, Kristy,
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:09.700]   - Kristy, you're telling Tim.
[01:28:09.700 --> 01:28:10.540]   - Kristy, you're telling Tim.
[01:28:10.540 --> 01:28:12.300]   - She's the first woman that Apple has had
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:13.500]   on the stage in five years.
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:14.340]   - What?
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.180]   - Yeah.
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.020]   - So.
[01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.780]   - I think you do a presentation rather than
[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:18.620]   - She was a superman.
[01:28:18.620 --> 01:28:19.460]   - And she was a superman.
[01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:20.780]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:22.380]   No, including, I think including some of them
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.780]   is the last time was Angie Mocle with what?
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:25.620]   - Holy cow.
[01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:26.460]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:28.340]   - So Burke, who's the master of model making here
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:33.340]   at the Zwitt brick house has made me a 32 and a 48 millimeter.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:36.460]   Now Burke, I need a 150 millimeter strap.
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:38.060]   Can you even, no.
[01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:39.620]   So there's the size.
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:42.580]   And so you can see what that would look like on your wrist
[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.460]   or compare it to the Moto 360.
[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:46.740]   And you say that, or look, it's exactly,
[01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:47.940]   it's pretty much exactly the size.
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.820]   - Well, yeah, but the pebbles got all of the stuff
[01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.260]   that extends on either side of it.
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.100]   So it's all really well-established.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:52.940]   - Yeah, it's just more of a level.
[01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:53.780]   - Yeah.
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:54.620]   - Yeah.
[01:28:54.620 --> 01:28:57.820]   - All right, so I don't,
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:00.900]   so Serene, you might buy the 42 or?
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:03.460]   - I think I'm pretty much set on the 38,
[01:29:03.460 --> 01:29:06.300]   but the 42 was less bulky than I expected it to be.
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.140]   - Not as bad.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:07.980]   - It's going 42.
[01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:11.300]   - I think I might, in next, in like intervening years,
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:12.780]   like next year or the year after,
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:16.140]   I may go 42 if they decrease the height a little bit.
[01:29:16.140 --> 01:29:19.780]   I think the 42 with the height on my little tiny girl wrist
[01:29:19.780 --> 01:29:21.580]   is probably a little bit too much.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:22.940]   But for the majority of people,
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.900]   I think it should be just fine.
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:25.900]   - Sliders.
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:26.740]   - Sliders.
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:27.580]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:28.420]   - Slenders.
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:29.260]   - What you don't like little tiny girl wrist,
[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:31.500]   is that not the, not the adjective?
[01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:32.660]   - It was really that small.
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:34.020]   I don't think.
[01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.140]   - Are you, I don't know.
[01:29:36.140 --> 01:29:36.980]   I don't know.
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.300]   - Anyway, I mean, in comparison?
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:39.300]   - Where we get away with that.
[01:29:39.300 --> 01:29:40.460]   - That's fine.
[01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:41.460]   - They get the elbow and not the wrist.
[01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:42.300]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:44.060]   - It's very, it's all.
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:47.180]   - Whoa, is it someone was, someone in the chat room
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:48.260]   was saying something interesting.
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:50.100]   And now, now I have a phone.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:50.940]   - We'll teach them.
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:52.220]   - Can I just say that it,
[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:54.980]   we do really need to point out that as excited
[01:29:54.980 --> 01:29:56.180]   as we're all getting about this,
[01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:59.820]   we're talking about $600 plus for a stainless steel watch
[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:02.580]   that in itself doesn't do anything.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.460]   It only makes the phone more useful and more handy.
[01:30:06.460 --> 01:30:09.620]   And that for $600, that can,
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:12.060]   if someone says, I've got a $600 budget
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:14.820]   to radically improve the way that I use the computers
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.380]   and the services that I have in my house
[01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.340]   and in my office and in my personal life,
[01:30:18.340 --> 01:30:20.500]   I'm not sure if I would steer them towards that.
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:21.580]   - Leo's making animation.
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:22.420]   - If they were saying that,
[01:30:22.420 --> 01:30:25.180]   if they were saying that I wanted to spend hundreds
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:27.140]   of dollars on a really cool watch,
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.620]   and it's nice if it has features too, maybe.
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:30.460]   - Andy.
[01:30:30.460 --> 01:30:31.300]   - People are missing right now.
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:33.500]   As Andy speaking, Leo's watching the animation
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:34.340]   of the stainless steel watch.
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:35.180]   - Look at this Andy.
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:36.020]   And then tell me how much you would pay.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:36.860]   Can you show my screen?
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:38.460]   - I can see the money flying out of Leo's office.
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:41.300]   - Now tell me how much you would pay for this.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.140]   (laughing)
[01:30:42.140 --> 01:30:42.980]   - Ooh.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:44.900]   - I've seen a gift of that.
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.580]   - We're looking at the Milanese loop and how it connects.
[01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:49.540]   So I had an insight Andy,
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:50.900]   and I think you'll understand this
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.220]   because you use an Android phone.
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:55.340]   One of the reasons I use an Android phone over an iPhone
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:57.900]   is I want, the nice thing about the Android phone
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.020]   in the larger space is I can use widgets.
[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:02.860]   So I turn on the phone and I get information immediately.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:05.340]   I don't have to dig into an icon and launch an app.
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:07.140]   I have my calendar, I have time,
[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:08.300]   I have weather, all of that stuff
[01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:10.900]   because of the widgets on an Android phone.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:14.620]   And that to me is kind of the compelling reason.
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:17.540]   There's my email, there's New York Times headlines,
[01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:20.060]   there's messages, there's my calendar.
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:22.820]   And I don't have to dig, I don't have to launch an app.
[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:27.180]   And that to me is really the single most compelling
[01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:28.820]   feature that's missing in the iPhone.
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:33.820]   This grid of icons just doesn't speak to me literally.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.020]   That's what the watch is.
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:38.660]   The watch is a $600 widget panel.
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:40.540]   And you know what?
[01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.300]   I think it may be the single thing
[01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:44.820]   that can make me happy again with the iPhone.
[01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:49.380]   - Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna do a drill down into,
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:51.940]   and to fill us out with what should Apple be making,
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:53.740]   which what does this mean for making this?
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:55.660]   I can only think I can say with the absolute truth
[01:31:55.660 --> 01:31:57.860]   is that I really wish they had found a way
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:02.300]   to make a decent smart watch that cost anywhere under $300.
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:05.020]   And I really, really wish that there wasn't so,
[01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:07.900]   as Renee said, tilted above,
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:11.500]   oh well, you can have the cheap one for just working out,
[01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.300]   but here's the nice designer one
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.540]   that we think is the middle of the road one.
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.500]   I just wish they had found a way to say,
[01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:19.540]   we've decided to say here's 300 bucks
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:22.860]   to design the best look and watch we can possibly do.
[01:32:22.860 --> 01:32:25.020]   - But that's not Apple's way, look at the MacBook.
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.580]   Don't you think that the next generation,
[01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:28.700]   the generation after they could do a nice expensive one?
[01:32:28.700 --> 01:32:30.620]   - The MacBook has features
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:33.540]   and it has operational differences between one and the other.
[01:32:33.540 --> 01:32:36.380]   But the thing that I'm really trying to get my head around
[01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:38.500]   to the extent that part one of my write up
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:42.180]   posted late this morning or early this afternoon,
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:43.900]   part two is the part where I talk about the watch.
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:46.420]   And when I talk about the addition,
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:49.060]   it really is, the sneak preview is just two sentences
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.980]   and it says that my feelings on the addition are complicated
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:53.940]   and I don't feel like I can articulate them
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:55.660]   without another week's worth of reflection.
[01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:57.980]   And that literally is the end of that section
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:00.300]   because I don't know how we feel about
[01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:03.540]   we could pour any material into this mold,
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:05.140]   we poured gold into it,
[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:07.980]   that costs us an extra two grand, maybe a materials,
[01:33:07.980 --> 01:33:10.140]   but we decided to see how much we could ask for it
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:11.580]   and see if there's nothing wrong
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:12.700]   with running a business that way.
[01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:15.100]   I'm just truly trying to get my head around
[01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:16.620]   the idea of making a product that way.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:18.300]   - Yeah, I think going back to what we were talking about
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:21.260]   earlier, Andy, it's not a how much money
[01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:22.540]   can we make off of this product.
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:26.940]   It's this product is priced for a certain subsection
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:30.180]   of the people who will only pay this amount of money.
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:31.660]   I mean, our boss.
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:33.380]   - But at the same time, at the same time,
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:34.340]   why not 30,000?
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:35.740]   Why not $100,000?
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:36.580]   Why not $8,000?
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:38.380]   - Just having the platinum tier for a second.
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.060]   - I feel like the addition is not--
[01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:41.420]   - I just think it's very, very weird to say that
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:44.220]   we're just gonna guess at how much money we're in.
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:47.300]   When you can put any dollar amount on it,
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:49.060]   I believe that to an extent you're saying
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:51.860]   this object has no value.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:54.500]   I believe that in a philosophical way.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:55.980]   - Well, going back to the regular,
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:59.420]   the sport and the regular Apple Watch,
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.420]   the thing that I think is gonna be really interesting
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:04.140]   is next year's model or two years from now's model,
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:06.500]   because if it follows the same kind of pattern
[01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:08.140]   that we've seen in the iPad and the iPhone
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:09.660]   and the iPod and everything else,
[01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:11.860]   you're gonna be able to get the original Apple Watch
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:13.740]   for 50 or $100 cheaper.
[01:34:13.740 --> 01:34:15.900]   And if you have the 349 Apple Watch sport,
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:19.020]   as suddenly the 249 Apple Watch sport,
[01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:21.820]   from last year, that still runs the same operating system,
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:23.540]   but is maybe a little bit bulkier,
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:26.540]   that becomes a lot easier of a sell for people who are like,
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:28.740]   oh, well, I never really thought about getting a smartwatch.
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:32.060]   But now that this is potentially an option,
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:34.740]   this might be something that I can do.
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:38.060]   Could Apple price something at 249 this year,
[01:34:38.060 --> 01:34:41.500]   could they have initiated the Apple Watch sport?
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.300]   Possibly, but the margins I'm guessing
[01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:47.260]   would not be good enough for them to be able
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:49.460]   to innovate the way that they want to be innovating.
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:53.900]   - The iPhone and iPad didn't start at the price this low.
[01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:57.060]   I mean, I accept that it's an accessory,
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:58.260]   and so it's a little bit different,
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:01.620]   but I feel like this is still a product that starts at 349,
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:03.540]   and it's the first generation.
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:06.300]   And the existence, I think the existence of the addition
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:10.740]   is a distraction, which is why they didn't talk about it
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:14.540]   in any great detail, didn't show the gold video on stage,
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.540]   because it's playing to a different audience.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:19.140]   - It's a different group, and it's sort of aspirational,
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:22.940]   but the bottom line is, I would agree more with Andy
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:26.340]   if this $10,000 product was unlike the other products,
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:28.660]   but the only difference is the metal is different.
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:30.980]   - And also the conversations that they get to have.
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:32.860]   - I'm sorry, is that you free or disagree?
[01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:34.060]   I just started a mere cat,
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.860]   'cause we're gonna talk about that a little bit later.
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:39.380]   The conversations that they get to have by having,
[01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.140]   there are some really expensive watches
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:43.020]   that have really crappy plastic mechanisms in it,
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:44.580]   and has no relationship with anything,
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:46.980]   but this product allows them to have the people
[01:35:46.980 --> 01:35:48.260]   at this event that they had,
[01:35:48.260 --> 01:35:49.780]   allows the watch to be in the magazines,
[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:51.020]   allows them to have the conversations
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:52.980]   and be in fashion week, and do all these things.
[01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.940]   - And then regular people can buy one for 350.
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:56.140]   - Yes, have spent 10,000.
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:57.340]   - This is not the Rolex option, right?
[01:35:57.340 --> 01:35:58.180]   - No.
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.900]   - You can't get a can of rye for 350.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:00.740]   Do you have a second one?
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:01.580]   - You have a second one.
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:02.420]   - I would agree that Jason can use.
[01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:03.260]   - Yeah, thank you.
[01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:04.100]   - Oh yeah.
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:06.660]   - I think most importantly, a $10,000 watch
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:10.500]   makes a $350 watch and an $850 watch look cheap.
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:11.620]   - Yeah, that's true too.
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:13.620]   - That's probably the most important piece of this,
[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:16.100]   of having a $10,000 watch is to have us know
[01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:17.340]   that we're buying the little watch
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.980]   instead of the $850 watch.
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:22.940]   - Well, as I think Gruber said a while ago about Coke,
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:24.420]   whether you're the president
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:25.300]   or you're just a gun the street,
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:26.660]   everyone's drinking the same Coke.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:28.180]   And you can get a gold watch, sure,
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:30.140]   but if only if you have $350,
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:31.340]   you're having the same experience
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:33.180]   as someone who has an interesting idea, isn't it?
[01:36:33.180 --> 01:36:35.260]   Like, well, that may look prettier,
[01:36:35.260 --> 01:36:36.620]   but I got the same watch in the side.
[01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:37.620]   - You got the same watch, exactly.
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:38.940]   - You can get a--
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:40.580]   - It doesn't hurt the iPhone that you could buy
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.900]   a Swarovski blinged out iPhone.
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:44.740]   - Doesn't hurt the Volkswagen that you can buy a Porsche.
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:47.900]   - The Vertu exists, but it doesn't put anybody.
[01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.220]   Well, it's interesting.
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:53.060]   I think Apple is right to kind of push it aside
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:55.420]   because it is kind of a hot button topic,
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:57.260]   but at the same time.
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:58.140]   - All right.
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:36:59.300]   - I disagree with that point of view,
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:00.460]   but that's a half hour conversation.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:01.300]   So I'll simply say that--
[01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:02.300]   - No, it's a good conversation.
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:04.980]   I think it's a fascinating conversation.
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:05.980]   And your point is--
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:08.420]   - A good one for 20 minutes past two,
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:11.180]   a bad one for three minutes past until four.
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:12.500]   - Well, that's my secret, Andy.
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:13.420]   I always wait 'til the end of the show.
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:14.260]   - Here's the good news.
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:15.780]   We have such a big panel
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:17.780]   and Steve Gibson's under the weather,
[01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:19.820]   so we aren't going to do a security now
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:21.700]   at one o'clock as we normally would do.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:22.860]   - Good news, he's sick.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:24.220]   - Here's the good news.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:25.660]   This is a four hour show.
[01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:26.660]   All right.
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:27.820]   - It's a telephone now.
[01:37:27.820 --> 01:37:30.660]   - Until we raise one more dollar than we did last year.
[01:37:30.660 --> 01:37:33.540]   - Until we raise the money for Leo to get an edition.
[01:37:33.540 --> 01:37:34.740]   - Oh, there's a thought.
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.700]   I could do a Patreon or a--
[01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:37.940]   I could do a Kickstarter.
[01:37:37.940 --> 01:37:39.260]   We could just buy Leo an edition.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:40.180]   - Just like New Year's.
[01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:42.700]   - I guarantee you, there will be a Kickstarter
[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:44.140]   to buy somebody an edition at someone.
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:44.980]   - This was a mistake.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:48.140]   - There was a Kickstarter for a guy to ride on the--
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:51.860]   what was it, the Emirates or the Edithod suite.
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:53.260]   - There was a Kickstarter for potato salad.
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:38:18.440]   I mean, there's no
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:22.140]   on a green screen, Jason Snell from six colors,
[01:38:22.140 --> 01:38:25.800]   Andy Anaco, this is, these are the people I would spend my
[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:28.640]   life with all the time, if I could, I want you to invite
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:31.840]   you to my house and just you can move in with me and Lisa
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.840]   and just live with me because you guys are the greatest.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.920]   I love Andi will solve crimes.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:39.920]   Yes, it is, it's the justice league.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.920]   But only if Andi brings whatever, is that Scotch, Andy?
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.220]   That is, that is my old conference, green-spot whiskey.
[01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:48.440]   Oh, no!
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.720]   You can tell that I'm not a big drinker because I got this
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.120]   two years ago, but oh my gosh, good as this tasty stuff.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:55.920]   And we mentioned, we're such a big crowd, we should all be
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.920]   drinking whiskey, I thought, you know what we taste right now?
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.560]   It's some of this beautiful green spot.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.120]   The sun has gone over the yard arm, if you are interested,
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:04.920]   I can--
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.620]   It's always five o'clock somewhere, no, I'm good for now.
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:08.120]   Are you?
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.760]   OK, because we have plenty of brown liquor in the other room.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:11.800]   And good stuff too.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:14.040]   Yeah, I think the good stuff is so dangerous.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.000]   I know.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]   I'm like Lou Grant.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000]   That's true.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.580]   I turned into a 1940s--
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:20.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:21.820]   That's a classic.
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:23.140]   I've worked with many, many people.
[01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:25.220]   I've worked in journalism for all these years.
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.140]   You've got to have a bottle in it.
[01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:27.420]   The bottle in the bottom drawer?
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.100]   That is a thing that really still happens.
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:30.700]   You have to have the novel in the middle drawer,
[01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:31.700]   in the bottom drawer.
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:34.700]   We've seen Mad Men, Jason.
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:35.300]   It still happens.
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:37.300]   Tom Merritt bought, and I think it's still here.
[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:40.180]   He bought the Mad Men whiskey--
[01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:40.660]   Nice.
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:41.900]   --the metal lined whiskey things.
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:42.820]   I think he left it here.
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.860]   I don't know, maybe he decided it would better not
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:46.060]   to have it at home.
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:47.320]   Our show today brought to you by--
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:50.600]   we're going to come back with lots more from Mac Break Weekly.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.320]   I'm sure they'll find something to talk about.
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:52.600]   It's OK.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:53.800]   You can show the Coke can.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:54.300]   Oh, no.
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:55.000]   Are you hiding it?
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.440]   You don't want to give him a free drink?
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.040]   You mentioned it's time for a bathroom break.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.240]   So please tell me more about Squarespace.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:02.240]   I would like to know more about Squarespace.
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:03.440]   I keep this already on the low.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.200]   I hope we're ready.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:07.280]   Our show today--
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.240]   Hi, Mircat.
[01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:13.720]   Our show today brought to you by Mac Break Weekly and Squarespace,
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.640]   the place to make your next website,
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:20.520]   whether it's a commerce site, a blog, your portfolio.
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:23.320]   If you're a pro, Squarespace is easy to use.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:25.500]   Elegant, beautiful templates, the latest version
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:28.480]   of Squarespace has such gorgeous templates.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.280]   And of course, they're all mobile responsive.
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.900]   It means your site will look good no matter what size screen.
[01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.500]   That's important nowadays.
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:37.000]   You don't know what resolution, what size screen.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:37.920]   But it doesn't matter.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:41.480]   Squarespace automatically resizes the images.
[01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.720]   When you upload them, I think it makes nine different versions.
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.620]   It resizes the screen.
[01:40:45.620 --> 01:40:46.680]   I just love it.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:48.640]   Simple, powerful, beautiful.
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:50.920]   Making changes is clearer than simpler than ever.
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.560]   You can actually change--
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.000]   update your site, modify your site,
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.040]   change to the template and all of that.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.880]   On the fly, your content stays the same.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:01.200]   You can see how everything looks as you're doing it.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.640]   No separate preview mode anymore.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.120]   And if you want help, Squarespace does
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:09.840]   have a great portal with lots of workshops and videos.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:13.640]   And 24/7, live chat email and email support direct
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:14.920]   from their offices.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.100]   They don't outsource their support.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:18.660]   It's from Squarespace Bros right there in New York City.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.260]   Squarespace starts at $8 a month.
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:21.420]   $8 a month.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:23.220]   That's the hosting.
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:24.500]   That's a software.
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:26.700]   And it's a domain name when you register for--
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.220]   when you buy for a year.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:29.220]   That's a great deal.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:32.700]   All Squarespace sites include e-commerce too.
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:34.540]   Now on the $8 site, you can get one item.
[01:41:34.540 --> 01:41:37.620]   But that means it's perfect for donations, for fundraisers.
[01:41:37.620 --> 01:41:39.500]   Non-profits are going to love it.
[01:41:39.500 --> 01:41:41.100]   With cover pages, you can set--
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:42.420]   aww.
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:43.980]   That's a cute pooch.
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:46.320]   With cover pages, you can set up a beautiful one-page online
[01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:47.160]   presence in minutes.
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:50.000]   It's perfect for creating quick landing pages for your brand,

[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.960]   Leo LePort here with MACBreak Weekly,
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:17.540]   our daily descent into the world of Kool-Aid.
[01:42:17.540 --> 01:42:19.100]   People think that we've drunk the Kool-Aid.
[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:22.660]   But I have to say, I believe that I'm very brutally honest
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:23.620]   about Apple products.
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:25.540]   It's not the only thing I cover.
[01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:27.440]   And when Apple does something great,
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.300]   I want to say they're doing something great.
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:30.260]   The MAC book is great.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.620]   I'm very excited about the potential of the watch.
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:33.860]   I was more skeptical.
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:36.220]   But as I-- first of all, I was born Android Wear
[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:39.500]   for six months now and realized the value of that.
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.260]   Somebody said that--
[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:42.500]   I can't remember who it was.
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:44.900]   One of the value of the watch is you just never
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.140]   take your phone out.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:49.540]   It does everything your phone does.
[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:50.900]   I was just going to say, when I was a little kid,
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:53.180]   my father bought an Apple II and left it at home
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:54.980]   so that he didn't have to drive downtown to go to IBM
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:56.100]   and use the mainframe.
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:57.740]   And then I got an iPhone and I don't
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:59.540]   have to go back to my Mac all the time, especially when
[01:42:59.540 --> 01:43:00.420]   I'm not home.
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:02.300]   And people I know of you who are using the watch
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.180]   and from my use of the watch, I'm not
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:05.580]   going to have to reach for my phone as often.
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:07.340]   And that sounds silly because they're brief things.
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:08.740]   But they're also important things.
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:10.580]   And there's things that in my pocket, it's in my bag,
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:12.020]   it's a cross-room, it's charging.
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:14.980]   That just takes away another small amount of things
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:16.900]   that I don't have to go to a larger device to do.
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:19.140]   Look, at some point, more than a century ago,
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:22.300]   somebody looked at the pocket watch and said, you know what?
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:23.940]   If I strapped this to my wrist, I wouldn't
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:25.580]   have to keep getting it out of my pocket.
[01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:26.740]   And that really caused a lot.
[01:43:26.740 --> 01:43:27.500]   It's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:28.380]   It's kind of like that.
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:29.940]   I think for the Apple watch to be successful,
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:34.020]   it does need to make our interactions with our phone
[01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:36.940]   the ones we do that take a lot longer
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:38.420]   where we're spending minutes.
[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:40.100]   And the watch should be for all those things
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:41.900]   that we still do today on our phones
[01:43:41.900 --> 01:43:43.140]   that only takes seconds.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:44.820]   And we don't really need to get our phones out of our pocket.
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:45.340]   I do.
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:46.140]   And we can do that.
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:46.980]   That'll be a win.
[01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:50.060]   I do think that how you use the watch
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.460]   is really going to depend on your daily usage
[01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:55.820]   and what you use your iPhone for if you have an iPhone at all.
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:57.060]   And obviously, you need one.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:44:01.460]   You need a 5S or 5C or up to be able to do that.
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:04.940]   But the really interesting thing to me about the watch,
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:07.660]   besides the fact that it will hopefully decouple me
[01:44:07.660 --> 01:44:10.540]   from the big screen to just being like, oh, I
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:14.300]   can select the notifications that I want to pay attention to.
[01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:17.300]   Instead of having to freak out and pull my phone out
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:19.980]   every time the phone buzzes in case it might be Renee
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:23.620]   with an emergency for iMore, instead, it's like, oh, I only
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:25.620]   said it so that certain notifications buzz and all I
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:28.820]   have to do is look at my watch and it just says, oh, you know,
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:31.380]   oh, this is a message from a skater.
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:33.060]   So I don't have to worry about that right now.
[01:44:33.060 --> 01:44:35.540]   And I don't even have to pull it up.
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:37.220]   And if it is a message from Renee,
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.340]   or if it's a message from my parents,
[01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:39.940]   all I have to do is pull it up to my face.
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:41.900]   And I actually get more context.
[01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:43.780]   Like the context-based notifications
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:45.220]   is really exciting to me.
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:48.340]   The idea of maps on my wrist versus something
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:51.180]   that I have to carry around and maps that can intelligently
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:54.500]   buzz me when I have to go left or right is really cool.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:45:00.420]   And actually, there was a small little demo for various things
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:03.940]   that the watch could do when we were in the hands-on area.
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:08.380]   And people make fun of the messaging, you know, oh, I
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:11.380]   can send silly pictures to people like and send people
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:12.500]   my heartbeat.
[01:45:12.500 --> 01:45:14.340]   But I think about the things that, you know,
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:16.980]   like I think about how bad I am at talking to my parents
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:19.700]   who live on this coast and get frequently very annoyed.
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.380]   And they're like, so Eddie, why don't you call us more often?
[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:22.740]   You know?
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.220]   And I feel really bad about that.
[01:45:24.220 --> 01:45:26.780]   But sometimes it's like, OK, phone conversations.
[01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:28.460]   So you're just going to send mom your heartbeat?
[01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:28.660]   Yeah.
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:29.380]   Well, no, but it's--
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:30.020]   That's not--
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:31.020]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:45:31.020 --> 01:45:32.180]   No, but it's--
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:33.220]   They'll get an emoji like every--
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:34.220]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:35.420]   And only the classiest.
[01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:36.700]   But no, it's more about--
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:39.100]   So you feel you just drew a little heart for mom?
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:39.900]   Yeah, it's--
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:40.700]   That might be kind of nice.
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:42.700]   It's being more in communication with the people
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:45.380]   you care about and having it be easier, where it's--
[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:47.860]   I don't know why it feels more difficult.
[01:45:47.860 --> 01:45:48.940]   Well, actually, no, I do.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:51.300]   The iPhone is a multi-streamed device.
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:53.420]   We talk about, oh, it's hard to multitask.
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:55.380]   But in honesty, when in the last,
[01:45:55.380 --> 01:45:57.140]   like anybody who owns a smartphone,
[01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:58.660]   you pull out your phone, you're saying, oh, I'm
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.100]   going to look up directions.
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.340]   Tell me the times that, like, that actually ends up
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:06.140]   in you looking at directions and nothing else but directions.
[01:46:06.140 --> 01:46:07.980]   You know you browse up for 15 minutes,
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:09.660]   and you end up checking on things.
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:11.500]   And the same thing goes where you're like, oh,
[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:13.740]   I want to text my mother.
[01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:15.460]   And then, oh, wait, but there are emails
[01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:16.580]   that I have to respond to.
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:19.860]   And somebody yelled at me on Twitter and, oh, Instagram,
[01:46:19.860 --> 01:46:21.780]   and, oh, Facebook, and, oh, all of this,
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:22.860]   and all of a sudden, like, there's
[01:46:22.860 --> 01:46:25.940]   so many notifications that you're just completely overwhelmed.
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:28.380]   With this, it's as easy as, oh, I'm
[01:46:28.380 --> 01:46:29.820]   going to send a message to mom.
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:30.540]   I pull it up.
[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.460]   I tap the Friends button.
[01:46:32.460 --> 01:46:33.020]   Mom will tap.
[01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:33.460]   I tap Mom.
[01:46:33.460 --> 01:46:34.180]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:34.180 --> 01:46:35.180]   It's just--
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:36.180]   They're a little fix.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:36.860]   And it's easier for you.
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:38.780]   Will I be able to put my grocery list on it?
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:39.260]   I intranqued you.
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:41.260]   Because right now, I hold my phone as I--
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:41.780]   Yeah, there's--
[01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:42.860]   --it's a real pain in the butt of the--
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:43.220]   We had to--
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:44.100]   --and we saw the opposite yesterday.
[01:46:44.100 --> 01:46:45.020]   We saw, like, the Uber app.
[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:45.780]   That's fantastic.
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:46.700]   That was amazing.
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:47.500]   Yeah, you just tap--
[01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:48.380]   I, like, I hold--
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:50.100]   They're like, they're like, you need to hold me my phone.
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.780]   But the thing with it's so-- like, what Serenity said is,
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:55.260]   yes, the watch does take a percentage of the things
[01:46:55.260 --> 01:46:57.700]   and offload them off the Starship onto the shuttlecraft.
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:59.180]   It makes it much more easy to maneuver.
[01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:00.860]   But there's also things that it enhances.
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:04.860]   Like, it's got the heart rate monitor, which doesn't have the--
[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:05.780]   --on the watch.
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:07.540]   It's got-- sorry, it doesn't have on the phone.
[01:47:07.540 --> 01:47:09.540]   It's got-- for the communications, it has the sketch.
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:10.220]   It has the tap.
[01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:11.380]   It has all these things.
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:13.900]   Every category that they've targeted it as,
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:16.020]   it's got a couple extra added features as well
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:17.060]   that you don't have on the phone.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:19.500]   Serenity said, like, it's compatible with iPhone 5 up.
[01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:21.660]   You can only have Apple Pay on an iPhone 6 or 6
[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:22.220]   plus right now.
[01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:24.580]   But if you have the Apple Watch, suddenly you can have Apple Pay
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:26.540]   going all the way back to the iPhone 5.
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:29.700]   So for a lot of people, yes, it will take those tasks over.
[01:47:29.700 --> 01:47:31.300]   But it'll give you more you can do as well.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:33.860]   There's extra value in having a watch you don't get without it.
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:38.140]   Yeah, I mean, again, I don't think that the Apple Watch is--
[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:40.180]   again, it's not for everybody.
[01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:43.900]   I think that for people who use their phones very often--
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:44.860]   Which is everybody.
[01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:45.660]   Face it.
[01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:48.060]   That's all you see nowadays is people walking around
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:49.460]   into polls with their phone.
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:52.220]   We joke about, oh, well, I'm going to--
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:54.540]   I'm going to pay $600 for something that saves me
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:55.740]   half a millimeter of time.
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:57.700]   Oh, no.
[01:47:57.700 --> 01:48:00.380]   First of all, it's so socially more acceptable to be looking
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.580]   at your watch than it is to have your phone.
[01:48:01.580 --> 01:48:02.460]   I remember what Tim Cook said.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:04.660]   He goes, I've been wanting to have a phone call on my watch
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.140]   since I was five years old.
[01:48:06.140 --> 01:48:08.820]   I have 2.0, but I don't have $180 billion
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.020]   to make it a reality.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.180]   I'm happy Tim Cook did that.
[01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:12.340]   Thank you, Tony Stark.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:12.860]   Cook.
[01:48:12.860 --> 01:48:17.580]   Yeah, no, I understand completely why people don't want the watch.
[01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:18.780]   I understand why Andy's sketching on--
[01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:20.300]   You don't have to buy the watch or the Mac.
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:21.620]   Well, it's not--
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:23.460]   What is going to make you do that?
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:26.180]   I should point out that I've been wearing this on my wrist
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:28.020]   every single day since September.
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:28.980]   I'm a big fan of smartwatch.
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.980]   This is a Moto 360, right?
[01:48:30.980 --> 01:48:34.100]   Well, yeah, and the core things that does well
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:36.740]   are the same things that the Apple Watch does well.
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:39.980]   What all I'm saying is that I wish it were less expensive,
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:43.300]   even if that meant that it did not have Taptic Sensor,
[01:48:43.300 --> 01:48:45.540]   it didn't have a couple of different things,
[01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:47.220]   because when you start--
[01:48:47.220 --> 01:48:50.700]   it's a really, really hard thing to ask someone
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:54.820]   to spend $600 for a stainless steel smartwatch,
[01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:57.420]   even $350 or $400 is--
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.180]   I'm not saying it's a ridiculous amount of money.
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:01.100]   I'm not saying it's stupid for anybody to pay it.
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:04.380]   I'm saying that for the sort of features that are most
[01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:07.500]   important to people, I believe they could have done a version
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.020]   of this that was really great, would have sold like hotcakes
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:13.140]   and could have been sold for less than $300.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:14.020]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:15.100]   They will, two years from now.
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.420]   It'd be just like the iPod.
[01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:18.700]   It's just like saying the first iPod, all that's too expensive.
[01:49:18.700 --> 01:49:20.060]   Everybody wants a music player.
[01:49:20.060 --> 01:49:22.780]   If it were only $200, it'd sell like hotcakes.
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:24.900]   And it was the iPod, and when the iPhone came out,
[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:26.700]   we couldn't understand why that would be the case.
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:28.300]   Why are you to spend so much money on a phone?
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:29.580]   And then we all did.
[01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:31.300]   And I thought that you could see this over and over and over.
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:33.940]   The current iPhone is like $1,000.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:36.660]   Yeah, $600 is two hundred bucks for most people in the United States.
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:37.700]   OK, that's a good point.
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:39.500]   Subsidized, nobody really sees the real price.
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:40.700]   But the truth is, the real price is--
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:41.860]   That's a $180, $180.
[01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:44.100]   A lot of money.
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:47.420]   And I feel like what, in a way that Apple's done
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:51.140]   is said the watch you want is about the same as an iPhone.
[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:52.260]   And I don't know.
[01:49:52.260 --> 01:49:53.380]   Well, we'll see, Andy.
[01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:54.380]   We'll see.
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:58.100]   Apple has kind of said, we don't expect to sell this
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:00.140]   as well as the iPhone.
[01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:01.900]   Let me just tell you from my point of view,
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:06.260]   where I write reviews and either explicitly or embedded
[01:50:06.260 --> 01:50:09.420]   inside of the thing is, are you asking me, should I buy this?
[01:50:09.420 --> 01:50:11.260]   And I will tell you, I will give you my advice.
[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:12.420]   Well, that's the way you're right.
[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:13.660]   When you're doing that.
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:16.540]   When you have a Pebble watch that costs $99, up to $200.
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:18.700]   When you have an Android Wear device that costs $200,
[01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:21.100]   $250, I can say, look, even if you're
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:23.300]   even as just a cool watch that has these really cool,
[01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:26.780]   replaceable faces, that's at least $120 like right there.
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:32.700]   The ability for the phone in my pocket to quietly and at my control
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:36.940]   give me a notification or make an app present itself to my watch
[01:50:36.940 --> 01:50:38.740]   when it needs to come into vore.
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:40.340]   Like when I'm walking--
[01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:42.180]   I'm getting walking directions on my watch.
[01:50:42.180 --> 01:50:45.020]   The guy gave a little haptic buzz saying, oh, by the way,
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:46.620]   you're going to have to turn left or right.
[01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:48.420]   That's a killer feature.
[01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:50.300]   Good time for you to actually look at your watch
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:51.740]   and see what's going to be left or right.
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:52.700]   That's great stuff.
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:56.700]   When you start talking about, well, the cheapest one is $350,
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:59.140]   or $350 or $400.
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:03.140]   I have to start saying, is the person I recommend this to going
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:05.940]   to feel as though they're getting a value for $350 to $400?
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:09.100]   When you increase that to $600, then you start--
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:12.980]   I start thinking, I really don't know what to tell you.
[01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:14.940]   I'm not going to tell you not to buy it.
[01:51:14.940 --> 01:51:17.180]   I can't tell you whether you will get $600
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:18.100]   with a value on a value.
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:20.460]   That's not a problem that I had with the iPad, say.
[01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:23.340]   That's not a problem that I had with many Windows notebooks
[01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:25.820]   that are well constructed that cost $500 for $600.
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:27.660]   With the watch, I honestly don't know
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:31.620]   if I can stand by a recommendation that $600 is--
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:33.980]   you're going to get that value back off of that person.
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:35.780]   I still think $350 is going to be the normal point
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:36.860]   for most people.
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:38.820]   I'm going to disagree with my dear friend Andy, who I've
[01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:40.060]   known for 20 years.
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:40.580]   And so I do--
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:41.300]   See what you're wrong, Jason.
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:42.340]   I do this respectfully.
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:44.980]   But when I was in Macworld, one of the things
[01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:47.860]   that we debated a lot was, how much do you factor a price
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:49.100]   of a product into its rating?
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:51.100]   And I think ultimately, as reviewers,
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:55.060]   our real job is to describe what a product is good for
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:59.780]   and how it works and if it works well or if it works poorly.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:00.860]   And--
[01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:02.260]   Because the consumer knows the price.
[01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:04.740]   They know how much money they've got
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:06.060]   and how much money they want to spend.
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:08.100]   And it's very hard for us because there's
[01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:12.620]   no way to really bake in because everybody's financial
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:13.740]   requirements are going to be different.
[01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:15.740]   Their priorities are going to be different in the end.
[01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:17.180]   And we don't know this, Andy.
[01:52:17.180 --> 01:52:19.140]   And you will try out the Apple Watch
[01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:22.060]   and discover your feelings about whether it's truly useful
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:23.380]   enough.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:25.540]   And can your readers will say, well, yeah,
[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:27.220]   that sounds great, but not for $3.50.
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:28.260]   Or they'll say, yeah, $3.50.
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:29.140]   That's fine.
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:32.020]   I think we have to see it and try it and know that.
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:34.500]   Because for some people, they would never
[01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:36.660]   expect to buy a watch for $3.50.
[01:52:36.660 --> 01:52:39.220]   And for somebody else, it's just not even a question.
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:40.940]   Of course, they're going to buy the first generation.
[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:43.140]   And for me, the more important point
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:46.980]   is, does it live up to what Apple wants it to be or does it not?
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:48.220]   And we'll find that out.
[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:51.220]   But it's very hard for me to make recommendations about,
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:53.460]   like, look, should anybody buy this for this price?
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:56.980]   Because everybody's price sensitivity is going to be different.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:52:57.480]   OK.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:59.220]   Andy's raising his hand, Andrew.
[01:52:59.220 --> 01:52:59.860]   OK.
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:00.900]   Well, I do need to respond.
[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:04.260]   That never factors into my rating per se,
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:07.180]   although I don't have my most ratings in my review.
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:09.100]   But I do feel as though what value
[01:53:09.100 --> 01:53:11.180]   is this device giving for the amount of money
[01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:12.700]   they're asking for it.
[01:53:12.700 --> 01:53:17.860]   If, for instance, I'm looking at a $59 Winpad Windows
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:21.060]   tablet, that if this were a $200 tablet,
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.860]   I would have a hard time recommending it.
[01:53:22.860 --> 01:53:26.020]   At $60, I can say, look, you might have a really good use
[01:53:26.020 --> 01:53:26.220]   for it.
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:28.420]   Here are the things I think it does very, very well.
[01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:30.180]   And I'm thinking that's a really good thing, chiefly,
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:33.220]   because I think it delivers a lot of value for what you get for.
[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:35.980]   That's not the only metric, but I think that's a valuable metric.
[01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:41.260]   If Apple were to sell the new MacBook for $5,000,
[01:53:41.260 --> 01:53:45.820]   I could not avoid saying that is an insane amount of money
[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:48.460]   to charge for something like this.
[01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:52.380]   Again, I just want to make sure people are very, very clear
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:55.340]   on what they're getting for whatever money they spend on it.
[01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:58.100]   So I don't make that an important metric,
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:01.700]   but that does creep into my decision on whether I can simply
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:03.180]   say, yes, this is a great thing to get.
[01:54:03.180 --> 01:54:04.900]   I think you'll be very, very happy with it.
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:05.700]   All right.
[01:54:05.700 --> 01:54:07.100]   I don't think we need to belabor the point.
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:09.660]   I think you made your point very clearly and well.
[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:10.540]   And I agree with you.
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:13.900]   I did the same thing on that particular $59 win book,
[01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:16.620]   which I would not recommend at any higher price point,
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:19.420]   but $59 is kind of cool.
[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:20.700]   I'm going to buy the watch.
[01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:22.540]   And I think a lot of people are going to buy the watch.
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.380]   We'll see if it becomes a success.
[01:54:24.380 --> 01:54:26.380]   We did learn a few new details, for instance,
[01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:29.540]   the battery is replaceable.
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:30.660]   Although they said you'll probably
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:32.460]   get three years of battery life.
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:33.460]   It's like any other app.
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.300]   Like your iPhone's batteries are replaceable.
[01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:38.740]   They could pry it open somehow and put a new one at a cost.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:41.220]   They're already shipping the right size rocks to every store
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:44.700]   so they can smash it open with the degree of precision.
[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:50.020]   We also are learning that it has eight gigabytes of storage.
[01:54:50.020 --> 01:54:52.460]   Not all of that would be allowed for music, though.
[01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:52.740]   Yeah.
[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:54.780]   I mean, that's not that surprising to me
[01:54:54.780 --> 01:54:57.540]   when you think about an eight gigabyte phone, for instance,
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:00.180]   how much of that is actually available for the user
[01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:04.180]   and available for personal interaction.
[01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.420]   What 9 to 5 Mac originally reported
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:09.300]   and what they have apparently confirmed with Apple
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:11.020]   is that you'll have two gigabytes free,
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:14.660]   so about the size of a big iPod shuffle for on device music.
[01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:16.020]   That's not streaming music, mind you.
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:18.740]   But when you're away from your phone
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:23.100]   and then a little bit of space for on device photos--
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:24.820]   75 meg's, wrong device.
[01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:29.060]   Yeah, 75 megabytes for when you're away from your phone.
[01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:31.460]   And then the rest of that is presumably either being taken up
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:35.660]   by the operating system, along with your talking
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:40.660]   about app local cache data, as well as we haven't--
[01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:43.220]   Apple Watch apps right now are basically extensions.
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:47.060]   They run as widgets on the phone--
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:49.660]   Sorry, on the watch from the phone.
[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:51.260]   But that won't be always the case.
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:53.500]   In fact, that they've implied that later this year,
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:55.540]   we'll probably see native watch apps.
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:57.060]   And once we see native watch apps,
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:59.660]   I expect that those native watch apps will need some space,
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:02.260]   just like iPhone apps need some space.
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:02.780]   Yeah.
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:06.460]   And I think the away from phone usage is really mostly
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:07.940]   for exercisers, right?
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:08.860]   Yeah.
[01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:09.860]   I--
[01:56:09.860 --> 01:56:10.860]   Go ahead.
[01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:12.500]   No, I think there's going to be--
[01:56:12.500 --> 01:56:14.340]   I mean, I think that there'll be a lot of places.
[01:56:14.340 --> 01:56:16.140]   I think that the interesting thing is not just the away
[01:56:16.140 --> 01:56:18.620]   from phone, but the proximity of being somewhere
[01:56:18.620 --> 01:56:20.620]   in the house with the phone, I think,
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:22.620]   is going to be--
[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:24.660]   if you've got an extended Wi-Fi area,
[01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:26.900]   I mean, you're going to still be able to have access to that.
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:28.940]   So I think that's going to be an interesting place.
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:29.780]   Yeah, that was interesting.
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:31.340]   The phone has not only Bluetooth, but--
[01:56:31.340 --> 01:56:32.340]   I mean, the Wi-Fi--
[01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:34.060]   Well, we knew it had Wi-Fi, but the Wi-Fi
[01:56:34.060 --> 01:56:35.780]   was built into the Bluetooth for race to sleep.
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:37.620]   So it would make the Bluetooth handshake and broadcast
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:39.660]   and then transfer data over Wi-Fi.
[01:56:39.660 --> 01:56:41.060]   What they said yesterday is that if you're
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:43.580]   on the same Wi-Fi network, it'll extend the bubble of Bluetooth.
[01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:46.540]   So as long as I'm at my house, it doesn't matter where my phone is.
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:47.540]   Such a smart feature.
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:48.540]   Cool.
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:48.540]   Right?
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:50.820]   Because with my Apple, if I walk eight feet away,
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:51.660]   it loses connection.
[01:56:51.660 --> 01:56:52.140]   And it gets crashing.
[01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:53.220]   Yeah.
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:55.580]   Well, and if you're in a company that
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.620]   builds the networks in a certain way,
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:56:59.860]   the way we build our networks, I could theoretically
[01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:02.780]   have my watch in one state and be using--
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.660]   That's an unusual situation.
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:06.820]   But no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:08.020]   there's a normal--
[01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.020]   There's a structure.
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:10.220]   It's not normal.
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:12.780]   No, to put it in perspective, it's not normal for--
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:14.020]   It's a full-form business.
[01:57:14.020 --> 01:57:15.700]   A lot of businesses, but a lot of larger businesses
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:17.420]   work on large corporate networks.
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:20.220]   And if those networks are able to manage that,
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:21.940]   it's just really interesting to be able to--
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:23.220]   It made a difference.
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:25.380]   I'm not going to leave my phone in a different state.
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:28.220]   No, but the great-- my sister uses a pebble right now
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:29.420]   because she doesn't want to have to carry her phone
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:32.020]   on all the pages in the hospital or done over an iPhone now.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.180]   It's just an iPhone system.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:33.700]   No, that's interesting.
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:35.140]   It does use the push notification network.
[01:57:35.140 --> 01:57:36.140]   And she's looking forward to being
[01:57:36.140 --> 01:57:37.580]   able to leave her phone on her desk
[01:57:37.580 --> 01:57:38.940]   because she has a doctor's coach,
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:41.420]   doesn't want to put the phone in because it's heavy.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:42.780]   And she'll walk on-- she thought she'd
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:44.100]   have to stay within pebble distance.
[01:57:44.100 --> 01:57:46.940]   But now she's like, I can just walk through the hospital.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:48.860]   I'm sure there are going to be networking quirks there,
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:50.500]   where it's like, oh, well, this is a bad handoff,
[01:57:50.500 --> 01:57:52.140]   and this is in the same network zone and all that.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:52.940]   We don't support that.
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:55.900]   But I think that in a lot of Wi-Fi networks,
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:57:57.660]   the idea that you'd be able to move around in,
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:00.620]   especially in your house, to be able to move more than 10 feet
[01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:03.780]   away from the phone with the watch, have it keep contact.
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:04.860]   That's a use case I have.
[01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:06.060]   That's a pretty nice one.
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:07.060]   That's a use case I have.
[01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:10.260]   I often put the phone in its dock at the bed,
[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:13.180]   and then I will-- I'm in the house the rest of the evening.
[01:58:13.180 --> 01:58:15.260]   If I have my watch-- and I can even make a phone call
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:15.940]   for my watch.
[01:58:15.940 --> 01:58:16.380]   Exactly.
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:18.980]   Oh, I will miss a lot fewer phone calls for one.
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:19.620]   Well, exactly.
[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:22.300]   And if you think about how often you're charging your phone,
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:24.740]   I mean, you kind of forget to charge it overnight or whatever.
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:26.140]   And now you're charging your phone,
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:28.580]   and you're not feeling like you've been disconnected
[01:58:28.580 --> 01:58:30.860]   from the rest of the world for that two hours
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:32.060]   or whatever that you're charging it.
[01:58:32.060 --> 01:58:35.140]   What did the audio sound like coming out of the watch?
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:35.620]   So--
[01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:37.500]   Because we never really got an idea of what that's going to--
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:41.180]   No, they didn't really have a good environment for us
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:41.860]   to demo that.
[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:43.260]   It was totally annoying to get.
[01:58:43.260 --> 01:58:46.100]   They had the calls start to complete.
[01:58:46.100 --> 01:58:48.220]   And I think we got a couple of seconds on one of them
[01:58:48.220 --> 01:58:50.140]   where it's just like, it's the audio quality
[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:51.900]   is going to be just terrible here.
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:53.300]   So there's no real point to it.
[01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:55.060]   So we don't know if, for instance,
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:57.940]   it would be acceptable to make a long-term phone call.
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:58:59.980]   I know people who are making phone calls on their watch.
[01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:01.660]   And their thing isn't that it's long-term,
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:03.740]   it's that at a certain point, like, it's great for, yeah,
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:04.540]   I'm on my way home.
[01:59:04.540 --> 01:59:05.180]   Oh, you need milk.
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:05.660]   OK, great.
[01:59:05.660 --> 01:59:06.540]   I'll go get that.
[01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:08.180]   But if you want to have a five or 10 minute call,
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:09.540]   that's keeping that battery in screen.
[01:59:09.540 --> 01:59:10.780]   You know what I love?
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:12.380]   Audio messages, unmessages.
[01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:12.900]   Yes.
[01:59:12.900 --> 01:59:13.740]   So let me--
[01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:17.140]   And when they introduced that on OS 10, I thought--
[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:19.780]   I mean, on the iPhone, I know, iOS 8,
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:20.860]   I thought, this is really great.
[01:59:20.860 --> 01:59:21.380]   I love it.
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:23.100]   Now I get it.
[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.020]   That's a-- now I'm not going to dictate.
[01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:25.900]   I'm just going to talk.
[01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:27.780]   So this is actually a brilliant thing
[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:30.340]   about the watch that I found out when I was playing around
[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:32.300]   with the demo, which is Siri, right?
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.940]   We've all had problems with Siri.
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:37.300]   Siri has some great features, but it also has--
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:38.540]   it has some quirks.
[01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:39.420]   You try and--
[01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:42.220]   Yeah, you try and say-- like, I try and say my team name
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:42.820]   for Rolodirvi.
[01:59:42.820 --> 01:59:45.100]   I'm like, yes, the Cosmonauties are having a party today.
[01:59:45.100 --> 01:59:46.340]   Oh, they don't know Cosmonauties.
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.700]   Oh, Cosmonauties.
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:51.420]   It ends up being like, Cosmo not tenants,
[01:59:51.420 --> 01:59:53.220]   or something ridiculous like that.
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:54.060]   But it's like, all right.
[01:59:54.060 --> 01:59:57.060]   So if I'm dictating while I'm driving,
[01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:58.340]   I don't want to look at my screen
[01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:00.300]   because I want to pay attention to the road.
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:03.300]   And it ends up being like, Cosmonaut tenants, it's like, well,
[02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:05.540]   I either have to pull over and change my message.
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:07.540]   I have to try and redictate it and think
[02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:11.180]   about a different word that maybe the phone will understand.
[02:00:11.180 --> 02:00:14.180]   Or on the watch, there's a new button.
[02:00:14.180 --> 02:00:16.660]   There's a new button where if you-- whatever you dictate
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:19.500]   to Siri when you're in messages, it shows you
[02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:20.460]   what you dictated.
[02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:22.980]   And then there's also a button that says,
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:24.740]   send as audio message.
[02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:25.820]   I love that so much.
[02:00:25.820 --> 02:00:28.300]   So if it messes it up, you can just send it as an audio message.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:30.220]   And then you don't have to worry about redictating it.
[02:00:30.220 --> 02:00:31.740]   You don't have to worry about, yeah.
[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:33.460]   The other party has an iPhone.
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:35.460]   No, no, no, well, an iPhone, yes.
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:36.660]   Well, my problem is that--
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:38.620]   I mean, not everybody I know is an iPhone user.
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:40.220]   Can I get any messages on?
[02:00:40.220 --> 02:00:42.820]   No, because messages only works with other iOS.
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:45.580]   My problem is that I start to think in Siri now.
[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:46.860]   So I'm dictating an audio message.
[02:00:46.860 --> 02:00:48.780]   And I say, hi, Serenity, comma.
[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:49.780]   comma.
[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:51.300]   Yeah, I did it there soon, period.
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:53.060]   And then she hears the audio and thinks I'm a moron.
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:53.540]   More than usual.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:55.420]   That's one thing that Android Wear does really, really well.
[02:00:55.420 --> 02:00:58.220]   I could not get the speech text to work on this
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:01:01.700]   for the first two or three days, because I was using my Siri
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:03.220]   voice with the watch.
[02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:04.500]   As soon as I started talking like this,
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.300]   it was keeping up to me word for word for word.
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:08.620]   I'm like, oh, I've got to understand you.
[02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:12.180]   Andy, would you just speak to me like a normal person?
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:13.660]   And you can handle it with my eyes.
[02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:15.060]   Here's another thing we learned.
[02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:16.740]   At least I wasn't going to get one.
[02:01:16.740 --> 02:01:19.180]   And then as soon as I said, but Lisa, my wife,
[02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:20.380]   I could send you my heartbeat.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:21.660]   I could draw you pictures.
[02:01:21.660 --> 02:01:23.860]   It'll be a way of staying in touch that, as you said,
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:27.340]   with your mom, that's going to be unique.
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:28.140]   She's going to get one.
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:29.260]   And I think this will sell--
[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:31.780]   just as I think messages sells more iPhones,
[02:01:31.780 --> 02:01:33.740]   because I want to be able to do a lot of messages.
[02:01:33.740 --> 02:01:35.380]   You want to be a little bit of a person?
[02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:35.900]   Yeah.
[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:37.060]   It's not a bad idea.
[02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:38.540]   And the nice thing is all this stuff hands off.
[02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:39.900]   They're using the same handoff technology.
[02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:41.420]   So if you're doing a phone call and you think it's going
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:43.140]   to be a couple of minutes and you don't want to waste
[02:01:43.140 --> 02:01:45.020]   your watch battery, you can just send that to your phone.
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:46.460]   And then you're fine, where you get a message
[02:01:46.460 --> 02:01:47.980]   and it's going to take a longer reply,
[02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:51.500]   you just send that to your phone and you're fine.
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:54.420]   Incidentally, we have 410 people watching us
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:56.940]   in an unusual way.
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:01.140]   They're watching us on Meerkat, 410 people watching,
[02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:03.340]   because this Twitter app, we're going to talk about that.
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:04.580]   That's going to be Alex's pick.
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:05.500]   Can you see?
[02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:07.380]   Oh, you're watching me.
[02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:09.420]   You're one of the 410, eh, Jason?
[02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:12.420]   I have the feed, but strangely, it's very--
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:14.660]   like the aspect.
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:16.060]   There's something weird about the zoom.
[02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:20.060]   OK, I think that Meerkat is designed to be used in portrait
[02:02:20.060 --> 02:02:21.860]   mode and somebody said it was sideways.
[02:02:21.860 --> 02:02:23.460]   You've got to design the web window.
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:24.900]   You've got to make your web window narrower.
[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:26.420]   Well, I've turned it back to portrait mode,
[02:02:26.420 --> 02:02:28.300]   so it should be OK now.
[02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:31.220]   But I think Meerkat works better in portrait mode,
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:33.300]   which is, of course, everybody hates vertical video.
[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:35.180]   Anyway, I don't want to talk about Meerkat yet,
[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:36.620]   because that's Alex's pick of the week,
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:38.740]   but we are going to give you a chance.
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:41.220]   So somebody says, messages does work on all phones.
[02:02:41.220 --> 02:02:42.940]   You just have to turn it on in settings.
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:45.060]   How would I get messages in an Android device?
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:46.260]   Well, it's kind of--
[02:02:46.260 --> 02:02:47.780]   Yeah, it'll send SMS.
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:50.060]   It'll convert it to an MMS if you're using it.
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:52.420]   Yeah, it can message to an audio as MMS.
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:53.740]   I believe.
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:54.900]   I'd have to test it.
[02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:56.420]   I'm not sure if I've ever tested it.
[02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:59.340]   I believe it's supposed to be an MMS package.
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:02:59.840]   Yeah.
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:00.940]   Oh, and there's someone in the chat room
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:03.260]   who is using the watch while driving.
[02:03:03.260 --> 02:03:05.220]   It's actually a lot easier than trying to press a button,
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:07.740]   because if I'm driving, all I have to do is pull up my--
[02:03:07.740 --> 02:03:09.140]   I don't even have to look at the watch.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:11.500]   I just have to be like, send a message to my mother,
[02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:13.500]   tell her I'm running five minutes late,
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:14.740]   and then continue driving.
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:16.340]   I don't have to look at a screen.
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:18.180]   Like, that's the problem that I have with the car--
[02:03:18.180 --> 02:03:19.820]   the car stuff now, and even with car play.
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:21.700]   It's like, I don't want to look at a different screen
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:23.660]   and try and press a button to activate Siri.
[02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:24.940]   I just want to talk.
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:26.500]   I want to say, hey, Siri.
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:28.300]   I'm sorry to everybody who is watching.
[02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:29.180]   Oh, my god, you did it.
[02:03:29.180 --> 02:03:30.180]   I did it.
[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:31.180]   I did it.
[02:03:31.180 --> 02:03:32.180]   I did it.
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:33.020]   A whole time piece.
[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:34.260]   A whole time piece.
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:34.980]   I was joking.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:37.100]   I apparently said it four times during the iMore show
[02:03:37.100 --> 02:03:38.380]   last week, and then Kevin Lynch
[02:03:38.380 --> 02:03:40.660]   said it on the stage yesterday and set off every device.
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:41.660]   It's at a first.
[02:03:41.660 --> 02:03:42.540]   You said it on stage?
[02:03:42.540 --> 02:03:43.500]   I really just said it on stage.
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:47.140]   You said it on stage and set off so many devices.
[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:52.420]   So yeah, also, hey, guys, can we do a custom thing, Apple?
[02:03:52.420 --> 02:03:53.420]   That would be so nice.
[02:03:53.420 --> 02:03:55.020]   I'm not saying a whole time piece.
[02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:56.740]   You know what I do on my Android?
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:59.500]   My Moto X has held me Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:00.260]   That's a good one.
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:00.820]   That's a great one.
[02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:02.140]   You kind of enjoy seeing it, everyone.
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:03.140]   Yeah.
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:05.020]   It's weird how you adapt to these things.
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:07.900]   I like OK Google, but what I actually do is,
[02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:10.580]   as I'm raising my wrist, I simply tap the screen
[02:04:10.580 --> 02:04:12.940]   and remove all doubt that even in an OZ environment,
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:15.100]   it's going to hear that and start listening.
[02:04:15.100 --> 02:04:17.860]   I'm going to take a break in a second,
[02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:20.140]   but I want to make sure we say everything that Ollie--
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:21.660]   there is other news.
[02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:24.460]   And we didn't really spend any time on research kit.
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:25.100]   That is--
[02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:26.860]   Although Apple spent a considerable amount of time
[02:04:26.860 --> 02:04:27.180]   on that.
[02:04:27.180 --> 02:04:28.100]   It's really cool.
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:28.580]   Really?
[02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:30.540]   It's hard for consumers to understand,
[02:04:30.540 --> 02:04:35.620]   but it's an exceptionally well thought out idea that will
[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:39.100]   help doctors and help patients and potentially
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:40.300]   move medical research.
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:44.260]   So here is the-- now, and Dr. Mom--
[02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:47.220]   credit to Dr. Mom, who is our resident physician.
[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:49.460]   It's one of the few podcasts that actually has a physician.
[02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:51.780]   And it's because I'm so elderly.
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:52.900]   We also have a defibrillator.
[02:04:52.900 --> 02:04:55.300]   But she says-- actually, she has a different--
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:57.260]   a little bit different take on this.
[02:04:57.260 --> 02:05:01.300]   She says, this is about getting FDA approval down the road.
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:07.740]   So what this is going to be is in almost a proof of concept.
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:12.100]   So she said there will be peer reviewed articles about this.
[02:05:12.100 --> 02:05:14.020]   But what they're really doing is demonstrating
[02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:16.180]   that the data that they get from, let's say,
[02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:21.060]   that Parkinson's app actually is as good as or better than that
[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:23.060]   obtained by a home nursing visit.
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:26.620]   Once they show that to the FDA in the research,
[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:31.700]   then they can expect FDA approval for its use
[02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:33.140]   in a more general way.
[02:05:33.140 --> 02:05:36.700]   So in a way, what you're seeing is trials
[02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:41.100]   for something that down the road might be much more powerful
[02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.380]   and much more usable.
[02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:43.540]   So at this point, all they're really
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:46.540]   doing is trying to demonstrate that the device improves
[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:48.420]   the monitoring of patients out of the hospital,
[02:05:48.420 --> 02:05:50.260]   or at least as good as a home visit.
[02:05:50.260 --> 02:05:51.900]   Today was the shareholders meeting, and right away,
[02:05:51.900 --> 02:05:54.180]   they're like, what is the business model for research kit?
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:56.780]   And Tim Cook again goes, I don't need a business model
[02:05:56.780 --> 02:05:57.900]   for everything that you do.
[02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:01.180]   But I think he actually knows that there is a business model.
[02:06:01.180 --> 02:06:05.900]   Because if ultimately the iPhone can do that kind of reliable
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:07.620]   testing, your doctor can say to you, OK,
[02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:11.380]   you need to have an Apple watch and an iPhone that will save you
[02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:11.820]   money.
[02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:13.220]   You made it open soon.
[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:15.380]   But insurers might even cover this.
[02:06:15.380 --> 02:06:17.580]   Because you don't need a home visit anymore.
[02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:19.820]   Suddenly, there is a very good business model,
[02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:21.580]   especially with an aging population.
[02:06:21.580 --> 02:06:23.700]   Apple's really happy about those things that are maybe
[02:06:23.700 --> 02:06:26.500]   second or third level effects, where it's not, oh, this
[02:06:26.500 --> 02:06:28.460]   is going to sell a lot more iPhones directly.
[02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:32.060]   But it's more like, this is going to make people feel
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:34.580]   like Apple is changing the world, which is part of their brand
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:36.860]   promise, and that makes everybody happier about Apple.
[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:38.460]   And can you believe what the iPhone does?
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:41.340]   And that seeps into the success of Apple as a company
[02:06:41.340 --> 02:06:42.940]   in a way that may not be as direct.
[02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:45.940]   But I think it's Apple likes to show that side of itself.
[02:06:45.940 --> 02:06:50.140]   It is good PR, but there's also real world benefit of it.
[02:06:50.140 --> 02:06:52.540]   And they were happy to say that we're doing this privately.
[02:06:52.540 --> 02:06:55.700]   Like we're collecting your data privately before they have this.
[02:06:55.700 --> 02:06:57.940]   I believe that I believe they're quite sincere in this product.
[02:06:57.940 --> 02:06:58.940]   Oh, I do.
[02:06:58.940 --> 02:06:59.940]   Yeah.
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:03.500]   I'm also very, very glad that the phrase that
[02:07:03.500 --> 02:07:07.740]   keeps in this unwritten as yet response about the edition
[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:10.940]   watch, it's like Apple can make whatever they want.
[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:11.860]   They've got the resources.
[02:07:11.860 --> 02:07:12.500]   They've got the talent.
[02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:14.540]   They've got the word chest, whatever they decide
[02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:16.420]   that they want to make, they can make it.
[02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:17.580]   And so it pleases me greatly.
[02:07:17.580 --> 02:07:20.580]   This is actually how I warmed up part one of my column today,
[02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:23.100]   that I'm just very, very pleased that they chose to make
[02:07:23.100 --> 02:07:25.300]   these two things that will extend people's lives
[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:28.940]   and ease suffering, which is the possible end results
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:31.820]   of technologies that are this forward thinking.
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:34.540]   I'm thrilled beyond measure that they're putting these things
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:35.060]   out there.
[02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:38.500]   Yeah, in the long run, this is not probably something
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:41.220]   that's going to bring medicine to Uganda
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:44.660]   or to poor regions of the southeastern United States.
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:46.980]   This is a beginning that may in the long run
[02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:47.340]   have some--
[02:07:47.340 --> 02:07:48.340]   Well, it can't see that.
[02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:50.300]   That's interesting, too.
[02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:52.620]   I talked about this yesterday in the live stream.
[02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:54.740]   When I visit the Media Lab and see stuff,
[02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:56.780]   a lot of the projects that they're working on
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:59.900]   is here's a way to outfit a dirt, common Android phone
[02:07:59.900 --> 02:08:01.620]   so that it actually can give eye tests.
[02:08:01.620 --> 02:08:03.100]   And here's a way to outfit an Android phone
[02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:04.380]   so that it can give these tests.
[02:08:04.380 --> 02:08:05.580]   Because they don't--
[02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:06.900]   in a lot of parts of the world, they
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:08.060]   don't have access to medical care.
[02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:09.900]   But they do have these dirt cheap Android phones.
[02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:13.860]   And if you could find a way to get these $5.89 little lens
[02:08:13.860 --> 02:08:16.420]   kits or whatever or sleds you put into,
[02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:17.900]   you can give them diagnostic tools
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:21.460]   that they can use to at least triage someone
[02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:23.060]   to decide, is it going to be worth the trip
[02:08:23.060 --> 02:08:25.220]   to get them to a hospital or not?
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:27.140]   And so this is something that could really plug
[02:08:27.140 --> 02:08:29.060]   into that sort of stuff.
[02:08:29.060 --> 02:08:32.940]   If only Apple had dirt cheap phones that were actually
[02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:33.260]   relevant.
[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:33.780]   Well, that's right.
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:35.380]   These other parts of the world.
[02:08:35.380 --> 02:08:36.380]   But it's a good move.
[02:08:36.380 --> 02:08:39.220]   And that may be the ultimate value of this is--
[02:08:39.220 --> 02:08:40.020]   For research, kid, for everyone.
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:42.020]   And then you could put it in a $50 Windows phone
[02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:43.060]   or Android phone.
[02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:45.340]   Also, let's not discount the fact that we're
[02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:49.940]   mining this incredibly measurable population of people
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:54.620]   who already have these phones to do research that will teach us
[02:08:54.620 --> 02:08:56.380]   things that we might not have even known
[02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:59.300]   if we weren't monitoring them with this device in their pocket.
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:01.260]   That teaches us something that helps everybody.
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:03.780]   It doesn't necessarily have to be the direct monitoring.
[02:09:03.780 --> 02:09:06.100]   It's learning, oh, did you know that if this happens,
[02:09:06.100 --> 02:09:07.940]   then this happens that leads to a place.
[02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:10.340]   If 50,000 people with Parkinson's who
[02:09:10.340 --> 02:09:12.860]   happen to be well enough off to have an iPhone or have
[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:16.580]   an Apple watch can record their data for a year,
[02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:19.380]   and that data ends up providing a cure or something
[02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:22.460]   that makes Parkinson's a much more livable disease,
[02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:24.100]   that's an incredible win for people
[02:09:24.100 --> 02:09:27.980]   who don't have iPhones and who may never be able to afford iPhones.
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:30.220]   But if it makes their care affordable,
[02:09:30.220 --> 02:09:34.700]   I know plenty of people who are like, oh, I'll never buy an iPhone
[02:09:34.700 --> 02:09:35.860]   because I don't have the money.
[02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:38.820]   But that's in part because I'm spending $2,000 a month
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:39.580]   on medication.
[02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:43.540]   And it's like if Apple can do something that
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:46.660]   eases medication costs, that makes quality of life better
[02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:50.460]   for the world, that's a win.
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:52.260]   That's a genuine win.
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:55.140]   Just a program, not if you're just tuning in now.
[02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:59.180]   Steve has the day off, but we'll do security now later this week.
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:01.340]   So we thought since we have the time,
[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:03.700]   let's take a little extra time since we've got such a great panel.
[02:10:03.700 --> 02:10:06.620]   So we're going to continue Mac break weekly a little bit longer.
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:09.180]   Coming up, your picks of the week,
[02:10:09.180 --> 02:10:10.940]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times,
[02:10:10.940 --> 02:10:13.820]   Jason Snell from sixcolors.com,
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:17.140]   Serenity Caldwell from iMoor.com.
[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:19.940]   She's waving to the Meerkat folks.
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:20.820]   I am.
[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:22.420]   We have a dual stream going on.
[02:10:22.420 --> 02:10:23.780]   It's a little weird.
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:25.420]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:30.420]   Also from iMoor.com, Renee Richie, Alex Lindsey from Rwanda.
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:32.100]   Are you doing a Meerkat too?
[02:10:32.100 --> 02:10:32.940]   I'm Meerkatting.
[02:10:32.940 --> 02:10:35.140]   So I'm streaming Meerkat.
[02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:39.380]   No, it's-- I'm streaming, you streaming, Me streaming.
[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:39.980]   It's a meta-vial.
[02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:41.220]   You're starting to sound like--
[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:41.940]   Starting my head.
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:43.060]   I stream a Meestreamer.
[02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:44.900]   I stream a Meestreamer.
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.340]   Very confusing.
[02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:48.060]   It's not like John John Binks.
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:48.860]   Oh, no, no.
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:50.500]   I stream a You Stream a Meestreamer.
[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:52.180]   It's Timon from the--
[02:10:52.180 --> 02:10:53.020]   Timon.
[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:53.580]   It's crazy.
[02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:54.060]   It's a Matata.
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:55.020]   It's a Matata.
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:55.860]   It's a miracle.
[02:10:55.860 --> 02:10:56.620]   And I turn it on.
[02:10:56.620 --> 02:10:58.300]   And there's like 17 people watching.
[02:10:58.300 --> 02:10:59.340]   Do you sing?
[02:10:59.340 --> 02:10:59.860]   I do.
[02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:00.500]   She dances.
[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:00.980]   She sings.
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:01.620]   She acts Serenity.
[02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:03.140]   I don't dance well.
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:04.140]   And she roller-goorbeats.
[02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:04.980]   Like she dances well.
[02:11:04.980 --> 02:11:07.100]   And she's an amazing-- what do you call that person?
[02:11:07.100 --> 02:11:08.980]   That you throw them through the line.
[02:11:08.980 --> 02:11:09.500]   What?
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:10.260]   The jammer?
[02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:10.780]   Jammer.
[02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:11.860]   I used to be.
[02:11:11.860 --> 02:11:16.180]   It was amazing jammer.
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:18.140]   Hello, Russia.
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:19.140]   Hello, Russia.
[02:11:19.140 --> 02:11:20.740]   Hello, Russia's watching Gandhi's--
[02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:22.780]   and the Mir-- there is an eyeball.
[02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:23.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:24.300]   It is crucial.
[02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:25.180]   I'm peeking inside.
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:27.820]   There's a strange eyeball coming into Mirkat.
[02:11:27.820 --> 02:11:29.220]   Our show today, we're going to take a break, come back
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:31.500]   with our picks, and a demonstration of this Mirkat thing
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:33.500]   that is all the rage with the kids.
[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:35.380]   But first, let's talk about shaving.
[02:11:35.380 --> 02:11:36.780]   Kids, you don't have to watch this.
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:38.740]   Well, maybe you should, because you know what?
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:41.660]   It's one of the things-- it's one of the rights of passage
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:44.980]   that the boys go through, I guess girls too at some point,
[02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:47.860]   where it's like, oh, really, I got to do that every day
[02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:49.660]   for the rest of my life.
[02:11:49.660 --> 02:11:51.860]   Harry's makes this such a pleasure.
[02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:54.700]   Let me reach down and get my Harry's kit.
[02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:58.940]   Harry's is an amazing experience for somebody
[02:11:58.940 --> 02:12:00.180]   who has to shave every day.
[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:02.020]   I just take it from me.
[02:12:02.020 --> 02:12:04.140]   It starts with the Harry's kit.
[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:05.500]   Now, they've got a Truman kit.
[02:12:05.500 --> 02:12:07.020]   They've got a Winston kit.
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:08.460]   This is the Truman kit.
[02:12:08.460 --> 02:12:13.220]   Every kit, though, includes a handle, three blades.
[02:12:13.220 --> 02:12:15.980]   Either the Harry's shaving foam, shaving gel,
[02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:18.540]   or the Harry's in the tube cream, which I like.
[02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:19.540]   And-- oh, yeah.
[02:12:19.540 --> 02:12:20.540]   A tube cream mitt.
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:21.020]   A whipped cream mitt.
[02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:22.660]   Oh, that mint cream mitt.
[02:12:22.660 --> 02:12:25.060]   And it's got some African nut in it.
[02:12:25.060 --> 02:12:25.700]   It's got--
[02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:26.220]   Interesting.
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:27.180]   Yeah.
[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:29.260]   Makuna and Matata are some.
[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:31.340]   And it's just-- it's marvelous.
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:34.180]   Anyway, $15 for the Truman--
[02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:36.220]   I'm going to save you even more in a second--
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:38.820]   $25 for the Winston, which is a metal engraved handle,
[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:40.260]   which is really sweet.
[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:42.340]   But that just gets you started with your Harry's experience.
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:44.300]   See, the key to Harry's is they decided
[02:12:44.300 --> 02:12:47.420]   that they wanted to direct to you blades
[02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:50.700]   at a much reduced price from the ridiculously inflated price
[02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:54.300]   of the drugstore blades, like $4 for Gillette Fusion.
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:56.780]   Per blade.
[02:12:56.780 --> 02:12:58.020]   I was buying a Gillette Fusion.
[02:12:58.020 --> 02:13:01.700]   I actually had to put my basket at Target.
[02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:02.780]   And then I looked at it.
[02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:05.260]   I was like $50 for some blades.
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:06.580]   And I thought, I can't do this.
[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:07.460]   I just can't do this.
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:10.500]   That's when Harry's really kind of cut to the forefront.
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:13.260]   The way that they did this, the way they solved this conundrum
[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:15.780]   is they bought the factory.
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:18.300]   So it turns out there's only really two great factories
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:21.180]   that were known for their blades.
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:22.340]   They're both in Germany.
[02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:24.380]   Harry's bought one of them.
[02:13:24.380 --> 02:13:26.700]   And by getting all the output of that factory,
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:30.260]   they can specify the best blades.
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:32.220]   They engineer them for sharpness and performance.
[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:34.220]   And then they keep the price really low
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:38.060]   because they ship them free to your doorstep.
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:42.020]   So the efficiency cuts the price literally in half.
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:43.740]   Literally in half.
[02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:47.140]   A beautiful, clean, comfortable shave.
[02:13:47.140 --> 02:13:48.940]   I've never cut myself with the Harry's blade.
[02:13:48.940 --> 02:13:50.660]   So hardly that's because I always have a new blade.
[02:13:50.660 --> 02:13:51.740]   I have fresh blades all the time.
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:52.260]   What?
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:53.220]   It's like a hovercraft for your face.
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:55.700]   It flows over your wrist.
[02:13:55.700 --> 02:13:58.580]   You've spoken like the guy who hasn't shaved in days.
[02:13:58.580 --> 02:13:59.500]   I shave weekly.
[02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:00.700]   I'll have you know that.
[02:14:00.700 --> 02:14:03.060]   And I shave before I travel because otherwise,
[02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:04.660]   customs pulls me over.
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:05.820]   But really?
[02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:07.300]   If I don't shave before, they always
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:08.980]   want to know what I'm doing and where I'm going and why.
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:09.540]   That's profiling.
[02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:10.500]   That's beard profiling.
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:11.940]   Absolutely anti-bierdest activity.
[02:14:11.940 --> 02:14:13.460]   Anti-bierdest.
[02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:15.020]   Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:17.180]   If you only shave once a week, there's more pulls.
[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:18.380]   You've got longer whiskers.
[02:14:18.380 --> 02:14:20.420]   That's when Harry's really makes a big difference.
[02:14:20.420 --> 02:14:21.540]   It's phenomenal.
[02:14:21.540 --> 02:14:23.940]   Then you get such a clean shave and it's such a nice feeling.
[02:14:23.940 --> 02:14:24.700]   I want you to try it.
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:28.180]   H-A-R-R-Y, harries.com.
[02:14:28.180 --> 02:14:30.220]   $5 off your first purchase.
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:31.580]   If you use the offer code MAC break,
[02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:34.220]   that means $10 to get your Truman kit.
[02:14:34.220 --> 02:14:35.900]   That's a pretty good darn deal.
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:37.180]   You're never going to get a deal like that.
[02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:38.340]   I'll tell you.
[02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:39.700]   Harry's-- well, you are.
[02:14:39.700 --> 02:14:42.300]   If you use the offer code MAC break at harries.com,
[02:14:42.300 --> 02:14:46.020]   we thank him so much for keeping us--
[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:47.460]   here's suit lists.
[02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:48.820]   Unhearsuit.
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:51.580]   Do you hear suited?
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:54.500]   Ah, the fear limits.
[02:14:54.500 --> 02:14:56.140]   Jason Snow.
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:14:57.140]   I know I do.
[02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:58.140]   I screw you up myself.
[02:14:58.140 --> 02:14:59.860]   I couldn't help it.
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:01.860]   Tell me Harry's shave is so smooth.
[02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:02.540]   Get him your cat.
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:05.500]   Guess what happens when MAC break goes long.
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:06.420]   We get punchy.
[02:15:06.420 --> 02:15:07.180]   All right.
[02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:07.980]   Let's do some picks.
[02:15:07.980 --> 02:15:09.180]   I want to start with a mirror cat,
[02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:11.940]   because we're running a mirror cat right now.
[02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:14.540]   Alex Lindsey, what is mirror cat
[02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:18.420]   besides a small desert dwelling critter from Africa?
[02:15:18.420 --> 02:15:20.660]   From Africa.
[02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:22.500]   This is-- so this is mirror cat.
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:23.860]   OK.
[02:15:23.860 --> 02:15:27.780]   And you can see your mirror cat.
[02:15:27.780 --> 02:15:29.700]   You know, why don't I--
[02:15:29.700 --> 02:15:32.580]   for purposes-- so you see what it looks like as you stream.
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:33.580]   So here's my mirror cat.
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:35.500]   I'm screening.
[02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:36.020]   Yeah.
[02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:37.580]   So I'm looking around and everything else.
[02:15:37.580 --> 02:15:39.380]   Now, I'm in Rwanda from--
[02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:40.300]   oh, my iPhone.
[02:15:40.300 --> 02:15:42.020]   And I'm streaming to Twitter.
[02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:43.460]   Jason, show my--
[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:44.820]   42 seconds.
[02:15:44.820 --> 02:15:45.260]   Over the show.
[02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:46.060]   You know to do this.
[02:15:46.060 --> 02:15:47.420]   I mean, like it was-- it's crazy.
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:48.140]   You push a button.
[02:15:48.140 --> 02:15:49.220]   It tweets, right?
[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:49.940]   And then--
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:50.460]   It tweets.
[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:50.940]   It tweets.
[02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:50.940]   It tweets.
[02:15:50.940 --> 02:15:51.540]   Watching.
[02:15:51.540 --> 02:15:53.140]   Which is so cool.
[02:15:53.140 --> 02:15:54.460]   I actually really like that.
[02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:57.220]   And there's a chat on it so that people are chatting--
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:15:58.580]   That's right here.
[02:15:58.580 --> 02:15:59.260]   Yeah.
[02:15:59.260 --> 02:16:01.740]   From a social tie in, it's really, really interesting.
[02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:04.860]   And the fact that-- now I do a lot of live streaming.
[02:16:04.860 --> 02:16:07.340]   And I know that impromptu live streaming does not usually
[02:16:07.340 --> 02:16:08.540]   yield very many viewers.
[02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:09.100]   Right.
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.660]   So the idea that in a couple of minutes,
[02:16:10.660 --> 02:16:13.860]   I have 71 viewers is actually pretty good.
[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:14.300]   You know that--
[02:16:14.300 --> 02:16:16.900]   I think that's 500 people watching this mirror cat stream
[02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:17.580]   right now.
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:18.100]   Exactly.
[02:16:18.100 --> 02:16:18.660]   Exactly.
[02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:20.300]   So it's the--
[02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:21.820]   I'm going to see if I can spin this thing around.
[02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:22.140]   Yeah.
[02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:24.100]   But I think that this is--
[02:16:24.100 --> 02:16:25.220]   And you know what's amazing?
[02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:26.780]   It's pretty solid.
[02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:28.300]   I mean, it works pretty well.
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:28.800]   Yeah.
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:29.140]   Absolutely.
[02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:30.700]   Well, I have to admit, I had it on my phone.
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:33.380]   And this morning on the way to work, on the way to the school,
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:34.620]   I was just in the cabin.
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:35.940]   I just turned it on.
[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:38.820]   And I just couldn't believe that it was coming out smoothly
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:40.460]   and working and everything else.
[02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:43.500]   And so anyway, it is--
[02:16:43.500 --> 02:16:47.140]   So Jason's watching my mirror cat right now.
[02:16:47.140 --> 02:16:48.540]   What are you watching that on, Jason?
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:50.140]   How are you doing that?
[02:16:50.140 --> 02:16:54.340]   You have to resize the browser to a portrait format.
[02:16:54.340 --> 02:16:56.260]   So you can watch it on the browser.
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:57.340]   Yeah, you can.
[02:16:57.340 --> 02:16:58.340]   So this is it.
[02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:00.460]   I'm not resized.
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:02.900]   This is why this is the perspective we're normally
[02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:03.660]   used to having.
[02:17:03.660 --> 02:17:06.780]   But if you resize the window to a portrait,
[02:17:06.780 --> 02:17:08.740]   then you get a bunch of other classes.
[02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:11.580]   So you can schedule a stream ahead of time.
[02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:14.100]   And then it'll tweet out, oh, tune in, as I did.
[02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:14.980]   Tune into 12.50.
[02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:15.540]   It's really awesome.
[02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:16.040]   It's really awesome.
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:19.420]   Or that you can just start a stream and it'll tweet it out.
[02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:22.140]   And does it continue to read to tweet?
[02:17:22.140 --> 02:17:23.420]   I've been on for 40 minutes now.
[02:17:23.420 --> 02:17:24.540]   Does it continue to--
[02:17:24.540 --> 02:17:25.460]   people want to look at--
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:26.060]   I'm going to put a serrated--
[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:26.860]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:28.260]   I just started one.
[02:17:28.260 --> 02:17:28.780]   Did you start one?
[02:17:28.780 --> 02:17:29.060]   I just started one.
[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:30.420]   I just started one.
[02:17:30.420 --> 02:17:31.980]   This is like mirror cat inception.
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:32.480]   Oh, boy.
[02:17:32.480 --> 02:17:34.280]   Everyone pointed the camera.
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:35.720]   Everyone pointed the camera.
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:37.280]   Everyone pointed the camera right now.
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:38.280]   We'll have a weird camera.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:38.780]   Wow.
[02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:39.280]   We're all broadcast.
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:40.480]   We're all individual shows down.
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:41.480]   We do live action.
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:42.480]   We'll live action.
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:42.980]   We'll live time.
[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:43.980]   You got somebody cameras around here.
[02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:44.480]   This is a good studio.
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:45.480]   I know.
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:47.480]   So eight people are watching right now.
[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:49.480]   What-- so have you been using it for a while?
[02:17:49.480 --> 02:17:50.480]   No.
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:51.480]   No.
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:52.480]   I just-- I've been hearing about it.
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:54.480]   Everyone keep on telling you, oh, you've got to look at me.
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:56.480]   Because what I do, everyone keeps on telling me
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:58.480]   that I have to look at mirror cat.
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:00.480]   And so I finally had it.
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:01.480]   I down loaded it immediately.
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:02.480]   And I just didn't get around to it.
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:04.480]   And when I opened it up, I just thought it was so cool that--
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:05.480]   anyway, that's why it's my pick.
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:07.480]   There's a little bit of a latency on it.
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:08.480]   There's a little bit of latency on it.
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:09.480]   What is about half a minute?
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:10.480]   40 seconds?
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:11.480]   Something like that.
[02:18:11.480 --> 02:18:12.480]   Yeah, it's probably about that.
[02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:13.480]   Something like that.
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:15.480]   I mean, it's-- I can't tell because you're not on.
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:16.480]   We're looking at--
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:17.480]   I hear a sound.
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:18.480]   I hear a sound.
[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:19.480]   There we go.
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:20.480]   Now we're looking at Alex.
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:21.480]   That's Alex.
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:22.480]   Here we go.
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:23.480]   I'm going to go-- I'm going to snap.
[02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:24.480]   OK, I snapped.
[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:26.480]   This is a little bit insane.
[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:27.480]   It's mirror cat inception.
[02:18:27.480 --> 02:18:28.480]   We need to take--
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:32.480]   People are listening to the audio only version of this podcast are completely--
[02:18:32.480 --> 02:18:33.480]   Oh, they're very confused.
[02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:34.480]   I'm about to see you right now.
[02:18:34.480 --> 02:18:35.480]   Yep, so I've got 28.
[02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:36.480]   I'm beating you, Renee.
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:37.480]   You're going to see me--
[02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:38.480]   Oh, so you can receive a mirror cat--
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:40.480]   That was probably about 15, 20 seconds, yeah.
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:41.480]   You can receive a mirror cat on a browser.
[02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:43.480]   You can receive it on a phone.
[02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:44.480]   Mm-hmm.
[02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:46.480]   It is not Android yet.
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:47.480]   It's iOS only.
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:52.480]   And it really went viral just in the last couple of weeks, partly because of product hunt.
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:57.480]   But then yesterday, we saw that a number of people were going to mirror cat the keynote, which is kind of silly.
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:58.480]   It was already good stream.
[02:18:58.480 --> 02:19:02.480]   It was mirror cat road rage because people were trying to mirror cat the same watch table and yelling, "Dad, why mirror cat?
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:03.480]   Wait!"
[02:19:03.480 --> 02:19:04.480]   Oh, no, really?
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:05.480]   Yeah.
[02:19:05.480 --> 02:19:06.480]   Yeah.
[02:19:06.480 --> 02:19:07.480]   It was almost like-- it was almost brawls.
[02:19:07.480 --> 02:19:08.480]   Oh, that's terrible.
[02:19:08.480 --> 02:19:11.480]   I'm definitely going to use this for Derby.
[02:19:11.480 --> 02:19:12.480]   This is actually-- this is really exciting.
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:16.480]   So what's great about it is, yeah, you can do kind of ad hoc streaming.
[02:19:16.480 --> 02:19:19.480]   We certainly spend a lot of money to design a streaming studio.
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:24.480]   I don't really need mirror cats since I spend plenty of time on streaming live streaming video.
[02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:27.480]   But there's something personal and intimate about it as well.
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:30.480]   So now I'm going to mirror cat Jason's mirror cat.
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:31.480]   I'm mirror catting, Liam.
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:32.480]   I'm mirror catting Jason.
[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:33.480]   You're mirror catting.
[02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:34.480]   I'm mirror catting Jason.
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:35.480]   How about that?
[02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:38.480]   Oh, what's wrong with you, Jayne?
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:40.480]   Maybe this is the way we should do the show from now on.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:41.480]   All right.
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:42.480]   It's a multi-camera.
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:45.480]   You know, I do think that this is going to be something that's going to transform news.
[02:19:45.480 --> 02:19:46.480]   I mean, I think that's the thing.
[02:19:46.480 --> 02:19:47.480]   Something's going to happen.
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:49.480]   And suddenly, there's going to be mirror cats.
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:51.480]   You know, it's going to be a swarm of mirror cats.
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:54.480]   You know, on a, you know, on, you know, those types of things.
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:56.480]   There's the swarm of mirror cats right here.
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:19:57.480 --> 02:19:58.480]   Look at that.
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:03.480]   So the interesting thing is that Twitter just bought a company that does exactly this.
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:05.480]   Is it called Pumba mode?
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:06.480]   Yeah.
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:08.480]   It's Pumba.
[02:20:08.480 --> 02:20:09.480]   Periscope.
[02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:10.480]   No, it's periscope.
[02:20:10.480 --> 02:20:11.480]   Yeah.
[02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:16.480]   And I think that unfortunately they just missed the boat because mirror cat is obviously snagged.
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:18.480]   The, it is about Twitter.
[02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:20.480]   Without Twitter, it means nothing, right?
[02:20:20.480 --> 02:20:22.480]   They integrate it right into, into Twitter.
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:25.480]   Remember, um, quickly, oh, we need the, you were calling with much.
[02:20:25.480 --> 02:20:26.480]   Let's touch phones.
[02:20:26.480 --> 02:20:27.480]   Yeah.
[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:28.480]   Quick.
[02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:29.480]   I know.
[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:30.480]   Yeah.
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:31.480]   Social camera.
[02:20:31.480 --> 02:20:32.480]   Just social camera.
[02:20:32.480 --> 02:20:33.480]   You can see this.
[02:20:33.480 --> 02:20:34.480]   Okay.
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:35.480]   Now this is what's weird.
[02:20:35.480 --> 02:20:37.480]   You can save it to your phone, but what you can't do is save it to the internet.
[02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:39.480]   There is no, it, mirror cat is a little bit like snapchat.
[02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:41.480]   Well, I think it also is.
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:42.480]   I think it also is.
[02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:43.480]   Presumably.
[02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:44.480]   If you wanted to.
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:45.480]   Yeah.
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:46.480]   You could, you could post it somewhere.
[02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:49.480]   And I think that part of that is also the quality of the video that you post will be much higher quality than what it would have recorded from the live show.
[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:50.480]   But I think that's a good thing.
[02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:51.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:20:51.480 --> 02:20:52.480]   I think that's a good thing.

[02:23:50.480 --> 02:23:51.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:53.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:54.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:55.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:56.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:23:56.480 --> 02:23:57.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:23:57.480 --> 02:23:58.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:23:59.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:00.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:01.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:01.480 --> 02:24:02.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:02.480 --> 02:24:03.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:04.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:05.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:05.480 --> 02:24:06.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:07.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:08.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:08.480 --> 02:24:09.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:10.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:11.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:12.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:13.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:13.480 --> 02:24:14.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:16.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:17.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:18.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:18.480 --> 02:24:19.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:20.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:21.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:21.480 --> 02:24:22.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:23.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:24.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:25.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:26.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:26.480 --> 02:24:27.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:27.480 --> 02:24:28.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:28.480 --> 02:24:29.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:30.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:31.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:32.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:32.480 --> 02:24:33.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:34.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:35.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:35.480 --> 02:24:36.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:36.480 --> 02:24:37.480]   I think that's a good thing.
[02:24:38.480 --> 02:24:40.480]   We could show the studio audience, which is dwindled.
[02:24:40.480 --> 02:24:41.480]   Yeah.
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:42.480]   We're sorry.
[02:24:42.480 --> 02:24:43.480]   We went really long today, guys.
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:44.480]   Hour five of the telephones.
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:45.480]   Yeah.
[02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:46.480]   All right.
[02:24:46.480 --> 02:24:47.480]   Our Mac break telethon.
[02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:50.480]   If you're tuning in for security and ask Steve's under the weather, we will do it later.
[02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:51.480]   We'll put it on the calendar.
[02:24:51.480 --> 02:24:54.480]   Thursday or Friday, we're working on a time that we can do security now.
[02:24:54.480 --> 02:24:56.480]   That's why we're getting to go a little longer.
[02:24:56.480 --> 02:25:00.480]   We had such a great panel that I could not resist doing this.
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:05.480]   This is another time that the 10/1 design clip comes in handy that you recommended, serenity.
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:06.480]   I like this little thing.
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:10.480]   Because you can mount this now right there on your--
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:12.480]   Peter is a smart, smart accessory developer.
[02:25:12.480 --> 02:25:13.480]   Look at that.
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:14.480]   Is this a guy named Peter?
[02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:15.480]   Peter Skinner.
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:16.480]   Peter Skinner.
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:17.480]   10/1 design.
[02:25:17.480 --> 02:25:19.480]   10/1 started with a stylist.
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:20.480]   The pogo.
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:22.480]   The pogo, which I still love and use.
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:26.480]   And now this little silly thing, which I bought because you recommended it, serenity, has proven
[02:25:26.480 --> 02:25:28.480]   its value in mirror-catting.
[02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:29.480]   So now you can leave--
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:30.480]   Hey, for a $0.00.
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:31.480]   I can mirror-cat.
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:36.240]   I just realized-- so a bunch of my cartoonist friends used to do live streams where they
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:39.240]   would have to position their camera and weird things.
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:41.240]   I'm like, you just put your iPhone up against them.
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:44.240]   And now you can see what-- yeah, it's neat.
[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:48.240]   So there's Alex Lindsay's pick all the way from Rwanda.
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:49.240]   He's streaming.
[02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:50.240]   We're streaming.
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:52.240]   We're all streaming.
[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:56.240]   Would you like to pick something Mr. Renee Richie?
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:25:57.240]   Stop your mirror-cat.
[02:25:57.240 --> 02:25:58.240]   Stop your mirror-cat.
[02:25:58.240 --> 02:26:00.240]   I'll keep my mirror-cat going.
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:04.240]   I'm a little bit worried about saving this to my phone.
[02:26:04.240 --> 02:26:06.240]   It's going to be kind of a big file.
[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:07.240]   I'm just saving mine.
[02:26:07.240 --> 02:26:08.240]   I don't know if we'll do anything with it.
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:09.240]   But it's pretty scary.
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:12.240]   I'll post it on YouTube if I can upload it.
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:14.240]   And you can watch this ex post-facto.
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:16.240]   So my-- and I apologize to Jason as I was mirror-catting.
[02:26:16.240 --> 02:26:18.240]   I forgot to paste it into these show notes.
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:26.240]   But my Google Calendar has-- yes, asterisk finally asterisk appeared on iOS after being rumored
[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:27.240]   for a while.
[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:29.240]   And we use Google Calendar at work.
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:30.240]   We run off Google Apps.
[02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:34.240]   And it's always been really annoying because I use Google over exchange on my iPhone, which
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:39.240]   means I have to go to that stupid Google website on every device and check off the calendars.
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:40.240]   I actually want to show up.
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:41.240]   And I forget that's how you do it.
[02:26:41.240 --> 02:26:43.240]   So I just think my calendars are missing all the time.
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:44.240]   Right.
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:45.240]   And you only get one.
[02:26:45.240 --> 02:26:46.240]   Yeah.
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:47.240]   And it's super frustrating.
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:48.240]   But now it's a Google Calendar app.
[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:50.240]   It does look like Google's design language, which some people don't like.
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:51.240]   But I think it's perfectly serviceable.
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:53.240]   Like it's really well produced app.
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:54.240]   It nicely animated.
[02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:59.240]   And it just shows-- I loaded it, downloaded it, asked me which of my Google accounts I wanted to use.
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:00.240]   I checked off.
[02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:01.240]   My personal one.
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:03.960]   I checked off my mobile nations one.
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:06.120]   All my calendars were there.
[02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:08.160]   The colors aren't the prettiest.
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:09.160]   You know what?
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:10.160]   That's material design.
[02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:12.160]   It looks exactly the same as the Android one.
[02:27:12.160 --> 02:27:14.880]   My problem with material design is that I find a little bit like Windows Phone, and
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:17.640]   that it's so beautiful to the extent that once in a while it's monotonous and I'd like
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:18.640]   a little bit--
[02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:19.640]   Yeah, I know what you mean.
[02:27:19.640 --> 02:27:20.640]   Yeah.
[02:27:20.640 --> 02:27:21.640]   And the color-- I'd like a little bit of that.
[02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:24.240]   But Google Calendar is an AK-47 of calendars.
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:25.240]   It's a battleship of calendars.
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:26.240]   It is serviceable.
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:29.880]   Well, you can drop the Google Calendar in the water and it will still work.
[02:27:29.880 --> 02:27:31.520]   And it's just been great.
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:35.360]   I don't know if I'll keep using it because I've been fine having Calendar.app or Fantastic
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:39.000]   Owl pull stuff, but I like the idea that we can finally get it.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:40.000]   All right.
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:41.000]   And it's free.
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:42.000]   Yes.
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.240]   Well, like all of the-- what do you-- how do you search for it?
[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:47.200]   Is searching as hard right now because there's so many calendar apps and because there was no
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:50.400]   Google Calendar app, a lot of people put Gmail and Google in the name.
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:53.600]   So I would recommend just going to the-- like you can type it in and there is a Google--
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:55.000]   Just get all the Google stuff.
[02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.000]   And then you search.
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:57.320]   But again, it pulls up a ton of results.
[02:27:57.320 --> 02:28:00.560]   Or you go to a Google app and then tap on Google as a developer.
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:01.560]   That's what you do.
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:02.560]   And scroll to the bottom.
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:03.560]   Yeah.
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:04.560]   And it's down there.
[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:05.560]   That's the way to do it.
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:06.560]   Yeah.
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:07.560]   So, yeah.
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:10.160]   So Google Calendar, if you're at all committed to Google, then it is an excellent app for
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:11.160]   you to get.
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:15.920]   It's better than using the native iPhone calendar and just--
[02:28:15.920 --> 02:28:20.120]   I still like Fantastic Owl better because even the Google Calendar displays really nicely,
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:23.560]   but Fantastic Owl is so fast to get things into and to get things out of.
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:25.720]   And the other problem is I'm still split on this.
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:29.720]   Like a lot of people had Outlook and I looked at everything in one app.
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:31.400]   And on mobile, we're doing these separate apps.
[02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:36.440]   But would I be happier if Google had like a Google desktop app that was male plus calendar?
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:38.600]   I could just go back and forth between tabs quickly.
[02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:39.600]   I don't know.
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:44.040]   But I do like-- if I need to really get a Googly Crunchy Calendar experience, I can
[02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:46.000]   launch the Google Calendar app.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.440]   Well, I want a Googly Crunchy experience.
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:49.440]   Like granola.
[02:28:49.440 --> 02:28:50.440]   Mm-hmm.
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:53.320]   Serenity, I don't know if we told you, but we do pics every week.
[02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:56.200]   Yes, I actually put-- I just put mine into the Google app.
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:57.200]   Nice.
[02:28:57.200 --> 02:28:58.200]   Thank you.
[02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:01.880]   I'm so sad, actually, because my pic is-- it was in my luggage and it's sitting at my
[02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:02.880]   friend's apartment.
[02:29:02.880 --> 02:29:03.880]   But it is not here.
[02:29:03.880 --> 02:29:04.880]   My pic is in my luggage.
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:10.760]   All right, so I have been testing some Bluetooth speakers recently because I went to CES and
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:15.000]   part of the phone of CES is being like, all right, let's see some products that would
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.760]   work well with my phone and my Mac.
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:22.160]   And the thing that stood out to me is at CES and now that I've gotten a chance to play
[02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:27.480]   it with it, I'm kind of in love with it, is the Fugu, which is this little-- it's this
[02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:33.480]   jam box-sized speaker that is waterproof, snowproof, dustproof, and if you get the right
[02:29:33.480 --> 02:29:36.880]   jacket car-proof, I can hear you run over it.
[02:29:36.880 --> 02:29:37.880]   But is it derby-proof?
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:38.880]   Yes, it is.
[02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:40.240]   So I brought it to a derby.
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:41.240]   So it comes-- all right, so--
[02:29:41.240 --> 02:29:43.240]   Blood, hair, teeth, baby, right on.
[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:44.240]   Yeah, very much.
[02:29:44.240 --> 02:29:45.240]   It's jam-or-proof.
[02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:46.480]   Bear-- bare bones.
[02:29:46.480 --> 02:29:50.560]   This is a speaker that is about the size of a jam box that has 40 hours of battery life
[02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:52.040]   that connects over Bluetooth.
[02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:53.040]   Wow.
[02:29:53.040 --> 02:29:56.320]   And also happens to be a bunch of things proof.
[02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:58.480]   In addition, it sounds great.
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:02.880]   It sounds-- it's much louder than the jam box and you can strap it to pretty much anything.
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:05.320]   It comes with a tripod adapter, basically.
[02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:07.320]   So you can stick it on a tripod.
[02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:09.440]   There's a strap that you can wrap it around your bike.
[02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:13.760]   You can wrap it around a tree or you can wrap it around what I did at my last derby practice,
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:15.200]   which is one of our poles.
[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:16.200]   Nice.
[02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:17.200]   So you can basically put it anywhere.
[02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:18.200]   Rock and roll.
[02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:20.080]   Yeah, and it's just-- it's really nice.
[02:30:20.080 --> 02:30:25.600]   I charged it-- this-- I've been testing the sport, which I charged once, two weeks ago,
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:27.520]   and I have yet to run out of battery.
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:28.520]   Wow.
[02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:31.400]   Which granted, I've only been playing with it in like one or two-hour increments, and
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:33.600]   that makes sense for a 40-hour battery life.
[02:30:33.600 --> 02:30:36.800]   But like, I seriously have to, you know, do some crazy things.
[02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:39.120]   Yeah, I'm just asking if it's sandproof.
[02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:40.120]   It is sandproof.
[02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:41.120]   I haven't tested it.
[02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:42.120]   I tested it in snow.
[02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:46.320]   I've tested it in a little bit of dirt, and I've tested throwing it in water.
[02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:50.280]   In theory, it's supposed to be waterproof to three feet, but when I talked to the folks,
[02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:55.800]   they're like, technically it's closer to about 10 to 12 feet, but the Bluetooth signal starts
[02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:58.960]   to haze out after three or four.
[02:30:58.960 --> 02:30:59.960]   So I really like it.
[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:04.880]   It's 200 bucks for a core, and they also come with these swappable jackets.
[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:08.440]   So you can get like a nice-looking speaker if you want to get like-- I think it's called
[02:31:08.440 --> 02:31:10.200]   the fugu style.
[02:31:10.200 --> 02:31:14.400]   If you want a nice like clutch-like speaker to put next to your television and make it
[02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:18.520]   look fancy, but you can also get the sport for everyday use, and then you can get the
[02:31:18.520 --> 02:31:25.240]   tough jacket, which makes it look like, again, they have a video somewhere on YouTube where
[02:31:25.240 --> 02:31:26.640]   they run it over with a car.
[02:31:26.640 --> 02:31:28.320]   It's like, no big deal.
[02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:30.040]   It's fine.
[02:31:30.040 --> 02:31:34.600]   But yeah, I really, really like the speaker, and I've been testing it for about two, three
[02:31:34.600 --> 02:31:35.600]   weeks.
[02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:40.080]   And then they're coming out with one, I think, later this year in April called the XL, which
[02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:45.440]   is about the size of the big jam box, also has 40 hours of battery life, and something
[02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:47.400]   like-- I don't know.
[02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:52.280]   I'm an F of a music person to really enjoy it, but all of the subwoofers is kind of crazy.
[02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:53.280]   What is it?
[02:31:53.280 --> 02:31:59.000]   Eight symmetrically placed drivers for the big fugu.
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:05.120]   What I really like about this speaker actually is that it has drivers and speakers on all
[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:06.640]   sides of the device.
[02:32:06.640 --> 02:32:10.560]   So it's just as loud pointing one direction as it is another direction as it is standing
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:11.560]   on the side.
[02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:15.280]   It's not like my real problem with the jam box is you have to position it a certain way
[02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:17.000]   in order to get the good sound.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.600]   If you have it flipped, then you're like, well, why can't I hear anything?
[02:32:20.600 --> 02:32:22.600]   So yeah, I think it's pretty nifty.
[02:32:22.600 --> 02:32:26.720]   I've been recommending it to anybody who's like, I need a good Bluetooth speaker.
[02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:31.160]   And Leo, just a quick little tidbit here.
[02:32:31.160 --> 02:32:32.960]   Father Robert reviewed the speaker.
[02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:33.960]   That's what I thought.
[02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:35.400]   I thought we'd done a review of this.
[02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:40.040]   But I was spelling it wrong and kept searching for the blowfish fugu.
[02:32:40.040 --> 02:32:41.040]   It's F-U-G-O-O.
[02:32:41.040 --> 02:32:42.040]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:32:42.040 --> 02:32:44.040]   I gave it a buy.
[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:45.040]   He gave it a buy.
[02:32:45.040 --> 02:32:46.040]   He liked the fugu.
[02:32:46.040 --> 02:32:47.040]   I remember that.
[02:32:47.040 --> 02:32:49.440]   I was trying to find it this whole time.
[02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:50.440]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:32:50.440 --> 02:32:52.760]   Jason Howell, our producer.
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:55.040]   Jason Snell, our guest.
[02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:56.040]   Do you have a pick?
[02:32:56.040 --> 02:33:00.680]   I just came up with one because your backup pick to Alex's pick was my pick.
[02:33:00.680 --> 02:33:01.680]   Well, you can do that.
[02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:05.120]   I'm going to pick Alto's Adventure because I don't think you guys have done Alto's Adventure
[02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:06.120]   yet on Macbreak.
[02:33:06.120 --> 02:33:07.120]   It is a fantastic--
[02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:08.840]   Does it come in a little tin can?
[02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:10.640]   It's an endless snowboarding game.
[02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:11.640]   Oh.
[02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:13.000]   After iOS, it is beautiful.
[02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:14.000]   It's like a lot.
[02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:17.320]   There are a lot of endless skiing and snowboarding games out there, but it is beautiful.
[02:33:17.320 --> 02:33:18.960]   The music is fantastic.
[02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:20.960]   It is addictive to play.
[02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:21.960]   Oh, serenity's handing in.
[02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:22.960]   Serendity's got 140,000.
[02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:23.960]   My high sports like--
[02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:24.960]   Oh my gosh.
[02:33:24.960 --> 02:33:27.320]   You play this a lot, obviously.
[02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:30.240]   It is my latest game edition.
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:31.600]   I wrote a game guide.
[02:33:31.600 --> 02:33:34.760]   I wrote a game guide that's on I'm more on how to do all kinds of things.
[02:33:34.760 --> 02:33:35.760]   So you just tap to jump.
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:36.760]   Okay, guide me.
[02:33:36.760 --> 02:33:41.400]   All right, so you start skiing and then you tap to jump over things.
[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:42.400]   You collect llamas.
[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:44.840]   Oh, you just like that bicycling game.
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:45.840]   Yeah, I mean--
[02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:47.960]   It's in the genre.
[02:33:47.960 --> 02:33:48.960]   You got to hold to--
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:50.960]   Yeah, tap and hold to the lips.
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:51.960]   Although that was a nice little dream.
[02:33:51.960 --> 02:33:52.960]   I'm always here.
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:56.000]   So it's two bucks.
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:57.960]   There are no in-app purchases.
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:33:58.960]   You buy it, you get it.
[02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:02.600]   You do earn coins that you can use to buy things in the game, but you can't buy them
[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:05.200]   within that purchases, you just earn them by playing the game.
[02:34:05.200 --> 02:34:09.400]   And one of the nice things about it is a lot of these endless runs get boring after
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:12.760]   a while because you're like, oh, I got to go on forever before I get my next thing.
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:15.720]   What Altos does is every level is three tasks you need to perform.
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:17.840]   And it's basically three snowboarding tricks.
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:23.320]   And they are-- they scale with your level of proficiency.
[02:34:23.320 --> 02:34:24.320]   So there's always--
[02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:25.320]   I bet they're all just going.
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:27.400]   Yeah, there's always where you hit a rock.
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:29.400]   It's bad.
[02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:33.880]   It's a lot of fun and it's easy to play and it doesn't get boring.
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:36.520]   And I couldn't endorse it more highly than that.
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:37.520]   And it's beautiful.
[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:39.480]   And it changes from day to night.
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:40.480]   There's--
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:41.480]   Oh, yeah, you watch the sun go down.
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:43.680]   And if you ski long enough, you watch it come back up.
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:44.680]   It's pretty awesome.
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:45.680]   There you go.
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:46.680]   Now you're getting it.
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:47.680]   Oh.
[02:34:47.680 --> 02:34:50.680]   It's all kinds of fun.
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:52.680]   And you hit those now.
[02:34:52.680 --> 02:34:53.680]   Oh.
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:54.680]   This looks fun.
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:55.680]   That's great.
[02:34:55.680 --> 02:34:56.680]   Altos, adventure, $2.
[02:34:56.680 --> 02:34:58.320]   From Snowman on the App Store.
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:01.280]   Thank you for letting me play.
[02:35:01.280 --> 02:35:02.280]   Andy, not co.
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:04.120]   You're pick of the week.
[02:35:04.120 --> 02:35:07.520]   Mine is something that's kind of pricey, but it's something I freely, really like.
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:12.600]   Last year around this time, my pick of the week was this Olympus OM-D-E-M1, which is one
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:15.360]   of the nicest things I've ever bought in my life.
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:18.480]   I've been-- I've shot thousands and thousands of pictures with this.
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:19.480]   Absolutely in love with this.
[02:35:19.480 --> 02:35:21.000]   It's exactly the sort of camera that I like.
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:25.680]   It runs-- it uses the micro four-thirds lens system and sensor system, which means that
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:28.280]   it's-- the body is nice and compact.
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:32.720]   And unlike other mirrorless systems, it has a really nice library of lenses for it.
[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:39.000]   I actually bought like the nice equivalent of the 80 to 300 millimeter F2.8.
[02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:45.560]   Used this to shoot pictures inside PAX East gaming con over the weekend.
[02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:49.520]   I was getting so many pictures that I would not have been able to get otherwise.
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:50.520]   But I really love it.
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:56.800]   So, Olympus has always had like a sort of a-- not a more consumer-ish model.
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:01.640]   This has always been like their-- their-- their-- their pitch to pro photographers.
[02:36:01.640 --> 02:36:05.000]   The OM-D-E-M5 has always been there.
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:08.960]   We're going to make something that's a little bit more affordable, but also a little bit
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:11.720]   more practical for a consumer.
[02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:18.080]   So the buttons are not quite as-- as comfortable as on the Pro model.
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:23.400]   Also whereas the-- oh, the OM-1 has just a simple like flip out screen.
[02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:30.960]   The OM-5 has the full like flippy outy, turny aroundy, selfie sort of screen like that.
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:34.800]   But also-- but because this is one year newer, this is the Mark II that came up with.
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:36.160]   They released it last year.
[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:37.600]   This is the updated version of it.
[02:36:37.600 --> 02:36:42.560]   It has a better video even than the-- than the so-called Pro model.
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:46.960]   It shoots at 77 megabits per second, this post 24 megabits per second.
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:52.160]   Alex will be very interested to know that it outputs uncompressed HDMI through its HDMI
[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:55.640]   port and shoots full 1080 video.
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:37:00.720]   It also has a really cool feature where the one feature that has so many features that
[02:37:00.720 --> 02:37:05.800]   are shared between the Pro 1 and this one, one of them is this absolutely killer 5-axis
[02:37:05.800 --> 02:37:09.040]   stabilization that's inside the body so it works with any lens.
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:15.200]   I have been able to like hand hold shots of like one fifth per second and it's razor
[02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:19.840]   sharp because it is compensating for every piece of movement in there.
[02:37:19.840 --> 02:37:25.560]   It is insane how you can shoot at like low ISO's in low light and it just plain works.
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:31.640]   But they came up with this really clever idea because the image sensor, the camera is able
[02:37:31.640 --> 02:37:35.840]   to move the image sensor around, you know, to just to compensate for jitter.
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:40.600]   Some clever group of engineers thought, "Huh, you know what we could do?
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:46.160]   We could have a special shooting mode so that it will take a series of eight photos and
[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:51.960]   move the sensor a little bit each time and we could do some math and then convert those
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:56.920]   eight pictures into an actual 40 megapixel image.
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:02.120]   You definitely need to have it on a tripod for that to work but it actually works.
[02:38:02.120 --> 02:38:05.400]   You wind up with a for real 40 megapixel image.
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:10.480]   Again, it's synthesizing this from eight images so don't think that you can take a picture
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:12.920]   of your family reunion.
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:14.800]   People will be blurry because they're moving around.
[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:18.080]   But for landscapes, for buildings and just for the fact that, hey, it doesn't cost extra
[02:38:18.080 --> 02:38:21.800]   money for this, it's just a cool feature.
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:24.000]   It's there are a lot of mirrorless cameras out there.
[02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.520]   The Sony's are really, really nice.
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:29.760]   I think it's really between Sony, Fuji and Olympus.
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:37.760]   I happen to like the Olympus cameras because to me they're the best hybrid between having
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:41.560]   something that is nice and compact that I can easily just stick in whatever laptop bag
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:44.200]   I'm using and take with me wherever I go.
[02:38:44.200 --> 02:38:49.680]   And yet still having that sort of look and feel that sort of experience of using an SLR
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:53.720]   of looking through the viewfinder and being able to set things with buttons however I want
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:54.720]   it.
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:55.720]   So it's not cheap.
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:38:59.760]   It's about a list for $1,100 without a lens.
[02:38:59.760 --> 02:39:06.480]   But if you're shopping for a nice SLR, you're probably looking at like a Nikon 7100 or a
[02:39:06.480 --> 02:39:07.800]   Canon equivalent.
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:09.960]   That's probably about what you're going to spend anyway.
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:13.800]   Definitely look at a camera like this because it costs the exact same amount of money.
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:17.880]   It takes pictures that are just about as good I would say, maybe even better given the way
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:19.400]   the features are done.
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:21.680]   And this is, you know, look how tiny this is.
[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:26.040]   This is, here's my phone and there's, there disappears the camera.
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:27.800]   It's that small.
[02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:31.640]   So I mean, that's the reason why when the time came last year to buy like my first really
[02:39:31.640 --> 02:39:36.400]   good camera in like 10 years, I bought this because I remember every single time I left
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:42.720]   my Nikon APS-C SLR at home, even though I'm spending a week in Barcelona and London because
[02:39:42.720 --> 02:39:46.760]   I just don't want to carry this big honkin SLR around my neck because I can't be able
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:49.640]   to fit it inside like any of my carry on bags.
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:51.280]   So that's my pick of the week.
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:52.800]   I've been using it for about a week.
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:57.240]   I used it, did the dumb thing you're not supposed to do of, Hey, let's take this.
[02:39:57.240 --> 02:39:58.840]   Let's take this up to PAX East.
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:01.680]   You literally took this out of the box a few days ago.
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:03.400]   You've barely shot 30 frames for the butt.
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:08.720]   Hey, let's do another thousand frames of this and this very high intensity situation
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:11.480]   left it on auto and it took great pictures most of the time.
[02:40:11.480 --> 02:40:12.480]   Love it.
[02:40:12.480 --> 02:40:14.440]   It's a fantastic camera.
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:17.200]   That's the one we brought on our last trip and I love it.
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:20.160]   And you know, I've moved to the Sony because I wanted a full frame sensor, but there is
[02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:22.960]   nothing that bests the Olympus UI.
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:29.120]   There's just so many good features and Sony even, you know, licensed their five axis image
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:30.120]   stabilization.
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:31.480]   It is killer.
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:34.720]   It was like, yeah, is everything I wanted this camera to be.
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:35.720]   Yeah.
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:37.960]   And yes, it does video as well.
[02:40:37.960 --> 02:40:40.400]   What camera doesn't these days, right?
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:41.400]   Yes.
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:45.560]   So this was your pick, Jason, so you can help me out on this one.
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:48.600]   Office for the Mac hasn't been updated since 2011.
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:49.680]   Yes, that's right.
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:53.600]   But now we've got Office for Mac 2016 preview and it's going to come out this summer.
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:57.520]   This the fall, the actual app will be out.
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:41:01.440]   They say in the second half of 2015, although I've heard some say as late as fall 2015.
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:02.440]   Interesting.
[02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:04.120]   But you can get the preview right now.
[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:06.720]   And if you want to download it for free, you can.
[02:41:06.720 --> 02:41:08.800]   You don't have to have an office account to use it.
[02:41:08.800 --> 02:41:09.920]   Not until it goes final.
[02:41:09.920 --> 02:41:13.880]   I did log into my office account and it will use that, which means you'll be able to save
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:15.480]   to one drive and things like that.
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:18.760]   It looks a lot like office on Windows, which I guess is the goal.
[02:41:18.760 --> 02:41:22.000]   It's got the color bar at the bottom that tells you what app you're using and it's got
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:23.760]   the tabbed interface at the top.
[02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:27.960]   Jason, you can show my screen because that would actually be the version.
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:28.960]   It looks so much nicer.
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:29.960]   There you go.
[02:41:29.960 --> 02:41:30.960]   There you go.
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:34.600]   It looks so much nicer than the existing version.
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:36.720]   The page is a little bit pokey.
[02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:39.600]   I'm hoping they'll speed it up as they get a closer.
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:43.640]   There's nothing worse than a word processor that actually doesn't keep up with your type
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:44.800]   in the process.
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:48.080]   Which I find that that is the case with Word for me.
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:51.640]   But it looks great and it's good to see it.
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:56.880]   If you minimize the tab ribbon by clicking on one of the tabs, it does start to look
[02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:03.080]   like you're running Windows because those tabs suddenly look like their Windows menus.
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:04.160]   But it looks good.
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:06.680]   These are the ribbon interface.
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:07.920]   You do that and suddenly it...
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:10.760]   If you click twice, it looks a little bit like you're using a Windows window with a
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:11.760]   menu bar in there.
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:12.760]   It does, doesn't it?
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:14.520]   What is all this stuff, the cruft up here?
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:15.520]   Yeah, there's an extra bonus.
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:18.760]   Well, that's very Yosemite, right, where you can collapse the toolbar up into that top
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:19.760]   level.
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:20.760]   Yeah.
[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:23.560]   So there's a floppy disk icon, classic, for saving.
[02:42:23.560 --> 02:42:24.560]   Right.
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:25.560]   Undo redo.
[02:42:25.560 --> 02:42:26.560]   Yeah.
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:32.360]   It looks really nice and it's nice to see Microsoft bring it up to date with the Mac.
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:34.480]   And there are a few new features here and there and all of them.
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.440]   Word's got a multi-user collaboration mode now that it didn't have and it supports threaded
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:43.640]   commenting which the Windows version does but the Mac version didn't.
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:46.720]   It also means that Microsoft is really bringing the Mac up to parity with what they're doing
[02:42:46.720 --> 02:42:52.080]   on Windows and iOS because the Office apps for iOS are actually really great.
[02:42:52.080 --> 02:42:57.280]   And so now the Mac versions will be sort of in the same generation of tool as the iOS
[02:42:57.280 --> 02:42:58.280]   version.
[02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:01.880]   So this is Word, this is Excel, it's PowerPoint.
[02:43:01.880 --> 02:43:02.880]   It's one.
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:06.600]   And then one note and outlook which we have already been out are a part of this install
[02:43:06.600 --> 02:43:07.600]   too.
[02:43:07.600 --> 02:43:08.600]   Right.
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:09.960]   Is there a big update to the outlookers at the same one we've had?
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:11.760]   It's the same one we know more or less.
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:16.520]   PowerPoint I think really benefits from the much more refined interface that is in Office
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:17.520]   twice.
[02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:19.920]   Like anybody I think who uses a Mac would want to use.
[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:24.440]   Well I always use it because when I was at IDG all of our corporate presentations were
[02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:25.440]   in PowerPoint.
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:27.440]   It's good to read about your life.
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:28.960]   So you make me some perspective on it.
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:33.000]   Number one reason to have PowerPoint is to download it so you can get a proper conversion
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:34.000]   to create.
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:35.000]   Right.
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:36.000]   Right.
[02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:37.000]   Yeah.
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:38.000]   That's so much better.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.640]   Which I have to say this new PowerPoint is not nearly as annoying.
[02:43:40.640 --> 02:43:42.440]   No it doesn't look so powerful.
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:43.440]   It looks a lot better.
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:44.440]   Yeah.
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:47.920]   It really I think is the app that has benefited the most from the facelift of the interface.
[02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:48.920]   It looks a lot better.
[02:43:48.920 --> 02:43:50.800]   And you know there's some neat stuff in Excel.
[02:43:50.800 --> 02:43:54.600]   Finally now if you click your cursor around in Excel it's actually animates the little
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:44:00.000]   selection thing flies across the screen which I find deeply disturbing but is what is how
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:01.000]   it works on Windows.
[02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:02.000]   Right.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:03.000]   So it's only right for it to work on the Mac.
[02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.760]   And there's some good new features that they've added.
[02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:10.360]   But you know being on the same generation of app on all the platforms is a good thing
[02:44:10.360 --> 02:44:12.760]   and the Mac is finally going to get there with this version.
[02:44:12.760 --> 02:44:13.760]   Yeah.
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:21.480]   And you know it's interesting because Satya Nadella the new CEO at Microsoft has very clearly
[02:44:21.480 --> 02:44:24.480]   pointed out that Microsoft wants to be wherever its users are.
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:27.480]   And you've seen that on the iPad with the office apps.
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:31.720]   In fact they came out on the iPad before they came out on the surface.
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:36.160]   But he also has said but we want the best experience of Microsoft products to always
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:37.800]   be on Windows.
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:40.680]   But I have to say this parody with Windows would be nice and they've always been kind
[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:41.680]   of out of sync.
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:42.680]   Yeah.
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:46.800]   Well in 2011 they did add the macro support back in which was kind of a big deal because
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:49.160]   it was gone in 2009.
[02:44:49.160 --> 02:44:53.640]   But this is this feels this feels the most current the Mac office has ever felt.
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:45:00.440]   Well and there is an opportunity here because Apple has stripped down its I work package.
[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:02.280]   Pages doesn't do as much as it used to do.
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:03.680]   Numbers doesn't do as much as it used to do.
[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:07.680]   So if you need a power tool and you're missing some of the features this might be the opportunity.
[02:45:07.680 --> 02:45:11.480]   And I know a lot of people don't like this idea of renting software like Adobe's Creative
[02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:12.480]   Cloud.
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:17.480]   But you know for a hundred dollars a year you get office and you get all of office.
[02:45:17.480 --> 02:45:18.480]   And that's pretty cool.
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:24.400]   I pay I get I get to have the office home office 365 home and so I said seven bucks a
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:27.680]   month I can't remember what it is but I get five installations.
[02:45:27.680 --> 02:45:28.680]   Yeah exactly.
[02:45:28.680 --> 02:45:30.000]   One of them or all of them could be Mac.
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:33.480]   So I've got on Windows I've got an iPad I've got on Apple.
[02:45:33.480 --> 02:45:34.480]   That's kind of nice.
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:35.480]   Yeah.
[02:45:35.480 --> 02:45:36.480]   Not that I ever use it.
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:37.480]   But if I worked for IDG.
[02:45:37.480 --> 02:45:40.360]   Yeah you'd have to be opening PowerPoint all the time.
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:41.360]   I use Excel.
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:42.640]   I like Excel a lot other than the charts.
[02:45:42.640 --> 02:45:46.360]   I use charts numbers for charts because numbers charts are beautiful.
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:47.360]   Pretty.
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:50.200]   But most of the things I will use Excel for although I use Google Sheets a lot more for
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:51.200]   that stuff now.
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:52.200]   Oh that's interesting.
[02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:55.720]   But if you want a power tool and I notice our finance department they want Excel.
[02:45:55.720 --> 02:45:56.720]   They want to install.
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:45:57.720]   Yeah.
[02:45:57.720 --> 02:46:02.520]   I had to install Excel on Lucis IMac 5K IMac.
[02:46:02.520 --> 02:46:06.320]   But because you know when you're doing finance this is the standard.
[02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:07.840]   And you mentioned the 5K IMac.
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:10.400]   All of the assets in Office are now retina.
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:12.440]   Which they weren't before because it was 2011.
[02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:14.800]   Who knew there was a retinomac in 2011.
[02:46:14.800 --> 02:46:17.160]   So yeah it looks great.
[02:46:17.160 --> 02:46:20.640]   The other thing that Microsoft has done which I think is really interesting with the Office
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:23.640]   subscription is unlimited storage in OneDrive.
[02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:24.920]   Not one terabyte.
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:29.480]   Apparently if you use a lot they like call you up and say are you sure and you say yes
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:30.480]   and they're like all right.
[02:46:30.480 --> 02:46:34.880]   Well if I go to my OneDrive because I'm a subscriber I see 10 terabytes is my limit.
[02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:38.760]   But I don't know how I would fill up 10 terabytes to begin with but I'm told that if you get
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:40.360]   to 10 they'll give you another 10.
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:41.360]   Yeah.
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:43.960]   So you're counting me on my one drive.
[02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:44.960]   You're kept to the way.
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:45.960]   Hey boy this is fun.
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:49.760]   I would like to go for another three hours but I don't know if anybody had listened.
[02:46:49.760 --> 02:46:52.560]   So let's just wrap this up right here.
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:53.800]   You guys are so great.
[02:46:53.800 --> 02:46:55.440]   It's so nice to have you in studio.
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:46:56.440]   This is so much fun.
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:46:58.280]   Come back anytime.
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:00.640]   You know your parents would love it if you're just.
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:02.720]   Oh I only get that every week.
[02:47:02.720 --> 02:47:03.720]   I'm just saying.
[02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:04.720]   I know.
[02:47:04.720 --> 02:47:05.720]   You can see my kids.
[02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:07.760]   It's ready to call.
[02:47:07.760 --> 02:47:10.280]   I'm more.com.
[02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:15.120]   And it's really I think one of the most fun people we have on the show and I'm so glad
[02:47:15.120 --> 02:47:16.120]   you came back.
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:17.360]   Thank you Leo.
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:18.360]   It's fun.
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:19.780]   This is my first time in the Twit Studio.
[02:47:19.780 --> 02:47:20.780]   So it's kind of lunch.
[02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:21.780]   We got lunch.
[02:47:21.780 --> 02:47:22.780]   So shiny.
[02:47:22.780 --> 02:47:23.780]   We got the other room.
[02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:24.780]   I think that I think we do.
[02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:26.520]   I hope I'm not promising something we don't have.
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:27.520]   I was promised lunch.
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:29.720]   Yes I saw lunch while you were reading about Squarespace.
[02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:31.900]   You see lunch came.
[02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:32.900]   Same for you.
[02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:33.900]   It's a Rene.
[02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:34.900]   Rene Richie.
[02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:35.900]   Rene Richie.
[02:47:35.900 --> 02:47:36.900]   Great to have you.
[02:47:36.900 --> 02:47:37.900]   Thank you so much.
[02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:39.860]   Yeah and I'm so glad you could give us a report from the demo room.
[02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:40.860]   Absolutely.
[02:47:40.860 --> 02:47:43.240]   That's nice to hear what it's like to actually touch this stuff.
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:45.240]   Alex Linden.
[02:47:45.240 --> 02:47:46.240]   Alex Linden is.
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:47.820]   What are you looking at?
[02:47:47.820 --> 02:47:49.340]   My eyes are up here.
[02:47:49.340 --> 02:47:51.660]   Alex Linden is in Rwanda.
[02:47:51.660 --> 02:47:52.820]   Kilgolly are you coming back?
[02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:54.820]   I thought you were coming back last week.
[02:47:54.820 --> 02:47:55.820]   I thought I was.
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:48:00.540]   Oh I'm going to be here and then I'm going to be in New York and then Pittsburgh and then
[02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:05.060]   then way back right before right near the end of the end of the month and right after
[02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:06.940]   this I'm going to play around with this meerkat.
[02:48:06.940 --> 02:48:08.860]   I'm going to walk around the studio in the school.
[02:48:08.860 --> 02:48:09.860]   Excellent.
[02:48:09.860 --> 02:48:12.940]   So another stream coming from Alex.
[02:48:12.940 --> 02:48:14.780]   Follow him at Alex.
[02:48:14.780 --> 02:48:15.780]   Aliex.
[02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:21.180]   L-I-N-D-S-A-Y like the former mayor of New York if that helps.
[02:48:21.180 --> 02:48:22.180]   Wow.
[02:48:22.180 --> 02:48:23.180]   Deep cut.
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:24.180]   Deep cut.
[02:48:24.180 --> 02:48:25.180]   Go Relation.
[02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:26.180]   Deep cut.
[02:48:26.180 --> 02:48:27.180]   Thank you Alex.
[02:48:27.180 --> 02:48:28.580]   Thank you Andy and Akko.
[02:48:28.580 --> 02:48:30.580]   It's a pleasure Chicago Sun times.
[02:48:30.580 --> 02:48:31.580]   Let's go for four hours.
[02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:32.580]   Let's go for five.
[02:48:32.580 --> 02:48:33.580]   I'm so tempted.
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:35.500]   I do not want to stop.
[02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:37.940]   This is so much fun.
[02:48:37.940 --> 02:48:38.940]   Always a pleasure.
[02:48:38.940 --> 02:48:42.460]   What are you working on for the Sun times today?
[02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:44.260]   Part one just went up this afternoon.
[02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:47.500]   Part two will be up of Andy's event is going to be up on Wednesday.
[02:48:47.500 --> 02:48:52.340]   On Thursday it's a nice piece on everything that I learned about from wearing the Amoto
[02:48:52.340 --> 02:48:53.340]   360 for six months.
[02:48:53.340 --> 02:48:57.340]   I think they'll be very helpful for people who are considering buying an Apple Watch.
[02:48:57.340 --> 02:49:01.340]   Well it's so great to have you two Andy and I'm sorry that you didn't come out for the
[02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:03.580]   event but maybe the next one.
[02:49:03.580 --> 02:49:04.580]   Maybe the next one.
[02:49:04.580 --> 02:49:06.940]   And hey it makes up for that.
[02:49:06.940 --> 02:49:09.900]   I can't think of any other group of people that I could spend three hours talking about
[02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:10.900]   this stuff with.
[02:49:10.900 --> 02:49:11.900]   What do you guys do?
[02:49:11.900 --> 02:49:12.900]   It went by like that.
[02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:13.900]   Like that.
[02:49:13.900 --> 02:49:16.700]   Jason Stell always a pleasure.
[02:49:16.700 --> 02:49:17.860]   Great to have you as well.
[02:49:17.860 --> 02:49:18.860]   He's just down the road.
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:19.860]   I'm just down the road.
[02:49:19.860 --> 02:49:20.860]   I'm just down the road.
[02:49:20.860 --> 02:49:21.860]   I expect to see more of you.
[02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:22.860]   I hope.
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:23.860]   See you later.
[02:49:23.860 --> 02:49:24.860]   I love having you as to you.
[02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:25.860]   He's going well at six dollars.
[02:49:25.860 --> 02:49:26.860]   Yeah.
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:27.860]   And I love it.
[02:49:27.860 --> 02:49:28.860]   It's just going right by.
[02:49:28.860 --> 02:49:31.820]   That Apple invited you to the event that shows you still have the respect.
[02:49:31.820 --> 02:49:36.740]   I appreciate their invite and I hope to get reviewing on the MacBook and the Apple Watch
[02:49:36.740 --> 02:49:38.100]   at some point too.
[02:49:38.100 --> 02:49:41.180]   Well, you know we will be but we buy them.
[02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:42.180]   Yes.
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:44.380]   If you can't get one on loan come up here.
[02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:45.940]   We'll work something out.
[02:49:45.940 --> 02:49:46.940]   All right.
[02:49:46.940 --> 02:49:47.940]   Hey thanks for joining us everybody.
[02:49:47.940 --> 02:49:50.180]   Thanks for a very long Mac break weekly.
[02:49:50.180 --> 02:49:51.180]   If you're still listening.
[02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:52.180]   You can break it up.
[02:49:52.180 --> 02:49:53.180]   You can break it up.
[02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:54.180]   Then we break it up.
[02:49:54.180 --> 02:49:55.180]   Yeah.
[02:49:55.180 --> 02:49:56.180]   Easy.
[02:49:56.180 --> 02:49:58.220]   I don't think we've ever gone that long.
[02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:00.220]   But you know I felt like nothing.
[02:50:00.220 --> 02:50:01.220]   Thank you so long.
[02:50:01.220 --> 02:50:02.380]   So much for being here everybody.
[02:50:02.380 --> 02:50:05.300]   We do Mac break weekly at 11 a.m. Pacific.
[02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:06.620]   That's 2 p.m. eastern time.
[02:50:06.620 --> 02:50:08.420]   1800 UTC.
[02:50:08.420 --> 02:50:09.620]   We are now in summertime.
[02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:14.140]   So for those of you who come into summertime a little later.
[02:50:14.140 --> 02:50:17.380]   Note that is a little bit of a time change for you at least for a few weeks.
[02:50:17.380 --> 02:50:21.380]   1800 UTC.
[02:50:21.380 --> 02:50:24.460]   If you can't figure it out out of watch life don't worry.
[02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:26.660]   All three hours will be posted on demand.
[02:50:26.660 --> 02:50:31.140]   It's with that TV slash MBW or wherever you get your podcasts like iTunes.
[02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:33.460]   And of course I have to point out we've got great apps.
[02:50:33.460 --> 02:50:34.660]   We didn't do them.
[02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:39.460]   But our wonderful third party developers have done apps on iOS, Android, Windows, Phone,
[02:50:39.460 --> 02:50:40.460]   Roku.
[02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:44.060]   And we're grateful to them and I encourage you to get one of those apps because that
[02:50:44.060 --> 02:50:47.900]   means that you know you'll never miss another Mac break weekly.
[02:50:47.900 --> 02:50:49.900]   I want to thank also the folks in the chat room.
[02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:50.940]   We don't thank them enough.
[02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:51.940]   They're great.
[02:50:51.940 --> 02:50:53.380]   We participate with them.
[02:50:53.380 --> 02:50:56.780]   We have risk dialogues with them.
[02:50:56.780 --> 02:50:58.340]   Sometimes we yell at each other at chat room.
[02:50:58.340 --> 02:51:00.300]   I know I do that but you guys are great.
[02:51:00.300 --> 02:51:02.220]   You're a big part of what we do.
[02:51:02.220 --> 02:51:05.620]   And I should point out although we provide the server the chat room really is a community
[02:51:05.620 --> 02:51:06.620]   effort.
[02:51:06.620 --> 02:51:08.900]   It's policed and moderated by the community.
[02:51:08.900 --> 02:51:14.420]   Those are all volunteers in there and your presence each and every day is always appreciated.
[02:51:14.420 --> 02:51:17.660]   So thank you IRC.twit.tv if you'd like to be in there.
[02:51:17.660 --> 02:51:18.660]   Thanks for being here.
[02:51:18.660 --> 02:51:21.460]   Now I don't know what you're going to tell the boss.
[02:51:21.460 --> 02:51:22.900]   That have to work.
[02:51:22.900 --> 02:51:23.980]   His break time is over.
[02:51:24.100 --> 02:51:34.580]   [MUSIC]
