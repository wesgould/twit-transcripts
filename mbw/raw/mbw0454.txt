[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.040]   Of course, Andy Inaco, our regular in-house from the Chicago Sun times in the celestial
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040]   waste of bandwidth.com.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.200]   Andrew?
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.840]   I'm hungry and I don't really know why.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   I can't imagine.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.040]   At a big breakfast at two slices of cold leftover pizza not 45 minutes ago and suddenly I want
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.040]   a snack.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.360]   We're far flat out of a paper bag.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.120]   We got some artisanal snacks.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.680]   I guess you saw this on Shark Tank.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.400]   Micro Pop Mini Popcorn.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   That's artisanal.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.080]   The world's smallest popcorn like that.
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.480]   It's like a little mini mouse or mini mouse.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.600]   Did they get funded on Shark Tank?
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   I believe they did.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   I can't remember which shark backed them.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.280]   That's not Mark Cuban for sure.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.680]   Hey, look who else is here, Adam Anxt from Tidbits, the longest running Mac publication
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680]   ever in history.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680]   Nice to be here, Leo.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680]   And you will never be eclipsed.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.480]   Pretty much a guarantee.
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.640]   Not unless someone gets that time machine thing doing something other than backup.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.080]   Adam, you're standing up, aren't you?
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   I am.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.880]   I do work at a standing desk.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.240]   Your feet don't get tired?
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.480]   No, no, that's not the problem.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.720]   Actually, if anything, my back gets tired sometimes.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.440]   But I have, let me show you a show until I have this thing called a "varier stool."
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.360]   Wow, that's bad.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.440]   That's not standing if you sit on a stool.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.480]   It's a, well, you don't sit on it.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.480]   You sort of lean on it.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.680]   It's around, so I can just kind of perch a little bit here.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.160]   It's like Judy Garland and the Wizard of Oz when she was tired to put her on a leaning
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.760]   board because she couldn't sit down in her.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.560]   Whatever.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.560]   And you know what?
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.560]   We got a newbie.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.080]   Everybody got to be nice.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   Let's behave here.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   Susie Oakes is here.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.680]   She's executive editor at Macworld.com.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.360]   Speaking to us from her own professional Macworld.com studio, nice to see you, Susie.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   Thanks.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.720]   Nice to be here.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.440]   It's just a little tip.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.280]   Jump right in.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.720]   If you have anything to say, don't be polite.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.920]   Okay, I'll try.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.440]   Just jump right in.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.440]   Try not to be polite.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.600]   This is the last place to be polite.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.320]   How many, you know, to work was so funny.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.400]   He was saying, there's a new, there's a new fascist salute.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.840]   Apple Watch.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.600]   And yeah, see?
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.600]   Yep.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   The Apple Watchers.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   Yep.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   Yep.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   We're all doing it.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   That's a Model 360.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   Wow.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   Wow.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   Wow.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   Wow.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   Wow.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   What do you mean, wah, wah, wah.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   I love the faces.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.840]   Oh, shut up.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.480]   And it has, you know, oh, shut up.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.080]   I can customize the watch face.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.760]   Any way Apple wants me to.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.640]   Any color you want as long as it's black, with Mickey.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.120]   I think, go ahead.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.580]   I'm kind of waiting for WWDC.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.120]   I hope that somebody has the forethought to make T-shirts, establishing that the official,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.760]   like, colors of Apple developers now are powder blue and sort of a grayish metal, because
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.520]   every time I'm talking to a developer, they have like the one kind of Apple Watch that
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.160]   was available in an expedited purchase mode to developers.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.880]   And they're all like powder blue band and brush that a little.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.800]   Hey, that's why I like yours.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.800]   And you're a runner, Adam.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.160]   So how's it working out for you as a runner?
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.400]   Oh, well, I mean, come on, don't get to get real.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.720]   It's not in the slightest bit worthwhile for running.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   Oh.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.320]   I think Johnny's going to be a little disappointed to hear you say that.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   Well, is he up?
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   Does he run?
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   So, okay.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.680]   So there's two ways you can use it.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.120]   And I'll give them credit for this.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.760]   You can use it when it's attached to your iPhone.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.920]   So you carry your iPhone when you run.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   This is annoying.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.080]   iPhones, particularly say an iPhone 6 Plus attached it to your arm.
[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.520]   You look like Christy Turlington Burns.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.400]   She could take off with that thing on her arm.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.640]   They're just, they're big, they're heavy, they're annoying.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.120]   So you don't have to carry an iPhone with you when you run, because the Apple Watch has
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.280]   an accelerometer in it and it can tell when each, when you take a stride.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.040]   And if you run with it some with your iPhone, it calibrates your stride length.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.840]   Somebody told me that on Twitter, which is interesting because I've been using an treadmill.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.960]   So I'm not going anywhere.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.560]   And so it's been wildly inaccurate measuring calories and steps compared to what the treadmill
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   is saying.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.680]   But somebody said, no, you need to go out and run in the, and outside.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.040]   So the GPS can adjust for your, it adjusts for your stride.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.480]   Yeah, adjust to your stride.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   Because you think about it.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.920]   Every time you take a step, there's a shock and you move your arm.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   There's a shock.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.920]   So it knows how many steps.
[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.720]   It just doesn't know how far I went.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.720]   Precisely.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.080]   And so, so once it calibrates, it's actually not too bad.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:53.480]   And however, it's not too bad as long as you always run at the same pace on a flat surface,
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.320]   because as soon as you start going uphill or downhill, your stride length changes.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.560]   As soon as you start going different paces, your stride length changes and then it gets
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   less accurate.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.480]   I realize I just confused the hell out of my Apple watch.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.520]   I came in on a segue today.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.760]   So it says you just went 2.2 miles and took three steps.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.480]   You must have the stride of a giant, my friend.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.760]   So it's, yeah, it's, it's really, it's, it's interesting.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.040]   I mean, I've been, I've been enjoying playing with it.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:28.960]   It's really one of those things where I'm, I'm having, I'm having to really think about
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.920]   what other people might do in terms of fitness related activities to figure out if it's going
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.080]   to be useful at all.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.800]   I mean, calories is the other thing.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.800]   It's very big on calories.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.080]   It wants to tell you how many calories you're burning.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.720]   But it doesn't really know, does it?
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.920]   Well, let's, let's assume for the purposes of argument, I don't know.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.480]   You see that video that Apple did with where they had people hooked up to oxygen, gas,
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.480]   and all that?
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.080]   I assume that it's actually pretty good at, at calculating that.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.400]   Although I'm dubious about that because how fit you are determines how many calories you
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.720]   burn for the same exercise.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.360]   I burn any fewer than someone who doesn't run at all.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.160]   Do they ask, do they ask your age, your weight?
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.160]   Yes.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.160]   They do.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.600]   Age, weight, and height, age, weight, height, and gender.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   Okay.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   So it does set it, at least set itself up that way.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.480]   And, but here's the thing.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.360]   What difference does it make?
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.280]   So I, I, I went for a run today.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.280]   According to the Apple Watch.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   And it's about 567 calories.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.480]   What does that mean?
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480]   Right.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:31.040]   And, and before people say, well, that means you could eat 567 more calories.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   I don't think that has any meaning either because how many calories are in different
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.480]   macronutrients, protein, fat, and carbohydrates, you, you don't process them 100%.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   So if you eat 2,000 calories of Hagan does, that doesn't mean you can't process 2,000
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.480]   calories.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.480]   Well, but that's true of anything.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.760]   That's not an Apple Watch issue.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.120]   Oh, not at all.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:57.000]   But it's more that the Apple Watch is focusing on calories as this primary measurement without
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.840]   any, I can't, I mean, I don't want to say any science mindics.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   I'm sure there's some science minded, but I'm trying to figure out what the, what the
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.560]   takeaway is for someone.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.360]   I mean, all I can really come up with is more calories is better.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.320]   You know, if you burn more calories, that's good.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.840]   But it's not something you can plan on.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.080]   You know, it's like, well, if I burn 300 calories, that's going to make some difference
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.120]   as opposed to if I burn 250 calories.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.280]   So I rode yesterday and I, it says I went, I rode for half an hour indoor rowing and it
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.480]   says 319 calories, which is, you know, it's like if you looked it up in a book, you'd
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.120]   see that that, you know, oh, you know, although that's like a lot for half an hour actually.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   I don't know if I got.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.620]   But, but, but, but, you know, I had a, I had a, it was a package of M&Ms I had on the
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.280]   plane the other day that claimed it was 250 calories.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.280]   Right.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.880]   All like, so is there a connection there?
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.640]   No, I don't think there's a connection there.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:46.640]   So, right.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.880]   So why are we bothering with this measurement at all then?
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   Right.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880]   So, A, that's-
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.640]   So you disconnect from the other fitness bands, which are all steps, they say, 10,000 steps
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.280]   and just takes 10,000 steps and you're on the road to health and-
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   So we should mention that-
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.600]   We should mention that the goals here and steps, you can always set the goals and calories.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.400]   But it's kind of, it's, it's at least viable in that.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.520]   I'm thinking of the line from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy where the actual book,
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.320]   The Hitchhiker's Guide, where it's inaccurate, at least it's definitively inaccurate.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   So, so-
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   It's so unenacted.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   So definitive and consistent.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.520]   Like even if, even if the, even if your bathroom scale is off by like four and a half pounds,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.200]   it will still tell you that you're heavier today than the day before.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.920]   And so if it's, if it's at least inconsistently, if it's at least consistently inconsistent
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:35.980]   by saying that I'm, I'm, I'm low-balling you in your number of steps by consistent
[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.400]   factor every single day, it'll still help me understand how much I'm moving or not moving
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.280]   on a day to day and then a week, by week day.
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:45.840]   I want to, it's when you, it's when you get the, it's when you get accumulation of data,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.360]   these things really be, really pay off.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.760]   I want to point out for people who are new to the watch that there are actually, with
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.120]   the watch come two different fitness applications.
[00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:59.240]   The calorie measurement and things like measuring your, your, your distance running and stuff
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.720]   is the workout app, which you actually have to launch.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:06.440]   If you launch it, and actually I will note that it's also very hard to see in the sunlight.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.440]   And you have a choice.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.560]   You can set a goal for net calories, as you say, calories, set time, set miles, or what
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.280]   I always do is open.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.120]   And when you press start, it goes beep, beep.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.120]   And now I'm running.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.680]   And here's the other thing you run.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.920]   And the other thing that's cool is it pings you every mile, which is kind of neat, right?
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920]   Standard, standard at all running watches.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.920]   Oh, it is though.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.920]   Never mind.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.200]   The, the, the other thing that's annoying actually is is that you can't see all your
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   metrics on one screen.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   Right.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.080]   So if you're running, you want to see your distance, your time, and your pace.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.640]   I mean, you don't want to see calories because calories completely irrelevant to running,
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.600]   but you know, beats per minute, your height rate possibly, but you can't customize those
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.760]   screens.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.800]   So you can choose a little bit of what shows you can get, you can get, sometimes you can
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.040]   get two of them showing.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.520]   You can get, I think, a laps time and one of the others, more possibly a laps distance
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.800]   in one of the others.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.080]   But again, it's, you know, for what you might want to see, you actually have to like interact
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.440]   with it while you're running, which is just kind of difficult.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.720]   And of course you have to interact with the touchscreen.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.640]   Most running watches, you just, you can just, you know, reach over and press a button without
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.880]   looking at it.
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.800]   So you don't have to be trying to, you know, manage the little touchscreen interface.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.240]   So what you're saying is this does not compare with dedicated running runners watches, like
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.200]   the new Garmin, which just came out, which does heart rate built into the watch.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   Not in the slightest.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.520]   I run with a Garmin 620.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:39.000]   I just got a Garmin Vivo active and they, they just work way, way better, aside from the
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.080]   fact that they have the GPS chip built in so that they can actually track where you are.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.160]   And they're uploading to things like Garmin Connect and Stravo so that you can do all
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.040]   the social aspects and, and web tracking of what you want.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.200]   One thing that people may not realize when you do a workout, you can see the details
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.440]   of your workout right afterwards and you can save it.
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.600]   But once you've saved it, you can't see the details on the Apple Watch anymore.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.840]   You have to go to the activity app on the iPhone to be able to find out what you did
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   in the past.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.920]   Now, that's the other app and that's one, I don't know, I'm going to say, I'm not a
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.920]   runner.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.000]   So the workout app, you know, for me, it's just like keeping track of my workout.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.680]   But the activity is those, is that circle, circle thing.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.360]   And you, and you have a glance for that.
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.640]   And that's the one that says, stand up every hour.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.960]   Unless it's, it tells me to stand up every hour, even though I'm at a standing desk.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.280]   So this is the thing that's weird.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:33.720]   It doesn't count the fact that you're doing something as having done anything.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.320]   And so it just does it every hour.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.000]   It says time to stand up.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   So here's the thing.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.440]   I've been looking into this because I'm trying to figure out what those rings mean.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.600]   There's move, stay, exercise and stand.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.160]   And so the stand is just, you have to have stood for a minute in the last hour, but I
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.760]   think it does check whether you've changed.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.800]   So if you've just been standing for an hour or a second.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:55.800]   No.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   Exercise.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.160]   Um, is heart rate probably right?
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   Tight heart rate.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.760]   Yeah, it seems to be related to, to say, I'm like in between the difference in exercise
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.760]   and move.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.400]   Um, one of them is, is what Apple calls a brisk activity, but they don't say what that
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   means.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   That's exercise.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.600]   And, and so again, I don't know what that means.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.360]   That, you know, is like, if you're walking around, but your heart rate goes above some number,
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.520]   that counts as brisk exercise.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.280]   I, I have been, I have burned 81 of 500, my goal of 500 calories for the day in the
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.920]   move section, although I have not had any brisk exercise.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.480]   And in fact, that's what it says.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.880]   Zero of 30 minutes in exercise.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.920]   And all of those, if you swipe up, you'll see a graph with more stats.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.320]   Pre previous, uh, well, it's, you know, it's just a different display of the same thing.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.320]   Right.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.320]   Right.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.320]   Here you go.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   What time, uh, you know, hour by hour, basically.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.280]   So you could, I mean, this is, it has more cool factor probably than any, any real health
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.280]   benefit.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.360]   What you figure out is what's the goal?
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:59.640]   You know, let's say you want to be, you know, improving your health in some way.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.160]   Will this help?
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.080]   And that's what I want to, I'm trying to suss out.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.080]   It will for me.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:07.080]   See, you're a trained professional.
[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.160]   You run cause you, you're a runner.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.200]   I am not, I am a sitter.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.520]   So for me, um, anything, and this, I, but I had the same experience with a jawbone up
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.400]   and the Fitbit and everything else, anything that kind of says, you know, oh, your goal
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:29.520]   is 10,000 steps and you've got 8,000, I'm more likely to take the stairs or to walk a
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.760]   park farther away and walk.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.960]   It incensed me to try to make the goal.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.280]   And I think that's valuable.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:38.000]   It's not going to be valuable for you, Adam, cause you're, you're trying to do something
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   else.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   I don't know what it is.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Run away.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.280]   For Adam is a step down from what he normally uses, but for a lot of people, it's a step
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.880]   up from what we normally use, which is nothing.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.520]   So, but the problem I've had, I want to know what the heart rate threshold is because I
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.920]   have a Fit bike at home.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.760]   It's a, it's, I got it on Amazon Fitbike 2.0.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.360]   So it's a little stationary bike with a desk attached.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:04.440]   So I can sit there and do my work and get some pedaling in, or I can just put my iPad
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.120]   there and watch a movie and do like a real workout.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.640]   But if I'm working and pedaling, it's, I'm not, it's not very vigorous.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.480]   I'm just kind of, you know, I'm still moving.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.320]   So it's more like a standing desk than, you know, like a treadmill desk.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.640]   But yeah, so I clocked 40 minutes on there with the workout app just to kind of test
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.320]   it out, but I was sort of dogging it for the first 15 minutes and that didn't count as
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.320]   exercise minutes.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.840]   My exercise minutes weren't the same as my time spent in the workout app.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:34.400]   So yeah, there is a threshold there where if you're not working hard enough, that got
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:39.280]   credited to my move ring and the activity app, but not the exercise ring.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.800]   And yeah, and I took a road trip to speaking and I guess a stand thing and I was like,
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.600]   just a little chair dancing in the car and it's like, great.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.600]   So all you have to do to stand is go like this.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.600]   You're all right.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   Great.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.560]   So sometimes when it tells me to stand, I use that as an opportunity to go over to the
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.840]   fridge and get a snack.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:04.000]   So not exactly the intended use, but you know, at least I stood, I guess.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.800]   So Susie, I think you could probably hack the exercise thing, but when you get on your
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.320]   fit bike, just pedal really hard for say 20 seconds.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.120]   Get your heart rate up and boom, you're good for a while.
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.120]   Right.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.800]   This is the problem.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:24.000]   It's like every time you hand us a game, there's always, you'll play the game and enjoy
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   it.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Then you find out how to fix and rig the game.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.600]   We've got our own version of deflate gate happening every second with the watch, where
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:36.760]   I really, but I really do think that the most valuable thing that the fitness watches, no
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.280]   matter what they are, can do is simply expose data that is normally invisible to us.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:47.160]   The latest thing that I've been sort of paying attention to with the experimenting with the
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.000]   Microsoft band is like sleep time.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.080]   That's actually, it's very, very easy to, you wake up and the watch says, oh, are you
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.320]   up now and press a button?
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:58.760]   We'll just, you know, we'll, we'll, we'll log you in as being awake as opposed to a sleep
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.800]   that I've been watching for the past X hours and you get your score for sleeping.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:08.520]   And it's like after a week or two, I've been wearing this now for about two or three weeks.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.080]   And like, wow, I really don't get enough sleep.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.200]   It's like, I'm aware of all the times that I've been up until two or three in the morning
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.000]   working and then I, you know, I don't have an appointment in the morning.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.760]   So I'll just sleep until whenever.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.240]   And I think that I'm still getting like six or seven or eight hours was like, okay, got
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.200]   three hours that night and then four hours the next night slept in and got four hours
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.440]   the next day.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.920]   Okay, new rule.
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.120]   We were in bed at midnight and we don't get out of bed until eight for the foreseeable future.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:39.040]   Yeah, I just wouldn't, I wouldn't have figured out unless I had numbers saying here is how
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.640]   many hours we think you slept.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.280]   You wouldn't, you didn't figure this out on your own with a basic clock.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.280]   I mean, come on.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.560]   You know, when you go to bed, you know, when you get up, it's not that hard.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.000]   No, I need to go over that.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.160]   It was a bed last night.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.920]   And when you got up this morning, but if I asked you when you went to bed like four
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.640]   days ago, you'd probably have no idea.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   Exactly.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.280]   So I can, I can tell that I was really tired.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.680]   I can tell that I'm, I'm really tired because there was something I needed to finish last night.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.960]   So I'm, I'm on about four hours of sleep right now.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.880]   And normally the way I correct that is saying, okay, well, I'm sure we go to bed nice and
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.680]   early tonight and then we sleep in tomorrow, the next day, but you don't really look at,
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.920]   here's how many times you've been pulling that kind of crap on yourself.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.520]   And it's the sort of thing that says here is a deficiency, not just in how things went
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.460]   Monday night, but here is your deficiency and your whole attitude towards sleep.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.000]   That means that you need to need to apply a new mission rule that says that there is
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.280]   no being, there is no being out of bed and in the office after midnight at midnight,
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.920]   you are in bed and not, not only are you in bed, but the lights are off, the screens
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.080]   are off the laptop is closed.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.000]   You have to make sleeping a priority.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.840]   Now fortunately sleeping is a lot easier and a lot less problem.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.240]   My body than walking six miles a day.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.640]   I think I can handle sleeping 68 hours a day.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.760]   So it was like, you're saying we're taking a nap right now, Andy?
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.640]   If it was a big mistake right now, I think I threw them right now.
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.040]   Not on each angle, one on the free wrist and just one free wrist for the Moto 360 and
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.440]   that'll be good for me.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.600]   I'm testing the jawbone up to right now and I'm using it as a sleep tracker because unlike
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.280]   the Apple Watch, it lasts a week on a charge and part of that is because they want you
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:11.480]   to use it to track the sleep.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.080]   And yeah, I pulled an all-nighter last Thursday to write something big that I really wanted
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.800]   to get up on Friday.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:23.040]   And yeah, it's, it suggests it says, okay, you've been averaging three and a half hours
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.040]   this whole week.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.600]   You have not been sleeping well.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.680]   And it suggested to me.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.920]   So Friday, I don't sleep during the week and then Friday I go to bed.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.400]   As soon as my son isn't bad, I go to sleep at nine o'clock and I kind of try to catch
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   up.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400]   It's not a good habit.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.280]   Sleep when your children sleep.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.280]   That's the rule.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.280]   Yes, that's the rule.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.280]   Unless you have teenagers.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.200]   Yeah, if you have teenagers to the opposite.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.760]   I really, I really do think that me.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.480]   Yeah, Jumbo has something they call the smart coach.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:50.080]   And so on Friday, it was trying to just nudge me back down.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.120]   It didn't know about my like, like, happy habit.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.240]   So it was like, how about tonight you try to get in bed by 1 a.m.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:00.160]   Because that would be a huge improvement over what I was doing all that night.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.560]   And I said, Oh, Jumbo, and I'm going to bed at 8 30.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   So you don't worry.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.360]   But yeah, Jumbo and you said you've been full of work too hard.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.680]   The smart coach is kind of cool.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.320]   I like that feature, how it looks at your patterns.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.520]   And then it says, okay, compared to other Jumbo and users that are your age, that are
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.560]   your gender, you're doing better or worse.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.800]   It gives you some of the science.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.440]   It says, you know, on days that you don't sleep, you're going to be tired the next day,
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.360]   but it gives you better insights than that.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.520]   Once again, the knowledge of how the human brain works, that that's sort of the dish
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.480]   I work in sleeping more than me.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.480]   Screw him.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   Nobody sleeps more than I do.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:37.240]   I'm going to sleep 12 hours tomorrow just to speed him and grind his butt.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   I love sleep.
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.240]   That's where I'm a Viking.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.240]   So it's been really helpful.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.800]   I read somewhere that if for every, what is it?
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.960]   For every hour of every hour every time in some of some amount of sleep that you lose
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.320]   at night, you will spend 8.4 minutes that more the next day browsing the web.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.120]   And aimlessly, just wasting time.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.600]   Because your focus will be gone.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.600]   Just not all there.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.760]   In my daily called it wool gathering.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.200]   There's very nice about kitty pictures.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.200]   There's cheap I get to more.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   I gather captions.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.000]   But yeah, I mean, you're you're you're writing that I think I think that it's interesting
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.880]   when like tech reviewers are writing about this stuff because it's mostly about most
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.520]   of the pieces going to be, oh my God, I didn't realize I'm sleeping so poorly.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.640]   But as soon as I finish this review of the new job on I'm going right to bed.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.680]   But yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   That's one of the nicest things about the Microsoft app that it does after it's collected a certain
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.680]   amount of data.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.960]   It says, okay, here are some things we seem to have figured out that we're just going
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.360]   to put this in front of you.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.960]   It basically does the intervention like Andy or we're all the place of peace and peace
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   and safety.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.600]   You know, we don't want you to actually tap any buttons.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.080]   We just want you to look at this data as we go as all of our sensors go around the room
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.200]   and say about talk about how watching your inactivity has affected us.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.840]   So is it safe to say that the Apple Watch is not a good choice?
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:02.120]   If you're choosing it just for exercise sleep monitoring health purposes, well, you can't
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.840]   use it for sleep monitoring at all.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.760]   Obviously it's a bad choice for that.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:11.880]   But yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it really is not if that's your goal, you really should
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.000]   get a device that does those things very significantly dedicated devices that do much better.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.400]   They're cheaper and they're more capable.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.040]   That said, the Apple Watch does some things which are really, really cool.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.360]   We're going to get to be the reasons why you're buying it.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.160]   Maybe you know, I get achievements.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.200]   They're stupid, but I get a cheap where can I go back and get them or do they do the activity
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.200]   app?
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.800]   The activity app will have my achievements.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.560]   No, the actually activity app on the iPhone.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.760]   Oh, there's an app.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.760]   Wow.
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.760]   I don't.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.760]   Let's go to.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.280]   You're going to set up your iPhone and puts the activity app on that.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.280]   Oh, I get.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.440]   Oh, so there's your rings.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.400]   It's got to look at all my achievements.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   I got a red button.
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.120]   Yeah, see, that's why they're kind of inscrutable.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.680]   And I got, well, but I got a green button.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:04.120]   So Apple has a video where they explain several of the achievements.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.120]   I don't know.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.080]   Most of the rest of them that are just, I said, I look at them.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.440]   I just don't know what they mean.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.040]   Is it like, does this mean I'm on star patrol or what?
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.240]   Walking workouts, so you get stars just for the first thing you do.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.240]   This is kind of cool.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.240]   You get a calendar.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   Hey, thank you.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.400]   I didn't know there was an app on here.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.400]   I don't know where Apple put it.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.400]   It's a social component.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.240]   A lot of the fitness things let you get against your friends.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.160]   And that's just totally absent from here.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.960]   So maybe that's coming later.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.160]   This doesn't seem to have much of anything in it, really.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.040]   It's just the, I actually think that it won't be coming later because you think about what
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.320]   Apple's done.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.280]   They really are all about, you know, I mean mine.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.840]   You know, it's sync between your devices, not sharing with other people.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:41.840]   They don't do social.
[00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.400]   They don't do sharing, that kind of thing.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.680]   So I'd be really surprised if they would, you know, push this in a big way.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.280]   I mean, maybe they'll get, you know, you can share a workout to Facebook or something
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.920]   like that via the share sheets.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:25:00.720]   But if it's not there now, it just seems odd that they wouldn't have had it at the
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   starboard.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   Well, they were so gung-ho on like game center challenges and game center leaderboards.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   It's kind of gamified.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:10.200]   We should gamify the fitness a little bit and just have you like challenge your friend.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.640]   Like I can burn more calories than you can this week and winter buys snacks.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.440]   Do people still use game center?
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.440]   No.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.440]   No.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:22.040]   I have a, they wrote it when they removed the green felt table club.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   I have.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.640]   It's, it's, it's interesting to think about how it's been well publicized.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.480]   All the fitness experts that Apple hired in and all the medical people they hired into
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.800]   beef up the health aspects of Apple devices, including the watch.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:39.320]   I'm just, I'm really curious to know how many absolute civilians they brought in to really
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.360]   give that sort of reality check saying that, yeah, I know that you think these charts
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.360]   are fascinating.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.400]   I apps, you're, you're talking to a person who will walk a mile, who will take a car
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.760]   a mile to go to the library instead of walking.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:54.720]   You're not going to get me to look through, be impressed by my progress through graphs
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.360]   and charts and little stars after launch an app in order to get.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.200]   So this stuff goes into, all right.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.000]   So this is good to know which I didn't know.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.520]   And apparently when it installed this, it just automatically stuck it into the folder
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.920]   that I already had called health, which is where health kit was.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.920]   So must have known.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.680]   And the other one, which one?
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   And that's totally inscrutable, totally inscrutable.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.400]   I mean, if you go in, I mean, half the time you look at those things and you say show
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.880]   all data and it just, it just dies.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.440]   I mean, it can't even do it.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:29.360]   But the, the, the axes on that, on that graph are almost impossible to figure out most
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.360]   of the time.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.360]   Yeah, it is just what is this?
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:38.360]   All recorded data.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.520]   Oh, I guess I could get my heart rate for a, yeah, no, I guess.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.960]   My favorite analogy for the health app is that it's kind of like your medical chart
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.920]   where like they have to show it to you.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   Like it's your data.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.040]   It would be really awful if they were like, you can't see your own chart.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.680]   But then when you look at your medical chart, like it's a medical chart.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   It's a medical.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   I do what it says.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:56.480]   Here's the, here's the sleep analysis I got.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.480]   No data.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.160]   I guess if I had another, if I tied it into the jawbone or some other device, I would.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.760]   So I think this is an opportunity for Siri though.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.760]   Siri can do so many great things.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.480]   If it's been, if it's thought of as something more than a hands-free device, imagine that
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   if you, if yes, all the state is there, but it's like, Hey, hey, just in case people
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.720]   have that, that feature turned on, I'll say, Hey, slow mo, how's my health doing?
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.920]   And it will just simply say you, you over the past three days, you achieved your, your,
[00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:26.920]   your walking goals.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.480]   However, you haven't been getting up enough.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.320]   And I wish you would, and it looks like you should, you should get some more sleep and
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.520]   just put into one sentence, the way that really good weather apps that will give you
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.760]   the charts, they'll give you the brommars, they'll give you the weather maps.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.480]   But the thing, the thing, the thing you zip right to is tell me in two sentences what
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.840]   the weather is going to be like tomorrow.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.840]   And it's always, it's going to be cold tomorrow.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.600]   It's going to warm up into the seventies or eighties and you, and there might be some
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   rain at four o'clock.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:54.320]   By the way, I think we are now from now on officially dubbing S.I.R.I.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   Shlomo.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:02.280]   So from now on, if anybody has to say the S word, just say, shlomo, I've been doing it
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.960]   for ever since ever since getting like no fewer than like seven, like the sort of like
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.680]   test the email saying, yeah, your last podcast.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.800]   Here's what happened when you said that for 10 minutes.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   So it's a slow.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   You know what the funniest thing is?
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.160]   First of all, in order for that to do that, you have to have that feature turned on that
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.560]   when your iPhone is plugged in, it's listening.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.880]   And I'm surprised the number of people who have it turned on because I got to tell you, my
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.000]   phone is waking up all the time.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.280]   You a lot of people listen at their desks and they've got it plugged into a charger.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:35.760]   But when the TV's on, all they have to say is in Syria today, what?
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.760]   Yes.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.760]   I don't know what you just said.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760]   It's a hurry.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.040]   Someone was telling me that he actually had his phone in his watch talking to each other.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.040]   Mm hmm.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.400]   You know, that, you know, the phone said something.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.960]   The watch thought it said, hey, Siri, and then the phone thought the watch said, hey,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.560]   you know, it's just kept going back and forth.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.560]   I gave up on it.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:57.280]   My wife and I tend to listen to iTunes U lectures to help us go to sleep.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.040]   Oh, that's a good way to sleep.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:02.000]   We learned so much in our subconscious.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   It's great.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Uh huh.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.760]   But the, but I mean, the iPhone was hearing itself say here, say, hey, Siri, which was
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.760]   just stupid.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.560]   That's really come on.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.400]   That's by the way, page slomo.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.160]   And from now on, whenever we say, instead of okay, the G word, we're going to say, okay,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   Gary.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.680]   So that's, that's it from now on.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.080]   I thought I'll take goober.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   Goober.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   No, see, it might wake up.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.080]   Yeah, we'll know.
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.360]   Or a car might arrive out front saying you called for an Uber.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.360]   So we don't.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   There's an Uber.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.360]   There's an Uber app for the Apple watch.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.360]   I use it.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:36.840]   And it's not really clear what you do.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.320]   And at some point I tapped it and called it was like, oh man, stop it.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.480]   I didn't mean I didn't mean it.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.080]   One of the reviewers reviewing the feature said it's a little buggy and I ended up calling
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.080]   seven Ubers.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:53.520]   Who's the person who did a YouTube review and like just showing how well the Amazon app
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.000]   response of voice commands accidentally bought an Xbox.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.120]   I said, okay, I'm going to cut the video because I need to, I need to go onto the web now and
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.480]   cancel this order.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.440]   Clearly, clearly we're in a building year in which both the watch is learning about how
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.320]   the humans work and humans are learning how the watch works.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:16.040]   My general take on the Apple watch is, and correct me, you tell me if I'm wrong on this.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   It's fun.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:20.120]   I think this was what I think this was groupers take too.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.240]   It doesn't do anything particularly well.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.920]   It's not something you have to have by any means.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.960]   In many cases, it's easier to actually take the phone out of your pocket and do whatever
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.800]   it is you want to do on the phone.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:35.280]   But it's a cool thing to be able to take a, for taking a call is a good example.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.160]   You're probably not going to want to do a lot of having phone calls on the watch.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.880]   But the fact you can has some coolness.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.880]   It's weird.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   I'm talking to a lot.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.440]   I'm still waiting for my, I'm still, I'll get my review hardware and I get, it's my turn
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:50.440]   to get review hardware.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.720]   But in the meantime, I'm talking to a lot of friends who have them and a lot of people
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.400]   who are just civilians who have them.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.520]   And it seems as though the things they love about them are the most common sense things
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.320]   about a smartwatch, which is a simply notifications and voice commands.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:08.120]   And the other razzle dazzle is stuff that they really, they like, but they could live
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.160]   without, which I think is kind of interesting.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.920]   Now, by the way, I just want to let you know, I've completed my outdoor run workout that
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.120]   I started earlier.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:25.520]   And I went two feet in 19, in 19 minutes and during 27 active calories, 45 resting calories,
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.040]   72 total calories.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.200]   Have you ever tried leaving the watch on top of the, on top of your washer dryer during
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   the middle of a dry cycle?
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   Like a spin cycle.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.800]   See if it'll get to your entire like days of walking.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:43.720]   I do feel like Apple was at some point, Apple said to itself, well, we, you know, we're
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.680]   just going to put some stuff in as much stuff as we can for fun.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.680]   And it's decorative.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.520]   They, I'm sure they felt a little disappointed.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.520]   They couldn't make it.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.720]   My other question is, does any of this go to research kit or do you have to, you have
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.400]   to sign up for research kit, right?
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.400]   To get sign up.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   Okay.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:00.400]   Research kit is something else.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.400]   So I'm curious.
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:02.400]   Go ahead.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.400]   I'm curious.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.400]   Actually, Susie, my wife and I both have them.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.320]   And we actually think that for a married couple, both have them as good because that means
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:10.640]   one of us doesn't kind of disappear into it.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.440]   But, um, Tanya actually, I think like.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.240]   You're both distracted all the time.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.240]   Precisely.
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.760]   We're distracted the same thing.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   Okay.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.760]   It's a bonding experience.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:24.560]   But, but Tanya actually likes hers more than mine because being a girl, she doesn't have
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:30.240]   pockets that it fits in or doesn't have necessarily pockets at all or her phone is on her desk
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.680]   or it's in her purse or whatever.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.720]   So she's actually liking it a lot more because the watch is with her.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.920]   So she can make a reminder or set a timer or whatever it is without having to go find
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   her phone.
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.800]   Is that something that you're seeing too?
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.640]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.480]   The lack of pockets in ladies outfits is a national disgrace.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.400]   Um, but so, but the problem with the watch that I found in my review is that it needs
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.200]   Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.400]   So if you turn off Bluetooth on your phone, even though the watch and the phone are on
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.680]   the same Wi-Fi network, the watch can no longer see the phone.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.720]   So if I'm in the, at my house, the, you know, Bluetooth, my house is small.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.960]   So Bluetooth will go pretty much everywhere.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:13.960]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.880]   I can use the watch anywhere in my house.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.360]   But if I'm at the office, the Wi-Fi network goes over the whole floor.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.600]   But if I leave my watch on my desk, I need to put my phone on my desk and walk away.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.880]   The watch loses it pretty quickly.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.480]   So if I'm wearing a dress and I don't have pockets, like I end up having to carry my
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.480]   phone with me everywhere.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.080]   But I want the watch to still work.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.280]   So that feels like it could be a lot better.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.840]   But yeah, I do use it for a lot of things.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:44.160]   The things I like it the most for are, um, yeah, I like setting timers and alarms with
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.160]   Siri.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.680]   I do that a ton with my phone too.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:49.360]   So having being able to do it with the watch is super handy.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:50.840]   I like using it as a remote.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.440]   I love using the remote app to control my Apple TV because it's strapped to your wrist.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.240]   You don't have to look for that little metal remote.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.840]   You don't have to dig out your phone and unlock it.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.200]   That's just been so convenient.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.600]   I like the camera remote app.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.800]   And I think it's going to be a game changer when these companies can finally ship their
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.440]   home kit compatible devices because those will all be--
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.440]   That might be a big break.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:12.440]   --rechargeable.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.440]   So I'm really, really looking forward to that.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.640]   I covered a lot of home kit stuff at CES.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:20.440]   And now we're just waiting, waiting, waiting for it to all drop.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   And that's going to change everything.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.400]   I think that, like to Leo's point, I don't think--
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.960]   I think that it was a case of Apple throwing a lot of features into the first generation.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:35.560]   I really think this is-- to me, it's really clear that if there's any frustration inside
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:41.400]   Apple, it's that, oh, I wish we could show everybody how we see this platform in 2016.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.880]   That we have to have the hardware in place to receive all the software that's going to
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:49.320]   be coming out next week to all the APIs that we're going to release once we let developers
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.760]   start to run their own stuff.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.280]   And once we show them the stuff that we're releasing ourselves in 2016, I think that's
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:00.440]   very, very appropriate that even today, the people who are buying these are the people
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.760]   who are still, like I've been saying, the early believers, because now--
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.760]   Yes.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.760]   Yes.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.920]   Even now, I'm really-- I got to say that if I thought that it would still take you until
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:14.960]   July to order a watch and get one, I certainly would have done whatever I had to do to stay
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.960]   up on the West Coast and make sure that I bought one, like one second after it got released.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.520]   Because right now, even the people who are buying them right now are not people who are
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:25.440]   making a typical consumer purchase.
[00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.680]   They're buying something, they're placing in order for something they know is not going
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.200]   to arrive for two months, which suggests a certain unusual level of interest in the
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   product.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:38.120]   But I believe that once they-- once it's the end of this year or early next year, when
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.600]   more pieces of the puzzle are in place, I think this watch is going to make a lot more
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   sense.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.960]   And hopefully, you will be able to actually convert money in your hands to a watch on your
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:49.040]   wrist in something less than 48 hours.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   Do you--
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.400]   It feels like it's a sketch, it's an outline of what they want it to be.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.400]   It's potential.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.600]   It's like the first sketch that a Michelangelo might do on the wall before he actually puts
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.760]   temper on plaster.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.560]   It just kind of sketches the outline.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:09.120]   And then one hopes that it will be filled in before we have to buy version 2.0 anyway.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:13.040]   I'm going to be really interested to see what the third party developers can do with
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.040]   it.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.320]   That-- I mean, the current apps are terrible.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.320]   And it's not their fault.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.800]   I don't blame any developers.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.840]   They were writing to complete guesses as to what this was going to look and work like.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.000]   Marco Arman had a piece about that recently where he was sort of said, "I started thinking
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.360]   it was an iOS to do iOS."
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.240]   And then I realized it's not.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:38.280]   It's basically this kind of little viewport into my app and it'll kind of a remote control.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.840]   And when you think of it that way, it changes the way you think entirely.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.320]   So developers are going to figure this out much more quickly now.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.480]   So we're going to see that.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.080]   But the thing that I'm frankly a little stressed by is that I don't see-- and I think Andy,
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.200]   you've talked about this with the Moto 360.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.760]   I don't see Apple going the next step.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:02.520]   They're providing the tools, but they're not using the tools in such a way as to predict
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.960]   what might be useful to me right now.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:12.080]   So you know, yes, you can get passbook stuff, but you've got to go to the notifications
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.080]   to get it.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.760]   It's not like knowing that I'm in an airport.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.920]   And the passbook should be the thing that comes up every time.
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.800]   So as soon as I go into the boarding line, I've got to fiddle with my watch to get the
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:26.880]   boarding QR code up.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:29.280]   It was easier to use the iPhone, frankly.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:35.160]   It goes back to I like the philosophy of Android Wear, which is that this is a wristwatch.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.200]   In that every time you do this, it is the watch's job to figure out why you did that
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.000]   and display that one piece of information that you probably most intensely want so that
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   you can put it down again.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.040]   I love the fact that this is this is valuable to me despite the fact that I rarely have
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.680]   to interact with it or tell it what I want.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:54.680]   Even though it's less than big.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.560]   I think Android Wear has a big advantage just because Google now is so darn useful.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.120]   Those cards are really useful.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:04.560]   That's an example of, you know, it knows you're at an airport and will pop up the notification,
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.880]   the QR code immediately.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.120]   What about Walt Mossberg, by the way, finally wrote his piece.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.560]   And I think he did the right thing, which is he wore it for four weeks before he wrote
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:15.800]   his review of the Apple Watch.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.640]   And one of the things he said was a great experience.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.680]   And this is an example, I think of what you just said, Adam, once developers figure out
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.080]   how to do it, checking in at the W Hotel.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.240]   He says, "As I walked into the lobby, my room number appeared on the watch.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:31.040]   I walked right by the front desk, went to the room and used the watch as a key."
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.840]   That, if I had that experience, and I have to stay at a start, one of the several hundred
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.040]   starwoods that support that right now, but that would be the kind of experience that would
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.240]   make you say, "Yeah, I'm glad I bought this."
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   Yes.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.240]   And more of those.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.240]   If you have five of those...
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:49.480]   I was just at a conference, and I had the little swipey card and things like that.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.760]   It is not a big deal, but this was a hotel conference.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:55.840]   So I'm going up and back and forth to the room three or four times, probably more or
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.480]   five or six times a day.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.840]   And no, it's not a big deal.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.880]   I can get the little swipey card out of my pocket and swipe it.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.920]   But if the watch actually opened the door for me, that would be something which I would
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.200]   notice every time I did it.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:13.920]   And not waiting in line to check in even, especially to conference, would be a great
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   thing.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.560]   So I'm really open to the idea that in six months, we can revisit and say, "Yeah, now
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.600]   there are some really useful apps."
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:27.840]   The Uber experience wasn't bad, but basically, just to be sure I knew what was going on,
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.000]   I brought out the phone.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Thank you.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.440]   And I think that that's going to be a problem.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.800]   If you can't be good enough to leave the phone in the pocket, it's not going to solve that
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   problem.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.720]   Let me ask you about this heartbeat.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.120]   So you and Tonya have it.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:47.120]   Does your, as soon as he does your husband have one or no?
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.120]   No, he doesn't.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   So yeah.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.640]   He sounds so sad when you said that.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.040]   He wouldn't even have an iPhone if I didn't keep forcing my old iPhones on him.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040]   He's not quite as bad as he is.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.880]   At least my wife has one.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:04.200]   And for the first few days, we drew pictures and said heartbeats and then never again.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.520]   No, it's a total gimmick.
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.520]   It demos well.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:09.600]   I shouldn't say that.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.360]   It's a gimmick to use with the other person.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.560]   It doesn't actually demo that well.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:18.520]   We found demoing the watch because we've had dinner with friends and whatnot and they
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   see it.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.520]   Oh, it's the Apple watching.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.680]   You know, you see people out.
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.280]   It's really hard to demo.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.280]   I have the same problem because you have to hold the phone.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.640]   You have to go around to the person on the right side so they can see, you know, otherwise
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.960]   you're cranking your wrist.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.480]   It's like tying someone else's necktie.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.120]   And you got to get behind them.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:39.360]   It's turning off the screen all the time.
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.520]   And the messaging is not really tight enough.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:48.040]   In other words, I'll get a message on my iPhone often 30 seconds to a minute before it comes
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.160]   through on the watch.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.440]   And so, so you know, sometimes when you're trying to sometimes 20 minutes.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.440]   Yes.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.440]   That's annoying.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:57.440]   That's annoying.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:00.760]   If the phone's in my pocket, I got to like, well, it's going to come through on the watch
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.760]   soon.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.400]   A perfect example of that.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.840]   And another example of, oh, I had to take out the phone was we ordered pizza.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.640]   Now the pizza delivery company texts you when they get to the restaurant, when they arrive
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.640]   out front.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.880]   So it was here at work.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.520]   So I knew that I would get a text when they were out front.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.520]   So I didn't have to worry.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.320]   I just went right to the front door, except that the watch didn't.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.520]   The phone did.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.080]   I never got those texts.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.720]   So I just ended up taking out the phone.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.960]   And that's a little bit frustrating.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:29.880]   Let me show you the other sad thing.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:36.240]   And I'm going to do it right now is when you send your wife a heartbeat and she doesn't
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.520]   respond.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.080]   And that's really depressing.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.520]   So here I'm going to do it.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.080]   So I force pressed it.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.080]   Gosh darn it.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.080]   I hate it when I do that.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.600]   Well, while we're waiting for that surprise waiting.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.760]   There's all of that that that's surprising to me because I've been joking to friends
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.560]   is that now have I've typically got the Microsoft ban on my right wrist.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.080]   I've got the bono on this wrist.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.600]   Every time I get a text message, I'll feel a buzzing in my pocket and then like two and
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.200]   a half seconds later, I'll be appear here and here like I'm having a stroke or something.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.520]   I never have to wait more than a few seconds for it to propagate to my personal body network.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.680]   Yeah, that's a tricky.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.040]   I mean, I'm sure that's a tricky thing to do.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.880]   And Lisa and I are on different networks.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.880]   She's on Verizon.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.880]   I'm on AT&T.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.320]   So that might also be an issue because maybe she's not getting.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:25.160]   I think sometimes she gets my heart like a day later and or maybe her or maybe her horizons
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.000]   at least feels that you're unworthy of love Leo.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Have you ever figured that out?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.040]   Hey, did you see Verizon just bought AOL?
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.040]   Yep.
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:34.960]   I don't even know what to say to that.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.520]   I mean, it's like really?
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.320]   Hey, you know, huh?
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.320]   Huh?
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.320]   Also, we journeyed to take on it was two crumbling empires together at last.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.520]   What does able actually do these days anyway?
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.160]   Mobile and video apparently.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.160]   That's what they say.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.160]   Really?
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.520]   They've got an ad network that actually works.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:57.560]   And Verizon would very much like to not just simply be the water and power company because
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:01.600]   once you're paying your monthly bill of water and it's like anybody else.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:05.400]   Especially when others get into the business, it's less than less valuable.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.080]   But they just want all those dial up lines.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.440]   The big issue, if you're in gadget, one of the AOL properties and Verizon owns you,
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.200]   does that make it difficult to do your job?
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:22.360]   Evidence tends to sense to say that there's always going to be firewalls that are put into
[00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:23.360]   place.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.960]   They're always going to be promises made.
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.280]   But that's nice that they say these things.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.920]   It's nice that they mention that in interviews.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:34.840]   But wait until one year later and then two months after that when the first people, editors
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:40.320]   who quit and discussed are willing to talk about the experiences they had because it didn't
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.480]   have that with studios.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:46.600]   We see a lot of stuff like, yeah, we, we, there are a bunch of stories and I'm scrambling
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.680]   to remember actual names.
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:52.760]   But stuff like that where stories get killed for odd.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   I think it was, I should have guessed.
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   It was the CES.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   There was CNET trying to-
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   Oh, you're right.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.760]   She had some kind of-
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:08.120]   They gave the best of CES awards to the hopper, which was the dish network device that leaves
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:15.080]   skip commercials and CBS said, and they retracted the award.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.400]   Perfect example.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.400]   Bingo.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.120]   Both Andy and Adam are having trouble with, so we're going to recall you on Skype and see
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.120]   if we can get that.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.520]   Oh, Susie, you're perfect.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.520]   Woo.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.640]   Don't move.

[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.440]   You tend to do more of that stuff that you should be doing because it's easy instead
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.640]   of putting it off saying, "Yeah, yeah, I'll get that trademark someday when we're doing
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.440]   really well and we can, but no, it's great.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.440]   You can do it now."
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.760]   Adam Inks is here.

[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:53.160]   Boy, I am going to read this Jeff Carlson article because photos has been driving me crazy,
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.000]   crazy.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.120]   All the information, all the news is right here, tidbits.com.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.840]   Also here with us, I'm really glad to have her.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.560]   It's the first time on Macbreak Weekly.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.640]   Susie Oaks, editor at Macworld.com.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:09.440]   SF SUSE, S-O-O-Z on the Twitter.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:17.680]   SF S-O-O-Z and Iyanako also here from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.280]   Anybody else having problems with photos?
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.920]   Is it working good for you?
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.720]   We are getting so many comments.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:33.000]   Anytime that you're forced to do something like move from my photo to photos, you're going
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.760]   to have people who are just unhappy.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.560]   But I have to say, it has a craft.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.960]   For once, I cannot use it anymore.
[00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.360]   It crashes every time.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.840]   I've tried rebuilding.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:44.480]   I've tried everything.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.400]   It just crashes on my Mac Pro.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.400]   It's depressing.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.000]   I think that photos is going to be an interesting one.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.320]   Apple has, we're hoping it's a little bit of the Final Cut Pro situation where it's going
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:02.000]   to get better over time as they bring back the features that just disappeared in the
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.600]   process from even iPhoto, much less aperture.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:11.720]   But I will say that honestly, I wrote a book about iPhoto 1.0 way back when and went through
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.720]   five editions.
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.280]   I have a lot of experience with that product.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.080]   They never really quite got it.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:26.400]   It was just never a solid thing that seemed to live up to its potential.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:32.080]   I'm hoping the Photos group is a completely different team.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:33.920]   I worry a little though.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.000]   What are you hearing, Andy?
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.640]   I'm just sorry that they really seem to have cleaned house and lost the aperture.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.760]   Members of the aperture team and people who have been doing stuff in photos on the Mac
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.720]   and iOS that I've thought were very, very good.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.560]   That said, I had my first real live fire exercise with photos during that week I spent
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.760]   Yosemite and it was extraordinarily positive.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:59.360]   It helps that I wasn't importing a legacy library.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.880]   I was simply starting from scratch, treating this MacBook like it was a brand new MacBook,
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:07.600]   which technically it was, and suddenly dumping two or three hundred photos per day into it.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.680]   What I should do is start over.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:20.840]   I also have to say that I'm a little bit worried about trusting my entire photo library to an
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:27.920]   Apple proprietary product, especially when you get to the point where after X number
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:33.480]   of months and a couple of years, you're going to have so many photos up there that is going
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:38.720]   to feel like such a Titanic undertaking to switch to a different phone or switch to a
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.760]   different tablet or switch to a different operating system.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:48.200]   That I'm not necessarily saying that platform agnosticism is the ecumenicalism is the most
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.040]   important consideration.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.160]   But given that other services like Flickr that recently went to a all you can eat sort
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.000]   of a model plus we're going to we want to host we want to back up and be your central
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.840]   photo library for everything.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:07.200]   If you subscribe to Adobe Lightroom Adobe Creative Suite, you can sync between platforms
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.800]   really, really easily have love automatically.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:14.240]   But you have to specify specific albums.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.320]   It's not a collection.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:20.880]   Yeah, but you can but you can solve that by simply you can a you can do that.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.320]   You can basically if you want to take everything you ever put onto your MacBook and have it
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:28.320]   backed up and have it available in that central repository, you can do that.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.560]   And secondly, a lot of the people who have been coming to me with their own observations
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:35.560]   and their own questions have been like, there are pictures that are really personal and
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:39.320]   I don't want them anywhere that's outside of my personal control.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.320]   And I'm okay.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.920]   I would at least like to simply say, look, these are private private and we're not talking
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:48.080]   about, you know, stuff that, you know, video nasties or anything like that.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:51.600]   We're talking about, look, these are pictures of my kids and these, this is pictures of,
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.840]   you know, my my one.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:02.080]   I could imagine a situation in which some people like to document even the most horrible
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:05.680]   parts of family life, including an illness.
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:10.760]   And the idea that I don't have control of these pictures of a loved one who's going
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.800]   through the worst time of all of our lives.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.040]   I don't want that to be anywhere, but on a device that I control, I'd like to simply
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.680]   say, don't back this up anywhere.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.840]   Don't upload this to anywhere.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:24.840]   Don't have any situation in which this could be the football that's on on the field in
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.080]   play because this is personal private.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.560]   I don't I don't think Apple has really screwed anything up here.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.480]   I think that it's a wonderful articulate.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.640]   It's a very, very modern way of expressing the idea of photos.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.840]   That's very much in tune with the generation and a time where people don't think of photos
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:42.120]   as even albums that get handed around.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:46.120]   But as devices where they want to find the one thing spontaneously, they want to show
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.120]   to somebody.
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:51.120]   And the editing features are a lot better than I, what way better than I even imagined
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.520]   them to be at a 1.0 release.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.240]   But it might be one of these systems that's going to take as number of months, like the
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:02.240]   Apple Watch, to take it from something that works for people who are testing it.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.640]   And now has to be something that tens of millions of people all across the world are
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:08.040]   going to be very, very comfortable using.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:13.760]   I agree that it's a real issue with this sort of locking yourself into someone's ecosystem.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:16.520]   And I mean, we're getting a lot of questions from people saying, Hey, can I use this with
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.520]   Dropbox?
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:23.000]   Well, you can put your photos library in Dropbox, but I'm not entirely certain how that works
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.120]   when you start switching between machines and does it sink well?
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.320]   And certainly you wouldn't be able to see it in iOS and all of that.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:34.240]   I will say that the one thing, I mean, the big thing that I have, I wanted ever since
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:39.800]   the iPhone and I particularly iPad came out is iCloud Photo Library.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:45.840]   I want to be able to see my library, the whole thing from any of my devices and be able to
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.840]   do anything I want.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:52.080]   It's a little bit weak on that still in terms of being able to keyword stuff and title photos
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.000]   and things like that in iOS.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.600]   But at least edits and that kind of thing do pass through.
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:00.360]   So that's all good.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:05.920]   But I do agree, there's a little bit of concern with, are you committing all of your photos
[00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.920]   to a particular Roach Motel?
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:12.160]   And that's going to happen with anything.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:16.960]   But if you do, you stay outside, then are you giving up photos as a management tool?
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.760]   Do you have to go to Lightroom as a management tool at that point?
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.840]   Which nothing wrong with Lightroom, obviously.
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.320]   And you've got to keep that in effect for it.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:27.080]   It's a lot, yeah, it's kind of expensive.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:31.040]   I'm looking at like five bucks a month for iCloud Photo Library for the number of photos
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.040]   I have.
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:37.360]   But that's a lot cheaper than having another subscription to a separate subscription to
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:38.360]   Creative Cloud.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.600]   Luckily, I already have Creative Cloud 2 for InDesign and Photoshop, so whatever.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.840]   I guess my difference is that I use these two tools differently and that I already have
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:48.040]   solutions for backing up Photo Library.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.720]   So I'm not worried about that.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:54.440]   And what I liked about Lightroom is that just the idea that, again, coming over from Yosemite,
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:59.720]   I've got at least five, six, seven hundred photos that, and the hardest thing to do,
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:03.320]   and the thing that keeps me sometimes from actually getting to the business of organizing
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.820]   these things is when I'm going to sit down and go through and look at each and every
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:10.920]   one of these and choose which ones are at least worth my further attention.
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:15.640]   And when I'm on commuter rail or something where I'm waiting for a train, and I just
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:21.520]   remember that, oh, by virtue of the fact that I've enabled syncing on that collection in
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:27.320]   Lightroom, that means that all of these photos are now synced in some form onto this iPad.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:31.960]   I can simply use this beautiful like eight by ten prints of each one of these pictures
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:37.440]   to say yes, no, no, no, yes, no, L yes, no, no, no, no, and that's what that's why I
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:38.440]   tend to use it for.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.440]   You can do that with Lightroom too.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.440]   Well, I'm talking about Lightroom.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:43.840]   Oh, I thought you were talking about photos.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.840]   But can't you do that with photos?
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:51.000]   I mean, it doesn't anything you do on your phone transmit to the photos on your desk
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   stops.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   You can create collections.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.240]   You know, some of the projects suggests, and I think he's right, Apple should create
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:04.840]   a incognito folder that is encrypted, private, and does not sync.
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:09.560]   So the way photos works is you have a system photo library, and that's the one that can
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.840]   sync to iCloud Photo Library.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:15.920]   You can have multiple other photo libraries and open them either by just double clicking
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.760]   them in the Finder or holding an option when you launch photos.
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.920]   And those will not sync.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:27.160]   The problem is that my photos that I'm worried about are on my phone.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:29.640]   I take them on the phone, and I think this is universal.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.160]   In that case, you're just jealous.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:36.920]   You don't, you know, there's a cute little naked puppy in front of you, and you want
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.080]   to take a picture.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:44.600]   And you don't because you don't know what the hell is going to happen to it.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   Right?
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   Absolutely.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.600]   It's a natural paranoia.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.960]   Well, that's annoying.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:49.960]   Great.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.960]   And incognito.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:54.240]   That's what you need to do.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.560]   It is about control.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:59.120]   And that's what people, even if it's the illusion of control, sometimes that's good
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:01.880]   enough for a lot of the illusion would be happy.
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.360]   I'd be happy with the illusion.
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:08.720]   But one thing I will say that they're lightroom and photos are there.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.880]   They are two different approaches towards the same problem.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.440]   What I like about Lightroom is that it does preserve the idea of a workflow towards a
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:21.040]   goal as opposed to photos is that, look, you're going to take a lot of photos, a lot
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.040]   of pictures.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:26.360]   It's our job as your as your photo resource to make sure they're safely on every single
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.920]   device that you will ever want to use them with.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:32.480]   And that you can improve some of them if you feel as though some of them need to need to
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   be tweaked.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.600]   We're asked with if there are people who take pictures like me, which is, again, I've
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:41.840]   got 900 pictures of which only about 80 are going to be worth ever showing to anybody.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.160]   And of those, maybe 12 are going to be worth posting someplace.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:48.840]   And that's and photos isn't as good at that as Lightroom is.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.920]   And Lightroom also has a better connection to Photoshop for people who actually want to
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:52.920]   do serious editing.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.920]   Right.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.000]   Photos cannot use an external editor at this point.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.320]   Adobe's so smart with that $10 a month.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.440]   You're a photographer's pet bundle where you get Laramond Photoshop.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.440]   That's just genius.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.440]   You have no idea how much power is in photo.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:11.120]   You think about Photoshop as, okay, so here's how I do like a spot exposure on this.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:16.600]   And this lets me like erase out from the background, this guy, the person in the wedding party
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:20.240]   who like dumped your sister, dumped your sister like three months after the picture
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:21.240]   would take him.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:26.280]   But it also, it really is almost like an operating system for digital images.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:32.640]   And the more time you spend on like Linda.com or other like a video tutorial sites and you
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.920]   realize that, oh, so you mean that if I can't, if I want every single thing in the field
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:41.800]   of view of this camera to be in focus, all I have to do is take five or six pictures
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.960]   and keep adjusting the focus in every one.
[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.840]   And I don't have to do any like masking.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:50.760]   I just simply open them, open them all up with this one command and then blend them with
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:54.760]   this other command and tell basically tell Photoshop, make sure when you blend, you don't
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.360]   blend anything that's not in focus.
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.600]   And then three seconds later, oh my God.
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.800]   And it's like, this has been in this app that I've had on my computer for the past year
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.280]   and four months.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:09.640]   And I have never used it because I have never looked at more than one level deep into menus.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.680]   And for 10 bucks a month, it's like there's no problem.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:14.680]   There is not a solution to within this app.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.440]   It's like, don't be intimidated by Photoshop.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:17.920]   It wants, it wants to help you.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:22.560]   It's like that neighbor that has a rec room and like a garage full of tools and a machine
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.640]   shop and they never use.
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:27.960]   And the one thing he would love is for you to come over and like use the way that he
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.360]   bought a year and a half ago that's never used.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.360]   That's what Photoshop is.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:32.360]   Please come over.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.360]   Let me do wonderful things with your pictures.
[00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:35.600]   For 10 bucks a month, it's great.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.800]   It's like Netflix only with creating things.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:39.680]   Is anybody using the new MacBook?
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:40.880]   Susie, you're using that?
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:42.680]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.880]   Is it fast enough to do, you know, Photoshop?
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.520]   And I mean, I love how thin it is.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.520]   Photoshop on it.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.080]   I'm pixelator all the way.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   And it's great.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:54.040]   So it's like, I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.040]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:58.040]   So I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.040]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.040]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:03.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:06.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:07.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:08.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:09.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:11.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:12.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:13.840]   I'm a little bit better than I do.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   The way that I put it in this extends to final cut and other professional level apps I put
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:23.440]   on it, it probably doesn't perform well enough for people who make their living with these
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.680]   apps.
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:28.880]   But for someone like me who occasionally uses Photoshop, it works just fine.
[00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:30.880]   You'll be able to get your job done.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:36.960]   One of the things I was doing to really test it to the point of ridiculousness was in taking
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:43.120]   a hour long HD video that I captured off my DVR and then converting it from that weird
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:46.680]   DVR file format to an MP4 file with handbrake.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:51.120]   I did it on my 2013 MacBook Pro, which has a really good processor on it.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:55.000]   I did it on the MacBook Pro, the MacBook, excuse me, the new MacBook.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.360]   The new MacBook did it in about 20% more time, but it did it.
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.920]   It wasn't like it took two or three times more.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:05.960]   It's not optimal for that sort of stuff, but you can do it.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.440]   Everything's really off the table.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.880]   The other thing is for stuff that's not necessarily professional grade, iMovie had no problem cutting
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.840]   all the commercials out of that TV show and missing it down.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:21.920]   GarageBand had no problem recording live audio and also editing multi-track.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:27.200]   Again, it's not optimal for stuff that if you're making money off of professional apps,
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.600]   I certainly wouldn't use it as an Xcode test bed if I'm doing lots and lots of builds.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.640]   But I don't really think that there are any apps that are really off the table for the
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.240]   new MacBook, and that really surprised me.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:42.280]   The reason I ask is, well, first of all, Lisa's order, once she's going to get one soon,
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.880]   did you, and he were using the base model or the stepped up model?
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.160]   I'd have to double check.
[01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:50.040]   Even the step up model isn't that much harder.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.040]   I know.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   It's a lot more expensive.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.520]   As a matter of fact, I have to send it back tomorrow.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.800]   Well, it's the hard drive, I'll tell you.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.120]   If you have 256 gigs, that's the base model.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.960]   If you have 512, that's the upper level.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.240]   But I just know, the only reason I ask is because Kevin Rose had one when he was in studio
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.000]   on Saturday doing the new screensavers.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.040]   Yesterday, Jim Latterback was on triangulation.
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.040]   He had one.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.760]   And when I see two kind of power users using them, it's intriguing because, man, is it
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.640]   thin and light?
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:19.400]   And it's really quite attractive.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:25.480]   I don't know if I talked about this a couple of weeks ago, but traveling, I don't think
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.000]   that you can possibly review this unless you spent a week traveling with it through multiple
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   airports.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.280]   And suddenly having the difference between a 13 inch MacBook and a 12 inch is substantial,
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.320]   way more than you think it's going to be.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.000]   Made my MacBook Air feel heavy.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   What?
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   Really?
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   Wow.
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.480]   Yeah, my 13 inch MacBook Air, I'm like, oh, it's so much heavier.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:49.200]   Do you have the same experience that I was having, especially when traveling with it?
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.600]   It's like, I feel myself like touch.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.320]   I'm not carrying even my laptop bag.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.000]   I'm carrying my larger iPad bag, a little shoulder like the thing.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.800]   And I keep having to touch the inside of it to make sure that I have a high-end software.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.800]   Right.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.560]   Cause it's like, I'm used to even with the air and certainly with my 13 inch MacBook Pro,
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.320]   I'm used to having some sort of sensation that I've got a laptop with me.
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.360]   Only this new device, it just reads totally like an iPad.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:21.640]   Last year I did three trips in a row and on my third trip, I got to the airport, got
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.280]   out of the Uber and like slung my bag over my shoulder and was like, wait a minute, my
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.920]   bag isn't as heavy as it should be and realized that I had left my MacBook.
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:31.960]   I had to get back in the Uber and go, I only live 10 minutes from the airport.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   So it was fine.
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:33.960]   I made the flight.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.000]   But with this MacBook, I don't know if I'd be able to tell, just like throwing it on
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   my shoulder like that.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.040]   Like I might have to start really like looking through before I go through security to make
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:43.760]   sure I have my MacBook.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.160]   Cause yeah, it's really light.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.400]   It's noticeable.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:50.520]   I like what you said Andy about how using a different bag because one of the things
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.360]   that I've run into is that actually long ago thought, geez, these laptops keep getting
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.360]   lighter.
[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.360]   How come my bag isn't getting any lighter?
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.840]   I ripped my bag apart and literally weighed every object in it.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:07.800]   It was amazing how much crud you carry and the laptop was the least of it in some ways.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.360]   You know, all the cables and adapters and dongle.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.360]   Well, you do need a dongle on this one.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.680]   I mean, with one type C port, you're going to want to get that $79 dongle, right?
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:22.520]   The true USB, HDMI and then another type C for power.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.480]   But here's another great thing.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:33.880]   If you have like a really good like heavy, like heavy duty battery pack, like for the
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.920]   sort of thing that can charge your phone like six or seven times in your iPad like twice,
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:42.920]   it will actually charge and extend the battery of the MacBook so that because it's just USB
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.360]   C and there's nothing proprietary about the charging protocol.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.000]   So long as it's connected to a source of power, it will charge.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   And so I find that with this little $40 anchor battery pack that I've been, that is almost
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.800]   always in my bag because I like to have a couple of days where the power with me when
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:02.480]   I travel, I'm getting like 18, 19 hours of uptime.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.880]   It can it will charge about half as quickly as it would from the wall wart.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:11.640]   But the ability to simply not the ability to take this on an overnight and for that 24
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:17.400]   hours or 36 hours, I don't even have to care if I'm ever going to be near a power outlet.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.480]   That's another huge win.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.560]   That's really interesting, Andy.
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:23.600]   So because Julio Ojeda Zapata who reviewed it for tidbits.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:28.120]   So that he tried charging it from an iPad charger and it wouldn't do it.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.920]   But it's just saying that if the battery just plugging into a battery will work.
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:35.280]   No, I got, I got tricked to.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.800]   Did he actually, I'm serious.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.880]   I I round I scrounched up like the one, you know, where everybody who has the ability
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:47.480]   to make a USB C anything, there's like seven press releases in my in my inbox.
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.240]   I had a couple of cables.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:56.440]   And so I plugged in a USB my one USB C to like USB 3.0 cable and it reported to the
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:00.640]   battery pack and it reported that not charging and I got the good thing.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.000]   So it could tell that it was connected to something that could deliver power.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   It was delivered.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.280]   It wasn't reporting not charging.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:06.280]   So I unplugged.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.920]   Oh, well, that's too much to expect.
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.360]   And then I thought, wait a minute, what if it's actually charging, but it's not it doesn't
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.240]   recognize it as a power adapter left it going.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:23.080]   And it was actually putting on about again, it took about if it takes about two hours,
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:29.080]   I think to charge it from zero to full on the on the included adapter, it would take
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:33.560]   about four hours to charge it up to about 89 to 90%.
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:37.240]   And then it would curve would flatten to the point where really wouldn't get much above
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:38.240]   90%.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:41.640]   But the but the really cool thing is if you are simply working with it and you keep it
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:46.760]   plugged into that battery pack, you will not be taking any power off of the internal battery
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.760]   as it's going.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:48.760]   That's great.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.200]   And that's and the fact that you can actually have external batteries that are both, you
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.120]   know, obviously generic enough to run with the iPad and the iPhone and run the MacBook
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.120]   as well.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.120]   That's very neat.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:00.440]   I did ask Apple that question explicitly and they explicitly said there is absolutely
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.040]   nothing proprietary about the chargers, absolutely nothing proprietary about about the protocol.
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:11.180]   If it is if something is capable of delivering power across USB C, it will can conceivably
[01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:16.440]   charge this device and no doubt will start seeing people who are developing battery
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.680]   plates that are specifically designed to work with this thing.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:25.080]   You might even have like a mophie cafeteria tray that you just chunk it into that gives
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:29.960]   you like 48 hours of power at the expense of making it look like a, you know, a compact
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.760]   from 2003.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.800]   I also feel like type C connectors are going to be ubiquitous in the next.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.040]   It won't happen right away, but in the next year or two, it's a pain in the butt really
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.980]   because and I was determined during my trip to Yosemite to do everything use this as my
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:50.000]   sole computer for come hell or high water.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.880]   And in order to deliver a presentation to VGA, I had to carry with me a VGA to HDMI adapter,
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:04.520]   plug the HDMI adapter into an Apple TV, connect a, a little portable like a Wi-Fi base to
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:10.240]   the base station, creating a private network and then have like a airplane streaming from
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:13.880]   the from the MacBook to this device and all of that.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:18.160]   And I put that in the review just for just to be funny, but this is a problem that solves
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.680]   itself during the summer.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:26.600]   Once it's it's unfortunate that you'll have to spend $79 I think to get the little dongle
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:29.600]   that contains those three extra connectors on it.
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:34.200]   But once you have that that problem is effectively over with and to be fair, even on the MacBook
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:38.760]   Pro, you still need to travel with some sort of a dongle because this is a VGA world.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.640]   You cannot count on HDMI.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.000]   And so you'll be traveling with some sort of an adapter anyway.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.280]   So it may as well be this USB C one.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:51.440]   I have the also the pixel, the Chromebook pixel that Google did with the type C and they
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.440]   did the right thing.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:56.840]   And I wonder I will guess the next generation two ports one on each side.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.840]   There are a couple of benefits.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:00.520]   One, you can power it on either side, right?
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:03.280]   So that's convenient to have ambidextrous power.
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:07.120]   But then the other port can be used with the dongle or used with new to I think lots of
[01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.600]   devices in most phones probably be type C.
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.560]   I'm hoping the iPhone 6s will be type C.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:17.680]   The good news is that USB C makes it a lot easier to do things like a hub as opposed to
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.000]   a simple adapt and a powered adapter.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.880]   That was that was a frustrating limitation of the first MacBook Air where it came with
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:29.560]   only one USB port and it was difficult to put more than one device on it unless you have
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.000]   a really good powered USB hub.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.720]   The devices that I've been seeing, I haven't actually put my hands on it.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.680]   I've been talking to some of the engineers who are building them make it make it seem
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.440]   as though if you have this, it'll be possible to build this one harmonica like device that
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:51.640]   will have VGA will have a couple of like like it looks like a harmonic a white harmonica
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.800]   with a little pigtail connected to it.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.200]   Really all you what you really need is you need the ability to have at least two USB 3.0
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.480]   ports going at the same time because figure on I need something to act as this SD card
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:09.520]   reader and I need something to act as I can take my photo library from my desktop office
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.960]   to and carry it with me when I travel.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.960]   So it's there are a bunch of solutions to that.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:16.920]   And again, these are things they're going to solve themselves as more people start making
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:17.920]   these devices.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.760]   We just we're just I think that everybody should be happy that we're free of the tyranny
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.800]   of the proprietary power plug that you people have to be able to buy and license that connector
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.560]   and Apple was not allowing people to license that stuff.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.440]   So there are limits to what people could buy because this is just simply bog standard
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:39.440]   USB C. Anybody can build anything they want to confirm that conforms that standard and
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.600]   Apple supposedly is not going to do anything to interfere with whatever anybody wants to
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:43.600]   build.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.600]   But I do miss Max safe.
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:48.040]   Do you know, I mean, you just.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.640]   Well, you know, whoops, I just.
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:55.600]   I was about to say at distances further than 12 feet.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.920]   I can't really shoot it with one shot.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.240]   I have to get a shotgun to really blow it all blow a hole inside it, which is what I
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.240]   like.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.880]   Again, that's one of the very few things that Apple has designed in the past 10 years that
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:13.840]   I can without any reservation whatsoever say is just badly designed that I don't understand
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:20.800]   how that design ever left the engineering department because it is so clearly emphatically
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:26.280]   ill suited for the purpose of maintaining a power connection to a device that requires
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:33.760]   a lot of power that it must be nice to only work on a desk where you have the ability
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:41.800]   to simply put a strip of gaffers tape down on the cord so that it never ever ever ever.
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:42.800]   I just hated it.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.120]   I've been using this machine for over a year and a half.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:47.960]   It's still frustrating that I'm on the sofa.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:53.120]   I just simply like, you know, move my leg a little bit off comes the connector or I'll
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.120]   I'll leave.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.760]   I'll simply I'll simply get up, put it on the sofa cushion and I'm sure the power is
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760]   connected.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.200]   Go back upstairs and go to bed, come back the next day thinking that, okay, I got a whole
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.680]   busy work to do inside the library.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.960]   At least my, no, but it's not charged up because it popped off during the night.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:11.720]   And now it's now there's basically 20% power left.
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:12.720]   Oh, you pastors.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.720]   Oh, you bastard.
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:14.720]   You bastard.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.080]   Yeah, I trade magsafe for that external battery charging because I used to have a hyper Mac
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.240]   battery that had a magsafe thing on it.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.240]   And then they had to discontinue that it wasn't licensed or something.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.360]   They had a really crazy workaround where you had to buy the Apple accessory that you would
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:31.840]   use in airplanes.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.160]   And then you had to plug that into the battery and then the other side into your Mac book.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.160]   And it was a mess.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:42.520]   So I clung to this super heavy hyper Mac battery like for dear life because that was the only
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.160]   way to charge my Mac book on the go.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:50.400]   And yeah, so you magsafe was cool when it worked, you know, on a desk.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.960]   But like Andy says, yes, sometimes I'm working on a couch or in a bed.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:58.200]   And then as soon as you put it down or tilt it at all, it has to do is little corner has
[01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.320]   to come up, but it doesn't doesn't work.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:05.040]   So I would rather have USB C charging and be able to use external batteries.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.680]   And then you don't have to worry about being tethered to a plug, which is a nice.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.160]   Andy, I got your, I got your harmonica like device right here.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.480]   Thanks to scooter X in our chat room.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.040]   This is a Kickstarter called hub plus from a company called Nanda.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:21.480]   You've seen this $80 and it does exactly what you were talking about.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:26.320]   It plugs into the type C port on your Mac book and then gives you every other kind of port
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.840]   including another type C out the back.
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.800]   I think this seems like a good idea.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.480]   Yeah, we'll be seeing some good docs.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:40.320]   And this is the same price by the way as apples over price $79 dongle, which doesn't do nearly
[01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:41.320]   as much.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.320]   This has got a card reader.
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.320]   It's got a battery in it.
[01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:45.320]   Too much.
[01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320]   Too much.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.320]   Too much.
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:48.320]   Too much.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.840]   I bet the inside of the hub plus is not painted just as well as the outside.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.840]   Okay.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:51.840]   You're right.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:53.680]   And the holes may not exactly be level.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.520]   Can you put a price tag on that?
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.520]   Let me see.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:58.520]   I'm looking, looking to see.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.520]   Comes and gold.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.520]   It comes and gold.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:04.920]   Oh, that's if they make their stretch goal gold.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:07.040]   This you know, by the way, they've they've already funded.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:12.040]   They were looking for 35 grand.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.880]   I'm trying to find the specs on the battery.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.880]   So what's the battery for?
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:18.520]   Is it going to actually power anything?
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.520]   Built in.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.520]   Built in.
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:23.080]   Oh, it doesn't charge the.
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.680]   Although I don't know why it couldn't charge the computer or at least give it a little
[01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:27.680]   rush to choose.
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.680]   Well, it doesn't matter, right?
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.240]   I mean, that's the whole point of this to your point, Andy, that doesn't need a certain
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.240]   amount of watts.
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240]   It could trickle it.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.240]   It just wouldn't.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.840]   I just I think it would just suck it drive so too quickly probably.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.840]   Well, I mean how much could it be in there?
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.400]   I just need two more minutes.
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:45.680]   It's got an in USB C in and out.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:51.240]   It's got an SD card reader lithium ion battery, USB A plus charging, USB A plus charging, USB
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.520]   A plus charging, three of those.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.160]   I like it's got a mini display port.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:59.640]   So kind of cute three USB plus.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.680]   Look at that.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:07.000]   I don't know what's going on there with the green, but charging is charging.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.320]   Oh, that's you flow it through.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.320]   It's just a rope.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:15.120]   If the cables actually did that, I would buy it.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:18.720]   There is a cable somebody told me about that has LEDs in it.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:23.000]   They go faster when it's charging and then it gets to 90 and it starts trickle charging.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.200]   They slow down and you're all the way charged.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   They stop.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:28.200]   I can't remember what they're called.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.520]   I saw them at an AB.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:38.720]   I will say the thing that's just traveling, so it's in a hotel room and all the LEDs, man,
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.920]   you got to really put your clothes over everything.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:42.560]   They light up the room.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:45.000]   They don't do nightlights anymore.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.800]   They don't need to.
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:47.800]   Everything's lit up.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.800]   The room glows.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.560]   I'm going to order one of these and I'll let you know.
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.320]   I have such bad luck with Kickstarter.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:56.040]   It's not a store kids.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.040]   Hey, let's take a break.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.040]   We're going to come back with more Andy and Ico Chicago Sun time.
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.300]   Suzie Oaks from MacWorld.
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.980]   Yes, there's a Macworld still, Macworld.com.
[01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:08.200]   Were you at the print publication to Suzie?
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:09.740]   I was at Tech Hive, so--
[01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:10.360]   Oh, I loved--
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.820]   I was at Mac life for something--
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.720]   I loved him, you know, Tech Hive?
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.460]   --and the Tech Hive--
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:14.400]   was kind of Jason's side.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.700]   Yeah, that's how I came to IDG.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:17.620]   I loved Tech Hive.
[01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.340]   Is it-- it's still going, right?
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:20.760]   It is.
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.200]   They've kind of pivoted to just be a smart home
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.720]   and connect-- streaming media, cable cutting kind of sites
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.960]   so they're just doing smart home.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.100]   But Mike Brown's running it.
[01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.320]   And he's a smart home genius.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:32.640]   So they're putting out a lot of good stuff.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.160]   Good.
[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.480]   And of course, Adam angst from the immortal tidbits.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:38.040]   He's immortal.
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:40.600]   The guy-- he looks 25.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.200]   He's looked 25 for 25 years.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.840]   I don't understand it.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.720]   Yeah, I'm amazing.
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:45.920]   You didn't see my hair back then.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.440]   Amazing feet.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.920]   Oh, it's not-- it's white, not blonde.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:49.880]   OK, now I feel better.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.720]   Yeah, yeah, that's-- actually-- no, sorry.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.200]   I didn't realize that video wasn't that good.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.480]   It's MacBook Gold, my friends.
[01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.600]   MacBook Blonde.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.900]   MacBook Blonde.
[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:02.000]   That's yet another benefit of being
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.020]   like a competitive runner.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.740]   You can say, oh, no, it's not going great.
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:06.180]   Gosh, I spend so much time running.
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:08.220]   The sun just keeps bleaching it and bleaching it.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:09.660]   But what can you do?
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:10.980]   It's like for a claim.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.100]   Yeah, right.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.820]   I'm going to put-- I'm going to buy two of these.
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.820]   I'm going to go all in on this hub plus.
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:18.940]   Gonna buy two of them.
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:19.380]   Because Lisa--
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.100]   If you date him, then what happens?
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.900]   Oh, I think it's like crossing the streams.
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:25.380]   I think-- yeah.
[01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.940]   I think the universe ends.
[01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.560]   But I might be wrong.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:29.760]   I hope I'm wrong.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.960]   Lisa ordered one.
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.120]   But now, after hearing you guys talk about it,
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.400]   I'm thinking I'm going to get a MacBook, too.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.160]   Sounds so nice.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:36.960]   It's pretty cool.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:39.400]   It said, I had one of those really dangerous reactions,
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.120]   especially now that I'm packing it up.
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.320]   It's on a back to Apple.
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.160]   That's like, I have $1,300.
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.120]   I'm going to make another $1,300 very quickly.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.840]   I can have this if I want.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.840]   That's the big negative.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.040]   It really is pricey.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.040]   I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:54.680]   It is pricey.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.800]   But again, for people who do nothing but travel, travel,
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.260]   it's like-- I think they'll forget about that.
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:00.700]   And if they have that kind of money,
[01:17:00.700 --> 01:17:02.200]   they'll forget about that purchase
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:03.500]   after their first trip with it.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.620]   Yeah, this is one of the pictures that goes with the review.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:09.820]   A friend of mine has a 17-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.740]   I had to take this picture of the new MacBook on top of it.
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:13.940]   It's making me.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:14.660]   It feels like it--
[01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.020]   It could close the MacBook Pro,
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.740]   and it wouldn't even know there's another experience.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:22.700]   It's like, here's the novelty greeting card
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:26.100]   that Apple ships with the MacBook Pro.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.720]   Here's your startup guide.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.840]   Hey, can I--
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:31.800]   I book a rez posing an interesting Apple Watch connect.
[01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:34.800]   Could I use the Amazon app, which
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.840]   does have one click purchasing on the Apple Watch,
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:40.240]   to buy a MacBook from my watch?
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.000]   Only one way to find out.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.400]   It was just a test.
[01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:47.520]   Because we got at least another half hour on this show,
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.600]   you won't be able to rescind the order.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:50.600]   Oh, no!
[01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:51.600]   No!
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:54.000]   No!
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.800]   Our show today.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.600]   You have the red devil on your shoulder.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.440]   You are!
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.140]   Put Andy on my left shoulder, and I'm afraid there's
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:05.520]   nobody on the right.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:08.640]   No, Angel Andy is also saying, you know what?
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.100]   I think you can be more productive.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:13.720]   Your mission to reach out to your listeners.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.800]   Well, that's what I'm wondering.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.840]   I will have to wait.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.880]   There he is.
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:20.680]   So Susie, get on my left shoulder and tell me things like,
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:22.800]   but the next one will have two chords.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:27.400]   Also, don't share any of those snacks that you received.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:30.200]   You are the one who keeps the entire system afloat.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.800]   Angel Andy, you're small enough to just micro-pop.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:38.000]   Let me just give you a little bit of a micro-fiber.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.200]   I don't know if I have it.
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:42.800]   Our show today, brought to you by Audible.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.200]   I'm having Audible.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:46.000]   I like having little Andy on your shoulder,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.600]   or a little book reader on your shoulder, reading to you.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.120]   I was cooking yesterday.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.200]   And I had-- I put my iPhone in my pocket with a speaker,
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.400]   pointed up, and I listened to my audio books
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:57.640]   as I'm going around.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.920]   I love Audible.com.
[01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.880]   First of all, I love to read.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.640]   Who doesn't love to read?
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.080]   But as I've gotten older, it's harder with on my eyes.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:09.960]   I spend every waking moment doing something like driving,
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.640]   or shopping, or walking the dog, or on the treadmill.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.200]   So I can't hold a book.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   Audible means I get many more hours of listening time in.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:20.480]   And man, I just love Audible.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.800]   Lisa is listening to a great Audible book right now.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:27.440]   It's called The Girl on the Train.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:30.680]   And she says, oh, does this have a twist?
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.840]   The Girl on the Train from Paula Hawkins, she's loving it.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.920]   And this is one of the things Audible does so well.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.640]   There's several narrators in the book.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.480]   So each of them has a different reader,
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:43.560]   Claire Corbett, Louise Briely, and India Fisher.
[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:45.480]   And that's great.
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:49.120]   That in a way, that's something you can't do with a printed page.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:53.840]   It really makes it like you're listening to this incredible story.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.280]   I am.
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.320]   It's reminded me a little bit of Gone Girl, which we also
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.040]   listened to at audible.com.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.400]   I like to listen to a nonfiction as well.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:02.000]   And I just read--
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.960]   that's how I read the Steve Jobs, the Coming Steve Jobs
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.240]   book, and I loved it.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.880]   Neil Stevenson's newest comes out and just--
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.920]   this would be the one if--
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.840]   OK, so here's the deal.
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.680]   We're going to get your free book.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:18.000]   And if I were you, the new Neil Stevenson comes out in a week.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.880]   I might just say, yeah, I'm going to get this as my free book.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.840]   First of all, 31 hours or 55 minutes,
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:26.240]   you're definitely getting your poundage-wise.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:28.400]   You're getting your money's worth.
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.600]   Here's what's going to happen.
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.280]   You go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:31.800]   You'll sign up.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.600]   You won't pay anything for a month.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.480]   In that month, you'll get a credit toward a free book.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.640]   You'll also get the Daily Digest of the New York Times,
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:40.040]   The Wall Street Journal, every day.
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.240]   And you can cancel any time in that first 30 days.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.400]   Pay nothing.
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.960]   The book will be yours to keep forever.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.760]   But you'll-- you see, I think the deal is--
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.120]   I think you're going to love audiobooks,
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:52.240]   but audible understands.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.440]   Oh, Jurassic Park.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:55.760]   Oh, wow.
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.000]   Was that ever on audio?
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.840]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:01.680]   Oh, Scott Brickarizi, he's one of their best.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.800]   I think that probably people say, yeah, the reading is brand new.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:09.400]   2014, or 2015, I should say, by Brilliant's Audio.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.920]   So apparently, this is the 25th anniversary
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.000]   of the Jurassic Park of the novel.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.440]   You might wonder, is that what's that like?
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.680]   I could play a sample.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.080]   Every audiobook has a sample.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:20.720]   I'll go back.
[01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:24.040]   Well, now, Dr. Cruz said, lowering the plastic flap
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:27.280]   of the oxygen tent around Tina, as she slapped.
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:30.600]   Mike Bowman sat beside the bed close to his daughter.
[01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:34.040]   Mike thought Dr. Cruz was probably pretty capable.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:37.280]   He spoke excellent English, the result of training at medical--
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:39.160]   I want to stop the show and finish the book.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.360]   You don't mind, do you?
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.480]   Audible, don't--
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.760]   try it, your first book's free, audible.com/macbreak.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.320]   The only challenge is picking just one.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:47.840]   But you know what?
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.280]   Next month, you get more.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.440]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:53.360]   I didn't ask Andy.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.520]   Usually I ask Andy.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:55.840]   The problem is every time I--
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:56.340]   uh-oh.
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:00.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:00.680]   Come on, Susie.
[01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.440]   Talk me out of it.
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.000]   Come on, Andy.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:02.680]   Talk me into it.
[01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.240]   Come on, Susie.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.400]   Talk me out of it.
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.640]   Every time we do an Audible, I like to ask Andy what he's
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.640]   been listening to.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:11.040]   And the problem with that is that it's
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.120]   doubled the list of books that I just got the Patton Oswalt
[01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:15.040]   book.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.240]   What are you listening to today, Andy?
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.120]   What should I add to my list?
[01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:21.920]   The last Audible book I bought was Dick Cabot
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.560]   has been writing a whole bunch of essays
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.920]   for "Apinionator Essays" for "The New York Times."
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.200]   And so he has a new book, "Brief Encounters, Conversations,
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.320]   Magic Moments," and assorted hijinks.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:34.320]   And it is a whole bunch of these essays read by Dick Cabot.
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.920]   And he's just such a--
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:36.880]   Love his voice.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:37.400]   He just has this--
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.000]   Exactly.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.360]   He's a broadcaster, so he knows how to tell a story.
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.160]   And also he doesn't--
[01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.200]   he knows not to have the microphone right next to his--
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.160]   right next to his--
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:46.680]   And then--
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.680]   --you know, no, to that stuff.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.680]   I've read.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:49.280]   And stuff like that.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:52.760]   He makes sure he has the coffee before he goes and does
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:53.480]   that sort of stuff.
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.320]   But they're well-written pieces.
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.040]   And they're just good old-fashioned, old-style,
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:02.000]   like "Apinion" pieces that you'd find in "The New Yorker"
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.760]   during the heyday of the place.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:09.520]   And like Pat Nosswald's book, somehow it really--
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.600]   it almost seems like it's better suited to spoken word--
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.640]   spoken by the author than it is on the page.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.320]   Because I think I read most of these
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:19.280]   when they were originally printed.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.320]   And I enjoyed them, but hearing him talk this way
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.000]   about being at the funeral for James Gandolfini,
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.040]   I was not representing anybody perhaps.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:32.360]   And it's like, oh, goodness, that's--
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:36.480]   I will make my Apple Watch happy by completing my circle
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.160]   and doing some more walking if it means I get
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.920]   to hear the rest of the story.
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.640]   I asked a learned friend about this.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:44.240]   Dr. J. Meltzer, the legendary physician to whom I--
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:44.960]   He's getting on.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.480]   --medicine until he retired.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.000]   Sounds a little.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.480]   And whom I still go for his culinary gifts
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.360]   and for education and tutoring on tough subjects.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.480]   But you hear that smile?
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.440]   I always-- I feel like he's always making a joke.
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.040]   You know, he's always like a little--
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.320]   Is the next great frontier of discovery.
[01:23:59.320 --> 01:24:01.400]   Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:05.040]   Thank you, Andy, for yet another book I have to add to my endless--
[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:05.600]   You have to--
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.600]   Yes.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:10.320]   --I'm here to make some one thing, the quiet one thing.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.280]   I only wish it could be a material possession that
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.120]   could burden you.
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.120]   And I wish I had to commute.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:15.640]   I wish I had to commute.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:16.800]   I like Audible so much.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:19.120]   I wish I had to commute.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:19.680]   I don't.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.040]   So that's why I listen like every moment while I'm cooking
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.240]   and stuff I just have a plan.
[01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:26.800]   I've said it before.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.160]   My subscription to Audible has really upped my house cleaning
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:33.480]   game because it's like I cannot motivate myself to spend 45
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.880]   minutes back and dusting the living room.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.240]   But if I know that I've got another like Neil
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.200]   Gaiman's book of short stories, I will clean until the end
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:43.840]   of this next short story.
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:46.320]   And sometimes I screw myself because, oh, this is one of the ones
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.400]   that actually takes three--
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.480]   OK, well, I guess I'm going to have to--
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.600]   I'm just going to have to have Neil Gaiman tell me a story
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.440]   while I back.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:53.160]   Oh, Shucks.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:57.240]   Yeah, that's another one I added, the new Neil Gaiman.
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:01.080]   Apple Pay, some big Apple Pay wins.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.880]   First of all, according to time, Apple Pay is creaming
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.640]   currency in the Mobile Payment Wars.
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:08.720]   And what a surprise.
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:14.200]   Walmart's current C is the worst idea ever.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:17.080]   But there are a number of retailers
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:20.320]   who have signed up to this, not just Walmart, but CVS
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.840]   and Target.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.000]   They created the merchant customer exchange.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.920]   And they said, instead of using Apple Pay,
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:28.800]   we're going to do this currency, which
[01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.920]   involves a trade of QR codes.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:32.680]   It's like so clunky.
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:36.840]   And obviously, it's one of the chief benefits of Apple Pay,
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:38.880]   which is that the merchant doesn't get your credit card
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.920]   number or any personal information.
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:43.640]   That's why Walmart doesn't like it.
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.960]   The good news is, it isn't working.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.920]   And I went to the CVS the other day,
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.840]   and I tried to use my Apple Pay.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:53.840]   And they said, no, those things aren't hooked up.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:56.360]   I just said, then I'm not hooked up either.
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:57.920]   I'm out of here.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:58.720]   Actually, I did buy it.
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.000]   But it's enough to make me not want to go.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.760]   Yeah, I mean, I do find myself shopping at places
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.840]   if I can use my Google Wallet to pay for it.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.560]   I mean, if I'm not going to buy something,
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.360]   I wouldn't buy other ones.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.480]   That's part of it.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:14.560]   It actually makes buying things kind of fun.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.480]   Or at least you feel better.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.080]   It's easier.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.440]   You get emailed receipts.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:20.680]   And it's a lot more trusted transaction.
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.400]   I got to say, though, I did read that report.
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.640]   And I was a little bit confused by it,
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.320]   because I wasn't aware that currency was actually
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.480]   deployed.
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:29.960]   I don't think it might say the S. I think--
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:30.600]   I don't know.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.360]   I think it's still being tested.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.160]   So how could it be a winner or a loser is what you're saying?
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:35.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.360]   But well, it's a loser.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:36.360]   Definitely.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.360]   We just don't have to lose it.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.360]   That's how.
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.320]   Because it's always a horse race.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:40.640]   Right.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.760]   It has to be a horse race, doesn't it?
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.280]   I have to.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:43.280]   I have to.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:43.840]   It's not a technical specs.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.680]   It's terrible.
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.840]   It's like-- it really is exactly what a coalition
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:53.800]   of national stores would create for themselves.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.360]   They would say, we don't want to bother ourselves
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.080]   by having to install special equipment that
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.160]   makes it easy for this stuff to operate.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:02.720]   So we can just do the cheapest way possible,
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.680]   make it as difficult as possible with a consumer.
[01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:07.120]   Also, we're going to make sure we're collecting as much data
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.320]   as possible, stuff we could never get
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.320]   if we were just doing Apple Pay.
[01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.000]   And also, we're going to share this information
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.720]   with all the other people in our coalition.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:15.280]   And guess what?
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.520]   Because this is also an app, we can actually
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.960]   have the app tracking our user and making sure we know
[01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:22.240]   exactly where that person is at all times.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:26.720]   And it's just such jerk behavior that I've been actually
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:29.280]   I've been actively telling people just don't even install it,
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.920]   don't even use it, whenever it ships,
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.960]   it's just such a so the wrong way to do it.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.440]   And I can't imagine that it will get anything
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:42.240]   like a toehold on phone payments that NFC, Google Wallet,
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.600]   and Apple Pay have.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.360]   It's just ridiculous.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.480]   Yeah, they want to cut out the credit card companies entirely.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.040]   And they want to go from currency.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:50.440]   Well, that's right.
[01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:52.040]   Doesn't user credit card, does it?
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.680]   No, because Walmart and those big stores,
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.280]   they pay their credit card fees.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.880]   And that's billions of dollars a year for them.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.840]   So they want to cut out the credit card C.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.640]   And Walmart would love to just basically become your bank
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:05.800]   at some point.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.440]   And so they're trying to save money
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:10.600]   and have it be good for them, whereas Apple Pay
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:12.840]   is set up to be good for the consumer.
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.120]   And I think that they've done a really good job of that.
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.200]   Like the candy says, it doesn't track you.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.800]   It doesn't pass along your credit card information.
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:25.760]   Home Depot, who I think was part of this MCS merchant exchange
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:28.160]   possibly, but now they're saying, no, we're
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:29.040]   going to go do Apple Pay.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.720]   We want to get in on Apple Pay.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.440]   And that's one of the reasons that people use Apple Pay
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.560]   is because there was that big Home Depot breach,
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.640]   and everyone had to get new credit card numbers.
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:40.720]   So the consumer isn't liable for fraud or anything,
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.000]   but that's still-- that's a pain in the butt.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:46.440]   So you get consumer protections with your credit card,
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.000]   and you're not liable for fraud,
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.600]   but the merchants have to pay a fee every time
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:54.560]   they use it, and that's what currency wants to eliminate.
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:57.400]   Home Depot says, 2000 stores, it'll
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:00.920]   be the largest installation of Apple Pay anywhere.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:01.680]   I think you're right.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.320]   I seem to remember their name in that currency list.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.920]   They want to put it in 2000 stores.
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:13.120]   And of course, those of us who are Apple--
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.640]   fanboys will actually shop there more,
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.200]   because they have Apple Pay.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:18.800]   I don't find it that much more useful,
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.080]   but with it on the watch, I just find
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.760]   that I still have to do so many--
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.560]   at least at our grocery store across the street.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.000]   So many fiddly bits.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.560]   I still have to say credit or debit.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:31.040]   I have to-- on my ATM, I have to give them a pin.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.400]   I still have to say cash back or not.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.520]   And so by that time, the savings--
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.760]   Paper plastered.
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:39.520]   Yeah, well, no, we don't get that choice in California.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:42.160]   Oh, not a coffee free or anything.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.240]   Mostly, it's like, do you want to buy a bag is the one I get
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:47.800]   all the time now?
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:51.800]   So customers apparently were able to use--
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.520]   if you're saying, wait a minute, I had--
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.760]   the Home Depot had Apple Pay.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.040]   Some of the Home Depot's had Apple Pay.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:29:58.520]   Just because--
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:01.280]   Yeah, a store doesn't have to be officially supporting Apple
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:01.560]   Pay.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.000]   If they have an NFC terminal, you can try it and it works.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.560]   I used my Apple Pay on my iPhone 6 at CVS on launch day.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.360]   And then the next day, they turned it off.
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:10.840]   It turned it off.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.480]   So annoying.
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:12.400]   Yeah, me too.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.480]   So a lot of places, if you see that little symbol that
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.520]   looks like a Wi-Fi system--
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:16.320]   It just works.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.760]   --it turns over on its side, just give it
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.480]   a try, and most of the time it works.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.800]   That's very cool.
[01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.920]   I wonder if the question is if it really works,
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:25.640]   or if, in fact, those charges just go into Never Never Land.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:27.280]   But does it really work?
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.240]   Yeah, it really works.
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:32.440]   I don't know if it tested, unfortunately.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:37.600]   Let's talk-- apparently, the Beats is imminent.
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.360]   Some are saying that Apple will announce it at WWDC, which
[01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:43.000]   seems about right for the timeline.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.600]   That would be late June.
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:51.120]   We would also get iOS 8.4 at that time.
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.600]   Stories all over.
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:56.160]   We mentioned last week that Apple was getting a little--
[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.560]   kind of the stink eye from the federal government
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:01.640]   for going to music labels and saying,
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:06.800]   be nice if you didn't give away free music on Spotify, hint, hint.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:10.560]   Which is obviously anti-competitive.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:17.440]   Spotify's accusing Apple of anti-competitive behavior as well.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:19.440]   Does anybody have anything to say?
[01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:21.000]   I feel like the silence here tells me
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.840]   that you're all on the beta of Beats,
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.000]   and you're just laughing at me now.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.600]   No, I just--
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:28.760]   We're just waiting.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.560]   Just waiting.
[01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:30.560]   Nothing to say.
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:33.200]   It's kind of like a--
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.280]   it's interesting.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:38.320]   It'll be an interesting test to see why Spotify is so popular
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:40.360]   that if-- let's say that Apple--
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:42.200]   or excuse me, let's say that the labels that
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:45.680]   have a lot of motivation to turn off free streaming
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.680]   because they want to make money from subscriptions.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.960]   They want to make money, period.
[01:31:49.960 --> 01:31:52.680]   It's interesting to see if the reason why Spotify and some
[01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.040]   of these services are so popular is because people
[01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.520]   like not having to pay for things.
[01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.600]   And even if you tell people to pay $8 to $10 a month,
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:00.840]   that's not a hell of a lot of money,
[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:03.040]   but that's the difference between free and not free.
[01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:07.040]   So it'll be interesting to see how this shakes out.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.040]   Personally, I think that a lot of it's going to come down
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.760]   to ease of use.
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:14.160]   Once you have one of these services,
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.480]   you tend to use it a lot.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:16.800]   You tend to live in it.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.400]   And so I personally use RDO rather than Spotify
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.520]   because at the time I was making the decision,
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:24.800]   Spotify's interface wasn't as good.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:27.800]   And I think that will be a question with Apple
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:31.320]   if they're forcing us into iTunes and the usual iTunes
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.320]   interface.
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:35.000]   It may just be annoying to a lot of people.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.680]   If it's a separate app, maybe not.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:37.680]   I don't know.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:38.680]   We'll have to wait and see.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:41.840]   But I do feel as though they're all offering kind
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.240]   of the same thing.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.240]   So it's six to one half dozen of another.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:46.440]   And you'll be making your decision
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.000]   based on personal preference in terms of interface.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.960]   Or maybe the price will be just a hair different
[01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:54.240]   if you get a family plan, that kind of thing.
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:55.640]   Yeah, I use RDO2.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:58.920]   And one of the things that I like using it on my Mac
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.200]   is that I don't really launch iTunes very much anymore.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.760]   So that's been a hidden benefit.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:07.120]   And I love using it.
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:08.320]   It's a very cross platform.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.680]   I use it on my iPhone.
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:15.160]   But when you have all your music in the music app on the iPhone,
[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.200]   you can have Siri play you a song.
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.840]   I can't do that with RDO.
[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:21.600]   So Apple has an advantage that they
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:26.120]   can build whatever service they have so deeply into the ecosystem
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.440]   that you're already using.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.520]   So that'll really help.
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:32.520]   And then like Adam said, all the services are really similar.
[01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:36.120]   So what Beats, I think, is trying to do and also titles.
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.280]   And Stacey relaunched it.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.880]   Is there going for like exclusives?
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.960]   So they want to get Taylor Swift to pull all her music off Spotify.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:47.400]   They want to make her a sweet deal so all her stuff is on Beats.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:52.240]   And that's where they're going to try to hang their hat is the curation
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.160]   and the exclusives.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:59.440]   But it'll remain to be seen if that's enough to get a lot of people to switch.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.760]   How sticky are these services?
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.800]   Well, they actually are fairly sticky because once you've got a big collection
[01:34:04.800 --> 01:34:07.000]   and one of them, it's a pain in the butt to move.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.200]   Collection, you mean like playlists?
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.320]   No, I mean, literally, well, maybe people do it differently than I do.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:14.560]   I don't make playlists, but I go through it, I favorite stuff.
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.080]   OK.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:17.840]   And so I can then play my favorites just in a big, you know,
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:20.320]   randomize everything or I can go to a specific artist.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.400]   I tend not to do playlists.
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:23.720]   It's not the different--
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:24.640]   But I don't want to export.
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:26.360]   It's not what's--
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:27.680]   Yeah, because that's the question.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:29.120]   It's the same music on all of it, right?
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.400]   Everybody's there.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.840]   But how do I get that list out?
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:32.840]   I see it because I ran it.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:36.280]   I found all these great weird bands in Rario when I liked their music,
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.520]   but I'm going to have to go and literally write them down.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:41.080]   Well, I wonder if I could find a few lists somewhere.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:44.680]   Wouldn't it behoove Apple to have some sort of import capability?
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:47.880]   Or maybe they need cooperation from Beats?
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.760]   I mean, from Spotify?
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.440]   I think they need cooperation.
[01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:54.360]   Unless there's some way of--
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:58.520]   Can you export your export Spotify collections?
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.520]   Just not--
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.720]   I don't know about Spotify and Rario.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:01.720]   There's no way to do that.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:04.080]   And what I've been hoping is is that there's deep in the system
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:06.320]   somewhere like a playlist file that keeps track of all this
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:06.840]   whole data.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:07.280]   But I don't think so.
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:09.680]   I think it's just a web interface.
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:12.240]   Jay Z says you can import playlists from Spotify
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.120]   to title according to the chat room.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:16.080]   But Jay Z has been known to say many things.
[01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.480]   That's--
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.520]   Yeah, that would be really handy if you could take your playlist
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.400]   with you when you left.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:24.320]   But I don't know why Spotify and RDO
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:26.760]   would want to let you take your playlist with you when you left.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.480]   But that would-- boy, that would--
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.800]   that's the stickiness, right?
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:32.880]   And every other respect, I mean, you
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:33.480]   can move around.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.360]   The prices are the same.
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:38.800]   Everything's $10 a month, except for title, which you pay extra
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.200]   for high quality if you want to.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:44.520]   Warner Music, which is one of the big five record labels--
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:45.600]   I guess it's down to big three.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.600]   I don't know how many there are anymore--
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.040]   says streaming revenue surpassed revenue from downloads
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:53.320]   for the first time ever.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.080]   I don't understand, because aren't they saying over and over
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.880]   again how streaming is losing the money?
[01:35:57.880 --> 01:36:00.560]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.920]   In this quarter, says Warner, we saw continued growth
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:03.720]   in streaming revenue.
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:05.480]   It surpassed download revenue for the first time
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:09.680]   in the history of our recorded music business.
[01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:13.480]   40% of the record label.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:17.240]   43.9% of the total revenue is now--
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:19.640]   to Warner is now streaming.
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:22.080]   That's a 0.7% improvement.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:22.920]   Wow.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.800]   So I don't know what is the rest.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:28.720]   If they're roughly equal, that means we've
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.000]   got to 10% of revenue from other sources.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.040]   What, cocaine sales?
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.520]   I don't know what that would be.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.520]   I don't know what that would be.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:43.720]   Anyway, I for one will be very interested to see what Beats does.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.320]   I use Google All Access.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.200]   And there is a feature, both Amazon and Google
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.000]   offer, that Apple could offer, that would be RDO and Spotify.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.880]   That's the ability to upload your existing library.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.920]   And Apple, because it has iTunes Match,
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.880]   it probably already has that information, right?
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:01.960]   If they included that in Beats, would that be interesting to you?
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:04.720]   The reason I say that, for instance, I have the entire Beatles
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:07.120]   collection, which you can't listen to once.
[01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:09.960]   I don't think on Spotify or RDO.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.520]   But because it's in my library, I can listen to it
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.120]   on Google All Access.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:18.680]   I thought RDO let you access your music on the local device.
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.640]   I don't do that because--
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:20.400]   But it's not local.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:20.920]   I have it.
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:21.960]   It's not going to be on my phone.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:22.960]   It's at home.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:26.800]   But because I uploaded it to Google Play, to Google Music,
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:29.840]   I can stream it on my phone.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.800]   Yeah, I almost listened.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.720]   I listened to RDO almost entirely on my main Mac.
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:37.040]   So I don't really care too much about the phone
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.600]   for the amount that I'm losing it there.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.720]   But that would be a competitive advantage.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.560]   And by the way, for me, it would be a disadvantage.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.440]   If Beats doesn't do that, there's not a chance in hell
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:47.160]   I'm going to switch over.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:50.040]   But there are a lot of people who, like me, who pay $25 a year
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.400]   for iTunes Match, Apple knows my music library.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.280]   They have my entire music library.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.160]   I mean, thinking about it, it makes
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:01.080]   sense that Apple would build this into iTunes, much as I sort
[01:38:01.080 --> 01:38:02.840]   of hate to say that.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:05.640]   And so once the music is in iTunes,
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.760]   one would hope that they would be able to access your existing
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.040]   library at the same time.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:16.560]   Well, we'll just see.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:19.800]   I have a fantasy, which I realize is a total fantasy,
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:23.560]   that Apple has been rewriting iTunes.
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:30.080]   Like totally rewriting iTunes, and that this will be a brand new
[01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:32.720]   iTunes in addition to Beats.
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.520]   Can they say version 12 was already rewritten?
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:36.920]   It's not rewritten.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.600]   It's rewritten to break it, but it's not--
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:41.960]   Yeah, I mean, I--
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.760]   Because different is good.
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:44.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:47.240]   I realize that the one thing that would get me as a user
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.640]   really interested in Beats is if they said the first part
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:55.400]   of a half hour presentation on Apple devices is we threw out
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.280]   iTunes, started all over again.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:01.040]   If they did something as radical with their music app
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.720]   as they did with their Photos app,
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.280]   that would get my attention in a huge, huge hour.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.760]   Because it's like the students were saying earlier,
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:11.200]   it's like I'm looking for ways to avoid using iTunes
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.680]   if I can possibly not use it.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:17.200]   It's the reason-- one of the reasons why I'm using the Amazon
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.840]   music app and then the Google music app is simply because it's
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:23.120]   not iTunes and it's not the built-in iOS music app.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.560]   When I was-- I still remember when I was testing the--
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.960]   when I got the iPhone 6 to review.
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.840]   And here is what it took to import my entire library
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:34.400]   from Amazon Music, tap two buttons,
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.880]   and then like about-- after 20 minutes of downloads later,
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.840]   all of my music was on this device.
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:43.960]   And yet I had an Apple device connected to an Apple Macintosh
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.480]   using an Apple Music service and nothing
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.600]   for no amount of please to God or any otherworldly entity
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.640]   could get music off of this machine and into that phone.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:57.600]   And I'm like, god.
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:00.440]   Apple built their whole-- Apple's the company that
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:01.800]   fixed music on devices.
[01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:05.200]   How do they break it again?
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.000]   Any shot at high-res music, the Apple hardware,
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.360]   I don't think, can play it back.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:12.360]   If you go to the MIDI app, you can turn it up
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:16.120]   to a higher sampling rate, but you can't do 24-bit.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.000]   I don't think.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.080]   Is there any indication that people would pay money for it,
[01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.320]   that people care about that?
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.320]   I would.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.040]   But you can't hear it.
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.800]   Yeah, it's just a small market, right?
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:25.640]   Yeah, I can't.
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:31.560]   People listen to music in the car, end of story.
[01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:33.360]   So they take it back.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.720]   You can go to 96, 24.
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:40.760]   I don't know if that-- is that done in the Dacriff?
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:43.400]   It's up sampled, but you can do that.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.440]   So you have to use the audio MIDI setup
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.040]   to turn up the resolution.
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:53.400]   All right, let's see.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.480]   What else before we take a break and get our picks?
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:41:00.360]   Anything else you guys want to talk about?
[01:41:00.360 --> 01:41:03.840]   We did briefly mention Marco Armit's article on redesigning
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:05.440]   overcast for the Apple Watch.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:09.880]   If you haven't read it, you should read it.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:11.960]   iPhone 6s.
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:13.200]   According to Apple Insider.
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.160]   We'll come.
[01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:15.160]   Nobody knows.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.960]   But according to Apple Insider, we'll come in rose gold
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.360]   featuring two gigs of RAM.
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:24.840]   Believe it or not, the iPhone is still a gig RAM, right?
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:26.200]   And a 12 megapixel camera.
[01:41:26.200 --> 01:41:28.200]   We're hearing lots of rumors about that camera being
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.160]   some sort of interesting new ray tracing camera or something.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:34.000]   This is from Ming-Chi.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.640]   Whoa, it was pretty good.
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:38.040]   I want an X-ray camera.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:38.840]   X-ray.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.560]   X-ray specs, just like in the comic books.
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.560]   Yeah, just like in the comic books.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.760]   I want an MRI.
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.440]   So that-- oh, yeah.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.040]   How about a functional MRI?
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:48.800]   Exactly.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.440]   Yeah, you start thinking about things
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.480]   and it can see and hear--
[01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:55.160]   Do I need to go in for the sependousitis thing right now?
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:57.480]   Or can I complete binge watching Game of Thrones?
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:01.200]   Oh, that twinkle.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:02.000]   And like--
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.600]   And three floating shaving heads.
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.440]   Wouldn't that--
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:10.040]   While you're shaving, it's diagnosing your jaw.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:13.040]   You're keeping your face--
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:13.960]   Kissively smooth.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.920]   Mm.
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.720]   iPhone could be so much more.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:18.640]   Don't we agree?
[01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:19.000]   No.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.200]   You're going to need a towel left for your phone, though.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:21.560]   Yes.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:22.640]   Cross over.
[01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:23.400]   That's what we're talking.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:26.080]   Cross over.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.720]   Actually, I guess the amount of RAM in an iPhone
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:30.680]   isn't really meaningful to compare that to, say, three gigs
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.760]   of RAM in my Galaxy S6 because it's the operating system
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:38.200]   is tuned for that space, right?
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:41.480]   Yeah, but I don't think anybody has ever said, oh my god,
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:44.000]   this thing is so slow, there's just so much damn application
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.200]   RAM in this thing.
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:51.160]   I would never fault an iPhone for having less than another phone
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:52.480]   with the internet running on their operating system.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:55.160]   But nonetheless, I wouldn't necessarily
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:42:57.360]   think it's a bad thing if they added more RAM.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:58.200]   It's like calories.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:00.640]   More is better when you're putting it in any way.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.960]   Or fewer is.
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.520]   Or fewer is better if you're eating it.
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:05.520]   No, I don't know.
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:07.320]   Meetingless number, which--
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:10.280]   I need my watch to tell me which one is good.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.440]   Should I eat or burn?
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:15.280]   I am literally rather less without my watch
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:17.160]   to tell me how I'm living my life.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:18.560]   Want to create a website?
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:21.200]   I got to tell you squarespace.com.
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:24.440]   My daughter and her best friend just created a nonprofit
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.920]   themselves, and they created the website on Squarespace.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.880]   They registered a domain name.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.760]   Actually, Squarespace gives that to you for free when
[01:43:31.760 --> 01:43:33.720]   you sign up for a year.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:35.200]   They tied it together.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:36.640]   It's amazing.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.920]   Squarespace lets you--
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:39.880]   I mean, these--
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:43.520]   Abby and Katie had no experience doing web design.
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:47.440]   They made a gorgeous looking site with lots of features,
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:49.680]   including e-commerce.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:52.280]   Every Squarespace template has a e-commerce.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.280]   And if you've ran into difficulty,
[01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:56.240]   you just--
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:59.600]   Squarespace is live and chat and email support 24/7.
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.800]   So it's easy.
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:03.520]   And it starts at just $8 a month.
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:04.480]   That includes the hosting.
[01:44:04.480 --> 01:44:05.600]   That includes the software.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:09.040]   Tightly integrated, so you really get an amazing experience.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:10.840]   And as I said, when you buy a year,
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.400]   you get a free domain name.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:13.560]   All of them are responsive.
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:17.040]   That means they look good on any size screen.
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:19.680]   And this new cover page's thing is great.
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:22.080]   You could set up a beautiful one page online presence
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:22.960]   in minutes.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:25.680]   Just create a quick landing page for a brand, a personal
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:28.680]   identity to promote a new product, a new event.
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:30.240]   You'll love-- I mean, if you're a musician,
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:34.360]   they have templates that let you do concert dates and sell
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:34.880]   music.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:36.240]   I've just so great.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:39.040]   Squarespace, the place to create a professional website,
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.760]   blog, or online store.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:43.840]   Elegant, beautiful, simple, powerful.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:45.320]   I want you to start your trial.
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:46.160]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:47.400]   Just go to squarespace.com.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.080]   Click the Get Started button.
[01:44:49.080 --> 01:44:51.400]   You've got two weeks to build your site.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:53.280]   You can even import data from your old site
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:55.400]   and try it out, see how it looks.
[01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:00.320]   Switch around back and forth with the different templates.
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:01.840]   If you decide to buy, don't forget
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:03.200]   to use our offer code MACBreak.

[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.480]   That's an excellent deal.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.480]   Time for a pixel of the week.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:22.040]   I'm going to kick things off because I got a little thing.
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.160]   For Andy and Aco, this is from NewerTech.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:27.120]   It's called a snuglet.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:28.600]   Have you seen these?
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:29.960]   I've seen them.
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:32.840]   It helps prevent accidental disconnection of MagSafe
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:34.920]   two connectors.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.400]   You put the little snuglet-- what the snuglet basically is
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:42.880]   is a shim, little metal shim, that you put around your MagSafe
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:48.120]   two just to add a little bit to the size and heft of it.
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.000]   And then it's not going to fall out as easily.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.280]   Because I don't-- it doesn't particularly bother me.
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:56.480]   But everybody agrees that MagSafe two
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:59.480]   seems to fall out a little bit easier for some.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:05.240]   And so it's a snap to just literally snap it in,
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:06.520]   put it into your MagSafe.
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.720]   And it's going to be snugger-- whoops.
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:12.000]   Just sucked it right off of there.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.440]   It's going to be snugger.
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:15.600]   Can you see this?
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:18.240]   I guess I can't get this in the shot.
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:21.560]   That it ever was before.
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:22.040]   Oh, wow.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.960]   Now it's really in there.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.520]   They actually-- sometimes it's so tight,
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:27.520]   they have to give you a little snuglet removal tool.
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:29.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:32.600]   Let's you pry it out.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.320]   Newer tech, they do good stuff.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:36.640]   And this is actually a really interesting kind
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:41.400]   of solution to a problem that Andy's been bitching about
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.520]   for a long time.
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:46.600]   Snuglet, how much is it?
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:48.240]   Is it say?
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:50.800]   I don't see.
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:52.920]   $10 for two of them.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:56.120]   I literally can't get my cable out now.
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:57.280]   It's stuck.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:58.280]   Problem solved.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:02.560]   It's hardwired now.
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:03.400]   Whoops.
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:04.320]   I can't--
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:04.840]   It's not.
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:07.120]   You just succeeded in creating the KPro 2000.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:07.480]   Oh, good.
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:08.280]   I got it.
[01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:09.640]   But now the snuglet's stuck in there.
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:12.800]   That's why you need the snuglet removal tool.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.280]   I'd like to circle back to my earlier point
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:17.200]   that perhaps this was poorly designed
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.920]   and Apple should revisit their design.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.760]   I can't get it out.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:24.400]   All right, now I have to buy a MacBook.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:25.360]   There you go.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.560]   Oh, man.
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:29.640]   Oh.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:32.040]   Andy, you have a pick?
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:32.760]   Indeed I do.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.920]   We were talking about photos earlier.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.280]   And this is something that I saw a promoter on the Mac Store
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:39.920]   over the weekend and downloaded it.
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.960]   And then downloaded the demo and then
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.000]   was buying the full version about 20 minutes later.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000]   It's called Noiseless.
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.920]   And it's a really simple noise reduction app
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:53.040]   for your photos, especially when you're taking pictures
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:55.680]   at night and your iPhone or even your SLR
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:01.080]   has to up the ISO's to get to get a proper exposure.
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.560]   Because there's so much more power being dumped
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:08.760]   into the image sensor, there's a lot more heat
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:11.840]   and creates all these randomly colored faculty noises.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.840]   And since time immemorial, there's
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:17.640]   been software that tries to make this stuff less noticeable.
[01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:20.520]   I don't think I've seen another app that makes it as easy
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:21.520]   as Noiseless.
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:24.400]   It will analyze the image for content
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:29.000]   and try to apply the best level of noise reduction,
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.080]   the most intelligent level of noise reduction.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:33.240]   And if it guesses wrong, it's not--
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.640]   the actual app isn't that much more complicated than what
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:37.280]   you're seeing in this web demo.
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:39.360]   You can just do quick ABs.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.280]   There are about-- it gives you like little big buttons
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.480]   on the other side of the screen that simply say,
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:45.800]   more intense, less intense.
[01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:48.320]   And for each one, you can do fine-tune things.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.360]   Or you can take it fully off of automatic
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.480]   and get just this page full of sliders that
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:53.920]   let you adjust things.
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:57.680]   I took some pictures at 6,400 ISO, which is really high ISO
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:59.720]   for the camera that I have at Yosemite.
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:01.720]   But I had to because I'm using a long zoom
[01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:04.120]   and I'm taking pictures of a moving critter.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:06.080]   And you're sort of-- you see there on the left,
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.920]   you sort of have to settle for-- there's
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:09.120]   going to have to be a lot of noise.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:12.320]   That was even with Adobe Lightroom doing noise reduction.
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:14.840]   That's the best I could get it with Adobe Lightroom's built-in
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:15.480]   noise reduction.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.800]   Wow, that's amazing.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:17.320]   Exactly.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:20.040]   And on the right there, that was about 30 seconds.
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.360]   There was really no more than--
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.520]   it automatically shows intense, which sort of smoothed it out
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:28.200]   so much that you couldn't see all the details and the feathers.
[01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:31.080]   I went two clicks lower and then even then took the slider
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.720]   for moderate and took it down a little bit.
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:35.800]   So I didn't even have to go into the really super sophisticated
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:36.960]   fine-tune controls.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:39.520]   It was just-- nope, not less less less.
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:40.400]   OK, that's about right.
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:41.240]   A little bit less than that.
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:41.760]   Perfect.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:43.360]   Let's ship that one.
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:48.480]   And because it can work as a handoff app for Lightroom
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:51.320]   and other apps, you can use it.
[01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:52.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:53.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:55.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:57.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:49:58.320]   And it's a good thing.
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:59.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:00.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:01.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:02.320]   And it's a good thing.
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:03.320]   It's a good thing.
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.320]   And you can just push it in PixelMader.
[01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:08.320]   And just simply, at this point, I really want to apply some better
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:09.320]   noise reduction.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:12.320]   And then you-- it hands off to the noise list.
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.320]   And then you're done.
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.320]   And then that file, that TIFF file,
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:17.320]   gets handed right back to the app and gets round-tripped.
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.320]   And you don't even have to deal with it.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:22.600]   You have 30 seconds to put this into a desktop app,
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:25.560]   or even a really good mobile app to just--
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.920]   an app that does nothing but take care of noise reduction for you.
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.120]   So this is why--
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:31.640]   we're, I think, we're all paying close attention
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.760]   to see what Apple does with the iPhone's success.
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:38.120]   Because there's an argument to be made that maybe it's not
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.560]   quite so important now to have a really fancy schmancy image
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:46.080]   sensor if the CPU on the device is powerful enough
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:47.960]   to do post-processing later on.
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:51.120]   But yeah, as you can see, it's pretty much as quick and easy
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:52.360]   as that.
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.440]   And as I said, it was one of those wonderful things
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:57.080]   where $18--
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:57.560]   I don't know.
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:58.400]   I want to risk $18.
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:50:59.080]   Oh, there's a demo.
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:50:59.520]   Oh, OK.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:01.760]   I guess I'll use the demo then $18.
[01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:02.600]   And it's like, a lot of money.
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:04.400]   Let's buy this $15 right now.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.640]   And let's reprocess everything I've posted on Flickr
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:08.080]   for the past six months.
[01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:10.760]   Actually, $18 is cheap for a plugin like this.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.760]   That's nothing.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:14.680]   And the great thing is it exists as a standalone app,
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:17.440]   so it's not necessarily getting a minimize stripped-down
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.160]   interface, really easy to use.
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.800]   And I can't argue with the results.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:23.200]   They also have a pro version for $50 that
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:27.720]   has additional features, including raw, which is--
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:31.080]   Yeah, I think it will--
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:32.480]   in lightroom, at least, lightroom will
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:37.280]   export a TIFF file that is the same depth as a raw file.
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:37.640]   Sure.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.800]   So I have to plea ignorance.
[01:51:39.800 --> 01:51:41.320]   All I saw was the price differential
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:43.800]   between the regular version and the pro version.
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:44.800]   And said, well, tell you what, why
[01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.200]   don't I just give them the $18 for this?
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:48.240]   And then later on, I'll convince myself
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:49.200]   if I need the pro version.
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:52.280]   And the ordinary version seems to work just fine for me.
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:56.520]   Neat from Mac Fun, M-A-C-P-H-U-N.
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.000]   Mac P-H-N.
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:51:59.440]   Mac P-H-N.
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:02.520]   Oh, that's how you say it.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:04.880]   Susie Oaks, you got a pick for us?
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:05.240]   I don't know.
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.560]   Did they warn you?
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:07.080]   No.
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:07.840]   You know what?
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:08.200]   I didn't.
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:08.880]   I apologize.
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:09.880]   Oh my god.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:10.800]   Ah, it's OK.
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:13.400]   Think if you want, you could think, and I'll have Adam do it.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:14.200]   No, I got one.
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:14.720]   OK.
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:15.920]   Fire away.
[01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:18.560]   So one of our awesome freelancers, Andrew Hayward,
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:20.760]   did a roundup of Apple Watch games.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:21.240]   Oh.
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:22.560]   And I know you're thinking, why would I
[01:52:22.560 --> 01:52:24.080]   want to play a game on my Apple Watch?
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:25.000]   That's bananas.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.920]   It'll kill the battery fast.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:29.440]   Nope, but there's a few of them that are kind of cool.
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:31.440]   I've been playing one called Lifeline.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:32.360]   Yes, that is cool.
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:33.120]   It's $3.
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.560]   You buy it on the phone, and then it has a watch thing.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:37.720]   And so it's like text adventures.
[01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:39.000]   Remember text adventures?
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:42.160]   So it's you and another person, not another person.
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:45.160]   You're texting back and forth with the character and the game,
[01:52:45.160 --> 01:52:46.480]   and it's a real time thing.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:49.120]   So he crash landed, and he says, OK, I got to go over there
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:50.160]   and see something.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:52.520]   It's going to take me two hours to hike there, and you say, OK,
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:53.120]   go check it out.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:55.520]   And then two hours later, your watch is going to buzz.
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:56.720]   Oh, that's good.
[01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:57.240]   That's good.
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:52:57.800]   We use that.
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:52:59.400]   Real time, thing all day.
[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:03.200]   And it's not-- it's easy to control.
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:06.240]   It's easy to get into, and the story really sucks you in.
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:08.360]   So I'm not a great gamer.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:09.680]   I can't play shooters.
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:11.200]   I can't play driving games.
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:13.200]   But I'm a sucker for a good story,
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:14.800]   and this has a good story.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.760]   So $3, check it out.
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:17.480]   I really like it.
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.840]   If you have an Apple watch and you want to do something unique,
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:23.040]   that's built right for the watch, and it's entertaining.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:23.800]   Lifeline.
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:25.160]   Lifeline.
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:28.480]   It's not-- it's like real time Zork, which is cool.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:53:29.400 --> 01:53:30.400]   I like that idea.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.760]   Yeah, Megan talked about this on iPad today yesterday,
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:34.480]   and I really seem like fun.
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:53:36.120 --> 01:53:38.480]   That's not to diminish the contribution.
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:38.760]   Well, yeah.
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:39.560]   Now you just--
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:40.160]   No, no, no.
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:40.660]   No, no.
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:41.320]   Another endorsement.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:43.920]   And then you should go to Macworld.com and read all of them,
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:44.680]   right?
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:45.180]   Yeah.
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:47.880]   We found 10, and I was really--
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:49.640]   I was like, Apple watch games.
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:50.800]   Does he like trivia crack?
[01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:52.360]   Because I see I could do it on the watch.
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:53.560]   I think that one's in here.
[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.800]   The watch is so limited, because it doesn't do animation.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:53:59.000]   It really just does slide shows.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.120]   So it's perfect for something like that.
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.640]   Text it.
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:04.840]   AdamAnks, tidbits.com.
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:07.480]   Giant Penguin sneaking up on you.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:08.480]   Giant.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:09.800]   They're really not very stealthy.
[01:54:09.800 --> 01:54:14.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.240]   OK, so I have an unusual one.
[01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:19.720]   Website, applespecialist.com.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:22.040]   What I was in fact-- I was out by you last week.
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:24.600]   I was in San Francisco and field trip up to Nevada
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:25.720]   for C Drive savers.
[01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:28.680]   But that was there for the ASMC conference.
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:30.120]   This was a bunch of Apple Specialists.
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:32.600]   Now, we talk a lot about Apple stores,
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:36.280]   the big gleaming class edifices of commerce.
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:38.840]   But there are still hundreds and hundreds
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:42.240]   of independent Apple resellers and service people out there.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:43.120]   And I had no idea.
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.080]   It really didn't occur to me that there were this many of them.
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.520]   And that's our conference.
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:49.920]   So I was like, wow, there's a whole lot of people here.
[01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:50.960]   Who knew?
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:53.080]   And so these are the mom and pop stores
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:56.080]   that are helping small businesses.
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:57.240]   They're doing training.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.880]   They're doing all sorts of cool stuff that Apple stores,
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:01.320]   maybe not so much.
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:03.440]   Where you walk in and you're thinking, oh my goodness,
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:06.520]   there's a whole lot of 20-somethings and t-shirts here.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:10.080]   And so one person I talked to said
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.240]   that the Apple Specialists are Apple stores for grownups.
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:14.640]   So I would just encourage people,
[01:55:14.640 --> 01:55:17.280]   if you're looking for an Apple reseller who will sit down
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:21.360]   and talk with you, go to the applespecialists.com site
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:22.760]   and see if there's any around you.
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:24.680]   Unfortunately, there's none real--
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:27.040]   Yeah, I said I was just surprised.
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:28.280]   I gather it's a tough business.
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:30.360]   I mean, Apple will actually open stores
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.760]   around the corner from them and put them out of business.
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:36.120]   But nonetheless, there's still a lot of them out there.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:40.040]   And they're doing great stuff in terms of you need something
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:42.000]   a little different.
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.680]   Frankly, the Apple store gets too busy or whatnot.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:46.920]   And they say, yeah, go take your broken iPhone
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:48.120]   off to these people.
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:50.600]   Mac Fusion in San Diego or somewhere.
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:53.000]   And they're doing the same kind of service.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.480]   They're all totally Apple authorized.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:58.120]   They're selling totally official Apple devices.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.520]   They can't get the Apple watch yet,
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:02.080]   but they do sell the iPad and the Mac.
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.680]   And they're getting better at the iPhone.
[01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:07.080]   There's carrier issues with that.
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:07.640]   But is it?
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:08.680]   I was surprised.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:11.680]   I just think people should, hey, support your local businesses.
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:13.840]   And if you can do that while buying your Apple products,
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:14.920]   all the more power.
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:17.880]   I couldn't agree more.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:19.680]   Actually, we have on this weekend Enterprise Tech.
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:23.200]   We had a sponsor, New York company that did that.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:23.800]   Techserve?
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:24.880]   Techserve.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:25.280]   Techserve.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.440]   They're one of the big ones.
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:26.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:26.920 --> 01:56:28.160]   Yeah, they're very well known.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:29.520]   They do great work down there.
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:33.200]   And you want them, if you're setting up a newspaper
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:35.600]   running on Macs or something like that,
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.800]   where you really have a specialty.
[01:56:36.800 --> 01:56:38.520]   And that's much better than an Apple store
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:40.280]   where somebody would come in and really do a system.
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:41.640]   Yeah, people doing great audio stuff.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:43.160]   You want to set up a recording studio.
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:43.760]   Perfect example.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.040]   Who are you going to buy from?
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:46.960]   Thank you, Adam.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.080]   ASMC.
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:49.560]   What's to say again?
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.320]   Apple Specialist.com.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:53.840]   Apple Specialist.com.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.080]   Hey, I didn't mention, but I will briefly mention
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:59.720]   Craig Hockenberry's post on his website, furboat.org.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:02.160]   You guys know what I'm talking about.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.080]   Could you say this on here?
[01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:03.720]   I can't.
[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:06.760]   And so don't look too closely at the screen.
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:08.080]   It stands no more.
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:09.280]   But I love Craig Hockenberry.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:11.160]   He's a very smart guy.
[01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:16.080]   And he did discover some sort of weird error in a demon
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:20.920]   that runs on most Macintosh computers, part of Yosemite.
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:23.560]   He says he filed bug report after bug report.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:26.800]   It said the Discovery D demon.
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:29.480]   And he says this piece of software
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:34.800]   is responsible for a large portion of the thousand cuts.
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:36.480]   Personally, I've wasted many hours
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:38.920]   just trying to keep my devices talking to each other.
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:41.000]   As soon as he published this article,
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.760]   I did what he recommended.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:46.360]   First of all, if you're using the latest version of Yosemite,
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.280]   that's the first fix.
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:52.360]   But then, because Discovery D will be cached and kind of the
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:56.080]   errors that it creates will be persistent,
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:00.320]   his suggestion is to go around and unplug--
[01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:02.600]   it screws up a bonjour--
[01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:05.120]   is to go around and unplug all your Apple TVs.
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:07.720]   He says it's ironic that the people who get bit by this are
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:09.960]   the ones who are the most devoted Apple fans who have a lot
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.920]   of Apple stuff like an Apple router and Apple TVs.
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:14.240]   Unplug all your Apple TVs.
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.280]   Unplug all your Apple routers.
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:17.960]   I did this.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.640]   Then, replug the router.
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.960]   Let it sit for a second so it forgets all of the data that's
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:23.280]   in there.
[01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:25.520]   Replug your router.
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:28.360]   And then, plug in the Apple TV.
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:32.640]   And while I was having a lot of trouble with dropped networks
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:34.760]   and Discovery issues--
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:37.360]   and I can't say for sure that that fixed it--
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:39.320]   I haven't had a problem since.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:41.480]   So maybe it's voodoo.
[01:58:41.480 --> 01:58:44.080]   Maybe it's a little--
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:48.400]   maybe it's an actual prophylactic work around.
[01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:51.760]   But reboot everything.
[01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:53.640]   And unpoison.
[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:55.920]   He says, what happens if someone running an older version
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:58.040]   of OS 10 connects to your network and poisons it?
[01:58:58.040 --> 01:58:59.680]   Reboot again.
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:02.960]   So make sure you've got up to data devices on your system.
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:05.200]   And then reboot it all.
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:10.160]   Discovery D is not related to Tenacious D.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:11.440]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.280]   Susie, you did great.
[01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:13.880]   I appreciate your stopping by.
[01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:14.880]   It was so nice to have you.

[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:17.240]   Yeah, anytime.
