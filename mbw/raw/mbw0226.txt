[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.560]   And here we are, ladies and gentlemen, gathered once again.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.600]   I think the last Mac Break Weekly of the year 2010,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.160]   because next week it'll be a best of.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.920]   So we can kind of sum up the year in Macintosh, iOS,
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.560]   everything coming out of Cupertino and joining us
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.480]   to do that right now.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.760]   Of course, the usual cast of suspect Andy Inaco.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.960]   He's the usual--
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.360]   Andy Inaco is the usual guy in the hat.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.080]   And because I'm the first one here,
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.560]   that means I would be the prime suspect.
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.480]   Prime suspect.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.960]   Your number one--
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.240]   A very, very wise call.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.240]   I might say I've got blood on my hands figuratively.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.680]   And as well, not literally as of 10 minutes ago.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.800]   Where you did get--
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.560]   When you wrap gifts, paper cuts are always a risk.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.360]   Yes, paper cuts from wrapping gifts.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.840]   That's what it is, officer.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.360]   And you should sound like--
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.640]   you should sound like Peter Nore with that faz on.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.360]   Oh, he's frozen solid.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.560]   Gift wrapping.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.080]   Mr. Lindsey's not with us.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.000]   And proving I was here in Paris, France.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.760]   Yes.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.320]   5,000 miles away from Cambridge, Massachusetts,
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.840]   Ponte.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.240]   Hold up Le Monde.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.200]   Hold it up, and we'll know with the date on it.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.560]   That's what Alex is doing.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.200]   See, there he is on Rwandan TV.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.360]   It couldn't have been him.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.840]   Of course, as you point out, anybody like Alex,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.920]   Lindsey, probably nothing you should believe nothing
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.680]   that you see in video.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.080]   So Alex is still in Rwanda.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.040]   We're talking about going to Rwanda now in the spring
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.600]   here this summer.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.880]   Tiffany Tapp, that man in the background there
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.200]   is Mr. Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.440]   and many of a game podcast.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.360]   He's a little under the weather, so don't make him sneeze.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.360]   Yeah, I do have--
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.960]   I've tried every naturopathic--
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.480]   we had a doctor on the show a few weeks ago,
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.360]   and he's like, you need to try this, this, this, and this.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.920]   I've tried all of them.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.640]   And I'm here to tell you that none of them work.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.160]   No.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.480]   Nothing other than a little whiskey in a mug full of tea
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.200]   won't cure, though.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.280]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.360]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.320]   You just drink that up, Mr. Morris.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.320]   Somewhere behind you, Natalie Morris,
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.560]   and the little baby Miles Morris.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.360]   Yeah, there's a little cute cherub.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.400]   Oh, isn't that cute?
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.680]   There are two cute cherub's.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.080]   We had Natalie on Sunday.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.280]   Yeah, she had a great time.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.200]   And so the little guy is sleeping.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.640]   Give him a little dime a tap.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.760]   He's not that.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.160]   You just dip your pinky in it, right?
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.880]   Let him suck on it.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   That's all.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.200]   Well, it's good for two days.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.760]   If you have to get work done around the house,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.200]   a little dime a little dime a tap.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:55.800]   Fantastic.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.240]   We're not recommending that at all.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.080]   If you're getting your pediatric information from this show,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.040]   you're in trouble already.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.920]   Here she is, ladies and gentlemen from Pittsburgh, PA.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Justin is there.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.520]   Hello, I'm Mr. Justin.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.040]   Is there a here?
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.560]   I, Justin, hi.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.480]   Hello, how are you?
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   We haven't seen you in ages.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.840]   It has been forever.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.720]   Long time.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.560]   So you've been busy.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.640]   I know I keep seeing YouTube videos of you dancing and singing.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.200]   Yes.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.640]   Yes.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.600]   You like being a dork on camera, don't you?
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.120]   I do.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.520]   I do.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.040]   And I've actually been spending a lot of time.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.280]   I just got an Xbox now, so I'm not proud of it.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.680]   But I have an addiction.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.640]   OK, let's do it together.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.560]   OK, you do the Lady Gaga one?
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.240]   No, and then you jump up and down
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.240]   for the-- for Connect Adventures.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.040]   I'm trying to-- oh, my gosh.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.600]   Yes.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.040]   For rears of the Lost Ark?
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.840]   I want a video.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.920]   I want a video of that.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.520]   I got to say--
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.680]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.160]   It's so much fun.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.680]   On the dance one at the end, you know, you freestyle in the dance.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.120]   This is dance central.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.080]   And then they do a series of stills.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.200]   And they play it back too fast.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.360]   So you're going like this.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.760]   It's just dorky.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.840]   Oh, the worst part is-- yeah, there's the YouTube video.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.720]   Me doing that, of course.
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.520]   But doing it on television, you're
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.920]   trying to explain the device.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.120]   You're trying to walk everyone through.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.360]   If I'm doing another show on Fox,
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.120]   you're trying to walk everyone through the specs of what--
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.800]   you know, what Connect--
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.960]   Well, you're dancing and you're out of breath.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.440]   Dancing.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.080]   And you know, I'm wildly out of shape.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.640]   So, you know, after about 45 seconds of dancing--
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:27.080]   It's pretty bad.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.680]   --to us, I'm bell biv devo.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm--
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.960]   Tod.
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.680]   It's pretty intense, but it is so much fun.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.800]   Go, Spandy, you know, you know, you're
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.400]   dancing to bell biv devo.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.960]   Is that the--
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.480]   Oh, no.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.760]   Everybody gets to choose one.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.800]   Like, my game consoles a little bit out of date.
[00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.600]   My dance moves are more like twist the left, press the left,
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.080]   press the right, press the left, press the left.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.280]   We call that the four loco.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.320]   I am in shape just basically for that.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.320]   It's-- it's-- I have to say, I am a big fan of--
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.240]   I think we all agree.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.280]   Connect is great, isn't it?
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.280]   Definitely.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.320]   Versus the moves, I had the-- I got the move first,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.120]   and I was so excited.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.920]   And then I got the connect.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.000]   I was like, all right, well, I haven't touched my PlayStation
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.480]   since.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.480]   Yeah, I kind of-- when I played with the move, I thought,
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.400]   mmm, mmm.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.800]   I'm not-- I'm not crazy about the move,
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.360]   because it's just like-- it's more like a wee moat.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.600]   But it's a little bit more precise.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.640]   You know, one of the things I like about the move
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.880]   is that the precision, you know, and I also see it
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.560]   for some more hardcore gamers.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.600]   And I have to say, playing some of those golf games,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.800]   you do not get that-- even like a slight rotation of your wrist.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.400]   Using those three points of contact with the move.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.760]   I mean, even playing like the John Daly golf,
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.600]   or Tiger Woods golf, I mean, slicing.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.920]   Just a hair, it's picking that up on the move.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.240]   You don't get that on connect.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.360]   No, I like using-- I like using my whole body.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.880]   Oh, I think it's-- it's really fun.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.320]   Let's see how Clayton does--
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   Oh, God.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.240]   That was great.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.240]   Here he is, Dennis.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.560]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.720]   Hey, yes, you pointed out it's on the internet.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.280]   What can I say?
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.360]   So I do like that control thing.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.880]   Look at that.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.040]   See, you can just move like the minority report thing.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.560]   Oh, one thing I can't stand about it, though,
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.800]   and I pointed it to set up my review is the voice recognition.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.600]   I mean, it's just such a gimmick.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.200]   I found it to be worthless.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.760]   I got so frustrated with trying to say connect menu.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.000]   No, I didn't use that.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.280]   And it doesn't work.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.240]   I mean, do you use that, Leo?
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.800]   No.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.640]   But I do like-- especially on Dance Central,
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.960]   which I think is one of the best games.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.000]   I do like-- they did something a little different
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.440]   than the traditional connect controls.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.640]   And I think it works quite well on Dance Central.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.400]   And by the way--
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.920]   Good.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.800]   To go back and then forward, but I love it.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.040]   I'm actually so much fun.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.200]   Here's Clayton doing the obstacle.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.160]   You know, Becky Worley did this on ABC.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.280]   And I thought she did quite a good job.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.360]   Of course, she's a natural athlete, which obviously you.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.160]   The only problem with those types of segments
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.640]   is you're trying to get out some information.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.320]   I thought Becky actually saw Becky's segment.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.960]   She did a great job.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.560]   She did amazing.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.840]   She got out some information.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   She's jumping.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.920]   I'm like, these are the five points
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.200]   that I want viewers at home to know about, who've never
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.000]   seen this before.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.360]   They have no idea what this thing is.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.320]   I want to make sure I hit this, this, this, and this.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.480]   And then of course, you have anchors, like jumping in.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.280]   Yeah, it's such a hate stuff.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.800]   Don't you hate anchors?
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.280]   I hate anchors.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:58.760]   No, you did it.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.520]   This is a good piece.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   This is on as Clayton's blog if you want to see the piece.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.160]   Look at that.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.000]   You're such a white boy.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.240]   Such a white boy.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:06.760]   What was that?
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.560]   Is that an iPad wipe they just did?
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.720]   In the middle of the connect segment, they do an iPad wipe.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.840]   Yeah, I think they built the--
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.280]   Let's go back.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.640]   They built the tech segment with the iPad wipe.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.320]   OK, we want to see that one more.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.400]   Yeah, that's an iPad wipe, definitely.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.240]   With the Fox News.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.280]   With an unnamed tablet device, they all stink and say in these days.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.000]   So we are all going to CES in two weeks, hard to believe.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.720]   God darn it.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.120]   It seems like I'm just still recovering from last year.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.480]   And last year's CES was 3D TVs.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.000]   This year, it's very clearly tablets, big time, right?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.920]   Everybody wants to do an iPad killer.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.000]   Remember this happened?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.840]   Andy with the iPhone for two, three years, I think.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.440]   Everybody said iPhone killer.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.760]   Remember the sprint instinct?
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.000]   Whatever happened to that.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.760]   Oh, God.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.200]   What a piece of junk.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:05.080]   The Blackberry Storm 1 and 2.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.280]   So it was not easy making an iPhone killer.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.560]   But maybe this time, it'll be a little easier
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.160]   to make an iPad killer.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.520]   Probably not, because they still have
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.280]   to wait for Android 3.0 to make any sort of a serious tablet.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.960]   Right now, anything you buy today or in the next couple months
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.640]   is going to be based on--
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.440]   hopefully, you'll be able to upgrade this later on.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.720]   There are a bunch of different players
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.960]   that are doing interesting things.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.400]   But I think that if you want any other indication of how far
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.480]   Apple has come and getting the iPad out there
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.240]   and making it just really resonate with everybody,
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:41.280]   is the fact that every single maker, in their public statements,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.720]   in their private statements, they're all positioning
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.920]   their devices in relation to the iPad.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.800]   It's like the iPad only it's smaller.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.400]   It's like the iPad only it's more open.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.400]   It's like the iPad only it's less expensive.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.720]   But we agree that the Samsung, which I'm
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.800]   holding right now, the Galaxy, was surprisingly good.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.120]   I mean, it's not--
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.040]   It's 2.2.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.800]   It's not gingerbread.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.080]   I think it was more of a demonstration
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.880]   of how good the 7-inch form factor could be
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.600]   and how wrong Steve Jobs was a few months ago when
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.280]   he said that the 7-inch form factor is dead in the water.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.960]   Because there are a lot of things
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.840]   I didn't like about the tab.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.880]   But the size definitely wasn't one of them.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.360]   Yeah, scrolling internet scrolling for me was--
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.560]   I'm not-- I wasn't a big fan of it.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560]   I loved it though.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.560]   I spent a number of weeks with it.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.480]   And I thought in my review, I said
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.040]   that I felt like Android for the first time to me
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.040]   felt like it had room to breathe on the Samsung Galaxy
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.400]   tab.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.560]   Like I felt like it had a little bit more breathing room
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.440]   on that device.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.040]   And I actually-- I really enjoyed it.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.200]   But I think you're right, Andy.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.840]   And how many 7-inch tablets do you think we're going to see?
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.160]   And I know, obviously, a lot of the rumors out there
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.680]   for iPad style, almost the same size as the iPad.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.040]   But Samsung, I think, hitting a home run with the 7-inch.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.920]   And you know what it'll be interesting?
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.080]   I'll be looking for-- of course,
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:57.240]   we'll be looking for the first time we can hold a RIM playbook.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.920]   Because up to now, it's been demos.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.800]   But I presume they're going to have something physical to hold.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.440]   And then you saw the Motorola video.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.160]   Which basically called the iPad a big iPhone.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:09.660]   I mean--
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.160]   I mean, that's really--
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.760]   Really just it.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:10.760]   --it.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.160]   --pretty much true, actually.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.560]   But that's not a bad thing.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.280]   I mean, the iPhone is pretty much amazing.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.240]   So you know, a big iPhone.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:17.960]   I'm not complaining.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.600]   Yes, you're right.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.920]   I mean, come to think of it.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.920]   That's not such a big dis, is it?
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.360]   They had this whole--
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.480]   by the way, they never show it.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.000]   This is absolutely taking a page from the playbook playbook.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.600]   They never really showed anything.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.000]   It's just all about that this is the history of tablets.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.660]   And they start with the Rosetta Stone and so forth.
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.620]   But when they finally get to the iPad, they say,
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.020]   it's just a big iPhone.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.060]   And then they say--
[00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.340]   Yes, the iPhone is so bad.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.540]   No, that's a good point.
[00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.340]   And well, it's the obvious complaint to make.
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.980]   If you've got to find a weak point in the iPad,
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.700]   that's definitely what you're going to go for.
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.420]   It did make me think that, oh, dear.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.980]   But anybody who knows what they're talking about
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.940]   is going to say, well, no, it really isn't.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.340]   It's more like the iPhone is like a small version of the iPad
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.420]   when you start looking at them.
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.680]   Like, OK, but--
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.600]   I guess it's W.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.200]   When the undertaker comes out with a popcorn,
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.960]   the popcorn, the flazer lights at the beginning of the WWF,
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.240]   you don't believe anything he says
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.520]   to this all-pre-show height.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.400]   He's trying to settle it in the ring.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.360]   Well, exactly right.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.760]   Those interstitials during the commercial breaks
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.080]   when Jimmy the heart comes--
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.320]   the mouth of the South comes out and actually lays the smack
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:24.820]   down.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:27.200]   And then at the end here, we see the bee flying across.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.360]   So they're saying honeycomb.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.720]   I think that's the indicator.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.880]   But they don't show you anything.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.920]   We don't know if it's 7 inches.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.260]   We don't know if it's 10 inches.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.540]   We don't know what Motorola is doing.
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.620]   But they apparently will have a honeycomb base.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:40.580]   That's Android 2.3 based, which is the first tablet,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.260]   OS, according to Google.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.780]   But there's so many other things at play here, besides just
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.140]   the form factor and the operating system, right?
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.340]   I mean, it's the price.
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.060]   It's the price.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.620]   It's the parts manufacturers.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.780]   It's the retail experience.
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.340]   And I've long felt-- and shoot me down if you want--
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.940]   I think HP is one of the one companies that's positioned.
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.320]   And now with their huge purchase,
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.600]   shelling out the amount of money that they
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.540]   shelled out for Palm, to be able to go in with the back end
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.800]   retail experience at Best Buy, all of these other places.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.120]   I wasn't a Best Buy the other day.
[00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.720]   Almost every computer there is an HP product.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.080]   They have the retail extension to match for apps--
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.200]   They own the channel.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.800]   They own the channel, absolutely.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.280]   I mean, it says nothing about the quality of the computers,
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.920]   which are essentially junk.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.440]   Right.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.360]   But they have the channel.
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.440]   But you're walking in there.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.680]   I'm reminded of those Windows commercials,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.280]   where she's outside with a little bit of money.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.000]   And she goes in looking for a computer.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.040]   And she's in that store.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.280]   She knows she wants to leave with a computer.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.080]   It doesn't matter if she's going to leave with a crappy computer.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.280]   That's the one store she's going to go do to buy a computer.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.120]   Right.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.740]   I'd love to see the follow-up commercial.
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.440]   So how's that computer treating you?
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.280]   Yeah, really.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.200]   Not so great.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.160]   Yeah, that one you bought instead of buying a MacBook.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.880]   Yeah, how's that?
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:50.640]   Yeah, good luck with that.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.560]   So you had a bit of a scoop, Clayton,
[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.400]   on a Palm tablet as well.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.080]   The Palm pad, which we'll see presumably at CES.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.880]   Yeah, now I've been working on this story for a few months
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.520]   and have the spec sheets, which obviously look a lot like the HP
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.680]   slate and some of the stuff that I did
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.960]   and published, the extension of the spec sheets,
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.840]   because that's not my game.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.040]   That's not end gadget.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.280]   Yeah, but that's a hell of a scoop.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.840]   I mean, well done.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.280]   Thank you.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.960]   And I mean, it's interesting going and looking at web OS 2.5
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.120]   on this device.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.160]   What I'm hearing is we'll see three devices.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.760]   And those who have played with them have said,
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.120]   you know, one looks like-- and it'll
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.560]   depend when the final prototypes are there,
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.920]   but one of which will have like a gripped back,
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.840]   almost like a construction style device,
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.000]   more durable, more durable tablet device.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.560]   And four devices, it seems in total, one of which
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.640]   will just be exclusively for the education sector.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.760]   So through university--
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.360]   Still, and all of them on Sprint still.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.760]   Yeah, and it's funny because there
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.120]   were some going back and forth between some Palm folks
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.600]   and some HP folks as to which network it was going to be on.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   HP folks had to like correct the Palm folks and say,
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.800]   no, 4G Sprint.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.800]   Sprint 4G is the one.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.800]   4G is really-- maybe that's pretty exciting, actually.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.280]   So I'm excited.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.920]   You know, I think to see--
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.720]   I thought of all of the operating systems,
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.920]   I thought web OS would have been compelling in a tablet form.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.920]   I thought of all of them.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.320]   I thought a web OS tablet with a card style layout
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.440]   would have been really interesting
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.800]   to see on a tablet form factor.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.400]   We'll have to wait and see and get our hands on it.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.320]   But--
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.360]   I think it's really interesting.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.560]   This is going to be--
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.240]   I mean, CES last year was 3D TVs.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.880]   I'm sure there'll be plenty this year.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.200]   But I think this is going to--
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.280]   and E-book readers last year, many of which never came out,
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.440]   most of which never came out.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.040]   This is clearly the one of the-- this
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.120]   is going to be the tablet year.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.880]   Yeah, I think that really we're down to three cars
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.600]   on the starting line.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.760]   Apple's already there.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.200]   Been doing laps for about a year already.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.920]   HP is the only one that can kind of match what Apple's
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.880]   done with the iPad in terms of be the one company that
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.920]   makes one really good, solid, consistent performer.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.080]   And then every other Android tablet device
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.600]   are kind of conglomerated into one big, big, sticky rice ball.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.880]   It's not as though Motorola is going to make a big splash.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.920]   It's not as though Notionic is going to make a big splash.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.320]   Or any other individual manufacturer
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.600]   is going to make a big splash.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.000]   All together, it's going to be Android at one big lump.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.960]   Because the problem with any Android device
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.600]   is still going to be great.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.640]   Google has made version 3.0 or 2.3 of the operating system.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.120]   Then what happens to it when Motorola gets their hands on it.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.920]   Then what does Sprint do it with it once they get their hands on it?
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.600]   And by the time it actually lands in the hands of actual users,
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.480]   it can be three iterations away from whatever
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.920]   was considered to be a good idea back at Google.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.240]   You were excited by the Notion Inc, right?
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.800]   Very excited because they're a startup of the capital stuff.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   They're definitely not trying to say, well, let's take the iPad
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:45.560]   and try to clone it.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.880]   It's more like, let's do a really cool tablet
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.720]   and let's sort of answer some of the things we didn't like
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.160]   about the iPad when we first heard of it.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.560]   This is the Eden one.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.000]   The machine is called the Atom.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.760]   The Eden is their idea of a GUI based on top of Android, I believe.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.360]   So is Android, but it's got its own GUI?
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.720]   Yeah, but they're doing something really cool here.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.760]   One of the things they're doing here is that apps can have both
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.640]   a full screen and a minimized view.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.560]   What you're looking at is a view in which they can have multiple
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.640]   pains, so to speak.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.440]   So you can have Twitter in one pane.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.200]   You can have a web browser in another one, a book,
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.640]   or a calendar in a third.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.440]   And any one of these can be maximized.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.760]   It's basically tiled windows.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.200]   Yes.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.960]   And again, remember, that's just the minimized view.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.640]   So you can have it do lots of things at once when you're not
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.280]   just focused on bashing their email.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.600]   Also, they're writing good email clients and interesting things
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.360]   like that.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.160]   Let me ask you guys, I'm curious what you would say.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.080]   I mean, I have, you know, obviously viewers who ask all the time,
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.360]   Samsung Galaxy tab or an I'm not, I shouldn't say a lot of viewers
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.240]   that ask that question.
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.560]   Galaxy tab, very few of them even know what it is.
[00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:48.560]   They're all holding out hope.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.560]   You know, they want the iPad for Christmas and so forth.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.080]   But what would it take for you to recommend another tablet
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.400]   above and beyond what we know from the iPad?
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.200]   I've already recommended the Galaxy tab to people who want
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.320]   something they can put in their pocket.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.040]   I think this is actually pretty darn good.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.240]   And you know, they've sold a million of them, remember.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.880]   Yeah, but I can't recommend that as a $600 thing,
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.600]   especially when I think that there can be some really good $300
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.800]   things coming up next year.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.520]   Oh, it's the I don't think that anything can--
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.640]   well, let's put iPad aside for a second.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.680]   I don't think that a seven inch tablet can do the same jobs
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.000]   that a 10 inch tablet can do.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.280]   I mean, just last night, you know, I was in bed.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.360]   I was watching Holiday Inn on AMC.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.080]   I'm just sort of like noodling around on Wikipedia,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.840]   just looking up movie stuffs, looking for the band clip
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.520]   of the really awful, awful, awful scene from Holiday Inn.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.800]   They had to excise because it was just horrifying.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.360]   I don't remember that.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.720]   Oh, there's a-- the theme of Holiday Inn is basically,
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.040]   there's an inn that is only open for holidays.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.400]   And they have to basically find-- the movie has to find,
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.160]   like, holidays to do.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.920]   So they do Abraham Lincoln's birthday.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.200]   That was a good movie.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.760]   I like that movie.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:01.040]   And there's-- is that where White Christmas made its debut?
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.880]   There was no White Christmas in that particular scene
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.000]   that was excised if you'd catch my drift.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.440]   But yeah, that was the first movie appearance of White
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.960]   Christmas, Bing Crosby, Fred Astaire.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.840]   And bring it, Bing is singing, Fred is dancing.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.680]   What else could you possibly ask for?
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.880]   But the thing is, though, a seven-inch tablet,
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.240]   I could do the same sort of things.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.360]   But I won't have that big display that really looks
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.640]   like a window onto the internet and really won't do
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.240]   that sort of stuff.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.880]   I could do other stuff that's different.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.600]   But even a 10-inch Motorola tablet or a seven-inch Motorola
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.800]   tablet won't be like a 10-inch version of the same tablet.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.040]   But this got to be cheaper than $600 plus to your contract.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   No, do your wallet.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.080]   I still think what people are going to be doing with it.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.560]   I mean, for me, I watch and consume so much media.
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.520]   I don't even watch my TV anymore.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.120]   I mean, I watch all of my TV shows on my iPad.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.480]   And I do email it, everything on there.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.640]   And it's the perfect size.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.720]   And if it was any smaller--
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.560]   I don't know.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.400]   Seven-inch is-- have you played with the Samsung?
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.160]   To me, this is actually not a bad size.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.320]   It's completely-- 10 inches--
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   It's just the same.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.400]   --is the same as seven inches closer.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.520]   That's right.

[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.600]   And by the way, was it Jeff Jarvis?
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.000]   Somebody was saying, this is the only--
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.720]   you can't thumb type on his iPad, but you
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   can't thumb type on this.
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.520]   But you can't really type on it.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:17.720]   But you can't really type on it.
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.560]   I'm actually-- I actually challenged Andy right after,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.080]   I think, the week the iPad launched.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.640]   He had it for a week ahead of time.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.000]   And we were in the offices.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.160]   And I asked Andy, I said, all right,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.400]   you think you're really good on this now.
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.880]   He's been on the train so often.

[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.480]   And he was like lightning fast.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.600]   And I have to say, well, I wonder what the learning curve is
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:33.880]   on that.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.880]   Is it a lot like the iPhone?
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.600]   And after a few weeks, I can sit there and pound out--
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.960]   I'll write a whole column.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.800]   I'll sit there and pound out long emails on there.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.760]   And I love it.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.520]   And I end up using it, kind of going back to that Apple flip
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.880]   up case again, just because I'm able to type it on a keyboard.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.560]   But you can't do that on the Galaxy tab.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.640]   And sure, it's great to be walking around.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.120]   But I don't feel like it's a--
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.360]   it's not a device I want to be pulling out on the street,
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.680]   snapping photos.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.400]   It just didn't feel like that kind of a quick draw--
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.320]   that quick draw feeling that I have with my iPhone.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.320]   It's a crappy camera.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.080]   I mean, you really wouldn't want to eat it.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.960]   It's a dumb thing for a camera.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.360]   Although, get ready, because I'm sure the next iPad
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.800]   will have a camera on it.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.560]   Well, you feel silly pulling this out and going,
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.560]   snapping on the street.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.040]   Oh, definitely.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   I don't silly--

[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.800]   I said, I don't see the need for it,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.000]   because I felt like you're going to be looking up someone's nose
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.400]   if I'm going to be on Skype or something.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:22.720]   Oh, for the Skype.

[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.960]   But I mean, this is the same thing with an iPhone with FaceTime.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.560]   You have to hold it like that.

[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.600]   Just even I both went, really?
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.240]   Just with myself.

[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.160]   on the West Coast in San Francisco that have--
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.240]   I guess with the baby.

[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.520]   so I guess that makes sense.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.360]   All right.

[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.000]   And it works great.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.520]   But you don't use it just anything.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.640]   Because you don't have a baby.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.120]   I don't.

[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   Because then it's kind of stuff.

[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.920]   I'd have to ping my sister or my mom or something like that.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.680]   And I'd say, hey, at 5 p.m. today,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.640]   will you jump on Skype with being on Wi-Fi and being at home?
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.920]   I can just call my mom on FaceTime.

[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   Did you really?
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:50.560]   What'd you get?
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.840]   I love Ford.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.560]   What'd you get?

[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Ford Escape, a white one.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.240]   I need something up here for the mountains.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.680]   But I got to with Ford Sync.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.520]   And I love it.
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.520]   I mean, that's all I drive.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.240]   I mean, I love-- I've been driving for it for years.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.480]   You know he was a Ford Escape.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.120]   I-- you're a Ford family.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.720]   That's nice.
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.640]   I am a Ford family.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.760]   And there's a great piece, by the way.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.480]   If you're curious how Ford came back
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.800]   and did this incredible restructuring,
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.160]   there's a great article in the Economist this week about--
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.760]   or last week, actually, about Ford's whole restructuring
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:21.200]   and how basically Kevin Mulally, when he took over,
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.880]   went into this office, it went into--
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.400]   Allen, Allen.
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:23.840]   Allen.
[00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:24.280]   Allen.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:24.280]   Allen.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:24.800]   Allen.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.300]   Allen.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.720]   He's my personal close personal friend,
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.600]   so I wouldn't want him.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.920]   Allen, Mulally, she went into that meeting after--
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.040]   what's his name left?
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.760]   And no one would ever raise their hand.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:36.280]   And he said, how are we doing?
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.720]   And no one raised their hand.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:38.600]   Everyone's like, good, good.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.000]   He goes, we're about to have a $17 billion loss.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.320]   You mean to tell me we're doing good?
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.960]   And their hands shut up.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.400]   They're all fired up.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.840]   You're only--
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.400]   No, he did-- I think he's really amazing guy.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.120]   I don't know how we got off on that tangent, but there you go.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.720]   And from face to face to face to face to face to face to face.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.920]   Oh, yeah, face to face to face to face to face to face to face.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.440]   That's right.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.600]   Say again, I'm sorry, Justin.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.640]   But I'm just going to say Ford has been doing a lot of awesome
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.520]   social media stuff as well, which is really cool.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.200]   We especially like them for that.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.920]   They're supporting new media.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.280]   It's very nice.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.440]   All right, I just need to go ahead, Annie.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.200]   I was just going to say, I mean, it's a great feature
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.960]   given that it costs you nothing.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.800]   If you never use FaceTime or the front-facing camera,
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:17.400]   that's fine.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.640]   You got that front-facing camera for free.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.080]   When I do use FaceTime, I'm glad I have it.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.640]   When I don't use FaceTime, I'm glad that now when I'm traveling,
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.200]   I want to send a picture to my friend.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.760]   Hey, here I am in front of the world's largest shoehorn
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.640]   in South Dakota.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.920]   I no longer have to really figure out, OK, am I in front of it now?
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.720]   Am I in front of it now?
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.880]   I'm in front of it now?
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.960]   So yeah, you can't be the free feature.
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.520]   We did the--
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.680]   I've used to FaceTime twice now.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.160]   Once to interview Steve Jobs, Becky Warley ambushed him at an event.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.920]   And once to interview Steve Martin, because I didn't want to make him
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   the man learned to Skype.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.360]   And both times it worked fine.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.720]   I just-- that's it.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.360]   That's the two times I've used it in a year.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.200]   I never think to be like, oh, I should FaceTime my mom.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.160]   I'll just either take a video and send it as an MMS, which kind of--
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.000]   it just works perfectly fine.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.840]   Have you guys been using Tango at all?
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.200]   What's Tango?
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.560]   Tango, and I should have had it as my pick of the week,
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.240]   but I thought you guys might have already touched on it.
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:14.520]   No, we haven't.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.280]   Basically, it's FaceTime over 3G on the iPhone.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.440]   It looks-- it works great.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.280]   I've been waiting for somebody to-- can it
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.440]   run on other platforms?
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.320]   Because many phones now have front-facing cameras.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.520]   It'd be nice if there were a cross-platform solution.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.160]   I guess there's freeing.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.000]   Let me look on my Android to see if I'm not a fan.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.120]   I'm not a fan of freeing.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.000]   But I'm not a fan either.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.440]   I've done Tango calls on the bus.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.400]   I've done them on Edge.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.880]   I've done them on over-the-edge network.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.680]   And they look great.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.600]   I mean, obviously, you get a little stilted here and there
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.280]   once in a while.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.840]   But heck, I mean, not over Wi-Fi.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.760]   You can do these calls.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.840]   They just updated.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.480]   They just had an update last week, too.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.080]   It does work on--
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.560]   I'm seeing in our chat room that Duncan says he uses it on as
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.720]   a spreadevo.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.120]   I'm down-going it right now.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.960]   It's fantastic.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.560]   It looks exactly like FaceTime.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.360]   I mean, it's hard to tell the difference.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.040]   Maybe I can Tango you.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.360]   I'll be like college.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.000]   Let's take a break.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.800]   Maybe went to an old boys school.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.240]   The only way they could learn it next.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.400]   Now, what's net-- is net Tango something else?
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   OK, this is Tango video calls.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.200]   Tango brings you free, high-quality video calls on Android
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:32.600]   phones and iPhones over 3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.560]   Well, that's pretty cool.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.680]   I'll see if I can pull it up.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.920]   I guess I can.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.440]   I got to switch over here.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.560]   I just really don't like to talk on the phone.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:45.160]   You know, I think that might be a boy thing and a girl thing.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.040]   You don't want to fix your hair and get dressed,
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.400]   and we don't care.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:48.960]   We're ugly.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.840]   I don't know.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.800]   I mean, I would have to--
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.960]   I'm just a little bit more physically talking on the phone.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.480]   --cateboard right there.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:53.960]   At the top?
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.640]   No.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.240]   No, my friend, Mitch English.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.160]   Old weather guy at a show.
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.480]   Is he-- how old is he?
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.320]   Really old?
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:00.840]   That's 40.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.520]   Hey, it's time for the weather.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.320]   Oh, not that kind of old.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.680]   Long time.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.320]   All right, all right, all right, all right.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.600]   We're going to talk-- I think we're
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.160]   done with the iPad stuff.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.720]   Let us talk in a bit about TV, but first, an Apple's
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.160]   hobby, which is turning out to be quite a success story.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.480]   First, I'd like to talk about carbonite.com,
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:28.120]   if you would like to run away now, Justine, you can.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.720]   She works for a different company.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.520]   She likes Ford, so that's OK.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   I do like Ford.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.160]   That's OK.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.160]   Carbonite is a great way to back up both your Mac, your PC,
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.800]   your any computer, to the internet, automatic.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.760]   Look, the other company that you work for, that's fine.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.040]   I mean, look, the key to me is back that aren't thing up.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.120]   And so many people don't back up or forget to back up,
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.360]   or back up to a local hard drive, which, of course, is fine.
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.520]   You know, if you've got a time machine,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:57.560]   drive sitting right there, maybe a time capsule in your house,
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.520]   but I've got to remind you that if you're backing up
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.840]   to a time capsule or a local hard drive or DVDs or CDs,
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.280]   and it's all next to the computer there,
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.680]   it's all in the same place.
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.600]   If the worst happens, there's a fire or flood
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:09.600]   you're going to lose your data.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.000]   And I'll tell you, if you've got pictures, baby pictures
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.200]   of little miles on that computer,
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.320]   you've got wedding pictures, you've
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.360]   got your financial records, you've got your email,
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.320]   you're putting your life on that disk,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.960]   and if you don't have an off-site backup,
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.200]   you're really risking that data.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.360]   I need to get on carbonite because I've got
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.560]   multiple drobos I have, Drobi.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.560]   Yeah, we're all good about backing up locally now.
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.600]   I think we've all learned that.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.880]   And I have all the, you know, I back up a lot of photos
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.520]   to Google, to Picasa or something like that,
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.520]   and I have all those, the baby photos, all that stuff.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.960]   That's good.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.240]   But I fear, I fear a fire.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.960]   I fear somebody's going to fire bomb my house.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.440]   Look at all that pine, behind all that naughty pine.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.440]   Stuff will go up in a second.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.720]   That one I'll mean to say.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.680]   It's really scary.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.040]   It was funny.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.480]   I was actually, it wasn't at my apartment.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   My neighbor had texted me instead of a fire next door.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.080]   And my sister was at home at my apartment sleeping,
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.360]   and I'm calling her frantically, obviously,
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.640]   to make sure she's OK.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.000]   But to tell her--
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:07.880]   Get the hard drives.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.720]   --all of this, I needed to her to grab my apartment.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.240]   I was like, make sure you grab the two, two terabytes
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:13.960]   on this drive.
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.680]   So I'm going to have to grab these ones.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.800]   And she's like, just, I don't know which ones I'm like.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.240]   No, the ones with the stickers.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.800]   You know, she just puts the inside of the burning building
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.680]   and tell you you parked the drive heads.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   Right.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:28.240]   Make sure you eject and shut down, yes.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.000]   No, I think the thing to do is to put the Drobo right next
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.400]   to the door with a big sign on it.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.840]   Maybe you have a sign on the front door.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.400]   It says Drobo on board.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.560]   And they could come and they could--
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.400]   He's removed.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.760]   Yeah, like when you're at a hotel,
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.040]   they always say you should have your travel bag ready to go
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.600]   in the middle of the night should a fire come.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.100]   They do?
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.600]   Just get your Drobo right by the front door.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.560]   What kind of hotel are you staying in?
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.760]   Well, they're-- In case of fire, make sure you can get a--
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.760]   Have a travel bag ready.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.360]   This actually happened to my sister.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.720]   She was like-- she was doing--
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.640]   she was getting her graduate degree.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.000]   And she had to stay overnight in Virginia somewhere.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.600]   And she said, you know how they always tell you
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.560]   to make sure you have your stuff packed in the middle of the night.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   You don't know what's going to happen if there's a fire
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.960]   in the hotel and you need to run.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.920]   It happened to her.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.800]   There was a fire in the hotel and you need to run.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.560]   So she ran outside like half naked.
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:13.600]   Wow.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.960]   There's photos somewhere in here.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.800]   Wow.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.880]   Well, I don't know how we got off the topic of carbonite,
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.280]   but you can see where we're going here with this.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.360]   You make sure you back up.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.560]   Carbonite's automatic.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.360]   It's encrypted SSL on the way up so it backs up.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.160]   You know, even if you're on a laptop
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.440]   at an open Wi-Fi hotspot, still secure backing up.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.680]   And you can add triple deaths or blowfish encryption
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.960]   so nobody can see your data.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.120]   And anywhere you go, you can get it back by logging
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.120]   into your carbonite account.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.440]   They even have an iPhone app, a BlackBerry app.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.480]   If you still have a black--
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:42.960]   I shouldn't laugh.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.160]   If you still have a BlackBerry.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.200]   It's just fantastic.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.920]   I want you to try it free for 15 days.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.760]   No credit card needed.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.560]   Just go to carbonite.com and use the offer code MAC break.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.640]   And if you decide to buy, well, two months free
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.320]   with the offer code MAC break, it's very affordable,
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.880]   even without that break.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.720]   It's $0.15 a day, $0.55 a year for everything
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.440]   on your internal drive, all your personal data.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.480]   Carbonite.com, you got to back it up to get it back.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:10.120]   So get it right with carbonite.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.880]   I have a lot of-- I should pull these out.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.520]   Testimonial emails people have sent me.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.560]   I just always forget to get them in the commercial.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.760]   Just take my word for it.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.120]   I got it.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.640]   I got it.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:23.160]   I got it.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.160]   I got it.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:24.960]   It's important.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.600]   Net neutrality vote today, by the way.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.200]   FCC is going to vote.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.400]   This is so controversial.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.480]   And I'm seeing John Perry Barlow, who
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:36.040]   is very libertarian, anti-government, very concerned
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.760]   that, in fact, anything the FCC in acts
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:41.640]   is going to be worse than nothing at all.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.240]   Then I see Al Franken writing, this
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.920]   is the most important vote for free speech of the century.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.360]   I mean, it is a big deal going on.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.880]   I'm even seeing a was at this point weighing in.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.320]   He wrote an 1,800 word letter to the FCC
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.840]   about keeping the internet free at stake, really.
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:07.240]   And the big issue on this is this deal
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.680]   that Google made with Verizon.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.200]   And that's kind of, I think, the template
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.160]   for what this FCC act will be, which says,
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:21.160]   land-based internet, your cable modem, your DSL, bits
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.400]   as bits, everything's protected.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.640]   But on the mobile net, oh, if a guy wants to--
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.680]   if Verizon wants to turn off Google navigation
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.080]   and make you use VZ Navigator, no problem.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:35.040]   If they want to charge you extra for YouTube, no problem.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.640]   If they want to block Twitch from your phone,
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.200]   no, that's fine because it's mobile.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.000]   And mobile is suffering.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.560]   And I don't know what their rationale is.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.320]   It's pretty appalling.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.640]   It's awful because I feel like I do most of my surfing mobile
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.560]   because I'm not at home.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.960]   Everybody does.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.800]   It's constantly on my phone.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.400]   And if people are blocking things that I need to see,
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:55.920]   I mean, that's--
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.040]   Well, and let's not forget that if you're in a rural area,
[00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.680]   mobile may be your only form of internet access.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.040]   True.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.840]   So I think it's a big deal.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.040]   I invite you to read this 1,800 page--
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.240]   I tend to reward a document from Waz.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.560]   I'm glad that he weighed in on this.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.960]   I don't know if the FCC will particularly pay attention to him.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.400]   But if you want to read it, it's on the Atlantic.com.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.680]   "To whom it may concern, I've always loved humor and laughter.
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:25.920]   As a young engineer, I got the impulse to start dialogue
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.480]   and the San Jose San Francisco area.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.760]   I was aware of such humor services in other countries,
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:32.520]   like Australia.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.400]   The idea came from my belief in laughter.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.160]   I could scarcely-- this is Waz talking.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.520]   I could-- not me.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.720]   I don't believe in laughter.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.760]   I could scarcely believe that I was the first person
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.480]   to create a simple service in my region.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.440]   Why was I the first?
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.560]   It was 1972.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:50.680]   And it was illegal in the US to use your own telephone.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.800]   It was illegal in the US to use your own answering machine.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.600]   Hence-- people are going, what?
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.280]   No, this is true.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.400]   You had to rent a phone from Western Electric.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.000]   You never-- you couldn't own your own phone.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.840]   You couldn't own your own answering machine.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.440]   We had a monopoly phone system in our country then.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.720]   And so he talks on and on about the dialogue joke
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.400]   and so forth.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:20.280]   That's an example of that monopoly example
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:23.080]   is exactly what we're worried about here.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.480]   If you want innovation in this country,
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:31.680]   if you want to keep our dominance in technology,
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.920]   you've got to keep the internet free and open.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.680]   Doesn't this though speak to the fact
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:37.560]   that these laws are so antiquated?
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.320]   We're having a discussion about this the other day,
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.160]   which is where do my video go?
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.200]   I don't know, but that's a great shot of you.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.880]   I think we should just leave it like that.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.400]   Great, still shot.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:48.400]   That's the thinking man shot.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.600]   I was thinking and listening.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.800]   And he's gone.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.680]   Oh, here, no, it started over.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.160]   I want that still.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.520]   Please, I hope somebody grabbed that.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.680]   Moving on to just the financial correspondence
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.680]   beat.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.120]   That should be your hit shot.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.360]   I'm Blake Morris.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.120]   You may remember me.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:05.000]   There we go.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.200]   I hear you speaking.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.440]   And I'm--
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.760]   It doesn't speak though to the antiquated time of these laws,
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.360]   which is-- we were talking about this the other day
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.880]   with the FBI just as soon as they get a problem in place,
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.000]   we find out that what they have now, as far as infrastructure
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.200]   inside the federal government, is about four years
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.520]   or five years behind--
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.040]   Four.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.560]   Five.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.760]   Twenty.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.160]   I mean, this notion, though, that Republicans,
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.400]   I've seen some tweets today, John Boehner tweeting out
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.720]   that this is a huge power grab by the federal government,
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.040]   completely disagree.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.960]   And of course, Republican members of the FCC
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:43.520]   think that this is going to inhibit competition.
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.080]   And I just don't see how-- for instance,
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.640]   we already see throttling occurring.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.200]   We already know that it occurs.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.000]   So I think a lot of these guys literally
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.400]   don't get the point of it.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.680]   And they literally don't understand
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.080]   the premise of net neutrality.
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.480]   Well, I think first of all, the name is bad.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:04.560]   Really, it should be, I'm against internet discrimination.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.840]   As opposed to net neutrality, which I think is a very nebulous
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.280]   notion.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.600]   I mean, that's what it means.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.600]   I mean, it's like what?
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.840]   But I'm also concerned--
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.840]   and I know that there's dissent on the board of EFF
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.760]   and so forth.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.280]   I'm also concerned that any government regulation is risky.
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.320]   I think what we need is competition.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.360]   So that if-- but this is the problem.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.720]   If you're on Verizon and Verizon could very easily--
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.800]   and I know the carriers are going to do this--
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.840]   say, or any carrier, pick your carrier, AT&T.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.200]   If they say, OK, and they're thinking about this,
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.680]   we will charge $0.10 a megabyte for YouTube, $0.03
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:42.440]   in megabyte for, I don't know what, Bing.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.880]   And we won't charge you at all as long as using a Verizon
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.240]   VCast service.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.520]   That absolutely could happen.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:52.160]   And at that point, you have this kind of--
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.000]   Well, even the competition side of it, right?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.920]   I mean, at the point--
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.040]   I mean, look at Hulu, right?
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.920]   So it becomes a competition--
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.400]   And Skype is bliked entirely, right?
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.600]   So if you have other news organizations, websites,
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:09.160]   for instance, Comcast buys NBC, then there's Hulu.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.720]   Then some of these other video sites
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.800]   that we might think of that are under other properties,
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.680]   whether it's TV.com, a CBS property, or FoxNews.com,
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.880]   or CNN.com, or whatever they happen to be,
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.920]   because they're not under that umbrella,
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.680]   you may not have the same level of access.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.680]   And I just think, though-- and I'm also questioning--
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.640]   I think the post-- the Washington Post
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:30.360]   raised this point the other day, which is, do we yet
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.880]   know whether or not the federal government has,
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.920]   under the FCC, has the right to even regulate broadband
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.120]   the way that they think they do?
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.040]   Well, and we don't know.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.520]   In fact, that was the most recent court decision, kind of
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.840]   said, well, you can't do it that way.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.560]   And so it's very complicated, absolutely.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.880]   Yeah, it's not like white spaces.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.320]   Well, there seems like there's a clear delineation
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.920]   between what sort of spectrum you're dealing with
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.160]   and what sort of spectrum the local broadcasters want
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.800]   and have and holding on to and opening up--
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.320]   We've had this debate on Twitter.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.240]   Brian Brushwood, who's a staunch libertarian,
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.240]   says, and has a very good case, and he and Baratunde
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.800]   had a great argument.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.200]   And I don't know what the answer is.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:07.960]   I really don't.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:13.960]   I think that it's clear that mobile carriers are absolutely
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.920]   invested in tiering and blocking some services.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.960]   Comcast would love to.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:24.480]   Comcast would love to block competitors to its cable service.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:27.520]   Fortunately, this regulation that the FCC is voting on today
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.200]   prevents them from doing that.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:33.160]   Land-based internet has to be neutral.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.640]   But I worry about mobile service.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:36.320]   And as you say, Justine, most more and more,
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.240]   that's how we're getting online.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.880]   Yeah, especially even with the iPad.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.240]   I mean, I have the 3G version.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.840]   So most of the time, I'm sitting in an airport
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.120]   or at a coffee shop on my iPad.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.240]   And that's still mobile, even though I mean,
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.360]   I guess I can use the Wi-Fi.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.160]   But that's defeats the private--
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:53.920]   Zuckerberg doesn't think it's mobile.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.120]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.200]   You think mobile?
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.600]   That's true.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.400]   Also, we should mention, Leo, you just
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.280]   said that they are voting on it.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.120]   I don't know if you mentioned this off the top or not,
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.200]   but they did vote, in fact, to regulate.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   So it has passed.
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.840]   Yeah, well, we kind of knew that that would happen.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.160]   They had enough votes to do it.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   There was, I think, one dissenting Republican vote.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.360]   But I think all the Democrats were kind of strong-armed
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:15.800]   into voting.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.400]   So now we know, and we'll just have
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.400]   to wait and see what the impact is of this.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.840]   Although you could see absolutely a court case,
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:23.560]   Comcast could take them right back to court
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.040]   and have the whole thing thrown out again.
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.360]   We went into a lot of issues with music
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.360]   that I've used in some of my YouTube videos.
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:32.000]   And because I used that specific music,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.280]   it was blocked in other countries.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.280]   That happens to us all the time.
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.600]   So a lot of people are like, yes, it's like, oh, I
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.480]   can't even watch this video.
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.440]   I'm like, oh, sorry.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.200]   Nothing can do about it.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   To be honest, let me be completely clear about this.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.760]   I have a huge stake in this, because we
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.400]   are an independent internet broadcaster.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   Anybody-- you two, Justine.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.640]   Anybody who's an independent internet broadcaster
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:52.640]   is-- we're the ones who are going
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:55.440]   to get squeezed out by the big corporate media who
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.160]   are going to say, no, no, no, no.
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:58.240]   If you want to watch "Twit," you're
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.600]   going to have to pay $0.10 a megabyte.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.560]   If you want to watch "Vcast," you could do it for free.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.000]   Because the shows are that good.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.080]   Well, I can tell you right now, nobody's
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.400]   going to pay $0.10 a megabyte for this crap.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.040]   So we're not in business.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.560]   Well, no other shows have faces.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.280]   Let me tell you that.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.000]   Yeah, this is the only one with "Fezes" right now.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:18.200]   Again, you are the tastemaker.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.720]   Yes, of course.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:23.240]   But it really is a complicated thing, though, because I agree--
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.680]   I've been quiet because you guys
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.360]   have been saying things that I completely agree with.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.840]   I mean, it's just common sense.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.760]   You can't really-- you can't use leverage of owning the pipe
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.680]   to simply say, we don't approve of this means of communications
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.200]   we do.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.160]   We want to either disfavor or shut it down.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   However, then you talk to the people
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.320]   who are in charge of just maintaining these networks.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.880]   And you say-- and they are capable of making
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.960]   a very, very calm and reasoned case saying,
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.120]   you have no idea how much you're being killed by Netflix.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.360]   If we could shut down Netflix streaming,
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.840]   my job would be 80 times easier.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   And the service we can provide to other people in the network
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.360]   would be so much better because a small percentage of our users
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.160]   are using this service that uses an incredible amount of bandwidth.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.800]   So it's something that I have to keep--
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:12.000]   every time I feel that those nervous fingers going
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.680]   to my WordPress admin panel is like,
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.040]   time to really get angry about net.
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.840]   No, we'll make-- we'll talk about it.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:22.760]   But also mentioned that actually, especially on a mobile network
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.840]   where there's practically no bandwidth to begin with,
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.040]   you have to make sure they have the ability to at least make
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.440]   sure they're delivering good service to all of their clients.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.680]   And if they decide that, look, let's just reduce--
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.000]   let's not make Netflix less accessible,
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.200]   let's just make sure that it can't
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:41.960]   clobber the guy who just wants to use his wonderful peer
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.280]   to peer video chat software to talk to his baby.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.120]   Do talk to his baby.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.320]   Why not want this story?
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.560]   Why are you trying to--
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.600]   Comcast, why are you trying to keep me from talking to my baby?
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.680]   Why are you trying to be watching 10 series episodes
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.240]   in a row of lot in order?
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:58.600]   I mean, come on.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.360]   Well, Netflix is the perfect example because Comcast, in fact,
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:04.760]   is saying to level three, which is the backbone for Netflix,
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:07.400]   we're going to charge you extra for all that bandwidth
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.720]   that Netflix uses.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.560]   And of course, let's not forget Comcast
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.480]   competes directly with Netflix because they
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.080]   wanted you to pay for their video on demand.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.080]   And I have that-- if I sit down at my TV,
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:20.720]   I can watch Comcast video on demand,
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:24.320]   or I can watch it on Netflix or my Roku box with Amazon.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.120]   And that's competition.
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.480]   I think most people agree that we don't want them to set up
[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.720]   an anti-competitive environment, but we
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.920]   want to allow them the ability to run their networks
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.160]   so that, again, they're bruising its service.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.040]   I was about to say that I think that instead of bandwidth
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:40.240]   throttling, they should also institute taste throttling.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.400]   We'll all say--
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.240]   You know what?
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.000]   When you wanted to watch all three
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.280]   episodes of "News Radio," we were OK with that.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.840]   But two and a half men really--
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.240]   There are other people who are going
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.200]   to be watching better shows and be much rather
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:55.960]   than let them have the HD experience.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.440]   There's somebody in the switchboard
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.360]   like back in the-- whatever that SNL sketch was back in the day.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.240]   And Nott goes watching another episode of "Cougar Town."
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.600]   Shut up, Tanya.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.080]   That really--
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   Al Franken.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:12.000]   Only the government could threaten your first amendment rights.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.400]   Now corporations with government permission
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.800]   pose the greatest threat to your first amendment rights.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.720]   And tonight I want to tell you that I
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.640]   believe that net neutrality is the first amendment issue
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.360]   of our time.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:28.440]   Thank you, Al Franken.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.280]   I couldn't agree more now.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.560]   The answer is not nearly as simple as saying that,
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.240]   but it's absolutely true.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.720]   I think there's going to be two keys.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.640]   One is competition.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:39.720]   If there were competition--
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.640]   you know, it's fine to say, OK, I
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.240]   think you need to sunset this.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:45.600]   It needs to have a very specific time limit.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.800]   OK, we'll give you three years to get your network
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:49.240]   in order.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.680]   And everything that can be done to foster competition
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.400]   ought to be done.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.800]   If there were four internet service providers providing
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.240]   high-speed internet into my house,
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.840]   and one of them were net neutral,
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:02.880]   guess who's going to get my business?
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.520]   That always works great on paper.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:06.360]   But if you think competition always
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.960]   leads to a consumer friendly environment,
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.480]   try to go to a bank ATM and try to get them to not charge you
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.120]   5% to 10% of your withdrawal.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.320]   That's because there are only three banks in America.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:16.600]   Yeah, but they're competitive.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.920]   They're should bank America say, we're not going to--
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.440]   that's true.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.600]   We're going to make sure that you don't get charged by using--
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:22.800]   because everybody's going to come to us.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   Well, no, because--
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.280]   Right.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.080]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.600]   Competition may not be sufficient.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.440]   Real competition.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.600]   Let's put it that way.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:28.960]   But--
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.640]   Let me throw a monkey.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.320]   Let me throw a monkey wrench into the works.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:34.080]   What about white spaces?
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.240]   If that is the future of the way in which people
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.920]   are connecting, which--
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.360]   and it will likely happen, I think.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.400]   There's incredible download speeds.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.000]   There's incredible-- there's incredible speeds
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.800]   able to travel through walls, through brick buildings.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.920]   No sort of interference.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.160]   Not having to deal with the things that we deal with with Wi-Fi
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:53.760]   and sell the other connections.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.360]   If white spaces becomes the standard by which we judge
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.520]   mobile computing-- and yet that is under the FCC's purview--
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.440]   doling this out to mobile carriers and so forth,
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.680]   maybe that is why.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.160]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.960]   But I see that being such--
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.680]   again, these laws are written in such a way
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:14.120]   that they're five years too late.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.960]   And I think that's going to really be the next battle down--
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.800]   18 and teen Verizon get their hands on all of this different--
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.840]   all of this different megahertz spectrum and white space
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.080]   spectrum.
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.400]   How's that all going to fair it out?
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.960]   Barry is a very thoughtful Clayton Morris.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:32.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.280]   And for those of you not watching on video,
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.840]   about 18 copies of that picture of you on Twitter.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.640]   Clayton first really blossomed as a singer-songwriter
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.400]   when he went all acoustic.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.760]   That's just right.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.400]   Since "Innerspace" is in 1988.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.400]   And that's saying something.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.320]   That was one day--
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.320]   Right after my hit single "Contucky Woman"
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.920]   and "Forever Blue Jeans."
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   Yes.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.360]   [SINGING]
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:54.720]   All right.
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.880]   "Forever in Blue Jeans."
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.760]   [SINGING]
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:00.480]   That's all there, Neil.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.280]   I'm in impressions.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.800]   [SINGING]
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.000]   And that's what Verizon's talking about.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   I just got 10 cents extra.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   [SINGING]
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   [SINGING]
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   [SINGING]
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   [SINGING]
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   [SINGING]
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   I think the problem is that Clayton and I
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   have both been disjockeys forced to play Neil Diamond.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.440]   Were you ever a DJ Clayton?
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.440]   You must have been.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.360]   Yeah, my first job was in radio.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.400]   Oh, I love those days.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.200]   I love radio.
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.120]   Neil Diamond.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.360]   I worked on a radio station that launched in San Francisco.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.880]   And the theme of the radio station--
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:40.600]   this was a big gimmick, was build your own radio station.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.720]   We had to build your own radio station.
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.360]   You've always wanted to, which is moot.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:49.800]   But anyway, they started nothing but Neil Diamond
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.440]   for like three days, nonstop Neil Diamond.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.920]   And I'm sitting there spinning the--
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.520]   and now, and now, forever in Blue Jeans.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.640]   It's just one guy that voted over and over.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.200]   Oh, my God.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:46:59.700]   No.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:04.080]   And then you got to vote on who the second artist would be.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.800]   And that was Barbara Streisand.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.240]   And that's like the arcade version of Pandora.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:10.080]   Yeah, it was.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.840]   It was Pandora in the early days.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:17.520]   And then, except instead of getting really smart, really fast,
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:19.920]   it took four and a half years.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.080]   We added an artist a day.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.680]   It was so horrible.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.560]   Horrible.
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.000]   That station is now Spanish.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.240]   Come back with more Leo Leport here
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.080]   with a great Justine Azeric.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.120]   IJustine.com.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:34.880]   Watch her sing.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.320]   Watch her dance.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.920]   The YouTube channel is youtube.com/--
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:40.680]   I Justine.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.440]   Once easy to remember.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.760]   Is that the place people should really
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.560]   go as the YouTube channel?
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.160]   Pretty much.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.640]   I have like five YouTube channels,
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.280]   but you can find them all.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:51.280]   You can have mommy make my lunch.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:53.040]   I just need to do so.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.840]   No.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:55.760]   Mommy, back my lunch.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.160]   I don't know what I was thinking back in the day.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.720]   No, I love that.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.320]   I would just buy random domains and like, man,
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:01.800]   I should really do something about this.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   Mommy, back my lunch.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.040]   What a great name.com.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.080]   So I Justine.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.520]   Everybody knows her to find us Justine.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:10.400]   In fact, she pretty much owned Instagram.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.280]   I thank you for stop posting pictures of yourself
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.560]   on Instagram.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:15.320]   Oh, sorry.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.640]   I mean, I love seeing pictures of me Justine.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.320]   But it was automatic popular.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:20.960]   And if you went-- in the early days of Instagram,
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.000]   and you went in the popular, it was like 15 pictures of Justine.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.280]   Oh, see, I didn't even know that.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:25.800]   Oh, you did?
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:26.480]   See how it worked.
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:26.800]   No.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.400]   Because either you or Jack Dorsey.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.560]   Yeah, Ev, Jack Dorsey, and Justine.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.120]   That's so funny.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.000]   You still Instagram, though, don't you?
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:35.800]   For well, it's in a while.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:36.720]   I love it.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.280]   Oh, you've grown out of that.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.560]   No, I'm nice to use.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.240]   I just sometimes I forget.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:42.360]   I'm like--
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.720]   Are you a Goala or a four square?
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.240]   Yeah, I've always been a four square fan.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.080]   Now with the new four square update,
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:49.680]   it's pretty awesome.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:49.680]   I know.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.200]   I don't want to steal anybody's pick.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:53.520]   But the new four square is great.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.480]   Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.600]   Although I like Goala because I like to collect all the pins.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   You know me too.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.160]   You know with Goala, you can check into four square.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:01.440]   They're all mushy.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.000]   They're all mushy into one thing that Facebook will own
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.120]   in the end.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.240]   I use Facebook places also as well.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.160]   I'm still trying to figure out the benefit of location.
[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.200]   I mean, it's--
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.160]   There's no benefit.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.000]   What are you talking about?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000]   The benefit is people.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.800]   You know, you want your friends to be like, wow,
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.560]   you're so cool because you're at that place right now
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:20.680]   and I'm not.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.320]   You're right.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.200]   That is the benefit.
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:23.760]   That's the--
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.480]   Like, wait a minute.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.160]   He is at Walmart again.
[00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:28.480]   That's the problem.
[00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:30.640]   Clayton and I, we don't go anywhere glamorous.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.800]   It's just teens always going to the glamorous, but--
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.280]   I don't leave the house.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.480]   I check into Walmart too.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.160]   I'm like, yes, this is great.
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.840]   I just wanted to-- yeah, just to Instagram that one.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.200]   OK.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.920]   Just so I could check in.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:45.240]   Actually, this is not Instagram.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.840]   This is the Android.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:49.240]   I wish they'd do it in Instagram for Android.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.160]   You know what I like?
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.800]   Have you guys been using path at all?
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.480]   No.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.200]   I think it's stupid.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:54.880]   You like it?
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:55.880]   You know what?
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.240]   I found it-- I thought it was really nice.
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.120]   I thought it was really clean.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.160]   I really like that.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.880]   I like the interface, but the problem
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.880]   is it's limited to 50 friends.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.040]   You like that though.
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:05.600]   Well, I like that.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:07.560]   I thought it served a purpose in--
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:09.240]   I thought it served a niche purpose.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.200]   I also loved it too because the logo looks
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.560]   eerily similar to the Philadelphia Phillies logo.
[00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.400]   Is that true?
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.400]   It does.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.800]   I mean, it's a red P.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:19.880]   Oh, that's right.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:20.880]   Hmm.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.480]   My issue with path is I would be OK with having only 50
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.200]   friends except people who I don't want to be my friends end
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.440]   up showing up in my feed because they share their stuff
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.440]   with me.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.160]   So now that they're sharing, it's people
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:35.520]   that I don't even know that are showing up in my feed, which
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.840]   kind of I feel like defeats the purpose.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.360]   I thought it was just a bizarre idea to have 50 friends.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.400]   I mean, it's very contrary.
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.480]   And I understand that they thought
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.000]   that they would stand out because of that.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.480]   But I like Instagram.
[00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.000]   I really do.
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.960]   And I'm just posting now on pick please that photo, which
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.000]   is pick P-I-C-P-L-Z is the Android alternative.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.440]   Now, there's been a backlash.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.080]   SLR folks now, Andy, I know you take a lot of great photos
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.400]   of food.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.240]   Of everything, of diners.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.960]   And do you ever posted an Instagram from there?
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.240]   Or do you--
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.440]   I don't use Instagram because the lower-res pictures,
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.600]   I simply go directly to Twitter.
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.600]   The better ones will go into my Flickr feed.
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:19.400]   And I've just never had a room in my life for anything else.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.600]   Oh, because you have-- was it--
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.240]   I-- I can't think of it.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:29.960]   In your SLR, the SD card that's Wi-Fi and what do you think?
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:30.840]   Oh, Wi-Fi.
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:31.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:31.920]   Yeah, Wi-Fi.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.880]   Well, there was a bit of a backlash this week
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:36.840]   because a number of people on Instagram were not--
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.040]   they were uploading SLR photos.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.000]   All the time.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.200]   I've been complaining about it since day one on Instagram.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:42.880]   I guess it's--
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:44.000]   I'm going to do a fever pitch.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.520]   You know, if my iPhone weren't in France,
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:54.160]   I would look right now, but it's in France, so I can't.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.800]   It's being-- it's in the mail back,
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.880]   which means I'll probably get it sometime around summer.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:02.360]   Right when the iPhone 5 comes out, I'll get my iPhone.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.800]   There'll be a lot of nude photos on there.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:05.960]   Yeah, really.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.800]   Who's this?
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:11.160]   Now, this came out-- this came out pretty good, I think.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.320]   Oh, I'm going to post it to my own Instagram.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:15.960]   Maybe I'll even post it on path, too.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.800]   I'm going to get a little crazy over here.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:21.440]   See, because with a new 4-square, that goes everywhere.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.520]   It goes to 4-square, all sorts of places.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.480]   Oh.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:26.000]   What?
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:26.640]   I don't understand.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.040]   It sounds skeptical.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.920]   No, no, I'm just saying that there's--
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.760]   it's a race that you run, and there's
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.160]   a point at which you say that this line I will not cross.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.120]   Not because-- no, I'm being completely serious here.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.200]   It's not a judgment thing.
[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.880]   It's more like a thing where I'm perfectly OK
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.040]   with choosing a moment that say, well, this is a really cool,
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.440]   simple thing I want to post to Twitter,
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.200]   so my Twitter follows, we'll see it great.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.120]   Hey, wow, here's a really cool photo that I'm actually kind of
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.120]   proud of.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.360]   Or here's a photo story I want to tell of, and a bit.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:56.920]   Oh, you're talking about editing.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:57.760]   You're talking about--
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.640]   Well, no, I'm talking about-- there's
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:02.040]   a point at which I feel as though I have to--
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.760]   I want to stop documenting.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:08.160]   And it's OK if I don't have five different social media
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.680]   places where I want to post things.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.160]   As it is, this is-- I think 2011 is going to be the year
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.520]   when I finally be grudgingly decide that, OK, I'll expand
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.320]   a little bit more into Facebook.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.400]   Because right now, it's essentially--
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.800]   I want Facebook just so I can read real friends
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:23.880]   Facebook postings.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:27.800]   But I've never really taken it seriously only because if it's
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.840]   long, I want to blog it.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:30.400]   If it's short, I want to just Twitter it.
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.200]   Why do I want to get involved in Facebook
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:35.320]   and give that little Harvard bastard another--
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.000]   Aha.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.320]   You know, listen, I never use Facebook until this year.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.320]   I am not even kidding you.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.360]   Because back in the day, I approved every friend.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:44.960]   So my entire profile will just spam
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.560]   to people that I didn't know.
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.440]   So I deleted every one I didn't know.
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.720]   And now it's my friend's only.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.560]   And it's actually really useful.
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:52.280]   So I'm running around.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.920]   I'm like, hey, do you guys-- you brought this new website
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   called Facebook and Facebook.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.720]   It's so cool.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:56.880]   You can follow your friends.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.720]   But that's my problem.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.640]   I'm like, great.
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.280]   So are you really that full of yourself, Andy?
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.160]   Are you really going to create a fan group for yourself
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.200]   on Facebook?
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:05.680]   Really?
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.120]   You're that big that you can't just
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.160]   friend every other--
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.080]   Show of hands.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:10.560]   Show of hands.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.600]   How many people on this broadcast have a fan page for them?
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.720]   For themselves.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:17.760]   See, but I don't think it's--
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.560]   I don't really think it's--
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.920]   And Clayton just dive off camera.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.280]   Well, look, here-- oh, yeah.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   Of course you do.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.440]   We're building brands.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:27.720]   What's wrong with you, Andy?
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.880]   They call it something else other than fan.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.720]   No, no, I think--
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:32.040]   I call it a page.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.520]   I never call it a page.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.240]   Ever.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.160]   Anyone help me out, Lido?
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.760]   I know you've got to.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:40.120]   If I could change the name of that page--
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.360]   Because the box had set that up for me on Facebook,
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.040]   the fan page.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.520]   I had my main page, and then I reached 5,000 friends.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.480]   And I'm going to have a message.
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.040]   So what is it?
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:50.320]   Facebook's my fan page.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:54.160]   Facebook.com/FoxyPlatonMoris.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.080]   What?
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:56.080]   I don't even know.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:57.560]   Clayton Morris and Friends.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.040]   What is it?
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.040]   No, it's just Clayton Morris.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.040]   Clayton Morris.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:00.960]   Yeah, Clayton Morris.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.600]   Let me pull up.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:02.520]   That's all right.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.280]   But you don't own it, Fox on it?
[00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.760]   I hate that it says fan page on it.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:06.680]   I'm totally agree.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:08.920]   I feel like it's a little--
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:09.440]   I don't know.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.560]   So that's why you've posted absolutely nothing on it?
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.560]   Well, no.
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:16.360]   I like to-- because other people can't have access to--
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.440]   I don't want them having access to my personal page anymore.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.200]   So this is where I try to do everything that I do.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.840]   I must have the wrong Clayton Morris, because--
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.320]   Yeah, I don't like-- there's nothing there.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.200]   No, it's Clayton Morris fan page on Facebook.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:26.240]   Clayton Morris fan page.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:26.760]   Fan page.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:28.200]   I hate that it's all there.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:28.960]   I do.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:29.920]   I totally agree with you.
[00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:30.560]   There it is.
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.640]   Yes, see, I don't call mine that.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.560]   But I don't know.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:34.480]   They called it that.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.840]   And then I now-- you can't pull it back.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.080]   Once you do it, you can't pull it back.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:37.480]   No, you can.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.280]   You get two chances.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:39.640]   Really?
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.840]   Is it under your account or is it under their account?
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.520]   No, it's under mine.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.160]   You could change the page name twice.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.360]   Facebook.com--
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:49.080]   Leo--
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.680]   If you go to Facebook.com/username.
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:56.440]   No, I'm Leo Laporte, because somebody else is Leo Laporte.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.840]   Yeah, someone took Clayton Morris,
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.600]   and I had to take Clayton B. Morris, which
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:00.720]   is my middle initial.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.560]   So my fan--
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:02.840]   Andy, see what you're missing?
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.680]   My fan page.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.000]   This is my fan page, see?
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.160]   And it doesn't say fan page or anything.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.640]   This is Leo Laporte.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:11.480]   You can just do that.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.360]   You don't have to be fans.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.320]   Yeah, I hate that.
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:19.640]   I only have 11 friends, but they're all fans.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.400]   You're very active over there.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:24.120]   I hope I'm one of them, Leo, because I consider you my friend.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.840]   Are you on Facebook, Andy?
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:26.400]   Yes, I am.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.800]   I'm not go on Facebook.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.800]   OK.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.520]   I have a friend too.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:29.920]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:32.520]   Will you improve my friend a bit?
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:37.200]   The extra dimension is that I'm the only boy in my family.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.400]   So I now have legal--
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:43.320]   I am the in- out-go of my immediate blood relatives.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.440]   But unfortunately, I have an un-poking you.
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.200]   I have a cousin who have kids.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:47.880]   Poking you.
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:48.960]   Poke.
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   Poke.
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:51.040]   Poke.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.000]   I've poked you.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.320]   At least-- OK, at least I've stopped referring to it
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.520]   as the Facebook.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.080]   You're coming along.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.280]   You're coming along.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.920]   That's always the first step.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.200]   I'm on the Twitter.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.200]   It says, you are about to poke Andy.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.200]   I hate the way they will be.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.200]   They will be--
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.200]   They will be just by chair.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.720]   It should be he or she will be informed of this on his or her
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:12.720]   home base.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.320]   Not they will be informed of this on their home.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.800]   I hate it when people do that.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:16.960]   That's how the kids are talking.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   Is it?
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.560]   I don't know.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.360]   And also--
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.360]   I'm so sick and tired of this.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.240]   I'm fam.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.400]   I had like 20 messages in my inbox on Facebook the other day.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.000]   And I've been getting them all week.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.440]   Hey, is this you in this video?
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:30.560]   Yeah, I hate that.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:31.800]   And I am so sick of this.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:32.440]   That's by the way.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.120]   By the way, that's a--
[00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:34.960]   That's a virus.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:35.720]   That's a malware.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.120]   Yeah, they're trying to infect you.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:38.640]   Well--
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.640]   Don't click that.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.160]   Don't click that.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.160]   I'm not looking at my phone.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:41.680]   Did you--
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.200]   Oh, is that me?
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.400]   I got a video of you from last night.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.200]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, and then you have to click it.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.560]   It's like, whoa.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:47.080]   But it isn't.
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:47.920]   Yeah, is it out there?
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:48.920]   Where was I last night?
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:49.920]   I thought I was asleep in my house.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.240]   Must have been blacked out.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.440]   Pretty, tricky.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.960]   I only thought he was dead.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.920]   All right, let's take it.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.680]   It just got very much more complicated.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:02.800]   How much click time to get my hands on at home to go to that?
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:03.800]   OK.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:08.680]   For people who want to know, just like you, Justine, I retreated.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.440]   I deleted my Facebook page, remember.
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:14.000]   And then when I went back, I only added people I know.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.560]   So it's just-- it's like a real person.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.880]   It's not much more refreshing.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.240]   Yeah, and then even the fan page or the page, whatever.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.920]   I mean, I use that too, and you can still interact and leave
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:26.320]   comments and respond back to people too, which works out really well.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:29.560]   And you and I are actually Facebook friends.
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.640]   How about that?
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.160]   Yeah, it's not nice.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.720]   Oh, no, you're-- oh, we're not.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.720]   We're not.
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:35.720]   We used to be.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:40.360]   See, this really goes back to the point of what is friendship.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:41.080]   I'm going to ask--
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:43.960]   Obviously, we didn't even know that we weren't friends.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.760]   So so much for that.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.600]   I know.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.400]   Oh, here's the problem, Justine.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:48.880]   That's the whole thing.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:49.400]   OK.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:53.160]   Sorry, this user has too many friend requests.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:57.800]   See, that's the big issue, because I went through and deleted 10,000 friends manually.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.880]   And now they don't actually delete.
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:01.720]   They go into another queue, and then you
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.720]   have to delete all of those all over again.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.640]   So I spent a good four weeks deleting 10,000 people.
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:10.400]   You should do what I did, which is literally delete your entire Facebook presence, and then
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.240]   just go away for a few months.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.240]   Oh, I know.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:14.240]   So it's hard to do.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.480]   So it's impossible for us to be friends, because I have too many friend requests.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.560]   And so do you.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.920]   So we can't be friends.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:23.360]   I think we're rewriting the glass, Miranda, and Ashley right now.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:27.560]   Oh, many folks in friend requests that I have in my day.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:29.520]   As a matter of fact, I had so many one year, I
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.320]   had to set up a fan page on front my space.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.120]   That's the Tennessee or any Ford version.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.320]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.760]   Anyway, I have a great we have a great panel today.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.160]   It's just so fun to have all three of you.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   Andy Inako is here.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.840]   Justin Azerik, iJustine.com.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:49.080]   And he's at the Chicago Sun times, of course, Clayton Morris from Flux and Friends.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.560]   And you have a gaming podcast.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.080]   I never get to I never plug that.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.080]   I should plug.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:55.600]   Yeah, I mean, I do a tech take, which is once a week.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.880]   It's just sort of my take of tech for the week, but also
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.520]   gadgets and games, which has sort of gotten broken up into some smaller segments now
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.520]   that we're doing.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:08.080]   Because people are responding more to these smaller segments than an hour straight.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.480]   So we're testing some things out here for the holidays.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.960]   Short attention spans.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.280]   Yeah, I mean, that's what it is.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.840]   You know, do you use it in the segments?
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.080]   Do you use it in Squarespace for your gadgets, games?
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:18.560]   What do you--
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.600]   No, I just use it for my podcast that Andy's been a guest on,
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:24.800]   the Grizzly Buried Cafe.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.000]   We actually have a Squarespace site there, which houses the podcast.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   And then I have my personal page, Clayton Morris, over at Squarespace, which is just--
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:33.600]   I just love it.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.720]   I mean, it's so easy to use.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.720]   And I have a bunch of people who work on the sites and who, you know,
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.880]   through the podcast editors and so forth, and they publishing the podcast.
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.080]   And yeah, and so if you know, they have access to it, it's so easy for them to use.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:49.000]   I don't have to jump in there and do anything to it.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.200]   They have access.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.360]   They don't know how to write any CMS.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.360]   They don't know any of that stuff.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:53.920]   They don't need to.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.160]   And just, yeah, they don't need to.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.560]   That's what I love about Squarespace.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:03.960]   Go to Squarespace.com right now/MacBreak and take a look at Squarespace.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:06.480]   The secret behind exceptional websites couldn't be easier.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.320]   In fact, right now what I would do is just click that green button there
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.160]   and it says, "Try it for free.
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.320]   You don't need a credit card or anything.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:17.040]   You just put the site name, make up a site name, password, make it up obviously,
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:21.720]   email address in case you forget it, and then a little cap show to keep bots from doing this.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:22.920]   And there you go.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:26.000]   That's all you have to do to have a site for two weeks.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.400]   You can import your existing site if you want.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:34.160]   It supports all the big APIs, including movable type, type pad, blogger, WordPress.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:38.800]   They just come in including text, images, tags, authors, comments, all the original URLs,
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.960]   all automatically imported, which makes it very easy to try.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.960]   Because you could see what would my content, all of my original content,
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.680]   look like under this new regime.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:51.920]   Squarespace is hosting and software.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.360]   Great hosting, by the way.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:57.920]   I mean, never down hosting, really reliable hosting, very affordable to $12.
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:00.440]   It starts at $12 a month.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:04.520]   And if you use the coupon code MACBRAKE when you sign up, you'll get 10% off for the life
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.440]   of your site.
[01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.280]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:09.840]   We use it for our Insight Twit blog.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.120]   You know a good way to see what Squarespace is capable of.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:18.720]   Go to squarespace.com/macbreak and click the examples link and you can see a variety of
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   Squarespace sites, all of them unique.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:23.720]   Here's Brie Pettis' blog, Brie does that MakerBot.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.600]   I mean, if they have anybody, I mean, there you go.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:27.600]   Look at that.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.080]   That's just his unique style.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.480]   And that's what's great about Squarespace.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:39.960]   It's your style built upon the most rock solid serving software.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:40.960]   squarespace.com/macbreak.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:41.960]   Give it a try.
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.960]   Everybody use it.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.800]   All the cool kids are doing it.
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:49.920]   So Apple says it's little hobby, it's little itty bitty hobby.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.800]   The Apple TV is going to sell 1 million units.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.680]   Yeah, funny how suddenly they're willing to talk about how many they're selling.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.680]   Yeah, they never mentioned it with the other one, did they?
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.800]   I guess they just didn't want to inhibit the market by bragging about how many of the
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.480]   previous ones they're selling.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.840]   So we know it's less than a million.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:14.760]   What's interesting is that the CEO of Roku said, "Oh yeah, we're going to talk about
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.760]   it."
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.040]   Now of course they've been selling for a lot longer.
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.320]   But he said, "Our sales double when Apple TV came out."
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:23.040]   So clearly Apple, I don't know if it's the time as writer that Apple TV kind of raised
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.040]   people's awareness.
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.240]   But people want a little simple box that connects your TV to the Internet.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.880]   Well, I also think it wasn't just timing with Apple TV.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880]   It was Google TV as well.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.240]   And you're seeing the price of the Logitech review box.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:37.880]   And you're seeing some of these other solutions out there, the Sony television that with Google
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.880]   TV baked in.
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.000]   And you're seeing the price tag on some of those things.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.280]   And you're seeing the value proposition for that low end Roku box, which I think is what
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.280]   they're selling.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:46.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:48.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:53.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:03:59.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:20.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:27.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:34.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:41.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:48.280]   And you're seeing the price tag on the iPhone TV.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:52.280]   But I think it'll be really interesting when Hulu plus ads
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.280]   hairblade to it.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.280]   And I'm watching it on the iPad.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.280]   And then I could come home and go right back to the screen with it
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.280]   right from the iPad.
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.280]   Any word?
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.280]   Do we have any idea when some of these third party companies are jumping
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.280]   on board?
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.280]   Andy, what do you see?
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.280]   Andrew?
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.280]   I don't know anything about that.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.280]   I don't know why they would.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:11.280]   Because I think that if you're a company with resources and you
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:14.280]   have to spend money to put this feature in, I think your answer
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.280]   to that question is going to be yes.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   But you are aware the Apple TV does have Netflix support built
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.280]   right into the actual device.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.280]   I don't know why you would want the stream of the party.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.280]   Yeah, but third part, I would love to see what I mean.
[01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:26.280]   We talked about this.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.280]   I think we really want to see his apps.
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:30.280]   I mean, you really want to see the presentation app that can
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.280]   easily integrate with AirPlay.
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:34.280]   So you walk in any conference room or just in one company, you
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:39.280]   buy a cool $99 hockey puck for every conference room.
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.280]   And now everybody with a phone, everybody with an iPad can just
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.280]   simply.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.280]   The meeting actually starts at say, one oh one not.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:49.280]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:50.280]   I left a dog go back by office.
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.280]   Okay.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.280]   Hey, God.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.280]   Oh, is that an HD?
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:54.280]   Oh, I don't have an HD of eye dogs.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.280]   Can I can I just copy to the guy bar?
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.280]   So it's a debt book.
[01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:58.280]   Oh, for God.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:01.280]   Like I was even interested in your report.
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   Are you on our meeting last week?
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:09.280]   Last Thursday, I was I had created a great presentation.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.280]   I did it first in keynote on my air and then I I emailed it to
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.280]   myself and I opened it in on the iPad and keynote on the iPad.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:18.280]   You're right, Andy is really fun to work with in a way.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:21.280]   It was I mean, just it looks so good on that iPad and I never
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.280]   could get it to work on the screen player.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   And so if I didn't give the presentation, well, I had the
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.280]   dongle.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280]   It wasn't the iPad's fault.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   It was the you know, the the the the the projector didn't sense
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.280]   it.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   And it just and I you know, I worked on it for 15 minutes and then
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.280]   the time was up and it was like, you don't get to give your
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.280]   speech.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.280]   And that was all the work was I had to give a speech back in the
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:42.280]   spring and it was all Mac based.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.280]   I built it all in keynote, of course, and it was like it was
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   going to be like an hour and a half speech that I had to do a
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.280]   keynote.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.280]   And and I get there and then they don't have any Mac capability.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   So, you know, I mean, and I was I got there four hours early.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.280]   So 1995 was ridiculous.
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.280]   But I think there's a differentiation between video and
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.280]   audio to I think a lot of these a lot of the third party apps
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.280]   have airplay built in for audio purposes.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:08.280]   I mean, just even looking at the audible app, for instance,
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.280]   you know, right there, Airplay thrown right in it can throw
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:14.280]   throw up an audio book right to my screen and listen to that.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:18.280]   But, you know, you want the video, the news hour, the PBS
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.280]   News Hour app has has airplay in the app through through YouTube
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.280]   though, and I'm getting audio from that.
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.280]   But I'd love to see the video.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.280]   And I don't see why Netflix wouldn't be interested in doing
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.280]   that if they're trying.
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.280]   I don't know how much extra resources and money would it
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.280]   take to add that functionality.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.280]   I don't know how much Netflix on my iPad to be able to just
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280]   communicate.
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:41.280]   Well, Netflix says though that nobody watches Netflix on
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.280]   their iPad.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:43.280]   Remember that?
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.280]   They said it's not really a big thing for us.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:46.280]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280]   I'm trying to say this.
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.280]   Actually, watch Netflix that much on my iPad.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   I mean, I buy so many shows and things on iTunes that it works
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.280]   great.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.280]   And then you watch it on your iPad or you watch it on the big
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.280]   screen.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280]   You watch it on the big screen, right?
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:07:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.280]   And then I watch it with seems like at home on Apple TV.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.280]   But I did just get the new Sony TV with Google TV.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.280]   What do you think?
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.280]   And there's something like I actually really, really like it.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.280]   Really?
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.280]   And the setup was I really do have the logic to review and it's
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.280]   the one I mean, I just connected.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.280]   Oh my God.
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.280]   No, I love it.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.280]   I mean, I'm just sitting there watching TV.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.280]   I'm like, huh, I'm just going to Google something.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.280]   I'm going to go on Facebook.
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.280]   So just being able to do those two things.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.280]   You know, like you're the person they designed that for.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   Oh, really?
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.280]   I really did.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:25.280]   It was the iJustine box.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.280]   I think they did it.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.280]   And then I mean, I walked so much YouTube content that I just
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.280]   cruise on over to YouTube and yeah, no, I am a big fan.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   Now I get it because it's for me.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.280]   It was like, I have all of them.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:44.280]   On one TV, I have the Apple, the Roku, the boxy, the Logitech
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:45.280]   review.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:46.280]   I mean, I and more.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.280]   There's even more.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.280]   And I end up using Roku almost all the time.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:52.280]   And that's about it.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.280]   I think they mean Apple TV for me.
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.280]   So I'm pretty happy with it.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:57.280]   All right.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.280]   They're doing all right.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:59.280]   Nobody's complaining.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.280]   Let's talk real quickly.
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.280]   We have to get to our picks of the week and we will in a moment.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.280]   But let's go through a couple of the big headlines of the week.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.280]   Wall Street Journal continues its privacy series this time
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:13.280]   hitting at apps, including Pandora, which they say not only sends your
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.280]   unique identifier from the iPhone when you listen to Pandora, but also
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:21.280]   sends your location and a bunch of other information about you.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:25.280]   A lot of apps do this according to the Wall Street Journal.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:28.280]   Macworld says concern is overblown.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.280]   What do you guys think?
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.280]   I think it's just a principle thing.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:34.280]   It's the principle.
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.280]   I just think it's a principle thing where one thing that I like about
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.280]   Android over iPhone is that before you install an app, it'll tell you
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:44.280]   here is everything that this case, here's everything this phone is
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.280]   this application is interested in getting off of your phone and
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.280]   there are times when I've said, I just want to calculate a tip.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.280]   Why do you need to know what my phone number is?
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:52.280]   Right.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:54.280]   And on that basis, I haven't installed it.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280]   Oh, really?
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   So you've actually not installed apps when they asked for too much.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.280]   It's a good onion.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.280]   It's like, well, why the hell do you need my phone number?
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280]   Right.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.280]   And for define what you want to do.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:06.280]   Now, that's kind of ironic though, because one of the other things that
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:11.280]   the journal article was talking about was that more people are more
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.280]   developers are more likely to violate Google's privacy limitations on
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.280]   their app store than Apple's developers are to violate Apple.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   Apple rules on the app store.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.280]   Because Apple doesn't expose it.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   So there's still exposure, but the thing is that they have a
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.280]   stricter policy hardwired into their app store policy saying that
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.280]   you're not allowed to get any information for any promotional
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:38.280]   purpose that's not directly related to the task that your app is
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:39.280]   supposed to form.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.280]   Now, realize that anybody who's been watching the app store for
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.280]   anything over nine seconds knows that a lot of stuff gets through
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.280]   that doesn't violate its policies and has to be rolled back later on.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.280]   But at least that policy is there.
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.280]   But again, we don't get down to the question of, for me, it's
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.280]   not the question of what is my actual level of exposure here?
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:59.280]   Because I do believe that my level of exposure is pretty minimal.
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.280]   It's hard to like spend any time on the internet every day and
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:05.280]   then suddenly say, well, I'm okay with people tracking every single
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.280]   thing I do and profiling every single thing I do on this notebook
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.280]   computer, but you better not let track every single thing I do on
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.280]   this phone because that's fighting words, sir.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.280]   But still it's the principle of thing.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.280]   Does it concern you, Justine?
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:19.280]   I mean, you use the phone more than anybody I know.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.280]   Yeah, no.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.280]   I mean, you know, you don't really think about it.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:26.280]   And I mean, there's been times I put pictures and I didn't realize
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.280]   that my GPS location was on.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.280]   And so, I mean, at any point, I'm getting back Google map pictures
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.280]   of my actual location.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.280]   So times like that, I mean, it kind of scares me.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.280]   Well, that's one thing.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.280]   But when Pandora sends your age, gender, location, phone identifier,
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.280]   not just to itself, but to multiple ad networks or paper toss,
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:48.280]   which is a free game, shares your information with five different
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.280]   ad companies, that does seem a little excessive.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   Especially paper toss.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.280]   I mean, do you really need?
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.280]   Yeah, what do you need?
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:59.280]   I'm just throwing some paper into the trash cans.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.280]   How much do you need?
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.280]   I agree with Andy on the Android front too.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:06.280]   I mean, that's one big thing.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.280]   I do love about Android, letting you know that it's going to do this.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.280]   This, this, it's going to be shared with these five different ad
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:12.280]   companies.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:13.280]   Do you not want to install it or not?
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.280]   And, you know, I'm very careful, obviously, about the things that
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.280]   I check in on location wise.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.280]   And it's always like a general sort of area.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.280]   I'm never checking in at home.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:28.280]   But like, you know, when I'm out and about or maybe I'm at an event,
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.280]   then it's appropriate to check in and whatever, using one of those,
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.280]   one of those different check-in features.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.280]   But I'm very aware of, at least I try to be, but not everyone is.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.280]   You're launching these applications.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.280]   They may be running in the background.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.280]   They're collecting data.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.280]   They're doing different things based on where you are.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:47.280]   And I don't think a lot of people have any idea about this.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:50.280]   I mean, I certainly, if I, if I told my mom that she was being
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.280]   tracked, she wouldn't have any clue that this was happening.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.280]   Which should be upset about it?
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.280]   I don't know.
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.280]   I don't know that she care.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:01.280]   I mean, unless there's some sort of trigger in her mind that treats
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:05.280]   it sort of like the do not call list, you know, sort of like a telemarketer.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.280]   That this is an invasion of space.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.280]   This is an invasion of privacy.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:11.280]   To my mind, what are the, what are these individuals doing with it?
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:15.280]   If she suddenly starts getting mailers somehow at the house because she
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.280]   seems to be near a pet store, she's, why am I suddenly getting all these
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:19.280]   catalogs for fish?
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:24.280]   You know, I bet I think she might take umbrage with it, but I don't know
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.280]   that she can't.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:27.280]   You know, how many times have I said that to myself?
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.280]   Why am I getting all these catalogs for fish?
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.280]   Or pottery barn catalogs.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.280]   Hmm.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.280]   Well, I love those.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.280]   Thirty of them.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.280]   You do wonder when they're going to stop.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.280]   I mean, actually, I guess if they stopped sending paper junk mail,
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.280]   the postal service would then just end.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.280]   Period.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.280]   Yeah, you know, it's funny.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:53.280]   We're up here in the mountains and I haven't even set up a mailbox here
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.280]   because I don't intend on getting any mail.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.280]   What are you going to get that you want?
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.280]   Right.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.280]   The only thing I'd get would be like pottery barn catalogs.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:00.280]   And I don't want that.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:01.280]   You know, I don't need that stuff.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.280]   And all of the other junk.
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.280]   I pay every bill online.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:08.280]   So anything that needs to come to me is going to come to my other mailbox.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.280]   I don't need to set it up because the only thing that's going to start
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.280]   going up is going to be Victoria's Secret catalogs.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:13.280]   Oh, wait.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.280]   Now, there is a great iPad app, by the way, if you want to avoid the paper
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:21.280]   of Victoria's Secret has all the catalogs right in there on the app.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   Really?
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.280]   And they glow from within.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.280]   I'll never forget my father-in-law who's in his late 70s saying, you know,
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:31.280]   they seem like such friendly girls.
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.280]   Girls, you just like to get to know.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:35.280]   I thought, yeah, that's true, Dad.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.280]   They are friendly.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.280]   They're friendly girls.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.280]   You know, just love to get to know them.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.280]   Hang out.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.280]   No, it's the word.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.280]   I've interviewed a couple of them.
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.280]   I never get flummoxed in interviews, you know, interview senators on a regular basis
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.280]   and speakers and former former who knows what's a monkey.
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.280]   But when there's a when there's.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.280]   I get flustered whenever I interview monkeys.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.280]   Because you never know how they're going to act.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280]   You don't.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.280]   They can't.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:06.280]   But Victoria's Secret models in the studio, six of them lining up and you walk in.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.280]   They've got an entourage of like 30 people.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.280]   I mean, you know, you get a little faint.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.280]   I think we've all learned a little bit about Clayton Morris today.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.280]   I get faint when I just eat in the room.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.280]   We learned the play.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:19.280]   It's very, very normal.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.280]   I do, actually.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.280]   The first time I did, we did Mac Break Weekly with I Justine was at the 21st Amendment
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:25.280]   brew pub.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:28.280]   And I hadn't met you yet.
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:34.280]   And this stunning woman sits down at the table, which of course, first of all, is a shock
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.280]   because let's face it.
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:41.280]   The kinds of people who show up at our fence are usually overweight guys.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.880]   But we're not talking about you.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.280]   The person who's listening to this.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.280]   No, there are many stunning women.
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:49.280]   Yeah, but it was just, I mean, it's not completely unheard of, but it was a little bit.
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.280]   It was like, and then she pulls out her phone and I don't think it was an iPhone yet.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.280]   I think it was a blackberry.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   And it was the Spritrio.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.280]   Spritrio.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.280]   That's right.
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:58.280]   And you just like this the whole time.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.280]   And I think she's lost.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:01.280]   She's lost.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.280]   She doesn't know what she's doing here.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.280]   And then she said, I'm Justine and I went, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.280]   I'm tweeting the entire time.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.280]   You were.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:13.280]   I suddenly understood why Jackie Gleason goes, how am I gonna, how am I gonna, how am I gonna.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:16.280]   And now you also understand why Justine doesn't tweet her location.
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280]   Yes.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.280]   Yes.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   People show up.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   You know what I say?
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   Do people show up?
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.280]   Do people show up?
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.280]   Do people show up places?
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.280]   They have been just the coolest people ever.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   I think that's okay.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.280]   My suggestion is four square after you leave.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:29.280]   Or as you leave.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:30.280]   I'm not due.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.280]   Yeah, I definitely do that.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.280]   So if you're stalking, I Justine, you can always be the place she was.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.280]   Yes.
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.280]   So just hang out there for a couple days and I'll probably do that.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:44.280]   OS 10, the app store comes online January 6th announced on apple.com.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   And at the same time, they say we're gonna take the downloads feature off.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:52.280]   If you're on your Mac and you pull down that Apple and you see software update.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:55.280]   And then right below it, Mac OS 10 software.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.280]   That pulls you, of course, to the Apple downloads page.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.280]   Very popular page.
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:04.280]   It's kind of, I think, one of the top pages for Apple users.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.080]   That's gonna be gone.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.280]   The only place you'll be able to go is the app store.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.480]   What about, does anybody know yet what about Apple's own software that they have through
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.480]   that download center?
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.480]   App store.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.480]   That's gonna go through the app store also.
[01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:16.480]   Yep.
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:24.360]   In fact, if you look at the app store ad closely, you'll see right there, iPhoto, GarageBand,
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.280]   iMovie, Pages, keynote, Numbers.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.280]   $15 for those iWork applications.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.280]   And if you add that up, that's about what they're charging in the store.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   They have a free game, Rollum.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:39.280]   They have a $30 example, obviously, called Color Studio.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.280]   And they have a $5 game.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:47.280]   So they're showing kind of in this ad, right on the Apple site, what we can expect for
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   charges and so forth.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.280]   This will replace the download page.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.280]   It's the beginning of the end, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.280]   That's all I'm gonna say.
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:01.960]   The developers I've talked to, none of them seem to think that it's not a good idea to
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:02.960]   be there.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.960]   No, everybody's gonna do it.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.960]   It's great.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.240]   It's a great place.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.080]   Much better than the download page.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.760]   Although there are issues because Apple's already said what its guidelines are for the
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.800]   app store and there will be programs, demo programs, beta programs that are on the downloads
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:24.480]   page that cannot exist on the app store, according to Apple's fairly strict restrictions.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   So some people will be left out in the cold.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.800]   And not really because they can have a presence on the app store and also presence on whatever
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.920]   venue they're already using to sell their app.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.400]   But they were using this downloads page, which is gone.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.640]   So it's one venue less that they'll have.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.640]   Well, I'll give you the--
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:40.800]   One other venue.
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.200]   Well, their own page.
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:44.200]   Well, here's an example.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.200]   Adobe Sketchup.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.920]   Well, yeah, Adobe, but that's a big boy.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.160]   What about a smaller app developer?
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.160]   That's the one.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.640]   I mean, somebody else who does not Adobe, that's the powerhouse, right?
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:19:02.000]   I mean, so somebody else has an ability to channel somehow, which I'm not really certain
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.920]   that anything's going to be able to measure up to the Mac App Store.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.960]   Anyway, I don't know.
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:11.840]   I don't want to be-- I'm the chicken littler in all this, but it's begun.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:16.720]   I think if you want an app and it's somewhere else, you'll just go get it.
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.520]   So it's a lot of big deal.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520]   That's true.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.120]   So have you seen that speaking of apps, have any of you downloaded this app?
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:29.160]   This world-- this-- this-- Clayton Morris is thinking.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.480]   I actually kind of-- wait a minute, pause this.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.280]   Clayton, right there between Robert De Niro.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.280]   It's awesome.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.360]   And Ben Stiller, you're a little faucker.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.560]   That's what I'm used to calling it.
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.600]   That's actually a-- I'm going to-- we should-- somebody-- OK, capture this.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.680]   And I think we want a movie poster.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.920]   It's just begging to be done.
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:57.080]   By the way, somebody tweeted, and I think it's true, that if you don't look at the rest of
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.960]   his face, that could be me.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.440]   They're over on your left.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.440]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.600]   No, I clicked on the link and I was like, is that Leo?
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:05.600]   That was so--
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.240]   It looks like it's me and Clayton.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.800]   I get my eyes on you, Morris.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   De Niro.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.800]   I get my eyes on you.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:16.800]   Anyway, let's--
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.360]   Back to this world lens.
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.360]   This-- a word lens.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.360]   This is-- watch this.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.880]   If you haven't seen this video yet, this is-- has anybody-- is this--
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.320]   true or is this just-- oh, yeah.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:30.240]   So she's holding up signs in Spanish and on the iPhone, it's immediately translated
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.240]   into English.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.720]   Yeah, now it's nowhere near as fluid as this video.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.720]   Makes it have to be, by the way.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:37.720]   Yeah, there's-- so they're editing in time.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.680]   Yeah, I can download it.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:42.640]   There is a lot of people who are complaining that the free version only reverses the text
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:46.760]   and if you actually want to, you know, do the language conversion, you have to pay for
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.760]   it.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.760]   Well--
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.760]   I mean, I think that's something that you'd be willing to pay for.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.680]   Who's paid for it and does it work like this?
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:53.120]   I mean, can you really do that?
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.520]   I've paid for it and here's the--
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.480]   Here's like a shot of the Chipotle menu.
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.480]   I don't think it's--
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480]   That's good.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.480]   Spanish to English.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.560]   Was the Chipotle menu actually in Spanish?
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.120]   No, it's in English, which is why it didn't work quite so well.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:14.160]   But no, I was going around and just like looking for like Spanish sentences in order
[01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.160]   to get it.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:20.480]   And it is freaky because what happens is you are looking at live-- you don't take a picture.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:25.760]   It's live video as you're holding and moving around and just words are changing in the
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.280]   video as you hold it and as you move it around.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:34.040]   And if you hold it up to a paragraph, it doesn't work so well.
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:38.480]   But if you're trying to figure out, OK, one of these is for the ladies' bathroom.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.560]   One of these doors is to the men's bathroom.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.400]   I don't want to go to the wrong one.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.080]   OK, so that's how you say men's bathroom.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.080]   OK, got it.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.080]   That's mind-bought.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.080]   I mean, look, I--
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.080]   Whoa!
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.240]   OK, OK, it's like, oh, come on.
[01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.680]   You actually have to look at it to find out what it-- well, you actually do have to look
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.600]   at it to see what it means.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:02.800]   If you hold up to a sign with many words on it, it might update and change its perspective
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.520]   like a few times a second.
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:09.240]   But if you look at this for one second and a half, you will see the sign suddenly read,
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.920]   trash pickup is Wednesday.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:13.640]   Put your trash by the curb no later than some re-amazing.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:15.080]   I just don't believe it.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.960]   And the other thing is, they are going for broke here.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:18.960]   Let me hold that up again.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:23.120]   Again, this is a terrible-- I wish you had some Spanish or something behind you.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.880]   Can't you put a hold up a sign?
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.880]   If you hold it up the--
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:30.480]   I have it in front of my face, I am Spanish, so it turns me--
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.480]   Look at that.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.480]   It turns him into an American.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.480]   It's crazy.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.480]   Oh, boy.
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:38.120]   But you know, that could solve the whole illegal immigration issue, Clayton.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:41.000]   You might want to show that to Glenn Beck.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.200]   Fortunately, I don't have to-- I don't run into him very often in the offices.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.960]   But when I hold it up, it is incredible.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.560]   And I have to say, think about traveling.
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:54.520]   That's really the implication here.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:58.240]   When I was in Germany-- and of course, I took four years of German.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.960]   But there were a lot of signs of it.
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.360]   Is that telling me where I need to go?
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.320]   And that's the real world application for this.
[01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:04.320]   It's just incredible.
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.000]   I just can't stop looking at that.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   All right.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.040]   So this is now English to Spanish.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.040]   All right.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.040]   OK.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.600]   Let's take this cough drop.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.600]   All right.
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:19.840]   Let's see if I've got to stretch this over.
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:20.840]   Can I disconnect this?
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.240]   Will it disconnect me if I just--
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.240]   Yeah, it does.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:25.240]   Never mind.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.240]   OK.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:27.240]   Let's see.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.240]   I need something in English.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:29.240]   How about-- what?
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.720]   What do I have in English?
[01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.720]   Oh, Andy has something.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:32.720]   Give me something.
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:33.720]   OK.
[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:34.720]   Andy's doing something.
[01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:35.720]   What is that?
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.800]   It's hard for working a few things.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:38.800]   All right.
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:41.000]   Give me a piece of paper with some English on it.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   Huh?
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   Shooting digital.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   Shooting digital.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   All right.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.080]   Let's see what happens here.
[01:23:46.080 --> 01:23:47.520]   Let's see what happens here.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.760]   This is-- thank you.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.040]   This is-- we're going to see--
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.040]   Let's see if this works.
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.040]   In real time.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:55.040]   So do I hold it sideways?
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:56.760]   Is that the best way to do this?
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.040]   Just make sure you're holding it.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:02.000]   If you've got the control set to vertical, you've got to hold it the same way.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   Whoa!
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   Whoa!
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   I'm scared.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   Oh!
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   Sabino!
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   Sabino!
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   Sabino!
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   That's amazing.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   OK.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:19.160]   And the other thing is, notice that if the sign is a little bit off the horizontal, it
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.760]   will actually rotate the text to try to match it as best as possible.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.760]   It is weird.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:24.960]   It's kind of creepy that way.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:25.960]   All right.
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.960]   Why?
[01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:27.960]   Amber's book.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:28.960]   Power-friendly.
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:29.960]   OK.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:30.960]   Power-friendly.
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:35.960]   It's apparently that is Spanish.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960]   Power.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:40.160]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.160]   And there was--
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.160]   I think I need to get a Mexico now.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.160]   And if I do it this way.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.160]   See if I can survive.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160]   Ding.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.160]   Frending.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.160]   Potter.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.160]   It's very confused.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.160]   Potter.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.160]   It's the Jerry Lewis application.
[01:24:55.160 --> 01:25:03.160]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.160]   It doesn't know what this means, obviously.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:08.160]   Pandaman Zabangas.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:09.160]   It works.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.160]   It works better if you're a little bit steadier.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.160]   I agree that--
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160]   I'm steady.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:14.160]   OK.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:15.160]   Let's see here.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.440]   I agree that it doesn't work as magically as it does in the demo.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.240]   Well, welcome to the world of demo.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:24.760]   But the fact that you can't be blown away by simply the fact that it works in any successful
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:25.760]   way at all.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.360]   It's like, oh my goodness, this is really wonderful.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:30.360]   Hmm.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.360]   I--
[01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:34.360]   The best of this.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360]   The best of this.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.560]   The sake burrito is mammy-raised marinated pamper.
[01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.360]   You know the hit-al is correct, right?
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.360]   The carnitas burrito is mailer-rave pork.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.560]   Pote podad is correct.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:47.320]   But I think "friending" is in a real word.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.520]   That's why it's confusing that.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:51.080]   And apparently the vegetarian burrito is revered.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:52.080]   Aviard.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.080]   Yes.
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:55.640]   And it doesn't know a word for Google.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.040]   I'm trying to translate as you're translating, so this isn't working so well.
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:00.040]   All right, let's try another one.
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.280]   I'm trying to re-translate what you're trying to do.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.640]   Here's the man in the rubber mask.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:06.200]   I think that should translate quite well.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.440]   This is Bobby Llewellyn's book.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:16.440]   Bobby, the man in the rubber mask is the gaucho in the registrado.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.440]   Oh, mopo.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:18.440]   It'll mopo.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:25.840]   Routine it so that the baselines are per-particular.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.840]   Okay.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.240]   So it's got a baseline on it?
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:33.640]   Well, I might help it out a little bit.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:34.640]   I mean, this is great, too.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.240]   I mean, you think about it.
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:40.160]   I've been using Amazon's new updated app at the store.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:43.160]   I mean, so many people going in Wall Street Journal had a piece last week about people
[01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:44.160]   going into the store.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:47.640]   And, you know, just I do that all the time now, looking at TVs or the things I'm using
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.760]   at the barcode scanner, whether they're using red laser or otherwise.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:56.400]   But this is as close as you can get to Douglas Adams, Babblefish in the year.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.400]   I mean, that's pretty.
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:00.400]   I was thinking more of Roddy Roddy Piper and they live.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:01.400]   Okay.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:05.480]   I would pay five dollars for plug-in where it will just simply anytime it looks like
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.480]   it's advertising, it will say obey.
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.120]   It's a zoom.
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.240]   WikiLeaks yanked from the app store.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.240]   Surprise.
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:17.920]   I mean, every corporate America has basically gotten behind the US government in the punishing
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.400]   Julius Assange.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:21.400]   Not a surprise there.
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:28.200]   No, iPhone can be purchased at Sam's Club for $147, $147 this week.
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.040]   iPhone 4, $147 this week.
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.040]   $147 a dollar.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:32.040]   $147.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.000]   Apple owns 66% of the online music market.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.920]   Amazon distance second.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.280]   Apple of course is still the number one, I think seller of all, right?
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:44.040]   But 66% of the online music market.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:49.000]   iTunes 10 offering social playlists.
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.960]   Paul Allen's lawsuit against Apple, Google and others dismissed.
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:53.960]   10.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.000]   All right.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   I got one.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.480]   This looks at you.
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.400]   10 idiotic gifts for Apple fans.
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:06.040]   We have to run this through the translator because it's not in English.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:11.280]   Why am I getting a PC world version?
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:15.280]   I guess because it was in what language was this in originally?
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.480]   We don't German?
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:17.480]   10.
[01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.480]   10 idiotic Christmas gift for Apple fans.
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:22.800]   Did you want to, oh, that Steve Jobs doll?
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:24.800]   I did.
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:27.520]   Did you know anybody who got it?
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.800]   I think Cnetz, Brian Tong.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:31.160]   He doesn't see that stuff.
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:32.160]   They got one.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.720]   Yeah, because we talked about that a couple of weeks ago.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.680]   That's very awesome.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.960]   Here is a sausage fingers.
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:41.640]   It's a new stylus for the iPad.
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:47.040]   In case the pen manufacturer highlights that this design makes it stylus perfect to use
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.080]   in cold weather when you want to keep your gloves on.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:54.240]   It's compact slim fits in any pocket and should you be stranded on Desert Island?
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:55.800]   No, you cannot eat it.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:56.800]   It looks like a sausage.
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:28:59.960]   That's why I always have a slim gym in my pants.
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:00.960]   Exactly.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.720]   Is that what that is?
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:05.520]   Natalie must be so proud.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.400]   Speaker towel for iPhone iPod.
[01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.240]   It's a towel with a speaker built in.
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.800]   I'll say no, then you'll make the Andy mistake and throw that in the laundry.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:14.800]   Right.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:15.800]   Right.
[01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:16.800]   Bad idea.
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.560]   This sounds exactly the sort of thing that got rejected on dragons, Dan.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.960]   How about the fat free bacon sleeve?
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.960]   This is an iPad case that looks like bacon.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.320]   You can wrap scallops and bacon.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:32.560]   Why can't you write your right?
[01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.560]   It's just a skymall catalog.
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:35.120]   You better be getting these things.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.160]   This one I actually own.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.560]   The TV hat.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.160]   You put an iPad in the visor.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.880]   It's got an extra long bill.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:45.240]   You put an iPad in the front there.
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:46.880]   iPod in the front there.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:48.880]   Is that a photo of you in bed?
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:49.880]   Yes.
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.560]   It's me and my lovely wife, Jennifer.
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.640]   They're only telling you it's for iPod viewing.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.240]   It's just like that thing where they put the cloth over the ostriches and calm them down.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:58.240]   It does come.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:29:59.240]   It does calm me remarkably.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:03.320]   That way your staff will get you back in the pen calmly without any day of injury.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:06.200]   I will wear that next week on Mac break weekly.
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:07.600]   It's in my home.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:13.040]   The iPad chair, a chair with a built in iPad stand.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.040]   It's only.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.040]   I like that.
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.840]   It's only 20,000 dollars.
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:17.840]   Okay.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.840]   Well, maybe I'll sit that one out.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.840]   That's a bad pass.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.880]   Well, but if somebody wants to give it to you, right?
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:24.880]   Just in you take it.
[01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:25.880]   I love it.
[01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:26.880]   That's fun.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:30.000]   I mean, whatever.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.400]   Let's see.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.400]   There's more.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:35.320]   I'll leave it to you to go to PCWorld.It's Danish.
[01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:36.320]   PCWorld.dk.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:41.600]   You know, I have to say Google's doing an excellent job of translating this Danish.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.080]   He looks just like Clayton Morris.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.880]   This Danish.
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:49.280]   Tighten your iPhone onto your thigh.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:55.200]   This is a iPhone holder that goes around your thigh so you don't have to hold it in your
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.600]   hands.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.000]   This must be the skymall kettle.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   Because in that ska-
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.400]   You're soon going to be getting to the iPod sword case.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:09.200]   I only have room for a gun, an iPhone.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.200]   Which one will I take?
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:11.200]   Well, you're close.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.280]   Here's your close.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:17.480]   Here's the I arm for arm mount for the.
[01:31:17.480 --> 01:31:18.480]   Wow.
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.480]   You can hold it up a coffee.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:24.200]   The digital watch I've always wanted.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:31.600]   Mike, did you see that they raised a million dollars for the iPod digital watch holder?
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:32.600]   That's amazing.
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.320]   When I checked it was over 200,000.
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:36.280]   They were only trying to raise what 40?
[01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:37.280]   They got plenty.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.280]   They got plenty.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.280]   It's the producer.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.680]   You know what I worry about it?
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:41.680]   Kickstarter is interesting.
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:45.160]   But if you've got a great idea, are you worried about putting it out there and then someone
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:48.760]   else, somebody else coming along and snagging it from you?
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.440]   Well, it could beat you to it.
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:55.000]   In fact, there are quite a few risks I've seen now for sale.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.960]   iPod nano bans for your wrist.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:31:59.680]   I think they can have them.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.200]   I think perhaps these guys.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:02.960]   But they did raise a million dollars.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:03.960]   That's crazy.
[01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:04.960]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.760]   All right, we're going to get to your picks of the week in just a little bit.
[01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:11.200]   So get ready.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.120]   It can't be any of those 10.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:19.080]   I probably ran through them so fast you've all gone, oh, I don't have any picks anymore.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:20.320]   I got to pick for you.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:23.040]   This is a way if you run your own server never to have spam again.
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.000]   I've been using it since 2004.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:26.960]   It's called mail route.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:27.960]   I use it on Leoville.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:32.840]   Now, it's not, you know, if you haven't, they do sell individual accounts by popular demand.
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:37.200]   But truthfully, it really is designed for somebody who has their own mail server, whether
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:40.960]   you're a business that wants control of your email, you know, a lot of law offices, doctor
[01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.360]   offices, run their own mail servers.
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:48.120]   Or somebody like me, I have Leoville.com and I actually use that as an address for all
[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.080]   my family members.
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:54.240]   But you know, I want to filter that spam and mail route has been doing it so well since
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:56.120]   2004 for me.
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:01.520]   One million messages in the last 12 months of which 970,000 were clobbered before they
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   went to my server by mail route because they were spam.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.080]   No false positives.
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.440]   Just a great way to get rid of spam.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:13.320]   Find out more and get 10% off for the life of your account at mail route dot info.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.760]   Mail route dot info.
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:19.560]   Great guy, Tom Johnson, my friend, created that and I just want to encourage everybody
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.560]   to take a look at it.
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:22.600]   If you run your own server, mail route is a great solution.
[01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:26.520]   And now, oh my God, he's disappeared.
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:29.080]   Fortunately, we have a piece of paper.
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.720]   He's delivering presents.
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:31.720]   Yay.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:32.720]   He's a little.
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:33.720]   That's great.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:37.480]   I just think that this is, this is just him.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.000]   I've got my eye on you, Morris.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.760]   He's obviously run off either to go to the bathroom or to get his pick of the week.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.280]   So let's start with Andy and Otko.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:46.880]   You're pick of the week, sir.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.360]   Mine is something very simple and now that it's dusk, I'm going to turn off one of these
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   lights.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:54.440]   It is, it's a backgammon game.
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:59.720]   And it is one of those things I came too late in my iPad life realizing that gee, if
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.600]   you're carrying, I'm carrying an iPad with me all the time.
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.080]   Why not also have board games with me?
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:09.560]   And so every time like I'm meeting someone for, for lunch or dinner and we have to wait
[01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:14.640]   outside or wait in the bar for it to get something for a table to be ready.
[01:34:14.640 --> 01:34:16.600]   Now I've got my backgammon game.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:21.560]   And this is an app called Backgammon, what is it called?
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:26.000]   Unfortunately, it's a typical like App Store experience where there are a million games
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000]   called Backgammon.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.080]   And you have to make sure you have to, it's by CompuLab.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.400]   It's called True Backgammon HD.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:39.400]   And what I like about it, and I realize that I'm not a competitive James Bond 007 style
[01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.840]   competitive backgammon player, but it plays a very good, very strong game of backgammon
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.600]   on multiple levels.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:50.320]   What I like about it though is that it's a very, very pretty, pretty game.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:56.640]   There's so many others that claim to say, oh well, we can beat the Jablont's 4.8 metric
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.280]   for game play.
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:03.000]   And yet it's the crumbiest, crumbiest Apple 2 GS style graphics you've ever seen in your
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.000]   life.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.360]   This is nicely rendered when you're moving stones around the game board.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.000]   It feels nice and flowy and natural.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.920]   The camera moves are really, really nice.
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.160]   And when you just want it to be a backgammon game, it's just a backgammon game.
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:18.200]   So you can play two humans together, human versus computer.
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:21.600]   You can even just simply drink your little Scotch and soda and watch the computer play
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:24.800]   itself, which is a labor saving device.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.800]   And again, play a good game.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:27.200]   Do you ever really do that?
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.840]   You just let the, just watch it play itself.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:35.120]   Although, it's a labor saving device, you know, like we have a Roomba to vacuum the
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.120]   floors for us.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.120]   Sure.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.120]   It's too tedious to do it for us.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.800]   And our backgammon is too tedious to play by yourself.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:43.080]   That way you can just simply have a computer play the game for you.
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.080]   So there you go.
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:45.760]   Anyway, I like it a lot.
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.760]   Good.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:47.760]   Well done.
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:48.760]   Well, execution of a simple concept.
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:49.760]   Justine Azerik.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:50.760]   Hi, Justine.com.
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:53.760]   What you up to there, Justine?
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:58.240]   I was actually taking a picture, for example, for the app that I was going to talk about.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:35:59.240]   That's fine.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.240]   Continue on.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:03.400]   So mine is the new Daily booth app that just launched.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.400]   Oh, I like it.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.040]   I'm not familiar with daily views yet.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.040]   Go ahead.
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:13.400]   So daily booths inside, you take a picture and then people post photo responses back.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.880]   So I just took a picture here and I'm going to post it.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:18.840]   This is why we don't see your picture on Instagram so much.
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:19.840]   You're just so social.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.440]   I am daily boothing.
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:30.480]   And so what's cool about daily booth is, you know, people that watch my videos and
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.680]   stuff don't necessarily speak English and they can't type English as well.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.800]   So with a picture, people can pretty much just share anything.
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:40.960]   You know, you can get emotion and that's what I really love about daily booth is because
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:43.320]   people are posting pictures and you're responding back.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:47.880]   But what's cool about the new app that just launched is they have this ghosting feature.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:51.840]   So you can see if we're here.
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.720]   My parents have really bad Wi-Fi.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:02.360]   So this girl, she posted a picture and there's a post my little photo response.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:08.080]   So you can take a picture with her picture or?
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:13.240]   Yeah, so it'll put her picture and your response is kind of inset into it.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:18.000]   Oh, yeah, I could see on the web page, I could see that happening in some cases.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.720]   So you just try to like mimic people and sort of try to take the same picture.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:25.720]   That's kind of cool.
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.560]   And so this would be a good choice instead of Instagram.
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:34.320]   I like the live map on the website, which is kind of like Twitter vision only with pictures.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.320]   And it's cool.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:36.320]   They have a live feed.
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:41.520]   So I spend a lot of time just sitting there watching people live booth and then you could
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:42.520]   booth back to them.
[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:45.280]   So it's a cool way to just interact with new people and.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.400]   Pretty much people take pictures of themselves.
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.400]   Is that mostly the?
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:52.720]   Yeah, see, what I think is different between daily booth and Instagram is Instagram is
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:55.040]   something that people take pictures of stuff.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.520]   pictures of things as daily with is more sharing, you know, a little peek into your daily life
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:05.400]   or your friends and interacting or is Instagram is things.
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.400]   Right.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.000]   So it's fun.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000]   Thank you, Justine.
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.280]   And now late Morris with his pick of the week.
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:17.320]   You know, there were so I was sort of torn because I feel like in the past few weeks and
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.600]   backing me up on this or don't.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.400]   It's up to you that there have been a lot of my favorite apps have gotten some really
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:28.000]   nice upgrades like Flipboard has a really nice layout now where I don't have to jump
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.800]   to the internet to read and look at some of the different.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:32.360]   That was actually different articles.
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:33.360]   So don't mention Flipboard.
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:36.160]   Oh, I won't mention that app at all.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.160]   Okay.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:38.160]   Hate it.
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.840]   But the economist app, I love the economist app.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.720]   Now it not only has the full audio book of the economist, which is great for like a two
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.720]   hour long drive.
[01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:50.520]   Just plug it into your Ford plug it right into your audio.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.760]   That's free if you have our paper subscriber, right?
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:55.240]   So that's a good I like it when they do that.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:56.840]   I wish that more people would do that.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:58.960]   And they added some functionality now before they had to left this.
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:38:59.960]   You had to leave the screen on.
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:02.160]   Now they've allowed you to turn off the iPad.
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:04.760]   So you're not wasting battery in 30 seconds reverse.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:08.520]   But so I felt like there were a couple of a couple ones that I really liked that were
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:09.520]   jumping back.
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.520]   But I must say I wanted to show off because I've been driving a lot lately.
[01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:15.520]   Yes.
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:19.880]   And I've been testing out I radar's Cobra app.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:24.760]   You have a radar detector in your iPhone in the iPhone four and it has an incredible
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:25.760]   layout.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:28.600]   You switch and it pairs over Bluetooth with your radar detector.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:35.200]   It saved me from no, no short, no fewer than like five different five different tickets
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.200]   already.
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:37.200]   Wow.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.200]   It is fantastic.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:42.360]   So if you're a lead foot, but how does it detect radar?
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.680]   Well you have the radar detector.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.880]   It comes with a radar detector.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:45.880]   Oh, I see.
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:49.360]   So there's a physical device physical device in your car that pairs over Bluetooth with
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:50.360]   this great app.
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.760]   And you can both set it to highway or city mode.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:55.560]   And as you're driving, you can set all the settings.
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:59.760]   So if you're in a state that doesn't have, for instance, K band or X band or some of
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:03.360]   these other other different types of radar, I leave them all on.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.440]   Because I don't want to be in the wrong area where I drive through like three states, you
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:10.320]   know, from New York and New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:15.720]   It does such a great job of picking up the radar detector itself is top notch.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:19.720]   And it's doing such a great job of picking up, picking up radar from whatever it happens
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.720]   to be.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.720]   You can switch it from highway to city mode.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:27.320]   So when you enter a city, it's much more tight, I guess, it's closer to your car because
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:28.320]   you're going to be getting microwaves.
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:32.120]   You're going to be getting all kinds of other interferences so you can switch the modes.
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.440]   And it has a much wider distance when you're in city in highway mode.
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:38.520]   Also this is showing zero miles per hour right now.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:43.600]   But if I were driving it, you mount this right to your cars in car dashboard and it'll show
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.800]   you how fast you're going.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.920]   So it's using the iPhones GPS and it's great.
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:49.920]   I mean, it really is.
[01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.920]   How much is the hardware and software?
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.040]   The hardware I think is a little over $100 for the radar detector itself.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.000]   And you do need that to use this.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.200]   And the software is free.
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.520]   The app is a free download and it's great.
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:04.920]   And plus the plug in, you know, you can plug right into it too.
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:05.920]   They made the hardware.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.560]   They were smart about it because they know that it's going to eat up a lot of battery
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.560]   life.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:13.760]   So you can actually plug in the dock connector right into the iPad cord as it plugs right into
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:16.960]   the cigarette cigarette lighter.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:19.280]   So you're not having to run that running.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.720]   You could drive the speed limit.
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.400]   Oh, Leo.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:25.920]   And that's free.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:27.400]   Don't be silly.
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:31.200]   I should point out that that is illegal to have in some states.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:32.600]   One state, I think.
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.880]   I think it's only Virginia.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.880]   Okay.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:35.880]   Only in Virginia.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:37.560]   So offer void.
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.320]   We're prohibited by law.
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:41.640]   I thought California banned radar detectors.
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:42.640]   Is that not the case?
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.520]   I guess not.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:48.120]   According to I radar, no, it's not.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:50.400]   Washington DC and Virginia.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:53.520]   Which also I forgot to mention, what's also great is you can set alerts.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.400]   So you can actually like mark a spot.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:59.080]   Like if you had passed by a speed trap, you can just hit the little button on there.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:00.080]   It'll mark it.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.120]   So you'll remember where certain speed traps are hidden.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:04.480]   It'll also it also sort of crowdsources it to.
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:08.240]   And when you get stopped by the highway patrol and they see that.
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.920]   Did they get upset at all?
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:13.920]   I'd quickly disconnect it and throw the phone in my pocket.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:15.800]   Throw it out the window.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:19.440]   My usual answer is to give them the technology demo and get them so engrossed that they forgot
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.480]   why they put the low brick in the first place.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:26.000]   I have gotten out of I have gotten out of tickets by one ticket in my life by explaining
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.000]   how GPS work that was early in my my driving career.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.160]   No, I'm not watching TV while I drive.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.200]   It's actually you mean that it's talking to satellites?
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:36.200]   Well, it's not too late.
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:39.880]   It's actually like a mark a low Brit bandwidth.
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:44.600]   Well, I would have given you the ticket to be honest with you right there.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:49.160]   It helped that I was it helped that I was driving a real piece of junk that he said,
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.000]   you know what, you probably can't afford the 45.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000]   Okay.
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000]   Who are we kidding?
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000]   No more was really.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.680]   I really do have to go.
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.680]   Thank you very much.
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:57.680]   Always great show.
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:42:59.080]   Merry Christmas to all into all good night.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.080]   Good night, Andrea.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:02.280]   Not go from the Chicago Sun times CW.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:03.280]   I'll be back.
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:04.840]   Come and nice hat.
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:05.840]   Take care.
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:06.840]   Bye bye.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.920]   This is this is the Twit Christmas gift for which I'm I've rarely taken it off.
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:15.240]   I feel like I feel like, you know, I need a smoking jacket and a pipe and stories about
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.760]   the days of the British Empire.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:17.760]   There you go.
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:19.200]   And a tiny and a tiny car.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.200]   Good night.
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.760]   And our thank you very much.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.160]   We're taking the week off next week, Andy.
[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:27.000]   We will not be here, but we do have a best of which high features Andy, of course, and
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.160]   his ukulele and many other wonderful moments from our past year.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:31.840]   See in the 2011.
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:32.840]   Happy holiday.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.840]   See you next year.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:34.840]   Happy holidays.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:35.840]   Bye bye, Andy.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:40.200]   And my pick of the week, because you mentioned it to Clayton, but it is flip board and we've
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.200]   talked about flip board.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:43.560]   It's been a pick before, but flip board is updated now.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.920]   And I think the new updates are really fantastic.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:52.280]   You have many more choices for contents, including your own feed from a Google reader,
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.400]   finally, which means you can have quite a bit of content in there.
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:02.320]   And they've had some special publishers who are designing flip board content, which I
[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:04.440]   think is very interesting.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.440]   These are their partners.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:06.440]   ABC, right?
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:13.760]   ABC has some San Francisco magazine, sports illustrated swimsuit all access.
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.080]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:19.840]   I think flip board has become more and more just the must have iPad application.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:22.600]   If you haven't used it, it's really fantastic.
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:27.760]   It originally was designed to follow people's Twitter feeds and put the content from the
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:31.200]   links in the Twitter feeds into a magazine form.
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:35.040]   But it's now really become a whole lot more than just that.
[01:44:35.040 --> 01:44:37.480]   And I also love, I mean, I love what I was going to say.
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.680]   And then I stopped myself because it was your pick.
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.920]   But no, when you pick an article, when you, you know, we're in a particular article, instead
[01:44:44.920 --> 01:44:49.840]   of having to open Safari or read on the web, it now is pulling that at the bottom of the
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.800]   screen for each article, which I think is great.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:56.560]   You know, and then that way you're, it's sort of streamlining the process.
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:00.600]   So if you were to tap on, I'll just tap an article and then it opens it up like that.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:04.040]   And then you're saying if I pull it, if I go below it, it's now here.
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:06.240]   It has loaded yet, but it will.
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:10.120]   Is that within every content provider or is it other of those specific content providers?
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:12.920]   You'll see the full article just and may take a few seconds.
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.880]   This is the economist and it and they've been around for a while.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:21.520]   Let me go to one of the, let's say flip news, which is one of their own contents and hit
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:24.680]   one of this and see what happens.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.400]   I know that it was working on the Twitter.
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:28.920]   You know, it may be slow loading and that's all it is.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:29.920]   But yes, you're right.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:33.240]   You become much, you don't ever really have to leave it to read the articles.
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:36.320]   It's really become a very useful resource.
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:40.440]   Let me ask you though, with the Google reader integration, do you feel like that it's become
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.440]   too cluttered?
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:42.440]   I mean, the, yeah, I don't turn it.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:43.440]   It's funny.
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:46.200]   I was excited and then I didn't turn it on because I have too many feeds in there.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.800]   And so it's too much, it's too much content.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.800]   It's too much content.
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:51.600]   I'm counting glance and just stare at this thing this way.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.360]   So you know, you put, you put the big ones in there.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.880]   You put boing, boing, boing in there.
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:57.600]   You know, you, here's San Francisco.
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:01.440]   This is one of the partners, the San Francisco Chronicle is one of the partners.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.360]   So they've actually designed their content for flip board.
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:08.480]   And you can see already that it's kind of, here you go.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.160]   This is what you were talking about.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:14.840]   It's going to now load, load the actual newspaper article in there, which is kind of cool.
[01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:17.260]   And you zoom it up.
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:20.040]   So if you're using one of the contents, of course you get the ads, but if you're using
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.960]   one of the content partners, there you go.
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:25.040]   So you do need to do that to get the, get the example.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.040]   That's pretty cool.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:28.360]   I'm going to say, yeah, I love that.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.360]   I love that.
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.360]   Really, really nice.
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.720]   So if you haven't, if you haven't tried it, it's free.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:35.640]   If you have it, make sure you do the update because it just came out a few days ago.
[01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:41.320]   It's the new flip board, huge improvement, already a great product.
[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:44.600]   Justine Azarek, I have a great time in Pittsburgh with your family.
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:46.680]   We're so glad you could join us on the holidays.
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:47.680]   Yes.
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:48.800]   And I will see you see, yes.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:49.800]   And we'll see you see, yes.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.320]   Please be part of our broadcast from CES.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.480]   I will be there.
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.280]   We, we just think the best of you, iJustine.com.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:00.080]   Everybody go there, watch your videos and enjoy.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.080]   Happy holidays, Justine.
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:02.080]   You too.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.240]   And Clayton, I know you weren't feeling too well, but I do thank you so much for joining
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:06.240]   us.
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:07.240]   Absolutely.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:08.240]   Always a pleasure.
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:09.240]   Pleasure.
[01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:10.240]   Yep.
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:11.240]   Please give my regard to Natalie and Miles.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:14.800]   You're going to have a nice baby's first Christmas is always fun.
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:15.800]   I know I can't wait.
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:18.640]   And you know, you buy them the gifts and they don't care.
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:19.640]   They don't know.
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:20.640]   He's, he'll be what?
[01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:21.640]   He'll be what?
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:22.640]   Two, three months old at Christmas.
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:26.240]   He'll be almost, he'll be almost five months old.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.240]   Wow.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.120]   And he was born on the 26th of July.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.320]   So he'll be almost five months old.
[01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:33.320]   Well, all the best.
[01:47:33.320 --> 01:47:34.320]   Happy holidays, all of you.
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:35.320]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:40.640]   We'll be back, as I said, in two weeks, next week, a best of you, you voted on the best
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:43.640]   Mac break weekly moments and there's some really good ones.
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:48.600]   And then we'll be back on Tuesday, which is January like fourth.
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:52.600]   And then we go to CES and we're going to have an amazing bunch of stuff from CES.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:54.360]   All for the rest of that week.
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:57.680]   So we'll see you there at live.twit.tv.
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:47:59.240]   Thanks everybody for joining us now.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:00.720]   You get back to work.
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:08.400]   Break time is over.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:11.800]   I had a watch, you know, because I had, I have so many men films in a row that I made
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:12.800]   my wife watch.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:15.800]   She finally conned me and she's like, you know, we never watch a chick flick.
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:16.800]   That's a chick flick.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:17.800]   That's why I was so...
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.800]   So the other night, no, no, she made me.
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:21.600]   She's like, I've wanted to watch the movie Babies Now for like a year.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:23.320]   Oh, no, you couldn't get me to watch that.
[01:48:23.320 --> 01:48:24.320]   And you have a baby.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:25.320]   You don't even need a movie.
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.680]   I'm like, do we need to watch a movie about babies in Mongolia?
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:31.480]   We've got a baby right in the other room, Mike.
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:32.480]   Right.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.480]   What's the point?
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:36.120]   Just because we don't have a goat licking our baby's head.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.840]   So did you watch it?
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:38.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:39.840]   It was actually pretty entertaining.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:40.840]   I'll be honest with you.
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:44.640]   Because they follow the life stories of like five different babies, like from the four
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:46.960]   birth up through birth and you get to see.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.960]   And they're all happy.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.840]   It doesn't matter if there's a goat licking a baby's head.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:50.840]   They're all just happy babies.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:54.960]   You know, in fact, probably is better if a goat is licking a baby's head.
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:59.080]   Although if that's your follow up visit when you're trying to adopt, it's not going to
