[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.360]   Is it a reality?
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.280]   What's wrong with Apple's iCloud and stickband golf?
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.240]   A special plea for Jason Snell.

[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.720]   audience. We couldn't even get him on the panel.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.000]   There's so many people.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.360]   The audience is overflowing.

[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.440]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.400]   I don't want to bring that up again.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.880]   Yes.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.840]   Also in studio with us from IDG Jason Snell, he's a editorial director there for PC World and
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.040]   Mac World Magazine.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.680]   Good to be back.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.400]   Good to have you.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.120]   Thank you for coming.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.160]   I love being here.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.720]   To your left, Andy and Aco, the girl of the tiger.
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.960]   That is a modernistic take on Calvin and Hobbes.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.840]   Wow.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.560]   I love that.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.560]   A more scary and dangerous looking tiger.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.680]   There you go.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.040]   Hard to say greatest comic of all time, but certainly in the top three.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.120]   Definitely top five.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.920]   Top five.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.040]   Because you got Dunesbury, you got Peanuts, you got Pogo.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.560]   Bloom County.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.360]   Bloom County.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.120]   And because he punched Bill Watson punched out early, it will always be the legend of
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.880]   the series that just simply ended well before anybody wanted it.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.680]   It might have been.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.520]   Also with us all the way on the right hand side of the screen, Mr. Renee Richie.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.400]   If you're listening at home, he's in your left channel.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.760]   I'm just freaked out by that Calvin on Hulk serum that Andy's showing off today.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.680]   Calvin on Hulk's.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.800]   Sorry, Hobbes on Hulk's.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.320]   Hobbes is big.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.960]   Look at that.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.160]   That's working out.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.360]   If the comic strip had continued, that's how big Hobbes would have gotten.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.280]   Mo should not be pushing Calvin around with that kind of muscle behind the
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.800]   legs and the bows and the hips.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.720]   Well, it's good to see all on the eve of the most exciting announcement in tech history,
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.160]   the new Facebook phone.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.520]   We'll be here day after tomorrow.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.120]   I know it's hard not to laugh, isn't it?
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.160]   Yeah, you just like, okay.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.480]   I think this is an example of Facebook kind of not clear on the fact that people
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.080]   use it, but hate it.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.960]   Right?
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.760]   So they say, we've got a billion users.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.920]   We should take we should be masters of the universe.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.120]   And of course, then our ounce and our parents to learn how to use anything else.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.560]   We would not be using Facebook, but we can't get our odds and our parents to use anything else.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.880]   But it took us a long time to get them on to Facebook.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.680]   That's the whole thing is we went through a lot of effort to get our friends on to there.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.560]   And but everyone you talk to, I mean, that's their Achilles, he has everyone says,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.360]   the only reason that they're using Facebook is because everyone else is using it.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.880]   If something else comes along that everyone else is using, Facebook is toast.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.200]   And you know, Facebook was smart because Instagram started to be that as simple as it is.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.760]   The my look at my kids, they love that's how they share.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.600]   And I think a lot of kids and so Facebook was smart and a billion dollars for Instagram
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.200]   actually turned out not to be a bad idea.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.800]   It was it was to keep them from losing their audience to another social network.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.200]   But how long can they keep buying the competition?
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.880]   It will be hard because their main competition is not something that's viable.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   So I think Renee Richie knows something about what Facebook we're trying to decide
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.960]   whether we should do live coverage of it or not.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.160]   Facebook has cheated us so many times with these announcements.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.040]   We decided against it.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.080]   We're going to send people but we're not even live blog.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.120]   No, okay.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.880]   That's somebody you did send somebody.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.240]   Are you live logging?
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.000]   Phil Nickinson from Android Central is going to be there.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.280]   I believe he's live blogging it.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.240]   Okay.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.720]   I'm more.com's from a Richie.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.560]   I didn't say finish your introduction.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.640]   I've heard things about this.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.880]   So two years ago, Facebook hired Andy, sorry, Eric Tang, who was one of the guys running
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.400]   Android for Google.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.120]   And they hired Mike Mattis, who was the guy who started the designer who helped start the delicious,
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.440]   you know, highly textured rich graphic design year of modern apps.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.560]   And they reportedly from several people I've heard that Mark Zuckerberg invited them over
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.640]   and did the Steve Jobs walk around the park putting his arm on their shoulder and saying,
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.240]   if you want to dent the universe now, Facebook is the way to do it.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.960]   And these were iOS designers, developers, some jailbreak guys.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.520]   I mean, really the right people that you want to target if you want to start attacking mobile.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   And that has been really quiet for two years.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.880]   And you know, like Eric Tang and Mike Mattis haven't been redesigning news feeds for the last two years.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.520]   So mobile is clearly the future.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.320]   And what it looks like is that it's not a phone.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.760]   It's not even a skin.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.160]   It's not something like Amazon did with their complete fork of Android.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.480]   It's not even something like TouchWiz from Samsung, but it's sort of an enhanced app,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.520]   almost like a launcher where Facebook can sort of intermediate Android and make sure that they're
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.800]   the first thing that you hit on the phone and they can get access to all your sharing and all your data,
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.320]   all your demographics.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.440]   Against a smart play.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.200]   There's like a unclear on the subject.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.080]   They don't.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.200]   What are you going to tell people?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.480]   Look, we put a new app on here.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.400]   Works pretty much the same and you got a little widget.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.520]   But the good part about this is we'll intercept all your communications.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.560]   Well, I mean, Facebook is popular in some parts of the world.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.840]   There are phones that you can get that only run Facebook and everyone messages through that.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.800]   And they're starting to introduce voice over IP through Facebook.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.200]   They want phone calls and yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.280]   And it's really smart from Facebook's point of view.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.800]   It's like a face hugger from aliens attack where they're going to latch on to Android
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.400]   and inject their DNA into it.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.880]   Precisely.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.480]   And that stops them from being competition because Google pissed off a lot of people by
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.960]   releasing Android to kind of hedge against being locked out by Apple and Microsoft.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.720]   Thus ensuring they would be locked out by Apple and Microsoft.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.040]   And Facebook kind of wants to have the best of both worlds.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.840]   And Android is a great target for that because the amount of customization they can do without
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.360]   having to root the device without having to have their own hardware, their own,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.800]   even their own fork of Android.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.280]   Really, all they have to do is write a really good launcher.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.400]   It tapped into the notification system and really anyone can, and conceivably anybody can
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.280]   download this, flip two switches to get everything working in now.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.440]   Facebook is really, it's got to continue to raise fine analogy.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:25.280]   This is the alien blood that will continue to dissolve any part of your privacy until it reaches open space.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.800]   Well, I mean, we can mock Facebook, but there are some people.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:28.800]   Yeah, okay.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.600]   From Facebook.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   I mean, we should mock Facebook, but there are some people from, um, Facebook is the,
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.320]   is the internet.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.760]   There's the web and then there are there are people on Facebook and they do use Facebook
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.960]   messaging instead of email.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.320]   I mean, there are people who are very Facebook centric and giving them a product that makes,
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.800]   that works the way they see the internet working, which is through Facebook is not the worst thing
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.680]   in the world, even if it's not for us, uh, nerdier people.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.040]   Is it a handset or is it just a software?
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.280]   It's software, but I believe they're going to be using HTC as sort of an early adopter
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.120]   proof of concept demonstration.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.360]   So you can see what a phone looks like when they have this sort of agreement and they come
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.600]   shipped with the Facebook experience.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:12.000]   Like if you read the invitation, it says come see a new phone on Android.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.600]   And that's exactly what it is.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.680]   It's a home experience on Android.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.400]   So HTC might incorporate it into Sense 5.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   Some phones will have it.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.600]   I think that demo phone.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.720]   So I mean, it's a good idea.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.520]   Cause if there's a, if there's a, we're sending, like I said, Filnickinson, and if they can
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.360]   put a phone in his hand that day showing him what it's like, then that's what he's going
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.160]   to write about.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.680]   It's a much better story for them.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.600]   So the event is a Thursday at 10 AM Pacific, 1 PM Eastern time.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.600]   So what we're going to do, we do TNT tech news today at that time.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.680]   I think we'll just do TNT and if, you know, and cover it and as stuff comes through,
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.880]   we'll just add it to TNT.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.080]   I think that's how we're going to do it.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.480]   We're thinking of moving TNT, but I think it's up to Tom, but I think we're just going to cover
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:52.960]   it that way.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.840]   I don't think it's a big enough announcement to break for it.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.200]   Nothing I've heard says that's going to be noteworthy.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.760]   I'm going to be given that to cover this, all I have to do is arrange to be in a comfortable
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.280]   chair with a computer in my lap.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.600]   I'm going to be covering it, but I don't think I'll be.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.880]   I don't think it's going to be a big one.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.560]   We'll be watching with mild interest.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.280]   And it's interesting for HTC because they're not doing well.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.120]   So if they are the ones that are getting shown off with Facebook, then it's probably
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.120]   an agreement that you could never do this on Apple.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.200]   Samsung is too powerful and too wealthy on their own to do this, but HTC is still
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:23.680]   struggling.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.320]   So it makes sense.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.520]   The question is that is Facebook now,
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.680]   the people who are passionate about social messaging have kind of moved beyond Facebook
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.080]   mostly.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.280]   The people who are using it are the folks who want something easy and ubiquitous,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:42.720]   who they enjoy that kind of content with their far-flung family and friends,
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.040]   but they're not really passionate about it enough to, I'm going to install a really
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.160]   major experience on my phone as opposed to having it as an app.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.360]   So I'm not questioning it, but this is an area which I really,
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.520]   it doesn't fit in with what I understand to be what Facebook is going to be really,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.160]   really good at.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.480]   It's probably comforting.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.600]   I mean, some people will walk into a store and they'll see a phone that comes with a
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.640]   Facebook home screen.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.920]   And for them, you know, they're not really into, there's a lot of Android users who just
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.800]   don't use Android.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.960]   It's the next feature phone that they buy.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.920]   And for them, you know, they know Facebook, they're comforted by it.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.040]   Facebook was really smart.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.800]   They took over the browser, walled it off and provided an experience that a lot of
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.160]   people spend a lot of time in.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.680]   And if they could walk into Android and wall off a section, they might provide the
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.960]   same experience on mobile.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.560]   It does point to something really interesting though, but I find that more people have allegiance
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.480]   to the services they use on their phone rather than the phone itself.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.280]   So that you're right, they don't really think of this as an Android phone that I've
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.720]   been particularly thinking about as an iPhone.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.960]   They think of it as the host organism that they use to access Facebook, to access Twitter,
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.240]   to access their contact manager and that sort of stuff.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.720]   So that's a way to make the hardware and the operating system almost irrelevant if they can
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.320]   produce a better experience.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.960]   So it makes you want to extrapolate further to see how much harder is it going to be for Google
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.520]   and for Apple to assert that, hey, here's the tip.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.600]   Here is why your choice of hardware matters.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.680]   Here's why your choice of operating system matters.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.360]   I know that you're getting the exact same apps on both platforms that increasingly,
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.240]   both of these apps look identical feature for feature button for button.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   But please, we promise you there is a difference between an iPhone and an Android device.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.640]   HTC's one will be available on AT&T.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.000]   You could preorder starting April 4th, day of tomorrow, same day the eye.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.840]   I wonder if this is the same day the Facebook phone is announced and it'll arrive on the 16th.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.040]   They're the first to have it in the US.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.160]   And this is the first Android phone to kind of look hardware-wise like it might compete with
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.520]   the Apple iPhone.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.720]   Yeah, I've been talking to people.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.920]   It's pretty.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.720]   A lot of Android phone watchers and mobile phone watchers in general who say this is actually
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.560]   the beautiful industrial design phone. The Galaxy S4 is going to be popular and Samsung's got a
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.280]   lot of Galaxy.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.040]   It's going to be plastic and have a big screen.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.640]   It's going to be what it is.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.240]   But the HTC one really is an eye-catcher.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.200]   Do you think then there'll be a Facebook skew of the one?
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.280]   Is that how they're going to do it?
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.320]   That's the big mystery, right?
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.200]   Is this going to be a Facebook phone?
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.240]   Is this just going to be a Facebook layer that goes on a bunch of different phones?
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.160]   Can you say HTC or other vendors?
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:12.960]   F?
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.680]   You know?
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.400]   Or will you just be able to log into Facebook and it'll all show up?
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.200]   I don't know.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.920]   You know, Facebook isn't...
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.760]   We're all going to mock it.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:25.600]   Everybody who's watching this show and who's in the chat room are going to mock Facebook.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.960]   But I just had something.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.480]   I had an illness in the family and was gone for a couple of weeks.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.440]   And I share everything on social media, on Twitter.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.600]   Everybody who follows me knows I share too much on Twitter.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.800]   But that was something that I realized I ended up sharing all of my experiences there on Facebook
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.240]   and not on Twitter because Twitter wants to be a broadcast medium.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:49.440]   And Facebook actually lets you talk to a subset of people who are the people you have a personal
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.040]   relationship with or whoever you've decided to have that one-to-one relationship with.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.480]   And I would love to do that on Twitter and have groups that I could share to.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.600]   But Twitter's not interested in that.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.000]   Twitter wants to be a broadcast medium.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.960]   And so for some things, I was shocked, but I turned to Facebook.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.760]   - I knew there. - That's what keeps them alive.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.960]   And so that's the value of Facebook is that you have a little more control over who your
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.760]   relationships are, whereas Twitter, it's really anybody who wants to...
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.800]   I'm standing on the corner shouting and if you want to hear me, here I am.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.880]   Maybe Facebook Phone though isn't really as you, as people kind of already alluded to,
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:24.000]   not a US phone, but a phone for places where Facebook is the real way.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.360]   It reminds me a lot of AOL.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.120]   It's like living within a walled garden, right?
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.160]   - Yeah. - And some people want an AOL phone or would have had one available.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.280]   - I can see.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.800]   - That would have been very popular.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.480]   - If AOL had had a phone in 1992, everyone would have had an AOL.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.040]   - I can see somebody going into an AT&T store of Verizon,
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.720]   saying, "I want a phone with Facebook."
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   And if you've got one, you can pull out and say,
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.400]   "It's totally integrated with Facebook."
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.240]   For those users, then great.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.080]   That's a selling point for some people.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.040]   - When you have 30 phones and you're trying to have given one more option,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.640]   that's another option available.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.840]   - All right, QBL, the iPhone was an iTunes phone when it first launched.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.600]   And people were excited they could get all their iTunes phones.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.240]   - The rocker was.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   - Oh, remember that?
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.640]   - And there have been a couple of phones where back in the keypad era,
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.840]   where they would have an integrated Facebook button on it that you can just,
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.160]   for texting pretty much directly to Facebook.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.280]   - They're touching.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.000]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.360]   There are 100 reasons why it failed,
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.120]   but the fact that it wasn't one of those failures that was good enough
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.440]   to spur on a second version of this, at least, well, at least,
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.440]   I guess it just says at least five years ago, the world wasn't ready for it.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.600]   - Tim Cook apologizes to China in Chinese.
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.480]   There were complaints, I'm not sure where they were coming from.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.040]   It seems like the state run, Chinese state run media,
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:48.160]   so I would guess from the Chinese government saying that Apple's warranty policies were illegal,
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:48.800]   not okay.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:56.080]   Fortune has some speculation about why it was coming from state run media.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.680]   China Central TV did an expose on iPhone repair policies.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.600]   People's daily attacked the company for four days in a row,
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   devoting half a page to negative articles.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.640]   Five theories, Apple's behaving badly, it's possible.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.320]   In fact, Apple does discriminate against Chinese users with poor return and warranty policies.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:24.160]   Two, Apple hasn't, they say, courted the right officials.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.680]   - I think paid.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.400]   - Courted is one way of saying it.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:34.240]   Three, Apple's trying to bolster its domestic, I'm sorry, China's trying to bolster its domestic
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.080]   smartphone makers, Chinese military owns a big chunk of Huawei, for instance.
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.520]   China's trying to strengthen its hand, the hand of its state-owned mobile phone carriers like
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:49.680]   China Telecom, which is China Unicon, which is number, I think the two and three carriers,
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.920]   and China's retaliating for Congress's treatment of Huawei,
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.720]   and ZTE.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:00.960]   Now, Tim Cook apologized, so apparently--
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.840]   - Very different approach from Steve Jobs, who probably would have told them to go.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:09.120]   - Yeah, because Apple's return policy in China, as far as I can tell, it's not obvious.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.600]   - It's different.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.640]   - It's the same 14-day return on newly purchased products, full refund on returns by cash or
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:20.880]   credit card, one-year warranty on defective hardware, replaced with new or refurbished parts,
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:25.040]   minimum 90-day warranty on repairs. That's the same in the US and China.
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.720]   - It seems more likely that China is--
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.240]   - Yeah, it's more about politics.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.320]   - It's more politics than anything technical.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.920]   - Yeah, and then Apple is trying-- this is Apple's fastest growing market.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.360]   - So Apple doesn't want to mess around.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.680]   - Apple does not want to mess around here, and Apple, I think, will do what it needs to do
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.600]   to get out of the way of this, and basically say, "Hey, hey, if you want to pick a fight with
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:53.920]   the US government, don't have it be about us." We'll see how it goes, but it is the fastest market.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.960]   - I think the Chinese are also concerned. I think that it's probably valid that they are
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:04.320]   concerned about having a closed system growing quickly in their own country that they don't control.
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:07.520]   - That's the real concern, right?
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:13.760]   - Yeah, I wonder-- I have there been stories about whether they would intercede in sort of
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.840]   app approvals and Chinese-- - Well, they're not doing that, but I think this is a good way
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.520]   to kind of cut Apple off of the knees and try to slow them down, because the issue is that--
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.000]   then this is what the US government's concerned about, is trying to building stuff into their
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.520]   hardware that allows all kinds of back doors and so on.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.160]   - Apple's initial response was, "What do you talk-- the Steve Jobs response? What are you talking about?
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.880]   It's the same." And then the very interesting Tim Cook response, which is clearly political,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.720]   the poor translation that I'm reading here on 9-5 Mac. In the past two weeks, we've received a
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:50.320]   lot of feedback about Apple and China repair and warranty policy. We are not only a profound
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:55.920]   reflection on these reviews. I think he means we're going to-- but this is very Chinese.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.320]   - He's deeply concerned with these reviews, yeah. - We're going to think long and hard about this
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.360]   together with the relevant departments to carefully study the three guarantees and to also look at
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:10.080]   our maintenance policy communication, combing our management specifications. We are aware that due
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:15.600]   to lack of external communication in this process, we didn't pay off the right people, obviously,
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:19.920]   and lead to the speculation that Apple arrogance do not care or do not attach
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.640]   importance to consumer feedback. This is a very-- it's very Chinese-apologetic.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.920]   - Yes. - Very interesting.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.880]   - I'm sure there was a lot of people that worked on that very hard.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:34.000]   - So they are going to improve the repair policy on the 4 and 4s. They're going to be very clear
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.800]   on the website, increase the intensity of supervision and training of Apple authorized
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:46.960]   service providers. It's all I'm so sorry. - It's prostrating themselves.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.160]   - It is. - Mm-hmm.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.240]   - Yeah. - And just to underscore what you said,
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.120]   which is it is a big freaking market. - Yeah.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.200]   - Yeah. - And that's probably a problem.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.240]   - How far do you think Apple would go though if the government actually started making demands
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.680]   that look, we have a statewide policy where you can't sell communications hardware in our country
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.480]   that we can't drill directly into. We're going to require you to have a special version of the
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.040]   firmware or a special version of the hardware for our market to make sure that our needs as a
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.920]   state operator of all communication services can be fulfilled. Do you think that they would say,
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.840]   "Absolutely, we will design a whole new SKU for you," or would they say, "There are things that we can't
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:33.200]   do as a company and, well, 1.4 billion people. Is this one of the reasons why we have $100 billion
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.000]   in the bank so that we can say no when this is a really bad demand?" - Well, isn't this exactly
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.440]   what Google went through? - Yeah.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.280]   - Google's decision was to pull out. Blackberry's decision was to cave.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.760]   - Right. - Blackberry gave India the source code to Blackberry Server.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.920]   Did they do the same for China? - Singapore.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.000]   I think they put a proxy in place. - Yep.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.480]   I don't think the mainland China has done anything with Blackberry, but maybe.
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.960]   But Google's not on the... Or at least back then, they weren't in the business of producing
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.920]   hardware. They're not making millions and millions of copies.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.640]   - China wanted to see inside the searches. - Yeah.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.880]   That's kind of the same, isn't it? - But I'm talking about the practicality of...
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:16.080]   - It's one thing to make a decision that it's okay that we're going to kowtow to a government.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.440]   It's another thing to say, "Here is what we would have to do in order to comply with that."
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:25.040]   Well, what Google does have though is a lot of Chinese handset manufacturers using Android
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.960]   in Chinese-made phones. - Well, one of the advantages of being decentralized is the disadvantage
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.400]   that Apple has is it's one thing to say that you should shut the stores.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.200]   Why didn't someone grease the right palms and everything else? But you can't do that as an
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.760]   American company legally in American law. Whereas if you have a bunch of Chinese hand
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.400]   sent manufacturers, they can do whatever they want. - What does China do?
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:50.000]   What does Apple do in China? Do they take the Blackberry root and give them the source code and say,
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.760]   "Sure, we'll have a special Chinese version of the iPhone." Or do they take the Google root and
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.720]   say, "Hey, we're not going to do business in a company." - I think so far Apple has an... I mean,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.480]   I don't think the Chinese have asked for it because their communication servers are... We don't know.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.760]   But their communication servers are so good at combing through what's passing through them.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.080]   I mean, those handsets still have to access a cloud. - Right. And that said,
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:17.040]   China is the only country where Apple has a specifically swappable set of services on Mac and iOS,
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.080]   where if you're in China when you set up a Mac or an iPhone, it doesn't offer you
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.600]   Twitter and Facebook. It offers you their Chinese equivalents. And those are essentially
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:34.960]   supervised by the Chinese government. So Apple's trying to play within the rules in China and
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:39.840]   make a good experience for users in China. And the question is, is that going to be enough?
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:46.640]   Is that... Is access to the internet and services that are supervised by the Chinese government
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:52.480]   good enough for them or not? And I have no idea if that's true. - And with Blackberry,
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.040]   the network operations center meant that a centralized place to pull all the data that was
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.440]   moving between the phone and RIM servers. And Apple has a whole bunch of different servers,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.600]   some which are person to person and some which are provided by Apple. So it's a much more complicated
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.840]   proposition. It kind of helps them with this. - That's a nice thing.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:15.840]   All right, we're going to take a break when we come back more with our great panel. I am very
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:21.600]   pleased to have... Oh, and I mentioned we have a legend in the studio with Scott Kannaster who
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.560]   wrote... So what's the best-selling Apple book you wrote, Scott? Was it Hypercard for dummies?
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:35.440]   How to write Mac software? I probably have all of them now working in developer relations at
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:42.480]   Google, of all things, writing how to write Google software, I presume. I don't know.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:51.120]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Hulu Plus. Have you got a Hulu Plus account yet?
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.280]   If you like watching television, is the best way to watch television? - I have it. You do? - Yeah,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:01.360]   my kids have gotten very good at Hulu. - SpongeBob? - No, actually, Nova. So there's like a ton of...
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.240]   - Now that's awesome. - I don't know why... - I'm like hearing that. - Well, my son is obsessed.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.840]   There's one Nova special on Venom and my son watches it probably once a week.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.640]   He's just like... He figured out how to use it and everything else he just loves. He loves the snakes
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.520]   and the spiders. So he... - I like spatters and spiders. - But it was amazing how much...
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.400]   I started noodling around with it and then just realized that it was really something we had to
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.520]   add to what we had at the house. - $7.99 a month and you get...
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:31.440]   Current season hit shows from Comedy Central. That's how I watch The Daily Show and Cold Gear.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:37.520]   Fox, NBC, ABC, and more. - And Nova. - Nova, I didn't realize that's great.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.520]   So this is the Hulu Plus on Metro, which is actually pretty sweet. Look at this. - Yeah, that's great.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.120]   There's a new Apple TV version of this, which is great. They've really done a nice job. It looks
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:52.480]   kind of a little bit like Netflix, right? It's... Here's late. Oh, this is... This is fine. So you heard,
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.200]   you know, Jimmy Fallon and Jay Leno addressing the Tonight Show rumors, right? And you said,
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.800]   "Well, I don't want to see that." - Right. - "Well, you fire up your Hulu Plus and there's the clip
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.920]   right there. You can watch the entire show." Or you can watch the clip on your Hulu Plus.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.440]   And we got a special deal for you. Two-week free trial when you go to huluplus.com/twit.

[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.560]   - Stream show. - Watch it on... So we use it on the Apple TV. - Apple TV is a great way to do it.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:25.040]   PS3, Xbox 360, Roku has it, mobile phones have it. As you see, this is a viewed the Metro version
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:32.880]   on this is spectacular. If you're using Windows 8. Pretty much, you know, Blu-ray players,
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:38.960]   pretty much every TV comes in it with it now. Tablet apps, iPad app. Anyway, take a look.

[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.160]   And you, by the way, you can airplay it, right? - Yes. Put it right on the TV.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.560]   - Although I just... - That's it. - I don't know what a TV is like. - What is a TV 4?
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.520]   - What is a TV 4? - It's like it's like... - It's a TV 2. - It's attached to it.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.920]   - You know, it's like, "Okay, we're done." - Let me stop. - Let me stop. - Let me stop.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.840]   This is the only thing I have not yet figured out. Metro is so weird. Watch how I close this
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:16.880]   program on Metro. I swipe down and off. Is that weird? And now what? Nothing.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.680]   - Yeah, you're in the... - I have a green screen. Oh, don't show that.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.800]   There we go. That's my huluplus login. I'm going to have to change that one right now.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.200]   Moving along, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:35.600]   Eye radio is coming. That's what a music executive says. Apple's pushing for a summer launch
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.920]   of its first streaming service to compete with Spotify and RDO.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.720]   - Well, here's the question. Is it competing with... Is it a Pandora or a Spotify type? I mean,
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.200]   because if it's just a radio thing, it's like, "yawn." I mean, the thing is, I'm so used to Spotify now,
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:56.960]   like, being able to download my download... You know, all the songs that I want and put them
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.240]   into my own playlist. I don't understand why I'd want to listen to radio anymore.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.440]   Well, you know, the funny thing is the radio industry still really doesn't like Pandora and
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.760]   Spotify, even though this is how people discover songs. And if you're going to buy music,
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.480]   that's how you're going to do it. You're going to listen first on YouTube maybe or RDO or Spotify
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:22.560]   and Pandora. Andy? It's weird that we've been following this rumor for like, at least four years
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:28.160]   now. And we still don't really know what Apple is going to do with a streaming radio service,
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.000]   because there's so many different ways you can interpret the term streaming radio.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.440]   Maybe that's one of the reasons why they decided to update the podcast app and put radio into a
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.160]   more prominent position. Is it going to be a sort of thing where there's sort of a curated
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.560]   playlist of apps that you can recommend to people? Or is it going to be as simple as,
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:54.160]   I've got my usual playlist of peaceful music I want to share to anybody who wants to use it.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.840]   Will they then be able to listen to this music just by virtue of the fact that I've shared it?
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:02.880]   So it's cool that they're offering a different music product, certain one that
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.720]   allows people to listen to music without buying it, which is exactly where people want to go with
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.080]   their music right now. But we just have no idea what product they're actually building out of this.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   Meanwhile, I'm seeing stories in places like the LA Times and Hollywood reporters saying Apple's
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.000]   losing the pro community down in Hollywood that people are going back to avid.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.080]   Yeah, they don't care. I mean, they're going to do some PR. I mean,
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.480]   NAB is next week. So that's the that will be where we'll see, right? I don't know if they're
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.320]   doing anything publicly. They might be doing something at the Final Cut user group, the big
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:41.520]   super meet. But the I don't think that Apple, the problem is that the market is, you know,
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:46.320]   the behind market is contracting and the corporate education market is expanding.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:51.760]   And it is a perfect app for corporate education and a relatively good app for other production.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:57.920]   It may not be the perfect app. I mean, I just finished editing a, I'll use this Final Cut 10.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.760]   So I mean, I'll say that I mean, I get ready because Apple's going to launch
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.920]   coinciding with the NAB show, a big campaign, an advertising campaign aimed at professional
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:11.680]   users to get him back on Final Cut. What I'll say is that it's you use 10. That's all I use.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.720]   I won't go back. But there are a lot of people who I mean, I just doesn't support
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:18.800]   take. I mean, there's things that well, there are a lot of people who use a lot of people.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   Here's the here's the thing though, is that is that the again, Apple's looking at the future of
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:30.880]   the market, not the past of the market. I mean, it's not a lot of money. And it's all this other
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.800]   stuff. But I mean, someone, I haven't used tape in 10 years. And the thing is, we do a lot of
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.440]   production. I mean, it's not like we do a little bit of production here and there.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.280]   And all of our whole backbone is all Final Cut 10 at this point. Our guys won't look back.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:48.480]   It did take a lot of work to get used to what you have to do. And there's still things that I go,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.600]   oh, I wish I was just using an AVID or Final Cut 7 for a handful of little things. But there are
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.760]   so many things that you do so much faster. And the big thing is, is that the conversion rate from
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:04.400]   when you're looking at people doing education corporate, which is like 15 to 20 times the size
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:11.440]   of film, the film market, the times, not percentage times as much as the film market.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.840]   You know, the thing is, is that the film market is fine. And I think Apple obviously doesn't want
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.080]   to lose that because it's a good, you know, it's the good shiny version of what everyone looks up
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.640]   from a thought, you know, thought leadership perspective. But from a pure financial perspective,
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:29.920]   I think that the, you know, where Apple is focused is all these people have, you know,
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.600]   come with iMovie, comes on all their machines, they all start to learn it, and then they run into
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.720]   a wall in iMovie that says I can't move forward. And then they then Final Cut 10 is the easiest
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.480]   thing for them to move forward to, you know, if they haven't done anything before. I do think
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.720]   that Apple's biggest mistake was is they should have just, the biggest mistake they made is they
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.240]   should have just made this some other Final Cut or some other thing and let it kind of grow in
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:54.400]   rather than just force everybody into that, into that box all at one time. I think that's
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:30:00.720]   what got them into a lot of trouble. But I think that the app for many, many, I'd say probably 80
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.960]   to 90 percent of the people who are doing editing, and you know, when we say that, you know, the
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.560]   people in Hollywood are 2 percent of people doing editing, but for 80 to 90 percent of people
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:12.720]   doing editing, it's probably it's an incredible app. And I think that there are other folks,
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.000]   I mean, I know that my other company, they use mostly Premiere because it, it, it,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.960]   Rebel Unit uses mostly Premiere because it's a, it integrates with After Effects really well.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.800]   So that's, you know, so it's not like Adobe Shop, basically. Yeah, so they're in Adobe Shop,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.080]   and that makes a lot of sense because the integration of the Adobe products are so,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:34.080]   are so good. And then when we're looking at some of the film projects we're working on,
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.840]   we're probably going to be using Abbot. So the big thing is, is that you really can use a lot of
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:43.040]   these different tools, you know, and Avids are on Macs, but I don't think they sell a lot of Apple
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.120]   hardware. Oh, they don't sell Apple hardware, but I mean, they, you know, Abbott does, I mean,
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.400]   it's a big tool. It's a Mac tool and it, it's kind of heavily customized hardware.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.920]   Well, no, no, Abbott, Abbott now just runs on your, you can just run that out of your app.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.120]   Yeah, absolutely. And it's great when you're especially, I mean, there's just things that
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:04.000]   Abbott does well that you can't do anywhere else. But it's a prestige issue, isn't it? I mean,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.480]   the idea that like a 2003, you know, cold mountain. Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, edited on final cut.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:16.080]   Huge deal, Walter Murch, you know, legendary editor. Yeah. No, absolutely. And I think that,
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.400]   you know, that was Apple want to keep that, you know, cache a. Oh, yeah, I definitely think,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.360]   and I think that's what the ad campaign is going to be pushing towards that. I think that,
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.480]   although at NAB, really what you're pushing towards is the broadcast community. I mean,
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:30.960]   I can say as someone who has to do things quickly, you know, I have to slam a lot of video together
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.160]   quickly. For a fast edit, there is nothing that would rather use than final cut, you know, for,
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.920]   I want to put up five minutes quickly. So if you're doing a segment for TV, for instance,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.160]   if I'm in a reporter and I'm out shooting in, in Afghanistan, it was something I want to cut
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:48.240]   that quickly and put it and clean it up and put it up so that it can be used in a news reel,
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.760]   there's nothing I'd rather be in the field with in Final Cut 10. Apple may get the last laugh as
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:56.960]   the world moves towards. Well, I don't know what the numbers are, but the rumors are as they've sold
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.760]   more Final Cut of Final Cut 10 than they've sold of any, any other version of Final Cut. In fact,
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.960]   I think the rumor is they've sold more than all of the flat cheaper. Well, it's, yeah, it's a lot
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.200]   cheaper. A lot of people who are put off by $1,200 say, ah, 300 bucks, I'll do it. And in two years,
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.840]   we've seen, I think six or seven updates, you know, and not, not like bug fixes. I mean, like
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.920]   key features being added and adding those features back in. One thing that's really interesting is
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:25.040]   that we've had all those updates and we haven't seen any, you know, as a user, I'm not paying for
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:29.840]   an update, right? You know, it's just love that. You know, it's a, you know, it's, it's an interesting
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:34.960]   business model. I think that, and I, and I know that I'm not the normal person in this
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:40.240]   conversation as far as talking about Final Cut 10 because it's fashionable to bash on it, but
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.400]   well, also you're cutting edge in a way that a lot of traditional students. And we had to re-learn,
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.840]   I had to re-learn everything I thought about editing. I mean, how, you know, building compound,
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.360]   you know, the way I build the way I compound stuff, we put it together. I mean, it's, and I'm
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.760]   still learning it all. And I, and we have the advantage that because Mark Spencer and Steve
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.000]   Martin, you know, do Mac break video, you know, and talk about it, we get these over here and they
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.600]   and so we have the advantage that we were able to learn it very quickly too. So I think that that's
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.240]   the other, the other advantage. Wall Street Journal says, ah, Apple will begin iPhone production.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:16.080]   Well, this quarter, but what is this quarter? That's like, we just started this quarter.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.200]   Yes. Now, before June 31st, big deal.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:24.960]   Okay. That means what? An announcement when Renee Richie?
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.480]   I heard August, but other people have heard July. So somewhere in that timeframe.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:36.640]   So if they start production end of June, when do they start shipping? How long does it take?
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.560]   It's, I guess it's different than every, every year. It's a different number, right?
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.440]   Well, it's a five S and that's usually faster than any model.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.560]   They've already made this thing.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:49.200]   Yeah. And they, they want to have as many of them as possible because they otherwise run out
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:52.160]   and they want to sell them to everyone. They don't want those shortages anymore.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:52.560]   No, they don't.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.400]   And they haven't really been able to lick that one.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.560]   No, because the demand keeps growing and they keep increasing supply and they,
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.320]   and it's hard for them to catch up.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.560]   Are they making two iPhones of five S and some sort of inexpensive plastic version?
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.480]   They, they have been working on an inexpensive version for a couple of years and they have always
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.800]   chosen previously to just, you know, keep the older version over the lower price point.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.280]   Right.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:19.120]   But eventually if they get big contracts like China Mobile or Indian contracts,
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.480]   they'll need one that is actually cheaper to produce.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:26.400]   And their second problem is that if an iPhone five goes to a hundred bucks and next year
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.360]   it goes down to zero, that's really good hardware.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.200]   And people might buy that in lieu of an iPhone five S or an iPhone six.
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:37.280]   And that reduces the average selling price of the iPhone, which makes Wall Street cranky.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.920]   So they might want to have a cheaper model at the low end so that people who are on the fence
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.240]   decide, no, I want the premium iPhone.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:47.360]   Or they, or they could just make it country exclusive.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:56.080]   I just went to my 18 T page to see if the HTC one ordering was available yet in the big splash
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.080]   page, iPhone four, 99 cents.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.640]   That's, you know, that's the way they saw me in the, in the United States.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.560]   In the United States, you really can't convince someone to buy a cheap plastic phone when there's
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   a cheap, already a cheap, really wonderful phone.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.280]   Free iPhone.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.160]   Come on.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:10.240]   Come on.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.800]   So long, so long, so long as it still remains compatible with iOS six and then iOS seven,
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.760]   I don't see that that there's a reason for that to exist in the United States.
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.160]   Well, I mean, I could maybe make a case that it could exist on T mobile with their new price
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:26.000]   plans to take it for 99 and walk away and not have more USB.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.520]   But, but would it be within Apple's best interest to make that offer available?
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.640]   Oh, well, maybe not.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.480]   Didn't team mobile say they'll have the iPhone when they in April or whatever?
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.960]   So it's happening.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.000]   It's not outlandish.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.240]   Almost all of Apple's products, not all, but a lot of them have the lower end colored version
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.240]   and the high end black and white premium version.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:46.320]   Right.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.040]   It's a model that Apple knows and it's a model that they can, if an iPhone, the other problem
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.320]   with the iPhone five is been really expensive and really hard to produce.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.600]   And that's been part of the problem that we don't know how expensive parts to produce.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.360]   Future generation iPhones will be so to have a cheaper, easily produced one to
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.920]   fill that niche in the market could be interesting either way.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.000]   iPhone five coming to T mobile April 12th and you don't have that, you know, months to
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.640]   months plan.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.640]   But they don't say how much it will be.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.840]   One of the things they're doing is they're, you're still paying to pay $20 a month.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.600]   So you get a subsidized price.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.080]   For two years.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.920]   And for two years, you have to pay $20 a month.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.440]   So it's the same price, basically, right?
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.520]   Right. Although after two years, you don't have to pay.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.960]   I mean, my wife's phone, she's had an iPhone four for two and a half years.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.680]   And, you know, she's not paying any less now that her subsidy is done.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.520]   She's just giving that money to AT&T.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:33.600]   T-Mobile's plan is a little bit different, but T-Mobile, you know, theoretically,
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.960]   and to Andy's point, who knows whether Apple would want this or not, but T-Mobile could
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.720]   theoretically say, or you can just buy this low cost iPhone for 99 bucks.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:40.960]   Right.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.360]   And, you know, and it's super cheap or you just walk away with it that, you know, might
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.400]   appeal to somebody.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:51.440]   It's certainly more relevant in markets like, like China and especially India, where I know
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.240]   that the iPhone is rapidly growing now that it's officially available and not just a gray
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:37:01.200]   market phone in India. Yeah. Because overseas, there is a really
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:05.520]   significant premium for buying an iPhone over almost any other Android device.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.560]   It was a status.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:12.080]   Well, but it's a cool. Well, people have pretty much rather have the equivalent of $80 in their
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:16.160]   pocket rather than a logo. They can buy a logo in a flea market and stick it on there.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:24.560]   They certainly do that. And I really don't know that Apple would want to give, I think
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.240]   that if they played that game in the United States, if they gave someone the Americans,
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:35.120]   the option of week, you can either for $99, you can have a lockdown iPhone for that you can only
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:39.440]   use with the carrier you buy with and you're committed to that care for two years or for $99.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:46.320]   We can give you a cheap disgusting plastic. It's a little bit sticky on the front, but it's
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.200]   nine, nine bucks and you own it forever. You can take wherever you want. I think a crazy stupid
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.000]   number of people would say, nine, nine bucks and I own it forever. Okay. Good.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.760]   Sticky. Yeah. We'll wipe it off. The fact is who cares about plastic in the US.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:05.280]   The our view of phone prices is so distorted because of those subsidies that we're talking
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.640]   about is phones that are below the water line in the US. We're literally talking about phones
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.720]   that would be they would pay you to take them in the US. So there's really no price lower than
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:18.960]   zero, which is the iPhone four. But overseas, they don't have those models and those phones that
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.880]   we view as essentially free are too expensive. So they have to come up with phones that are
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:26.240]   cheaper that we don't even see in the US because of the subsidy model. So, you know,
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.160]   it is hard for us as Americans to look at this or North American. Sorry, Renee,
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:35.760]   to look at this and not think of that that model and yet beneath the water line in the rest of the
[00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.840]   world, you know, there are there's a whole question about how do you stay competitive.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:46.880]   We're going to take a break. Come back with more. We're having a lot of fun. Andy Inaco is here
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:54.400]   from the Chicago Sun Times from IDG editorial director at Macworld and PC world. Mr. Jason
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:57.840]   Stalem, great to have you again. You were great on Twitter a couple of weeks ago.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.400]   Thanks. People should go back and watch that one. Really fun.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.920]   A rare appearance. Not so rare, really, these days from Alex Lindsay of Pixel Court.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.040]   Anything you want to plug, Alex, anything at all, you just show up, you're here. You've got nothing
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.160]   to sell. Just kind of weird. Oh, are you? I'm just having fun. All right. Renee Richie from
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:25.040]   imore.com. We want to talk a little bit today about audible.com. What a great place for
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:30.880]   audio books, over a hundred thousand books in every category, fiction, nonfiction.
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:36.560]   I'm looking at my library, my audible library here. And it's just this because I've been a
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.040]   member since 2000. It's now, I don't know, $309. I can't remember what it was. Maybe I think it's
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:49.200]   over 500 books. Classics. I just finished Pete Townsend's Who I Am autobiography.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:55.440]   No easy day. The story of the Seal Team Six that went in and got some have been logged.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:02.240]   If you read, if you ever other, if you saw Zero Dark Thirty, this is the, this is the,
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.800]   one of the source material for it. It's really, really great. So many, I mean, I just look at all
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:11.440]   these great books. Ready Player One. Will Wheaton reading that great book? Of course,
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:19.120]   we all watch Game of Thrones on Sunday night. This book three storm of sorts, but you got to
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.720]   start with the first one and work your way through them. Actually, we got a special deal for you.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:27.440]   And to, and to get us started, I'm gonna let any Anako make his recommendation, because it
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:32.240]   turns out it's the same as the special deal. Go ahead. Tell us about it. Yeah, I swear to God,
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:36.560]   there was no collusion. We stayed in separate hotels. We had different coaches. He's been in
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:42.080]   a sound booth booth since last week. Exactly. This is a really cool book called Dimension of Miracles,
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:47.280]   with two names that are going to be attached to it that will get a lot of people instant immediately.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.400]   Number one, it's part of Neil Gaiman's Little Imprint, where Neil Gaiman presents, where he
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:57.200]   picks books that are out of print or not really well known and really puts them in front of
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:01.120]   audible audible to say, please make this into an audio book. And so because it's a cool book,
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:05.200]   more people would want to be interested. So it does have the Neil Gaiman stamp of approval.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.040]   And it is read by John Hodgman, who is just remarkable. This is the first book that
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.560]   outside of his about his areas of expertise and other books like that is the first fiction book
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:21.840]   that I've heard him read. And he is so good at this because he has that rare knack of a as a book
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:29.920]   reader to handle scenes with four characters going on, including one being a robot and two being aliens,
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:36.080]   and make each voice distinct without doing character voices. It's all about the reading and it's all
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:41.600]   about the meeting and the and the and the meter of the lines. It's just wonderful. Definitely a
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.800]   stuck in the driveway trying to get to the end of chapter five because I want to find out what
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:49.520]   happens at the end of it. And it's and it's a great book to Gaiman introduces the book and tells the
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:55.360]   story about how it was one of his favorite books and when he met and became friends with Douglas
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:42:00.480]   Adams, he assumed that Douglas Adams must have read this book because it is so close in tone to the
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.120]   hit charts guide to the galaxy. And he tells a story about how Douglas was absolutely shocked that
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:09.600]   essentially someone had written the hashtag to the galaxy about 10 years before he'd gotten to
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:15.760]   that subject. Funny stuff. And it's it's the it's also a great pick for people who are not
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:21.600]   terribly fond of science fiction because the the the problem that a lot of people associate
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.320]   with science fiction is instead of instead of a line of the book saying the two people traveled
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.280]   from Earth to Proxima Centauri. The trip took 236 days and by the time they got there, they're
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.520]   itching for a fight, which is the way a normal book goes. Stereotypically bad science fiction
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:41.040]   will spend eight chapters describing the light drive that got them there in 233 days. The changes
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.600]   it made on society when when this light drive was invented. When really all we want to know is
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:50.480]   people went from point A to point B. So this is really a very I'm only on chapter six right now.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:56.000]   And it's a very straightforward story in which really every moment of this simple story so far
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.240]   is savored and explored extremely well. It's an extremely satisfying book. And I already again,
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.520]   only six chapters and it's already probably one of my 10 to 15 favorite audio books ever.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.360]   Well, to celebrate this audible is having a sweepstakes. We're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.080]   Let me just tell you the name of the book is dimension dimension of miracles single.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.840]   Probably should mention was written by Robert Shekley.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.440]   Robert Shekley, John Hodgman narrates it. You can get it for free.

[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:43.520]   sweepstakes because this is exciting. A free trip to New York Comic Con coming up in October.
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:50.560]   It'll be a trip for two to New York City.
[00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.960]   Honeymooners alert.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.240]   Honeymooners alert. That's what a good honeymoon if you're a comic book fan or a, I don't know,
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:04.880]   a true blood fan or any including round trip airfare for night stay and two four day passes
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.920]   to New York Comic Con. It's coming October 2013. You don't have to be an audible member.

[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:33.360]   Comic Con. Do you go to that? You go to the New York one for sure, right?
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:40.080]   I go to New York Comic Con every year and it's great because you want a huge convention where
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:44.400]   there's lots of things going on and you have a good chance of meeting the sort of writers and
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:47.760]   artists that you really want to say hi to and give some money to and say, "Oh my god,
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:53.520]   you're working before Washington was kind of awesome and I buy your sketchbook for $10."
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:01.040]   But without like the really crazy stupid insane crowds of San Diego. Also, it's in New York City,
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:07.440]   so there's places to go and things to do outside of the place. I had only marginal interest after
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:13.200]   how big San Diego got and now it's like all my large convention needs are being served quite nicely
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:20.320]   at New York Comic Con. Can't wait. Audible.com/sweeps to enter to win and while you're there,
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:26.640]   celebrate the release of Dimension and Miracles. Sign up for your Audible account, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:33.920]   They go together perfectly. I can't wait to listen to this one. Gosh, I'm getting behind an Audible.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:42.160]   I have to drive around more in the car at work, at play while you're working out. It's great. Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:49.920]   Second quarter financial results for Apple. I can't but this comes so fast. They're coming out in two
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:56.800]   weeks, maybe three. I'm going to get three weeks, April 23, Tuesday, as always, right after Macbreak.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:00.720]   They do this on purpose. Yes. Everything Apple does is to foil us.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:08.400]   So we don't know what they're going to announce. They don't announce products at this quarter.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.280]   This is all about their financial money. Everybody makes beautiful charts and Tim gets on the phone
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.520]   and says, "This is Tim." Do you have any questions? Do you listen in on these calls? Oh, yeah. We do
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:25.440]   a live blog about this on Macworld. They drop hints. This is the most disclosure Apple ever gives
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:30.720]   you about their business. They'll do an occasional slide and a presentation. But here is where they
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.520]   they're mandated because they're a public company. They have to disclose and they set the rules of
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:40.880]   what they disclose, but they do have to disclose this stuff. They do say things. The analysts get
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.880]   on there and they're like, "Are you really going to announce a product? What is it? Tell us about
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:48.880]   it." They're like, "Where's my TV? No, we're not going to do that." Where's my Mac Pro?
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:55.200]   "Do you have a question? Where's my TV?" Exactly. No, you have to go. Do you see any
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:47:04.560]   opportunities in perhaps the lower arm above the hand, but more than the elbow area of development?
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.200]   Can you give me some color around your feelings about the wrist?
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:13.520]   So they do a lot of that. But the fact is Apple will. They'll make statements in there. Tim Cook
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.760]   usually will make a statement. Steve Jobs before him did this, where they'll say some things that
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.720]   are like head fakes. They'll throw some elbows at the competition. The iPad was essentially
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:28.320]   announced on one of these in that people asked him about netbooks. They said, "We think netbooks
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:32.720]   are a bad experience. We think we have a better idea." That was all they said. You read the tea
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.280]   leaves, though. You knew there was some. They do use it. There is information and it's just not
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:40.960]   the information that the analysts are looking for, which is pre-announcement of new products.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   That doesn't happen. There's great stuff in there. We transcribe what Tim Cook says and run an
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.680]   article on Mac World about it. That's actually great because that's a very rare thing to get
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:57.680]   a statement like that. They're doing it very carefully, but they are disclosing some tactical
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.840]   information on those things. It's worth a listen. Anyone can listen. You don't have to follow the
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:07.600]   line. There's a quick time. If you go to apple.com/investor, there's a quick time link that goes live and
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:12.480]   you can stream it live when they do it. You can spend your afternoon listening to analysts try to
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.840]   get information out of Apple and Apple say no. We're going to trick them this time.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:24.160]   Realize though that there's an 8 to 1 ratio of everyone. We believe that micro wearable technology
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:28.880]   has not been done well yet. However, we have an area for every one of those. There's well,
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:34.080]   by amortizing our purchase of raw aluminum across two companies in Cork, Ireland, we were able to
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:42.400]   defer that pre-tax right down to. There's a lot of that. There's a lot of talk about revenue per
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:49.040]   user or revenue per unit or the supply chain management that's a snooze. There's gems in there too.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:59.520]   The first call after the Kindle Fire came out. That's when they first start talking openly about
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:05.760]   here is what the 7-inch tablet is doing. Here's what the 7-inch iPad is doing to sales of the main
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:11.040]   iPad. Normally, someone has to go on Charlie Rose or better to get information like that.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.920]   Is there more technical discussion now that Tim Cook is doing them than when Steve Jobs was doing
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:19.280]   them talking about the back channels and how they're organizing that because that was really
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:25.120]   his specialty? It's actually pretty much the same because Jobs was never running it.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:32.720]   Tim always has run those calls and he still does with Oppenheimer, the CFO. Jobs would just
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:40.160]   parachute in and read a statement and occasionally kick over some trash cans and say, "Oh, and they
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:43.040]   Android thing is terrible." He would do that and then he'd go and he'd be like, "Jobs out."
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.960]   And he'd be gone. Tim Cook would take a time to go.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:50.960]   How do you think the structure of that works? Are they all in their offices on a conference phone?
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:54.640]   They're not in one big room? No, I think they're in one big room with a conference phone and they
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.160]   don't know. When Jobs parachuted in, he would like, "Come into the room, barge into the room,"
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:02.400]   said, "Let me interrupt here." I'm going to give you a chance in a moment, but first, I want to tell
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:06.320]   you. I think he was there the whole time, but they knew it was dramatic. So they'd be like,
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.560]   "But before we get started, we have a special statement and they see jobs from here." No one knows.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.200]   That's right, because yeah, it's audio on that. Yeah, that's right. Drop the mic and walk away.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:19.440]   Let Jim talk about the supply chain all he likes. One thing they almost certainly won't be
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.440]   announcing is a game controller. This is the worst rumor I've ever read.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:30.640]   This is from Pocket Gamer. They said, "Well, you know what, GDC Apple's been meeting.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:34.640]   This must be an April Fool's joke that came out early." Apple's meeting with developers
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:40.720]   discussing an Apple second-screen game controller, which is a lot like a Nintendo DS from '20.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:48.160]   Yeah. It's crazy. It's a game controller. They have a game controller. It's their iOS devices,
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:53.120]   game controllers. They have a second screen. Amazing. Jim Dowrymple's response.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.160]   Nope. Nope.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:51:03.200]   You go to the Apple TV product page and it's almost like the third item down where they're
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.680]   saying, "Here's how the Apple TV enhances gaming by turning the iPad into a second screen for the
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:13.280]   game experience." People who are interested in exploring those rumors, I'll give you the top
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:19.920]   secret website, it's apple.com/appletv. It was just it was, "Don't pass it out because you don't
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.480]   want the server to go down. They'll pull it. They'll pull it as soon as they know this gun
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:26.720]   pull it." It was such a dumb rumor that I read the headline and didn't even read the article.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.800]   It's like, "Yeah, right. No. You can probably have a bunch of other words. You just wasn't
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:36.080]   allowed to print them." Nope. It's a good one. I like nuke and append.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:41.520]   Let's see. What else is going on in the world of Apple? There's lawsuits,
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:45.440]   Glor. I don't like talking about lawsuits. I guess we could say, and this isn't over yet,
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:50.000]   the Apple was denied the trademark to iPad mini because it was generic.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.520]   Right. That was a rush to judgment. It's just asking them for more information, right?
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.720]   Right. I think that there will be continued.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:01.680]   I love it when there are legal stories by non-legal people and then Niele Patel from The Verge is
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.120]   on Twitter and says, "Incompetent, you don't know what you're talking about. It's great."
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:09.120]   Does that mean what you think it means? Yeah. He actually went to law school.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:15.760]   It's great because when they write pieces like that, it gives you an education on how
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.080]   complicated this stuff is. Mostly, from my reading of this sort of stuff,
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:25.360]   I found online, but with Niele's piece included, is that mostly it's because we can't give you
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:30.880]   a trademark that makes it seem as though you own the term mini. You have to be so specific that
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:35.520]   this applies only to your product and doesn't prevent anybody else from using the sequence of
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:40.320]   four letters. These are re-write. On that basis, it says, "Well, how did Apple lose the mini trademark?"
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:45.520]   Oh, okay. Because it's Jeopardy rules. They didn't phrase them in the form of a trademark.
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.480]   I'm sorry. Not a match the board goes back. Sorry.
[00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:53.120]   Enap. They tell you still control the board. Enap purchases, according to a dist demo. I don't
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:53:00.480]   know how they know, are 76% of App Store revenue as of February 2013. Does that seem right?
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.360]   Who is dist demo? Does some company that does this?
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:06.720]   I don't know. But there's a whole lot of free-to-play stuff happening out there now.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:11.520]   I mean, I just got super sick man too, which you actually, it's not free to play,
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:17.760]   super sick man golf too. Great game. It's like two bucks or something like that. But Rob Griffiths,
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.680]   who used to work for Macworld, did the calculation. It's something like, if you want to unlock everything
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:27.360]   via Enap purchase, it's like thousands of dollars. It's crazy. It's called a little too much.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.840]   That's premium and pay me. Pay me.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:36.240]   Lauren Bricktibbs letter press, which is very playable for free, but you pay a buck 99,
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.120]   you get a few extra things. That's a model that almost everybody's following.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:46.960]   I don't have a problem with free-to-play or pay me. My problem is, I love the game and I just want
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.280]   to get it. The problem with super sick man golf too is there's no price at which I can buy the game.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.320]   Yeah. Let me pay 10 or 20 bucks and just have the game because it's a really fun game.
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:58.720]   Did I mention that it's a really fun game? Is it playable without paying?
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:03.440]   And it is playable. You just have to grind and you have to do levels again and again and go around
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:08.240]   finding the little bucks that you have to redeem or you can just buy some. And that's okay if you
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:12.960]   want to do that. But can I just say, okay, I love your game, just 10 bucks. Give it all to me.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.640]   The problem is that when the App Store launched, there was stuff like $10 super monkey ball,
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.200]   but there was no demos and no refunds. And we as users told developers that we're not,
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.680]   we're risk adverse. We're not going to buy your $10 game under those conditions. So then they
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:31.680]   raced to the bottom and they were given in-app purchases and we said, we won't pay for extra
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:37.040]   levels. We won't pay to remove ads. What we will pay for is because we're impatient and we are
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:41.760]   egotistical. So I will give you, I will not give you a dollar for your game, but I will give you $99
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:45.680]   for Smurf Berry. So my hut looks better than Jason. Ladies and gentlemen, the human being.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:52.720]   What I really want to see is I love it. I think I'm on to something when I see a game where there is
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:58.400]   a there is a freemium version, but there is also a 999 buys it for real because that tells me that
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:02.320]   this game was built the way it was supposed to be built as opposed to we're going to tinker with
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:07.600]   the game mechanics to make sure that as soon as you're in sort of a mentally mental fugues,
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:13.120]   we're going to drive you into a state in which your brain is going to be down about 80 IQ points.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:16.480]   And that's when we're going to hit you for an upgrade that you absolutely need to have in
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.720]   order to keep this game running. Because when they start taking with the game mechanics that way,
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:24.480]   every single game I've ever played that seemed to be built that way was never satisfying for
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:31.280]   more than 30 minutes. I really want to really want the shut up and take my money level of a game
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:35.760]   where I want to play it for free. Just to see, okay, the controls are easy to understand. I've just
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.200]   like on a kindle book where if the first chapter is good enough to make you want to buy the rest
[00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:46.320]   of the book, then I will then that's that's that free version of it really did its job. If it really
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:50.720]   is just there to make sure that now do you really want to hear it looks like there's an action
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:54.880]   scene coming up if you want 99 cents, we will actually give you the action scenes of just telling
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:56:00.480]   you what it is then moving on to the next chapter. You know, I got a chance to speak to a lot of
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.640]   developers at GDC. And this was the question I asked every one of them. And for example,
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:08.800]   Firemint, which became Fire Monkey, which is now owned by EA, they did Real Racing 3.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.120]   And the first two you could just buy, but the new version is free to play and it was hugely
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:16.800]   controversial. And a lot of them will tell you that they just can't make money on the App Store.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:20.640]   And they can't make the kind of games that they want to make. We can't buy the kind of games we
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.360]   want to buy because we as much as you know, Jason or Andy or I would pay 10 bucks or 20 bucks for
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.440]   a great game. The App Store will not. They have said flat out under the current conditions,
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.040]   the current rules of the App Store, they won't pay it, which means the developers can't feed their
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:38.000]   kids. They can't make great games. And it's it's a bad problem. I would love to see demos. I would
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.800]   love to see refunds. I'd love to see a premium, you know, a Craig Hockenberry premium App Store.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.640]   So they didn't have to. So the EA games didn't have to sit on the shelf with free games from
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:51.280]   everybody else. I'd love to see a lot of solutions to that. But right now we have an environment
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:57.120]   created by us, by Apple and by developers that's pleasing nobody. I don't know. I mean,
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:02.400]   here, I'm very pleased with plans versus zombies. Yeah, the new ones coming at any minute now.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.680]   I can't even wait. I can't wait. So this this report gave us some interesting
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:11.920]   numbers that might confirm or tell you why Superstick Man Golf does what it does.
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:19.040]   They call it average revenue per download. So the free apps that offer in app purchases,
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:24.320]   average rate of venue per download is about 93 cents. Apps that you buy,
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:31.840]   just buy the average revenues $2.25. Apps like Superstick Man Golf, where you buy it and you pay
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:36.640]   the most $2.40. Right. Well, I mean, that's how you make the most money.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.160]   You're reaching a paying audience. I mean, it's it is kind of brilliant. So you're already giving
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.320]   you money. They're not looking for some free. They'll give you a couple bucks and then you crank
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:49.600]   the rindle. Once you got a sucker, you got to play them. You know, I think it's fine. I just,
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:53.760]   I want that out. I want that thing that says I'm all in on this game. I love it. I just won
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:58.480]   everything. And I mean, one did it and Superstick Man 2 doesn't have it. You just can keep on
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:04.400]   spending thousands of dollars. Yeah. Doesn't there come a time when you just feel like a sucker
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:10.960]   where you feel as though the whole point is to not give you value that they're promising you to
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:14.480]   and that they're just trying to keep keep holding you by the ankles and shaking you and shaking
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.920]   you and shaking upside down and continuing to just get quarters out of your pocket. Yeah.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:22.880]   Well, electronic arts has got a ton of my money from the Simpsons donut purchases,
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:28.000]   but I hate them. So they got my money, but say, but I hate them, which, you know, are they happy?
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.960]   Maybe they are. There are games that are run like casinos where you literally can't win
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.480]   anything, but you can keep buying in game currency and spend it. And I think we talked
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.640]   with this on a past show where they literally employ psychologists the same way casinos do
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:46.080]   to figure out how they can shake. Like Andy said, every penny out of your pockets and those using
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:49.680]   the rules of the of the App Store right now make the most money or in the top grossing charts.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:55.280]   Yeah. That's what it fends me. The idea that they they want to maneuver you into a position where
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:59:00.160]   you're higher brain. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. It really is a science where they
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:04.000]   figure out here's how to maneuver this person to a position where their impulse control level is
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.920]   very, very low. Their higher cognitive functions are very, very low. They're in sort of a fugue
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:12.000]   state where all they want to do is keep the shiny things coming so much more. And if there's this
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.560]   big immense orange button that can press to keep that happy chemical in their brain going,
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:19.840]   they're going to press it. That's when you feel manipulated like a sucker.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:23.840]   I should, I should apologize to the super stickman golf people. Rob Griffith's calculation is
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:29.200]   it's not thousands of dollars to reach level 60. You have to spend more than $160.
[00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:34.480]   Play 2,000 rounds of golf or win over 8,000 head to head matches. So really simple.
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:37.440]   So if you won 8,000 head to head matches, you wouldn't pay that penny.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:40.240]   Right. Right. So you can, if you played all your entire life,
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:45.360]   I'm not down. Or but 160 bucks, right? It's like, you know, if I'm your faithful user,
[00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:50.160]   you'll get to get it. I have to, I have to, I have to interject and point this out. That's
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:58.720]   $160,000. $160. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Because $160,000 would be the exact dollar amount of the wager
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:07.520]   at the end of Caddy Shack. That's a thousand level 60 golfers and super stickman golf.
[01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.920]   Equivalent. Well, I think it gets back to the seriousness of the game player. I mean, I think that I'm,
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:18.160]   for me, I don't want anything, and I'm only one segment of it, but I don't want anything
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.960]   more complicated than field runners, Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.080]   And all of those don't have an app and they charge me 99 cents or 199.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:26.640]   Angry Birds has the angry eagle. Do you ever buy that?
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:30.800]   No. No. Yeah. But those are like the top five games. Those are all wildly successful.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.080]   And the thing is, what about the rest of them?
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:36.880]   But they, but the thing is, is but it's to look at, you know, they have a very good model that
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:41.680]   other people can, I think other people can employ, you know, in that, in that it's simple enough that,
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:47.040]   you know, they, what, what they do very, very well is, I was just teaching my son, my five year
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.880]   old son how to play Plants vs. Zombies this morning.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.200]   You taught me how to play field runners. You're the king of intestines.
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:56.960]   Yes, I am. So anyways, he's very good. If you ever want a strategy case,
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.600]   Plants vs. Zombies is so good.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.080]   But yeah, and the thing is, is what, what those, what all three of those do really well is,
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:07.520]   A, they're compelling. The music's good. The art is simple, but good.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:13.280]   They are, they are easy to get started, but very, very hard to master. And they do that,
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:17.760]   that transition from easy to hard, very, very well. That's where it's game design.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.960]   You win, you win, you win, you win, you win, you win. And then after the third or fourth level,
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:26.240]   getting a little harder, but it's very, very, very good level design. And it's funny, you know,
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.320]   they're all, they're all funny. Well, I don't know, field runners is funny, but, but it's,
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.120]   it is. I mean, and it's gotten info. I would say two plants.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:38.400]   Plants is the best iOS game ever. But they're also older games. I mean, they weren't produced.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.960]   It wasn't made for iOS. That's right. It was a flash game. Yeah. And it's just, it's,
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:46.640]   and the thing is, is that, but what, but for instance, what Angry Birds has done is they
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:52.880]   haven't necessarily capitalized on in-app purchases. What they do is they put out new ones and we happily
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.680]   buy them. You know, it's like, ooh, there's, there's the seasons. I'm all paying another 99 cents for that.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.160]   What seasons was free at first? Seasons free, but I think it's now, now charged. There's Star Wars
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.160]   and Star Wars and, and then they make a lot of money when you have that big, large of an audience,
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.680]   you make a lot of money on, you know, merchandise, merchandise and shirts and how many t-shirts,
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.560]   so many Angry Birds t-shirts you see on Kizzies. My son has two or three. Yeah. The Roku 3 has
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.720]   Angry Birds Star Wars on it. I mean, that's, it's, it's, it's got a little bit crazy. Well,
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.920]   now they're doing shows. Have you seen them? And the shows are actually pretty good. Have you seen
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.440]   the YouTube? Really? No, no. So, so here's the whole thing with Angry Birds now is that they have
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:31.520]   moved to net. There's now in-app movie, like little shorts, like they want to be the Warner Brothers
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:36.880]   of, you know, Warner Brothers cartoons, you know, learning tunes, but they're putting the
[01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:41.600]   learning tunes into the apps. So you can actually watch these movies, you know, in the building,
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:45.680]   you know, so they're, you know, they're using an R&D audience. Are they cut scenes? How do they
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.800]   do that? They're shorts. I mean, they, they, they put some money into these. I mean, these are not,
[01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:52.960]   these are not like, so if you like, conquer a level, you get to watch a short or, well, they're,
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.040]   when you open them up, they play, you know, in the new, in the new version, I think, when they open
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.120]   up, you play and they're actually funny. They're funny. I mean, they're, they're brilliant. They're
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.920]   really well done. And so, but they're, you know, moving towards, you know, capitalizing on this,
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:11.520]   but I think that, you know, again, it, it is going to be, it's always going to be the handful of
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.000]   people that are making a lot of money and a lot of people that aren't making money. That's called,
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.440]   you know, I mean, like, there's a lot of actors in Hollywood that are, that never do more than
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.240]   weight tables. I mean, that's 90% of the actors in Hollywood, right? And so, so the, so,
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.080]   you got Jason playing super stick, man golf. I'm doing the Simpsons, tap that.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.800]   We're just playing you on. I'm just, I'm just, I had to service some, there's always going to be a
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:36.080]   small percentage that, that make a whole lot of money and everyone else that's keep on, that keeps
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.240]   on trying. But I think that when we look at the model of those super successful games, they're
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:44.000]   inexpensive, they're easy to get started. They, but they keep on challenging you.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.080]   You know what scares me is that it's hard to do good game design. It is. And there's not really a,
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.600]   a manual for that. Yeah. It's not hard. There's the, these are the shorts. It's not hard to do
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:04:02.000]   psychological tricks because it's pretty easy to trick people, you know, gambling and collecting
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.560]   loot in Diablo three. There's, they, it's, that's well known. There is a manual for that. And that's
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.760]   kind of depressing that some of these games, they focus more on how to trick you into spending
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.440]   money than on how to make a great game. Right. I feel like you feel like the game is being
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.680]   designed by some of the business plan, not someone who loves building a great game. And Zing is the
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:24.720]   classic. And that's actually, I think hurt the company desperately because they invented this
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:29.840]   with Farmville. And they felt malicious. And it felt malignant. It felt abusive. But I'm sorry,
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:34.640]   I have to buy some donuts here. So just continue on. And you look at Candy Crush. Now, I mean,
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.920]   I know a lot of people who are just addicted to Candy Crunch and they'll get, they'll get far
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.320]   enough that they're almost beating a level. Yeah. And it's just 99 cents to get five more moves.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.160]   No. And if they're spending more than a couple hours, they pay that 99 cents. And then, you know,
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:52.560]   mark my words. One of these days, somebody's going to come do one of those arcade game emulator apps
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.000]   where it takes real quarters. You'll have to buy
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.280]   that's true. They invented it. Didn't they? You're right.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.760]   With purchases and how many hours is that what it is? That's the it is on your own device.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.680]   You're in it. It is a coin op arcade game. How many times does how many hours has been a
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:12.000]   chucky cheese pizza time theater? How many dollars did you spend on one of one that's
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.040]   centipede? Five dollars every Saturday. Yeah. Was it all? Was it five dollars every Saturday?
[01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.160]   It's later. Well, that's what I had. I mean, I was 10 years old. So, but it was like five dollars
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:23.680]   every Saturday. If you're playing dragons, Larry, you you were throwing your money away.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:28.320]   Mine was. Yeah, exactly. No, I was gone. That was a terrible not like when I was in college.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:32.480]   It was always your case. It was a time. If you if you've never seen like the end of the final
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:37.520]   animation of Princess Stephanie, and you've never been 12 years old in your life, then you might
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:42.720]   think that that was a waste of money. But I have seen that animation Princess Stephanie,
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:50.080]   that was money. Well spent on the verge kind of tapped a vein when they said apples broken
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:54.640]   promise. Why doesn't iCloud just work more and more developers are saying if you
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:06:00.080]   want to tie your sync services in iCloud, don't your nuts? It doesn't work. It's terrible. It's
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:06.320]   hard to use. And of course, everybody who uses iCloud as an end user is a little frustrated with
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:11.600]   it. Maybe not frustrated, but I have a very low expectation. I think that I don't I don't do
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:16.400]   much with it. I think this article isn't talking about the front facing stuff. No, it's
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:22.400]   kind of developers to I call it core data sync. Yeah. Yeah. There's like there's two different
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:27.920]   kinds of iCloud user user facing iCloud like syncing. The document syncing works okay,
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:32.160]   where you have a discrete document that has to be synced to the cloud and to multiple devices.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.000]   The problem is that when you have databases, when you have complex data structures,
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.600]   because this is something I've been talking to developers about for two years now,
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.160]   they just can't get it to work no matter what kind of app developer I'm using. I'm talking to
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.880]   whether using a large database or a small or small database, it doesn't work properly. It's not
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:54.080]   reliable. There it's not the service is not communicating with like the originating piece of
[01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:58.320]   software to say, Hi, this failed. And here's here's the information you need to figure out why it
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:02.240]   failed. So you can either communicate that to the user or fix it yourself. No, but says,
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:06.640]   sorry, I tried if you want to try it again and make your user wait another eight minutes just to
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.760]   get this thing synced up. That's that's up to you. They're frustrated that Apple is not they're
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:17.280]   not getting enough support from Apple on trying to get it to work. And the number of developers I've
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:22.160]   spoken to that have absolutely given up on trying to get iCloud to work with their apps.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:27.200]   It's a long, long list. I'm probably not free to talk about all these different people, but
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:33.920]   most of many of them are actually so desperate and so have such a lack of faith in iCloud working
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.720]   anytime soon that they are actually contracting another developer to build them their own kind of
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:43.440]   iCloud syncing service, because they feel as though this will be a service that works to our needs.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:48.960]   It will actually work on time. It will because we're paying this guy to make it work. And more
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:55.040]   than anything else, they won't be they won't put one of the core features of their apps at the
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:00.320]   mercy of an Apple service that Apple might care about might not care about. It's just a terrible,
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:06.640]   terrible situation. And I've never I just have to underscore it. I've never seen a single problem
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:13.360]   with Apple that has gotten so many developers so absolutely honked off and frustrated and eager to
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.200]   say let's try anything but the Apple solution now because we have no faith that Apple's going to
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:24.320]   make this right. There is a I mean, Tandy's point, this this is a very, very difficult solution. And
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:29.440]   it could be possible that the way Apple's doing it just won't work that the strategy they took to
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:35.360]   do this. So you can you can sync key values over iCloud. That works fine. Tons of developers do that.
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:41.120]   Like I mentioned, you can sync documents. Yeah, and yeah, preference sharing. A lot of apps do
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.320]   that. You can also do the documents, but core data is trying to sync to core data databases.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:50.960]   Apple doesn't do single store of truth the way Google does. I used to work in databases. So I have
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.120]   a very rough understanding of this. But with Google, you're basically getting a view into the single
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.560]   database that is the truth that lives on the cloud. Apple is doing peer to peer sinking. And the idea
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:05.920]   of taking a core data, which the developer can invent his own object model for his coordinated
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:11.040]   database and thinking that to other devices when users may or may not be linked in when they may
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.840]   sorry logged in when they may or may not have made changes that result in collisions. You've got to
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:21.840]   have, you know, the there's multiple transactions. It's probably has to be very lockless. It probably
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.640]   has to be very optimistic. And you're going to run into tons of errors and apples not feeding those
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:31.920]   errors back to developers. So they have no idea what's happening. But worse, the way that Apple
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:37.120]   architected this just simply might be unworkable, in which case, you'll probably see a little dustpan
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.680]   at WWDC. Will they roll that away and try to fix it with a whole new system?
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:48.880]   What developers are saying in this Verge article is one of the toughest parts customers demand
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.520]   iCloud support after seeing Apple marketing. Yet developers can't deliver. And I'm seeing
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:58.000]   this in the chat room. Agile tourist developer Greg Pierce said one thing that one key thing
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.720]   I understand is that the user's perception of iCloud functioning is largely based on apps that
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:08.000]   don't use core data. And so people say, well, in fact, the chat room saying, Oh, it's working for me.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.440]   I like iCloud. What are you talking about? My calendar or it's the other right or it's the
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.720]   other services that Apple calls iCloud. There's a there's a nice article on the next web that
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:21.360]   Matthew Panzarena wrote called the tale of two iClouds. Although it's funny, the the URL is
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:26.080]   which iCloud actually sucks. But I guess that was his original headline. But the point is there
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:31.280]   are two iClouds. There's this developer data sync iCloud. And then there's the iCloud backups
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:35.360]   and calendar syncing and all these other things that are it's like a brand name. And what the
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.560]   developers are saying is, okay, for this stuff where we need to sync data like Rich Segal from
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:45.840]   Bear Bones wrote a post about how he can't sync your Jimbo data there. Their content manager or
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:50.720]   their, you know, personal database, right? Data syncing. It just doesn't work. And and Brent
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:57.760]   Simmons wrote a piece about how even if you can get it to work, it only works on Mac apps that
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:03.200]   are in the Mac App Store and iOS app. So if you want to go to a web app or to to Android phone or
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.520]   out of the App Store or to Windows, you can't use it there either. So, you know, Brent basically
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.000]   said don't use it at all. But but there are these two iClouds and there's, you know,
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.200]   that's part of the mess here is that Apple's just dropped all of its stuff into this one big box.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:22.240]   And if part of it is broken or part of it works well, everybody expects the other part to work
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.600]   well because it's all just seen as one thing. Well, it's also very limited. I mean, you end up
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:31.040]   with the situation where I've got a bunch of devices that are all, you know, 64 gig or, you know,
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.800]   or so, you know, and they're all trying to back up to it. And of course, you know,
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.960]   what that filled up pretty quickly. Well, there's a bandwidth issue, but I think I don't have bandwidth
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.920]   of it. But I can't buy the room to do it. Right. And Renee hit the nail on the head where he said
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:48.640]   really the issue is this peer to peer sinking is just very, very tough to do.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:53.680]   Ellis hamburger writing in the Verge says when Apple does use iCloud, it most often does not even
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:58.480]   use Core Data to sink information apps like keynote, for instance, use the document based
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:03.040]   sinking method. Keynote must work. So Apple keeps a close eye on document based sinking.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.360]   And when it does rely on Core Data, and this is the key Apple software has no more luck
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.840]   than third party developers. So if it did work at all, you could point to Apple and say, well,
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.600]   look, see, it's working for Apple. It must just be you developers aren't good enough. No.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:21.120]   It's the same thing as games. Apple doesn't dog food those API's, which means that the
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:25.200]   developers are going to hit the pain points first. And that's a horrible situation for everyone.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.400]   If Apple, well, they've set up this expectation. Yeah. So you're in trailers.app, I think,
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.320]   is the only one that uses this. And that's, you know, hardly essential to Apple.
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:41.040]   Well, so I think. And they and as Ellis writes, periodically trailers loses track of user favorites
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:46.080]   because Core Data doesn't work. Yeah. Even for Apple, you know, the notes app. You said the notes
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.680]   app probably did. That's probably what was wrong with podcast. And I bet you the rewrite
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:54.320]   stopped using it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so many of these notes app uses iMap email instead of,
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.320]   I mean, it's just it's yeah, I think Renee hit it right on the head, which is there's a lot of stuff
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.960]   that we're seeing that that Apple is not doing what it does for so many other things, which is take
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.600]   API's and then, you know, the phrase is dog fooding. It's using it yourself, eat your own dog food.
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:13.120]   And and Apple does that in so many other areas with API's. And yet here, it doesn't seem like they
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.240]   did it because they rushed to get it flat out. And it just doesn't work. Well, and the thing is,
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:20.640]   is that this stuff for developers that's sinking data between a bunch of mobile app,
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.600]   any mobile devices that are all trying to use that data is a cluster. I mean, it is, you know,
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.960]   it is, it's not, you know, the reason that for a long time we couldn't get anything out of our,
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.800]   you couldn't really have stuff with Google, Google was always, you know, it's always online.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:38.720]   You're always connected. I mean, drives here now, but the, you know, but the main advantage of that
[01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:42.880]   is that there was one version of the truth, you know, and, and a lot of these online, you know,
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.120]   these cloud based, truly cloud based services, whether it's Salesforce or Google or many of the
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.280]   other ones, they truly are cloud. I mean, like when you're accessing that data, you're accessing
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.800]   one database, you're not downloading something, changing and uploading it. Because when you
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.280]   start doing that from six different devices, if we have an iPad, an iPhone, my computer, and my,
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.880]   and, you know, somewhere out in them logging in somewhere, you know, those are all that creates
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:09.680]   just a, you know, a serious cluster. And there's no incentive for developers to figure this out,
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:14.080]   because it really does look like Apple probably just abandoned ship at WWDC.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.560]   They're going to, yeah, there's a, there's a really great tweet that I retweeted this morning
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:24.800]   about how, you know, how Apple has a session at WWDC where there's like Apple engineers in
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.040]   the room with a thousand developers asking questions, they would much rather have like three
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:34.240]   developers on stage talking to a thousand Apple engineers to get some basic information to them
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.560]   about how well a lot of their services are working. Yeah, I think that a lot of this is where you're
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:44.320]   seeing every philosophy has limitations, nothing is perfect. And another problem of iCloud is that
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.480]   it really is people don't, users don't understand that this isn't like a, this isn't Dropbox, this
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:56.400]   isn't like a network attached flash drive. This is personal sharing between the devices that you
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:02.080]   own. And when anytime you need to get information in or out of that ecosystem towards other people,
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:06.400]   it starts to have problems. And so this is one of the reasons why I'm sort of moving away from
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.480]   using iCloud for my documents thinking, because now there are just too many situations, which is
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:14.320]   just too difficult for me to share this document with another person who needs to get access to it.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:20.240]   And then the other, and the other difficulty is that alternatives that a lot of developers would
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.920]   like to use like Dropbox, small problem there, because Apple will not allow the application to
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:30.640]   simply access Dropbox without telling the user to please leave this application. I'm going to take
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.200]   you to the Dropbox application where then you have to specifically authorize this transaction to
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.800]   happen and then come back to the original, which is not the easiest way to walk a user into an
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:45.200]   operation that in theory could be just as simple as when he's Dropbox, great, you're using Dropbox.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:49.920]   Go ahead. Business Scott forest all problem. Was this created by Scott and will be fixed by his
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:53.760]   success? No. Well, Eddie, you fix this. The other thing to remember is that no.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:59.520]   It's a big cliche, but sync is hard. Sync is one of the hardest things to work on.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.840]   But big game, as the world is this a hard thing and is this the right way to implement it,
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:08.720]   people would have told you. So for example, kind of arrogance to say, no, we're going to do
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:13.200]   something nobody's ever been able to do before. If you talk to developers, they use Dropbox.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:17.440]   Dropbox is very good in North America. It's a huge pain outside North America because Amazon's
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.600]   data centers aren't as prolific there. Interesting. But they had they went through an incredibly
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:26.560]   tough time getting Dropbox sync to work for a lot of apps, but they managed to do it. And that was
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:32.480]   the biggest difference. But multiple concurrent users on peer to peer devices, when maybe Alex
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:36.320]   is changing something on his iPhone, while his wife is changing on her iPad, or maybe he starts
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.480]   changing it, then logs in, then does it or switches iCloud accounts. It's a nightmare. It
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:44.000]   probably is something Apple shouldn't have tried to do this way and certainly shouldn't have released
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:49.360]   it when they did. But mostly the over promised and severely under delivered, that was the big
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:53.920]   problem. They should have like iPhone 1.0 it where they said, we're not going to give you
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.520]   everything that competing phones today give you, but the stuff that we're going to give you
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.240]   was going to be brilliant and going to make you wish that the next year's version came sooner.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.960]   iCloud was wonderful demo given by Steve himself saying it all just works. It's magic.
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:11.440]   There's there are two kinds of magic. There's the good kind of magic. And then there's the
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.680]   black hat magic. I think we're seeing a black hat magic here. Yeah. Somebody in the chat room,
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:22.640]   deep pan says maybe this is why Adobe's CTO was brought in to Apple. Maybe he knows how the
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:28.800]   cloud works. Somebody must know. Yeah, there's there's much more frightening versions of why that,
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:35.360]   why you bring us CTO in from Adobe. Yeah. You know, for Adobe, the YouTube videos and Alex for
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:40.000]   the YouTube videos. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny. You know, some of the iCloud, I actually would say
[01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.680]   on balance iCloud has worked better than I thought it would. I do use iCloud backup
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:49.840]   and it does work. And I've used it to restore and backup phone. Yeah, but that's a simple thing to
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:55.200]   do. Right. And some of these other iCloud features do work. Yeah. Well, it's simple. And yet Apple's
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:18:00.000]   track record was not that good with this stuff. And that stuff they seem to have gotten. It doesn't
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.240]   seem to be a lack of this seems to be like an API problem. It's it's a and to Renee's point,
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.960]   it is really complicated. It is very hard to do. And they're struggling with it. And there's that
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:16.480]   overarching question of is this something that developers even want because it is limited to
[01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:23.040]   apps or apps and you can't go outside it. So I don't know. But you know, to give Apple credit,
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:28.080]   they had never attempted well, they had attempted they never succeeded at something as big as iCloud
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.800]   before. And a lot of parts of iCloud actually do work. And I didn't expect I didn't expect the
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.400]   backup to be reliable. I didn't expect iTunes in the cloud. It's a great praise, but it is better
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:40.720]   than mobile me. It is. It is. Yeah, they've shown some progression, but then they bit off this new
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:44.960]   chunk and it had a problem with it. Right. And to be fair, iCloud Docman's thinking was so good
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.840]   that I really changed my entire writing work. I gave up Scrivener for like a year and a half
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:54.480]   because iCloud Docman's thinking was such an interesting and useful thing. What's his name?
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.520]   Steven Lynch? Is that the W.C. Kevin Lynch? Kevin Lynch.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:02.320]   Okay. Why? Well, no, I'm just saying that that you know, I could.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.400]   Spiracy theory. Yeah, and I have no information at all. I'm just saying that when I saw that,
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.480]   I was like, well, Apple might be getting more serious about Photoshop. You know, you know, it's,
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:14.560]   you know, it's, you know, it's, it's a, you know, there's something that works. It'd be the former
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.720]   Adobe CTO. Yeah, I mean, obviously he can't, he shouldn't be able to talk about it or anything else.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:22.240]   But I mean, when you're talking about when you're talking about some cloud services when it comes
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.720]   to imagery and so on, so forth, but also, and it may just be that he just a smart guy and he's
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.640]   just has a lot of, I mean, that could be all, but I, is the scarcity in Silicon Valley.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:32.320]   Yeah. And if there's somebody talented, you hire them.
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:37.360]   And everybody who's been at Apple all this time, I mean, they've got so much stock that, I mean,
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:42.800]   they don't care anymore. Anybody who's senior and Apple could walk away. If they don't, if it's not
[01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:47.920]   just, if it's not a calling for them, it's just a job, they're going to cash out. So it's a problem.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:54.880]   I'm ready to cash out. So the latest iPhone River comes from an unusual source. The San Francisco
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:20:01.600]   district attorney, apparently he met with Apple over these phones. If the phone walks into a bar,
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:11.760]   you've heard the joke before. And apparently, Apple hinted that the next two phones were designed
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:17.200]   under Steve Jobs. But of course, right? But they're going to say that, right?
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:22.000]   No, but I mean, they said before that Steve Jobs had about four years of roadmaps and the five S
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.400]   is going to be like the five. And it's not, if you talk to any company that makes products like
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:31.840]   the iPhone, they have a two year, three year roadmap. And yes, things will change. But the broad strokes
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:36.000]   are determined years in advance. And it would be shocking if Steve Jobs didn't have at least a
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.200]   hand in basic ideas for these phones stretching forward several years.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.680]   The DA said they discussed the long and laborious process of researching and producing
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:48.960]   a kill switch technology for devices such as in, on my iPhone. He also said the next two
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:53.360]   generations of iPhones have already been developed. They preceded Tim Cook.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.000]   It's too hard a word though. Yeah, developed as a, yeah.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   Yeah. Is that a roadmap? They're not. I mean, they're not finished and they're going to respond
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.720]   to market conditions and they'll make changes and alterations. Oh, wait, sometimes I don't
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:10.000]   think Apple pays attention to any of the market conditions. It just seems like they just, they
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.880]   have a pipeline. They've decided where they're going. And I rarely feel like they're reacting to
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:18.240]   anything that, that we think that they would be reacting to.
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.840]   My favorite tidbit from the story, George Gaskicon, the, uh,
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.160]   uh, did, the district attorney in San Francisco, said his conversation with Apple's government
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.720]   liaison, Michael Folks, was very underwhelming. He did most of the talking. It was incredible.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:34.960]   He would just go on and on one subject to the next. It was hard to follow. It was almost like
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.160]   somebody who has been trained in the art of doing a lot of talking and saying nothing.
[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:42.400]   Sounds like this show. We're gonna take, we're gonna take a break.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:51.200]   We're right here, Leo. Sorry. We're going to take a break. Come back with your picks of the week.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:54.960]   Oh, I did want to give a plugged in Nolan Bushnell. He, uh, we're going to try to get him back on.
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:00.480]   He did a triangulation episode with us that was wonderful. Steve Jobs first boss. He hired him at
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:05.840]   Atari had lots of things to say about jobs in that interview and he has a new book out
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:11.760]   that refers to that. And what is the title of it? I'm trying to find it here. Finding the next
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:19.440]   Steve Jobs, how to find higher, keep and nurture creative talent by Nolan Bushnell. And we will
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:24.000]   get him back on triangulation to talk about that. His daughter, uh, emailed me, said, no one'd like
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.960]   to be on and we will work it out. Meanwhile, our show today brought to you by our friends at
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:36.240]   squarespace.com, the secret behind the best, most professional websites that never go down in the
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:43.360]   world. That's why I like squarespace because it's both incredible hosting plus the best content
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.920]   management system on top of it. They tie it together so smoothly, so beautifully, so, uh,

[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:56.960]   squarespace sites down when we send you there. For instance, our blog inside dot twit.tv. Go
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:02.080]   ahead, try to hammer it down. Uh, and now with a new commerce solution, squarespace is a great

[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:14.960]   of the week. Let's start with Alex. You haven't done an Alex pick in a long time. One of those
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.520]   $700. I don't have one for today. Yeah, $3,000 video hardware. Come on Alex.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:24.160]   Come on Alex. I didn't know that the pressure was going to be on. I could give you an expensive one.
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.240]   Mine will be expensive. Mine's not.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.040]   All right.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:33.680]   Okay. So mine is something I actually ran into at Macworld when I was there. And it's called JAXDA.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:41.920]   J-A-K-S-T-A. So what JAXDA does is it downloads videos from the web. I know that doesn't sound
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.640]   like much, but pretty much it downloads every video that you touch on the web.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:55.680]   So like just like just by visiting? Yeah. So you go to YouTube and so if I go to YouTube here
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:01.200]   and I go to a page, you'll just you might hear it in the background here. So if I go to
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:07.360]   I'll go to any video. Steve Jobs introduces the iPod 2001 that's on my playlist for whatever reason.
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:15.760]   So anyway, so I've gone to this video. You're watching the fabulous advertisement.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.000]   I wish you could skip that. You download the advertisement.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.720]   There was one way to skip that. It was one ad the other day that came on and I actually
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:26.080]   stopped and it was like a minute and a half and I was watching it. A minute and a half pre-roll
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.440]   is a little bit long. No, but I couldn't stop because it was actually really good. I can't
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:34.640]   remember. I see that's the key. Yeah, exactly. It's good. So anyway, so if I go to JAXDA,
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:39.120]   you'll see that it it's 128 megs and it's downloading right now. It'll take four minutes
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.040]   for it to download across this network. And then it'll convert to whatever format I'd like to
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:50.000]   convert it to. So it makes it it. So what happens is then this will work.
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.800]   Like for instance, there's a piece of hardware that we use and they have all their web behind
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:04.000]   the developer or behind the user, you know, wall, you know, the support, you know, you have to have
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.360]   a username and you have to have all this login stuff and then you go to their videos and I have
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.800]   to log in every single time. So I just turned JAXDA on. I just went and just clicked on all the
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:15.360]   videos that were locked in their webpage. Wow. And it just pulls them all down. And then you go to
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.840]   ABC.com and just pulls all that done to and then you go to, you know, then you go to lynda.com and
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:25.520]   it just pulls all that down to. So so the thing is, it's kind of this effortless way to, you know,
[01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:29.920]   anything that's unencrypted, you know, that doesn't have a, you know, that's there, which is most of
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:34.640]   the videos on the web because they want it to be easy to watch. It'll just grab for you. So
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.920]   anyway, so it's, it's like 20 bucks or 30 bucks or something like that, but it's worth it. It's
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:47.360]   worth every penny if you're, if you need to get stuff down from the web. JAXDA. J-A-K-K-S-T-A.
[01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:55.680]   S-T-A. JAXDA. Mr. Renee Richie, your pick of the week. My pick of the week is dedicated both to
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:00.720]   Andy and Jason. And I think we've talked about it before, but it's Marvel Comics Unlimited,
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:07.040]   now available as a native app on the iPhone and the iPad. It's like, it's people call it similar
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:11.840]   to Netflix. It's not exactly Netflix because it's like Netflix for only one network. You get access
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:18.240]   to all of Marvel's. I think it's 60 or 70,000 back issues. And I was using this on the airplane.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.240]   I've been traveling a lot and I read my way through Peter David's Hulk run. And now I'm reading
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:29.600]   old Arthur Adams, drawn comics. And it's just, it's a fantastically large library. The app isn't
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:33.920]   great. It's like a web wrapper at this point. It does a lot of really weird things, but they're
[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:39.200]   improving it slowly. And I'm hoping that it gets really good. But it's all about the content library.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:45.360]   Jason did a great article, I think on Mackerel about it. And it's just, it's fantastic to have all
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:51.280]   that stuff available on demand on your iPad. Yeah, it goes back what, a year-ish. And then
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.520]   there's a bunch of classic stuff. And the native part is in the sort of like accessing the database.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:00.880]   So you can kind of like go through and browse by issue. The reader itself, they built an HTML5
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.520]   and it does have some quirks, although it is getting better. And I feel like you really need
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.480]   a full-size iPad to really appreciate it. Because zooming is where it gets really weird. But yeah,
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:15.360]   for for for an annual fee or a monthly fee, you get access to read as many comments,
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:20.480]   comics as you like. I sat down on a rainy like Saturday afternoon and read the entire,
[01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.280]   what immortal iron fist series by the guys who are doing Hawkeye now, which is an awesome
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:30.480]   comic. And that's like 20 issues or something like that. And it was, you know, it was covered.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:35.120]   I already spent my money and I just, I could rip through one issue after another. And it was
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:39.520]   all covered and it was a lot of fun. So it's, it's, it's pretty cool. If you're somebody who
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:45.120]   loves Marvel and is not like, you don't have to be current with the latest and greatest. It's what?
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:52.400]   10,000 plus 13,000 plus issues, including some recent stuff, as well as stuff from like the 60s
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:57.200]   and 70s. And how much? It's, I think the introductory special was 50 bucks a year or something.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.000]   Yeah, 50 bucks a year. And there's also a monthly rated one. If I buy the year,
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.760]   can I continue to read them after it expires? No, no, it's, it's like Netflix where it's only
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:09.360]   the active subscribers. Although I should say, unlike Netflix, you can cash up to six issues
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:15.200]   locally. So if you're going on a plane trip or into the subway or whatever, you can cash six
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.840]   issues the size of a, you know, a comics trade and, and then read those when you're offline,
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:28.080]   which is cool. Marvel unlimited. It's streaming comics. It does. Andy, not go. You're pick.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:34.960]   This isn't necessarily a new app, but it's one that I just discovered rather,
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:39.680]   rather, rather started using as a regular thing a couple of months ago. It's going to be
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:44.400]   familiar with a lot of people's called. It's a to do manager called any dot do. Oh, I love it.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:49.440]   And I love it, right? It's there. There's no shortage of like to do list and list managers out there.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.240]   The problem is finding the one that is hooked in that you can actually successfully use.
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.440]   There are a lot of apps are too, they're trying to be too rigid and complicated. And I don't really
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:04.000]   go with rigid and complicated. And they're kinds where they're too static. They're not quite as
[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.520]   engaged. Like I can make lists to the day goes, day goes gray. But then I need to remember to do
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:14.880]   the things that are on this list, which is why I like any dot do because number one, it's a very,
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:19.840]   very clean, very, very pretty interface. I don't know if you can see it's got I've got the two
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:26.160]   X version on my iPad here. Very, very, very easy. And to add a new item, all you got to do is just
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:31.040]   swipe down from the top. And now you've just got either through the microphone or just by typing it
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:38.160]   in, you can give a new to do list item. But look how nicely it's set up. It's not only is it a list
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:42.880]   of things you hope to get done, but also you can these are these are two items that are under today.
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:48.960]   If I decide that, okay, I'm not going to edit that new book, the Bible today, I will shift that to
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:54.800]   tomorrow. So you just simply drag that into tomorrow or upcoming or someday. Just nice vague
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:58.400]   things are still quite useful. The thing that I really, really like about it, though, and this is
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:03.840]   what really made it into winter for me is last month, they added a feature called the any do moment.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:09.760]   But you can set it so that every day at a certain at the same time, what it's going to do is it's
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:14.480]   going to actually wake up and sort of not interrupt, but simply give your reminder and say,
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:18.960]   we like to walk through here. I'm going to activate it manually right now. And it gives
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:24.560]   us nice animation. And quietly just it's like the assistant walking in saying, okay, here are the
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:28.800]   things that I need to do list. Do you want to edit that new book, the Bible today or later? So
[01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:34.480]   I think I'm going to get that done later. Let's just postpone that for a day. Then the next thing,
[01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:39.200]   then it's going to ask you, do you want to do it tomorrow and a couple of days? It'll go through
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:43.120]   every single thing on your list like that. And so, no, I really got to return that shopping cart
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:47.920]   today. So I will definitely do that today. And then it will keep reminding you, you can say,
[01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:53.200]   I want to have that done by seven. And by going through every single item, by going through every
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:57.840]   single item on your list like that, it's a way to really figure out it not only does it collect
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:02.080]   all the things that you're hoping to get done, both things that are actually deadline specific
[01:33:02.080 --> 01:33:06.720]   and things that are just sort of vague goals and sort of organize them into here's the stuff that
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:11.360]   I'm going to be doing today as opposed to someday. Here are the things I really want to get done by
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:15.440]   three. So please keep annoying me until I tap a button that says, yes, I've done that. Please
[01:33:15.440 --> 01:33:20.880]   dispose of this. So like I said, there are a lot of tutors, a lot of organizers. Very few of them
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:26.800]   are the one that's best keyed into the way that a tutu list manager is going to work for me.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:31.840]   And the way that it's keyed into times and days and calendars really makes it very, very useful for
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:37.200]   me. So it's also it's free in its multi platform. Yeah, I can care. I use it and I love it. I really
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:42.480]   like the new review thing. That's just a great addition. Yeah. And it's as I said, and the great
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:46.400]   thing is that you kind of want to get you kind of want to worry about using something that's only
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:51.520]   available on one platform, because ideally, if this works great for you, you're never going to
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:56.480]   want to do without it. And you would hate to have to stick to one device because, oh, well, I can't
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:02.960]   do without any do. So I'm going to have to stick with my I'm going to stick with my blackberry curve
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:09.120]   because I can't. Now, only device that runs it on iOS on the Android, it syncs with Google tasks,
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:12.960]   which is nice because that gives me a central repository. What does does it work with the
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:18.320]   Apple's reminders or is it just use Google? It will it will link into your calendars and your
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:23.120]   contacts and you can also sync the result. Any dot do service, right? Yeah. Okay. That's cool. So
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:27.200]   again, you can do it. It's not just tomorrow. Oh, the hippie. Oh, how about tomorrow? How about
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:32.720]   someday? You can say that the second Wednesday of every month is the day that we have curbside
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:37.280]   recycling. So the night before, please remind me to get the recycling bin out. And we'll just take
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:42.080]   care of that until the second coming of Jesus Christ. Any dot do it's hard to find. You got to make
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:47.440]   sure you type it right. And why period do and you'll find it then. Jason Snell, you're picking the
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.440]   week and if it's stick man golf, you're in trouble. It's not guys are already really mad at me. But
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:54.560]   it is an iPhone app and I can show it here. I think we've got the magic. Do we have a magic camera
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:59.600]   that over the show and above and sees the backs of our heads? I don't know. It's called these all
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.600]   know's all right. It's called forecast and see I've got it here on my iPhone. I'm going to tap the
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.080]   button and the app loads and it's a it's a weather app and you're saying to yourself, why is a weather
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:15.040]   app that interesting? It is kind of a beautiful design. It's got the little slidey box to let you
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:22.240]   pick what what your location wants to be. But what's really cool about it and I can look like here's
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:27.920]   the here's the next week forecast and I can drill down and it's got like a little it's got a little
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.120]   and it's very pretty from the guys who did the dark sky app. I love dark sky which lets you see
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:38.400]   when the rain is coming. It's got it's got these beautiful maps. Here's the thing about forecast.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:46.400]   It's back in 2007 when they introduced the iPhone. They were kind of yelled at for saying that
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:51.360]   web apps were a sweet solution for developers and nobody needed to develop real apps because
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:59.680]   they could just use web apps. Well, it took what you know six years forecast is a web app. It looks
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:05.360]   it looks like a native app. You're at forecast.io or it's forecast.io. There's also a you know can
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.080]   you can load it in your browser. But if you load on your iPhone and save it it says save this to
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:15.200]   your desktop. And then when you load it it is you can't tell that it's not a native app. There's
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.320]   no like if you scroll up it just it does a scroll to reload. It doesn't bring up a browser bar or
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:25.520]   anything. And it's a really nice app too. But I love the fact that this is all happening with HTML
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:29.840]   5. And we have finally reached the point where somebody very clever could build a beautiful app
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:34.960]   like this. And it's not in the app store. You just go to forecast.io. It's so IOSC with the
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.800]   sliding and all of that stuff. Oh yeah, it's got all the tricks. Yeah, it feels like a native app.
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:44.880]   Yeah. Well, the slidey thing is kind of more like Windows phone, isn't it? We see we see so many
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:49.680]   we I'm seeing some that that can seat in so many apps now where instead of having drilled down into
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.080]   a settings bar, let's just have you slide off to the left or slide off to the right to bring in a
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:58.560]   panel. Apple's done some of that too. So it kind of goes and it's got the pull to refresh,
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:03.120]   which is all Lauren Bricter too. Right. There's a lot of Lauren Bricter in there. Yeah. In design
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.240]   circles, they call that the hamburger and the basement. So you have a hamburger for the menu
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:09.600]   button and you throw a bunch of junk into the basement because you don't know where to put it.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:13.440]   And Facebook was one of the first to do that and the Gmail app for iOS was one of the first to do
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:18.800]   that. And now everybody's doing it. It's the hot thing in design. And the booger pull. Yeah, sure.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.360]   Well, look, it's a hash. All right. That's the hamburger in the basement. You just
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:30.320]   saw right there. Yeah, when we don't have a show, my screen, show my screen. This is how it looks
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:34.880]   on on IE. I mean, it's just it's equally beautiful. So interesting thing is that for as much as people
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:38.960]   give Apple grief about web apps and openness, they always said that HTML5 was their second
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:44.000]   developer platform and they made web.app so that you could have icons on the home screen and they'd
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:47.760]   be equal citizens and they provide tremendous support for those kind of apps. And here's a great
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:54.080]   example of it. It took a while, but this is this is an immaculate to be fair. That was an Apple's
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.320]   doing that was the HTML5 standards we were doing and also a lot of independent developers
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:03.120]   creating their own kits that you can simply put it. You can these whole libraries for building
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:07.840]   web apps that are going to work great for and how many apps or if you if you want the weather,
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:12.000]   chances are you don't want to cash the weather from yesterday. You're probably going to be connected
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:19.840]   online anyway. For weather. Exactly. Came over vacation. I want to replay every day that I missed.
[01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:25.200]   It'll do that. It'll play back your your weather radar for the past week and then
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.240]   there you go. What did I make for the future? That's where my roof went.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:33.840]   Fear of missing out my weather. So my tips are something that you I'm going to refer you back
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:39.040]   to our last week's know how where I took a Mac Pro and tried to bring it to the 21st century.
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.920]   Actually, it's what it was the most recent Mac Pro, which came out in the summer of 2010. So
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:47.760]   it's almost three years old now. And one of the things that was wrong with it was the video card
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:54.640]   was an old Radeon. What was it? I came remember 60 something. No, 5,000 series. 5,500. So I
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:39:00.320]   right when I decided to do this upgrade, the folks at Sapphire put out their Mac edition,
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:05.360]   the HD 7-950. I think I talked about this last week during the show. You're in trouble getting
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:10.480]   performance out. Well, I couldn't get a very good open GL benchmark numbers out of it. In fact,
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:14.880]   it seemed like it actually slowed the system down a little bit. I conferred with the folks at PC
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:18.880]   perspective, Ryan tried to really knows about benchmarking. And we concluded that it's Apple's
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:24.160]   Open GL stack, which is not very good. And in fact, to kind of give you the follow up on this,
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:31.040]   when I booted up into boot camp, I got twice the performance in Windows twice the performance.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.160]   So I think it really is an issue of Apple's Open GL drivers. That doesn't mean though you
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:38.880]   won't get benefit on Photoshop. Final cut. It just won't be in games that use Open GL that you'll
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.320]   see the benefit of that. It is expensive to $450. That's $50 more than the PC version. However,
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:49.440]   and you can use PC versions. Renee and I were talking about this last week. So I got a PC
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:53.680]   version of the car to order it. It came, but it doesn't come with the right connectors, right?
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:58.960]   There's no mini display port. There's no the power connectors are supposed to go to a PC power,
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:04.480]   supply not the Mac Pro. Now you can motherboard as the as this card. So I think it's worth getting
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.040]   spend 50 bucks more and getting the Mac edition. If you wanted a different card that's not made
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:15.040]   for the Mac, the drivers are in OS 10 10.8 now, which is good news, but you'll have to spend a
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:18.640]   little extra time getting the right dongles and connectors to make it work. I'm not going to
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:25.200]   fully recommend this, although I have to say running Bioshock infinite in Windows is great on this
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:29.840]   on my Mac Pro. If you're doing bootcamp on your Mac, bootcamp or final cut or Photoshop, whatever
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:34.480]   you'd get some benefit from this is about twice as fast. This I cannot hesitate to recommend.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.440]   It's expensive, but boy, is this great. This is from other world computing their Mercury
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:45.680]   Excelsior. It's a PCI Express based SSD, which means it goes on the PCI Express bus. I have never
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:51.840]   seen faster benchmarks in my life read and write speeds of about half a gigabyte per second.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:41:00.560]   Unbelievable. It's so satisfying. It literally is like a hot rod. These are
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:05.600]   socketed, these little connectors. So you could buy one that you could afford today, but then
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:11.680]   get new socketed memory upgrades later. They have a variety of sizes depending on your budget.
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:19.040]   I bought one that was able to hold my entire Mac installation, my OS 10 installation and all
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:24.880]   the apps I use. That was the 240 gig. That's about $479. So it's pricey, but my God. Now,
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.240]   I did not make a Fusion drive out of that after reading about all the problems we were having
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:31.440]   the Fusion drives. Besides, the Fusion drive would slow this down.
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:36.880]   Yeah, and you don't really need the Fusion drive if you're capable of managing files yourself.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:40.160]   It's fine. I can figure that out. It's more like for people who don't know where they
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:43.760]   sell files. They want a three terabyte hard drive. Alex, it was you who said,
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:47.760]   just put the card. You want them to be. That's a start. But man, once you go SSD,
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:50.560]   you will never get that. I get on my laptops with SSD.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:54.480]   You just get it. It's like a broadband. Yeah. We have we have a handful of our
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:59.680]   retinas have regular drives on them. You know, with a lot of them that are all SSD.
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:02.560]   And I opened it up and I was using one the other day and I was like,
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.600]   "What is wrong with this computer?" I was like, "We're going to send it in." And someone was like,
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.800]   "Oh, no, that doesn't have an SSD." I was like, "Oh, no, that doesn't have an SSD." I was like,
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:11.200]   "Oh, no, that doesn't have an SSD." I was like, "Oh, that's fine." Here's the the Blackmagic speed test.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:16.400]   I've never seen this. By the way, it's pegging the meters. So I don't, it could be faster than that.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.080]   It's just they couldn't measure. I don't know. It's a number not yet known to man.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:27.120]   It's so fast. I've never seen anything this fast. Highly recommend that. That's an upgrade under
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:31.360]   500 bucks that if you have an old Mac Pro and you just want to give it a little bit of life,
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.040]   that's that's enough to make you feel like, "Boy, this is a pretty fast computer." You know,
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:43.680]   it's this was a quad core dual core quad processor Xeon. It's in the Halem chip. It's a fast machine.
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:48.800]   Even though it's two and a half years old, putting an SSD on there really kind of sped it up.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:53.120]   Memory and hard drive speed are the two things that you could, the easiest, cheapest things to do
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:56.880]   to speed up. And it's easy to add memory to this. It's got four slots. I have eight gigs in it,
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:43:00.800]   but if I don't, to be honest, I don't feel like any more than eight gigs, maybe you do because of
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:05.600]   what you do. I think ours are kind of set up a 16-hour series to go over 16. Yeah.
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:10.400]   Easy to put another eight gigs in. It's got four, it's got two free slots. Get the SSD. That's the
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.320]   best thing. Now, the Sapphire is, if you're going to play games on the Windows side,
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:17.200]   it's going to make a difference. And if you're going to use Photoshop and you want fast
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:20.640]   Gaussian blurs, it's going to make a difference. Not sure I could recommend it, but at least I
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:24.560]   have a more modern machine. Yeah. I mean, and what we've done with some of the machines is to,
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:30.080]   yeah, again, an SSD to start up and then raid three other cheap drives to the other ones.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.960]   That's what I was going to do is take the old drives and raid them. You just rate them up.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:36.000]   Rate them up. And we rate them zero. And then we just, we call them... Scary raid.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:39.280]   That's what they're all called scary raid. Scary raid 14. Scary raid 11.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.560]   Right. You know, it's to remind everyone that, you know... These will die.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:47.120]   Oh, and I think we did we discuss the whole like when you go from mountain lion to...
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:56.400]   when you go from mountain lion up, you... When I read it, it lost the raid. So I had to back, I had
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:59.760]   to... Right. It was kind of... It was scary. You're going to lose scary. Scary. Scary.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:03.440]   And that's the other reason to do the fusion drive, because if you want to ever un-perum,
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:07.920]   you're going to lose everything. And there, I think fusion has other issues.
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:11.520]   You can't, for instance, doesn't... Still doesn't work with the fusion. Even though they said it
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:15.440]   does work now with three terabyte drives, I tried it on my iMac with Fusion and said,
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:20.080]   "No, we won't install Windows for you. Sorry. Can't do it." Fusion's a great idea. It's just,
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:24.080]   it's early, early yet. Apple, of course, doesn't support do it at yourself. Fusion. So,
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.600]   it's not hard to do. No, you can't do it yourself. It's easy to do it yourself. They just don't support
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:33.120]   it. And so, might not be worth the trouble. The genius will frown at you if you bring your Mac in
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:39.920]   with a Fusion drive on. It's Apple. It's a user-facing feature. Just think about how much faster that
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:45.760]   beach ball curse is going to spin once you're using Fusion or SSD. But, I mean, look at that.
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:51.680]   Does that not make you just... When you put your benchmark on there and it pegs the benchmark.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:59.520]   The benchmark goes to a level. Well, there's no difference between car tuners and PC tuners,
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:04.320]   because we just want to see that higher number. And then, if we finish it, we're awesome. We've
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:09.440]   tweeted the screenshot of the benchmark results. And then, we go back to work and we realize that
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:15.200]   I just spent $900 to make the cursor blink to make more instructions have between cursor blinks
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.640]   while I'm not writing something. And the people that are really benefiting from that are when
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:24.000]   you're throwing uncompressed HD up there that you're... The reason we were using... Let me just
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:30.160]   show you the before. That's the SATA drive before. On a Mac Pro.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.840]   And when you're talking about production for the people that actually need this kind of speed,
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:39.520]   we were doing compositing. The reason we were doing these machines is we had 100 green screenshots
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:44.160]   of people in the back of a car. And they have all these green screen. We have to remove it all.
[01:45:44.160 --> 01:45:48.000]   It's not hard, but it takes a long time to render. So, we're sitting there in motion with it looping
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.680]   from the hard drive in to RAM. And it's literally playing back in real time. And we're able to
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.600]   sit there and adjust all of our keys. That reduces the amount of time you work on it for
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:06.720]   by days, which of course pays off the project. It pays off the upgrades. So, the people who are
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:11.600]   buying these are other than the people that want to see their cursor go faster. Or people who are
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.480]   actually trying to run multiple... So, two or three streams of HD or four... And if you spend five or
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:23.440]   six grand on your Mac Pro... And Apple refuses to give you anything newer. A couple of 500 bucks
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:28.720]   and then they have the external ones. This is the external one for Thunderbolt.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:32.000]   So, you can now... So, I can buy one of them? Where do I get my thunderbolt on my Mac Pro?
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:37.520]   I don't know where I'm sitting. Oh, and by the way, one more laptop. We speculated that maybe
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:43.280]   I could run a thunderbolt display off the mini display port. No. No, cannot. And there's no way...
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:47.680]   It doesn't go that way. It doesn't go that way. It doesn't go that way. It doesn't go that way.
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:52.320]   You can use videos on it. You can plug mini display port into a thunderbolt port. You cannot
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.280]   plug a thunderbolt into a mini display port and have it do something.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:59.600]   Yeah. I thought I'm going to put my thunderbolt display and my LED
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:02.720]   cinnamon display on here and only one worked. Period.
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:08.160]   That's all right. It was just a thought. Just a thought. All right. Hey, what a great show.
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:12.160]   Thank you guys for being here. Mr. Renee Ritchie, imore.com. If you want the latest
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:17.440]   on Macintosh and everything all about it, it's always good to have you Renee. Do you have a nice
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.880]   time when you're visiting? Oh, it's fantastic. I always love being in the studio with you guys.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:24.160]   I love having you. I was just like being at Disneyland or something. Yeah. And you had a nice visit to
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:28.720]   the Bay Area. What were you here for? GDC? GDC, yes sir. Would you don't learn anything?
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:34.080]   Just that free to play is the future of video game. Yeah, no kidding. The game developers'
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.400]   conference is all about apps. Used to be about, you know, first person shooters. Now, what's
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:41.680]   interesting is that there was two really interesting things. First is that mobile is starting to
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:46.640]   eclipse console, which is interesting. And also that while everything is cross-platform and they're
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:50.880]   really platform agnostic, the developers themselves are all using iPads. That's what they showed the
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.280]   games off on. Really? Yeah, so our Android site was getting upset because they're like,
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:59.760]   we can't keep putting up these videos of iPads. I can't tell developers who are allowed to use.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:04.400]   Yeah, that's what they're using. That's why I use a fine Windows 8 machine.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:08.800]   That and I don't want to have any here by the end of the show. I want to just tear it all out.
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:15.600]   Mr. Alex Lindsey from Pixel Core. Nice to have you. It's good to be here. Keep up the good work.
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:19.520]   Nothing to say. Nothing to say. You know, I keep on posting stuff. The best thing to do is just
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.240]   find me on G+, or Twitter. Those are the two places that I really... Alex Lindsey or Alex
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:31.440]   Lindsey? S-A-Y. S-A-Y. Just Alex Lindsey. You're fine. S-A-L-N-Z. That's exactly right. Yes. Yes.
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:38.880]   Editorial Director at the Fabulous IDG for both Macworld and PCworld. He crosses the aisle easily,
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:42.640]   fluidly, simply without any trouble, Mr. Jason Snow. Always a pleasure.
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:46.800]   It's great to be here. Thank you for making the trip up. Always great. Yep. Andy Inako Chicago
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:53.600]   Sun Times, the Calvin and Hobbes of Macate Journalists. We did a great interview with Andy last week
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:58.560]   on our triangulation show, so watch it. I think it was episode 96. It's a must watch.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:03.760]   Twitter.tv/TRI. If you want to see... We had a real Oprah Lance Armstrong thing going on there.
[01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:07.520]   It was beautifully captured. We captured a little bit of magic. I think of more of his Oprah and Tom
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:11.840]   Cruz. Andy jump on the couch. Yeah. When he jumped up on the couch. That was a moment.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:14.560]   That's my own couch. I got to clean those damn cushions.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:20.720]   Great to have you all. We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday, 11am Pacific, 2pm Eastern Time,
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:25.600]   1800 UTC on Twitter.tv. I hope you'll watch live. Our chatroom is a big part of the show. We
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:30.160]   love having you here. But if you can't on-demand audio and video are available after the fact of
