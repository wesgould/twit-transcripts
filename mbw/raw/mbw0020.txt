[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.080]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 20 for December 19, 2006.

[00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:52.960]   It is time to convene the panel of great big brains for Mac
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.240]   Break Weekly, number 14.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.000]   I'm Leo LaPort. Scott Borne is here from his hotel room.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.480]   Yes.
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.760]   Where are you?
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.320]   I'm in the gig harbor.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.480]   We've had a major storm in the Seattle area,
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.640]   one million people without power, including me.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.000]   So I don't have my regular mic.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.240]   I don't have my regular stuff.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.040]   But I'm with my buddies, so I don't care.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.440]   So was the gig harbor plan or was it because of the power
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.240]   outage?
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640]   It was because of the power outage.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.480]   So you're staying in a hotel to just see you have services?
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.200]   I'm staying in a hotel so I can be on this podcast.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.040]   Oh, you're a nice guy.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.880]   Yes, I'm excited.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.080]   The power is still out in Seattle.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.000]   Well, for a million people it is.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.240]   Wow, that was a bad one.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.120]   We had Hurricane Force winds here.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.920]   Wow.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.440]   Has that happened before?
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.080]   About 200 years ago.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.840]   Oh my goodness.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.600]   I mean, it's really weird.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.080]   You drive down the street and the Seattle's got a lot of trees.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.720]   So these 200 feet tall trees just laying across power lines.
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.320]   And these fools are driving underneath them like,
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.880]   well, that probably won't fall.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.160]   Wow, geez.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.880]   That other voice is Alex Lindsey of the Pixel Corps.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.960]   And he is in his Pixel Corps offices in San Francisco.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.880]   Hey, Alex.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.600]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.320]   Good.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.160]   Merlin Mann is also here.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.040]   Mr. Hot Dog's ladies.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.840]   He is here.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.960]   I love his Sky panel.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.400]   Oh, you weren't supposed to say that.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.520]   Oh, Mr. Frankfurt ladies.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.240]   Yes, that's right, ladies.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.600]   It's it.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.240]   Frankfurt's got that international flavor.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.160]   He is, of course, with 43 folders.com and everybody's favorite
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.440]   productivity guru just spent a both Alex and Merlin just spent
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.440]   time with me in Toronto doing call for help.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.240]   We got to get you up there, Scott.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   It was bombing.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.160]   It was bombing in Toronto.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.880]   It was warmer there.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.400]   I'm freezing my butt off here.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   It's 34 degrees in Petaloma.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.560]   Thirty minutes.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.720]   We had hard frost.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.280]   I mean, there was an inch of ice on my windshield.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.400]   That's why I was a little late getting here because I had a I had a I
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.080]   don't have a scraper like you people do.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.840]   We people.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   You people.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.280]   I got to warn you, I've got the Skype lie detector on today.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.040]   So everything you say I will be testing.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.320]   You know that Skype lie detector?
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.320]   It's called.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.320]   I was so close to adding that just for this call.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.880]   The Kish Kish lie detector.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.880]   Is it really?
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.040]   I don't know.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.880]   How can you tell somebody's stressed when they're on Skype?
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.040]   Everybody sounds stressed on.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.000]   I love making changes to my windows registry.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   That really did work.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   Wow.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.480]   Should I install should I put turn it on?
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.360]   No, I don't want to do that.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   You can.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.520]   You know, why is it that we always have to experiment with our technology during a
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   podcast?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.280]   Wow, that's why we're doing this show.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.280]   That's our way.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.480]   We're thinking of a new name for the podcast.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.440]   We're going to call it the 80D round table.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   That's right.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.440]   Thanks.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   That's Merlin.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.080]   Merlin, I you know, I thought Amber was the most 80 person I've ever met.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.240]   Then I thought Alex was the most 80 person I ever met.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.440]   Then I spent some time with Merlin man.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.000]   And now I know he's the most 80D person.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Oh, come on.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.240]   Alex and Amber are so much worse than me.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.720]   We're all bad too.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.520]   I think that's one of the requirements of being in radio.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.520]   Well, I'm trying to--
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.880]   Amber's like a hummingbird with a laptop.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.880]   She is.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.920]   She clicks from pedal to pedal.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.080]   I'm trying to figure out why it is.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.640]   Is it that this, the tech industry attracts this type or that it turns us into 80D folk?
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.640]   I think it's both.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.600]   I think there's are, I think a lot of people who are, you know, have these problems don't
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.200]   go into cognitive psychology and customer service.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.480]   I think they go into a place where they can have lots of things to stimulate them.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.840]   And then they overstimulate themselves because of the unlimited number of ways that they
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.320]   can bring that on themselves.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.720]   Yeah, I pretty much been this way in my entire life.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   I wasn't listening.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.720]   I just was booting my windows laptop.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.480]   I was like, I'm going to help.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   Something else.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.960]   He was, he was, he was, he was 80D.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960]   What were we were 80D?
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   All right.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.960]   So, okay.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.960]   Show of hands.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   How many people hate gizmodo?
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]   I mean, yeah.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]   I hate gizmodo.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   So you were gullible.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.000]   No, that's not gullible.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.240]   That's, they should know better than that.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.720]   I think gizmodo deserves a spanking.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:02.000]   So gizmodo on last Thursday, short, you know, blind item, which I hate anyway, says gizmodo
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.800]   knows iPhone will be announced on Monday.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   Brian Lam writes, I guarantee it.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.160]   Isn't what I expected at all.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.520]   And I've already said too much.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.240]   Now, I'm sure everybody, including Mr. Scott Bourne, who has been salivating around this
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.520]   for years, thought that it was going to be, did you think it was going to be the Apple
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.240]   iPhone, Scott?
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.360]   Absolutely not.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   You knew better.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.080]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.200]   Because I already knew, because I know how to do research, that iPhone was not a trademark
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.680]   that Apple could have.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.160]   It's already belonged to Cisco.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.080]   So I knew this was some kind of gag.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.080]   Well, you were right.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.080]   It is from Cisco.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.320]   So links is iPhone.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.280]   I thought it wasn't the iPhone, but I was glad to see all the conversation about it, because
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.360]   then I couldn't get dinged for bringing it up first.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.400]   I think that that's really cheesy of gizmodo.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.200]   I thought it was the journalistic equivalent of winning a bar bet.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.400]   You know, it was okay.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.880]   It was truthful.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.400]   And like, I got to buy you a drink now, but you're kind of a tool, you know?
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   I just, it's nothing.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.920]   Nothing against Brian Lam, but I mean, I think, yeah, something against Brian Lam.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.280]   I don't know the guy, but I was disappointed because I think I think it could be a good
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.120]   I don't know, fanboy stuff aside.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.240]   I think that that's something that it was, it was pretty clear what that was intended
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.240]   to do.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.640]   And that's why I think it reminds you of a bar bet.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   You know, you're going to do it.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.600]   You think you know what it's going to be and then yeah, exactly.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   So only Scott was smart enough to check the trademarks.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.480]   Of course, it makes sense because Apple has never called it the iPhone.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.200]   It's only what all of us have called it.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.560]   Apple's never said a word about iPhone.
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   That's our code name.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   Right.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.360]   But you know, I'm glad you brought this up, Leo, because I have an idea and I want everybody's
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.800]   help with it.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.240]   I want to get all the listeners to start an email campaign to Apple to suggest that during
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.840]   the keynote jobs call me up on stage as the largest potential iPhone fan to help him demo
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.920]   the product as we introduce it to the world.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.720]   I think you should single you out.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720]   Yes.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   You should say, right?
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.880]   We're going to do this until Scott born harassed us into it.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.280]   So we want to start a letter writing campaign.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.920]   I want to be up on stage with Steve.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.880]   I'll even wear jeans and a black t-shirt if I have to.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.720]   So just to complete the circle here, this is a linksus phone.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.040]   It is a voice over IP.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.040]   It's one of them.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.320]   They've already shipped three million VoIP phones.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.960]   So it's nothing new.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.440]   It's just another phone for voice over IP.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.440]   Big deal.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.600]   So you don't think this is just kind of a funny, I mean, like just to be contradictory,
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.960]   that it's just a funny way to have fun with fanboys.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.080]   You don't see it as just being kind of a way to drive traffic to your site.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.080]   Get a lot of attention.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.640]   Get a lot of mentions in the press.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.880]   I think you're right with a barbed.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.560]   I think it's a trick and I think it's bad journalism.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.000]   It's the kind of thing that John does all the time when he says, "Windows is going to
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   buy Apple."
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.160]   No, it's worse than that.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   Can you see any mainstream journalistic entity doing that?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   No.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.560]   And what it does is it paints these, you know, paints his motto as being kind of somewhat
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.800]   less than journalistic.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.280]   Well, this is the...
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.120]   That's why they are mainstream journalism.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.920]   Well, that's why you always get kind of short-shifted when you talk to mainstream journalism and
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.920]   why companies...
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.760]   That's what we're trying to get out of this, right?
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.960]   That's why we have to be careful and we have to really think about ourselves more operating
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.600]   with the same level.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.800]   I think we have to take the Time magazine that was intended for the Gizmodo people away
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.920]   from them so they can't see themselves in the mirror.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.000]   They don't belong in that Time magazine.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.760]   That's exactly what you guys think about the idea that this might just be a...
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.200]   No, not just, but in part this could be a bargaining position where Apple could come
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.360]   in and negotiate some kind of a deal with them to use a name like that.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.000]   What do you think they'll just use something different?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.720]   I don't think they ever wanted to call it the iPhone.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.160]   That was just something we made up.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.200]   What would they call it?
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.520]   Well I'm not allowed to say because I know.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:37.520]   What?
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.520]   Well I got it.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.440]   I have secret information which I cannot divulge.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.440]   Why not?
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.440]   Well, you can't say that.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.440]   But we don't know what we got.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.440]   Not them all did.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.600]   Come on now.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.320]   I got, you know, people...
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.840]   Because we've got this thing going, there are people deep within the bowels of Apple
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.480]   who, you know, I believe it was them.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.360]   I can't prove it was them who have sent me stuff and it could be completely bold.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.520]   You don't want to get anybody fired because you know the name.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.520]   No.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.400]   Give us a hint.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.960]   Well it's related to something you probably carry in your pocket.
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.440]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.440]   Switchblade.
[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.640]   An iPod.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.480]   I'm not saying a Switchblade.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.480]   It's the Switchblade.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   That's good Merlin.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.480]   That's very nice.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   Butterfly knife.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   He lives in San Francisco.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480]   He's got it.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.480]   You know when you're out in the avenues you got to have a Switchblade.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.240]   Yeah, I think Switchblade was actually their second choice Merlin.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.880]   Wouldn't that be a good name for a phone though?
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880]   A Switchblade.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:25.880]   That would be a great name for a...
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880]   Well they got Razer, you know.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.880]   No, it's a Switchblade.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.800]   Has anybody called a phone the blade?
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   That would be a Switchblade.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   It would be such a good name.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   You know what?
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   Apple should...
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   Let's trademark that.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.240]   Yeah, let's get going.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   I like it.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.240]   I'm opening up right now.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.080]   Okay Scott, is the name they have as good as Switchblade?
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.080]   No.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.320]   Absolutely not.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.240]   It's the Podphone.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   The Pafonod.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:53.160]   I can say no more because I do not want to jeopardize my chance to stand on the stage
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.160]   with Steve.
[00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.840]   I think the people who allegedly talked to you already going to get Steve.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:00.080]   They're going to get Steve right out of you.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.560]   It's too late, they know.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.620]   They don't you think they look at all the email and they probably have little beepers
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.620]   in your pockets and...
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.880]   You know what they did?
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.240]   They gave everybody that iPod Nike thing?
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.400]   Because you know you could track people with that.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.960]   Did you see that?
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.960]   I did, yeah.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   You can...
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.560]   The iPod Nike transmitter that you put in your shoe so that you can listen to your
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.760]   nano and keep track of your footsteps and stuff.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.800]   Actually transmits its unique ID all the time unless you turn it off which nobody does.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:32.600]   So with a sufficient antenna, broadcast it for several hundred feet anyway with a sufficient
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.400]   antenna you could track people and you could find out where they live by you know because
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   they come home.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.840]   So that means if you follow someone a hundred feet behind you'll know exactly where they
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.840]   are.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.840]   Yeah exactly.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   No.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.840]   What you have to do is put receivers all over town.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.840]   Is it RFID or...?
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.800]   I think it's RFID yeah.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.880]   And it must have a Bluetooth as well or some other kind of Bluetooth like component because
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.960]   it does communicate a little bit with the iPod dongle.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.680]   You know the RFID technology in general is just amazing.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.800]   We have a pixxical member who does a lot of that research and he can tell you in real
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:10.040]   time where a box is in a warehouse within six inches at a 400,000 square feet with an
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.360]   active RFID you know.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.720]   So when we look at this stuff it's really a technology that's both really cool and also
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.000]   a little frightening.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.560]   So Kevin Rose was the one who said that he knew all about the iPhone.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.640]   Do you think Scott knowing what you know, I'm really trying to triangulate this, that
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.160]   Kevin was anywhere accurate?
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.640]   Well here's the thing you know I believe that there's no way to know what I know is actually
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.120]   true because people could have been sending me these things to put me off the scent.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.240]   They were all sent you know in a way that I can't track where they came from.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.960]   They used one of those services that moves your IP to Europe or something.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:52.520]   So who knows but I do believe that the information that Kevin has put out does somewhat triangulate
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.440]   with what I've been told.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.960]   I'm going to use the word somewhat.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:03.360]   Hey you know speaking of Kevin they've redesigned DIG quite a bit.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.840]   It now has podcast stuff so everybody should go and dig our podcast.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.000]   Yeah because we're not let's see at the top part on one.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.280]   Guess what the top podcast is just take a wild guess just a dignity.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:19.160]   Oh yeah but this week attack is next then DLTV then the broken Tiki bars if that's the
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.360]   first one that's not you know Kevin affiliated podcast.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   Strong bad is in there.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.040]   Pixel perfect that's Kevin C net buzz out.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   Let Martin started.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.360]   Hey I don't see us in here.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.880]   Let's find Mac break weekly.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   I'm going to.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.160]   I don't think we have we submitted it.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.800]   I do have to I mean do you have to.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.120]   What's cool is when you drill down into a specific podcast to show you the number of
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.960]   DIGs per looks like per permalink item which is kind of cool.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   We're not in there.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.600]   Oh and by the way they've got an ad for dignity.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.560]   So that's kind of that's bad.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.960]   That's really bad.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.160]   I think we'll never be dignity.
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.680]   I'm surprised Twitt's doing as well as it is.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.760]   Oh yeah look it has all the episodes and you can dig the different episodes.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.160]   That's quite clever.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:07.040]   I'm a little mad at Kevin because David Prager was on Twitter last night and I got an emergency
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.240]   call because David kind of intimated that something was going on but said nothing.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.440]   An emergency call from Kevin and Jay and David say take it out.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.440]   Take it out.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.440]   You got him.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.440]   Bar goes.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440]   He didn't say anything.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.760]   I mean he just said there's something coming.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.840]   Anyway thanks for the scoop guys.
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.440]   Good thing you got a good relationship with these kids.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.400]   Yeah I don't know.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.640]   So now they got news.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.640]   They got videos.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.640]   They got podcasts.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.640]   I think that's a good move on their part actually to add.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.520]   It's just it's a much better use of the real estate.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.080]   I'm trying to visually remember what the other one looked like.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.080]   It's much nicer.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.080]   This is much.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:46.360]   The page a lot nicer and it compresses a lot of the kind of primary and secondary navigation
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.360]   up into the top.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   That's right.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   They used to have that all in the sidebar.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.280]   Now it's tabs at top which is exactly how it should be.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.440]   If you're a casual dig user I mean I'm not a power user dig by any means but I like the
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.480]   idea of having these areas exposed to kind of encourages you to explore and go around
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.800]   and try different things.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.480]   There's a significant flaw in dig.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.560]   I'm starting to realize having submitted I'd never submitted stories before when the James
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.600]   Kim story was out I tried to submit a story because I want I mean I don't normally try
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.960]   to curry the publicity of getting dug but I thought everybody should know about it.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.720]   And the problem is I don't know if you guys have ever tried this but you submit a story
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.960]   it goes to an upcoming stories page where it falls off the front page within minutes.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   Oh yeah.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.480]   So I think the only way you could really get a story up on dig is if you're one of the
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.840]   people that everybody's watching you know I'm saying it's totally self-reinforcing.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.280]   There's too many stories being submitted for it to be truly democratic.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.720]   Does that make sense?
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.480]   Well I think it's one of those things where you find out quickly that nothing actually
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   works the way you think it should.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.520]   I mean I remember back in the day in the mid 90s we were trying to come up with systems
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.760]   similar to this.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.000]   We were trying to track where people were going on the web and we asked them to fill
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.880]   out these forms and we did very expensive focus groups costing tens of thousands of
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.400]   dollars.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.000]   We were building a client with CMP media that was going to do something like this in 96
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.120]   and people would say well I visit the National Geographic homepage and I do this and I do
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.520]   this and I do this and then you go find out they really spend all their time at Playboy.com.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   So I mean you know.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.360]   Well people always lie about what they really do.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.000]   You can't ask them.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   That's the truth.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   We know that.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.160]   But see when they dig they're doing the same thing they're saying I like this story.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.840]   It doesn't mean they've ever read it.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.640]   Does it mean you know they want to look cool.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.560]   So if that's the cool story they're going to dig it even though they don't know anything
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   about it having read it.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.760]   I think the whole idea is very good in terms of its intent.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.080]   I just don't think it can be accomplished the way that they're doing it.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.600]   Well and by the way they've set this up I can't submit Mac break weekly so that sucks
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   too.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   Why can't you?
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   It won't accept the URL I'm giving.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   That's interesting.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   Because it doesn't have a closing slash.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.200]   Because it doesn't have an .xml I think but let me try it again with the XML which is
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.680]   not the you know when we do our podcast we do a redirect because we may move it to a
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:11.040]   different server or whatever so normally the URL is Leo.am/podcasts/mbw it won't accept
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   that.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   How about Twitch/mbw?
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.920]   Well somebody must have put that obviously they seeded some of those.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.880]   Let me put the XML and see if it accepts the XML.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.680]   No this thing sucks.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   I think that.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.720]   And if it may not that's going to really help our dig store really quite a bit.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.720]   It's in beta.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.720]   It's in beta.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   It's in beta.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:35.080]   Alright you have entered the URL for an invalid feed.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   Oh forget it.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   Just forget it.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.080]   Your guys thank.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.520]   One thing I think dig is good for what it is but I mean it's very very popular and very
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.800]   very big and that's just in the service of saying I think something like dig if you look
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.480]   at the open source plug which is a dig clone the idea of having like a localized dig just
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.440]   for a certain topic I think is a terrific idea.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   Yeah that's what you're doing.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.160]   That's something I'm actually something I'm trying to get up on 43 folders right now.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160]   And I've seen other folks doing.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.560]   So I mean having like a if you have this affinity group of a thousand people that are really
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.880]   into something I could see it being very powerful.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.880]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.400]   Let's look at dig for what it is which is a site that tells you what's popular among
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.800]   people who use dig.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.640]   And I think in that sense it's successful.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.200]   You know is it a great place to always find you know the top stories well maybe maybe
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.800]   not it's if you like Apple stuff and you like dig you're going to find all the top stories.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.280]   Well that's what I like about slash dot is they did that early on they got more granular.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:27.080]   There's an you know there's max slash and that's so they and that you I agree with you.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.400]   I think in some sense that that makes more sense.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.200]   Well if anybody's out there what I'm looking for and this is something I've actually gotten
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.840]   close to hiring someone to do.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.960]   I get way too many submissions on 43 folders than I could ever deal with.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.280]   And what I want to do is just open source that basically say if you have a story and
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.440]   this I mentioned here because I think it's good for lots of sites.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.240]   It would be great for Twitter to be great for us to really make it easy to say well
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.880]   you know anybody who wants to submit a story submit a story it goes into the queue all
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:52.680]   the other users on it.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.040]   And then what what's the part that's missing I think I haven't seen this done real well
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.280]   yet there's a WordPress plugin but I'd love to see a way to automatically promote the
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.600]   top story of the day of the week or the month.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.280]   And that's that's then that would be the cool thing some kind of XML RPC thing that would
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.800]   automatically promote that as a full post.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.200]   We are going to we're actually embarked yet again in a twit site redesign because Drupal
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.840]   5 is on its way and Drupal 5 is a significant change in Drupal with lots of nice new features
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.240]   including I think the kinds of features you're talking about.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.800]   And so I've gone to Lullabot and said okay time to spend some more money let's move this
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.080]   thing to Drupal 5.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:31.160]   There's some support for open source open search there's a lot of really neat things
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.160]   in Drupal 5.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.160]   Amazing how fast that application has.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.040]   I think it's it's really the best.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   It's all.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.680]   I mean you're in this business I think it's the best open source CMS out there now.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:48.760]   I agree I mean I've been playing around with these since I guess you know post nuke.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:54.560]   And so you know PHP nuke you know geek was a geek tool I tried all of them and this is
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.120]   the one that I've just seen the fastest development is the first one of these that I feel really
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.680]   comfortable going out and saying to clients clients I'm not really doing this work much
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.960]   anymore but good saying to people you know if you really need a quick shake and be excited
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.480]   like this this is the way to go and it's usable.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.520]   We're getting a little off track on the Mac let's talk a little bit about iTunes sales
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.760]   you probably last week I wasn't here for last week talked about the fact that iTunes sales
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.760]   were plummeting.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.280]   Yeah we did talk about that.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.280]   Well they're not.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.280]   Yeah exactly.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:25.520]   So Forrester said they were plummeting and Forrester's always right.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:31.640]   Well now I'm on Forrester.com and it says iTunes sales are not plummeting press credibility
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:40.920]   on the other hand turns out that the press aka us misunderstood what he was saying.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.920]   He's actually a little a little miffed.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.480]   Oh right.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.360]   This is he blogged the highlights.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.880]   New York Times he said ran a fairly a little fairly balanced piece on the research then
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.520]   a UK outfit called the register oh known for their credibility decided to dive in and
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.000]   highlight one finding of the report that iTunes sales had dropped in the first six months
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.960]   of this year we got treated to wonderful headlines about iTunes sales collapsing dropping plummeting.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.480]   Now for the record this is Forrester the same people who everybody's quoting iTunes sales
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.480]   are not collapsing.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.720]   I Apple I should point out never releases this information this is all kind of voodoo fairy
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:24.680]   dust people are you know for figuring out you know from other stuff for instance their
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.120]   credit card transaction data does show a drop between the January post holiday peak and the
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.760]   rest of the year but with the number of transactions we counted he says it's simply not possible
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.520]   to draw this conclusion as we pointed out in the report I guess you know we didn't read
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.400]   the report so we just we just I did did you.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.440]   Yeah I read all these reports and that's the problem with all of the reports.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.920]   All of this stuff that's actually the problem with dig and some of these other things there's
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.080]   an echo chamber that gets built around one faulty headline.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.360]   The headline is the is what everybody reads.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.680]   Yeah yeah you know nobody buys these reports but me so I mean you know they cost hundreds
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.440]   of dollars but I have a subscription to a lot of this stuff so I get all these reports
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.920]   because I use it as investment information and I look at this stuff and I I read the whole
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.520]   story and instantly knew that the conclusions in the story didn't match the headlines but
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:14.720]   I also do believe there's some stuff in the research that's wrong anyway.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.720]   Well I apologize then did you tell us all that last week because I haven't heard Mac
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   Break Weekly.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.360]   I think I covered a little bit but you know bottom line is it's you know I get a kick
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.000]   out of Forrester because I still go back to the day when I launched net radio and we did
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.600]   the IPO and Forrester said well you know the internet's going to be over in about a week.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.440]   I don't like these analysts in general but in any way he says you can't unring the bell
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.840]   Apple stock by the way dropped 3% because of this report this is how you know volatile
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.140]   this area is.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:44.520]   I will try to focus you on the truth here which is this.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:50.040]   iTunes sales are leveling off he says Apple is not in trouble it makes its money mostly
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.480]   from iPods iTunes and I think we've all said that iTunes is a loss leader that sells iPods
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.280]   right I mean it's hard for them to make money unless you buy a lot because of the credit
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.680]   card charges.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:08.080]   Yeah it's it really I mean they're making a penny each if they're not losing money.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.240]   They're just barely scraping out any kind of you buy onesies two z's your cost and Apple
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   money probably.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.440]   Given the one you'll notice you'll one of the things you'll notice when you buy from
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.280]   iTunes is a lot of times it won't invoice you doesn't charge your credit card immediately
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.240]   so you don't get that receipt because what they're hoping that you're going to buy a
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.920]   couple more because their minimum transaction is 25 cents so if you buy three or four over
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.200]   a week they'll they'll charge them all at one time and that saves them a lot of money.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.000]   You just do the math and you realize it's costing Apple a lot of money.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.480]   First of all we don't know but we think that the cut to the record companies is close to
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.800]   60 percent right.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   Something in that range.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.200]   So let's say 60 cents on the dollar they pay very steep Akama fees for the downloads.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.800]   So let's say 25 cents and then 25 cents for the credit card they just lost 10 cents on
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   that sale.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:58.320]   Yeah and I'm guessing that they're actually that however that all sorts out they are
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.000]   breaking even but I think that if they're breaking even it's by a razor thread.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.320]   I don't think they're losing money on every song that would be probably unsustainable
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.960]   but but I bet you they're not making anything on it.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:13.200]   Anything significant but of course they're making plenty on those $23 iPods they sell
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   for $2.99.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.320]   Right yeah no they're doing real well on that.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   Well and I have all of them.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.560]   Josh Burnoff goes on in his farster blog post to say it's not Apple's not in trouble.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.160]   It's the music industry that has to worry since the billion dollars a year or so from
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.320]   iTunes globally doesn't nearly make up for the drop in CD sales in the US alone down
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.160]   two and a half billion dollars from where they were.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:39.200]   And I still think as you as you see the music industry really trying to renegotiate with
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.240]   Apple as you see all this stuff pushing I still think Apple is moving towards a vertical
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.640]   market where the producers are all using their software the the distribution is going
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.560]   through their model and there's just it's just a point there's a there's a there's going
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:55.680]   to be a point in time where it just doesn't make sense to go through the middleman which
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:01.000]   is the record industry to you know to sell your goods and I think that's the that's
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.200]   what they have to be that's what they should most regardless of what their sales are right
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.000]   now that's what they should be concerned about.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.120]   You know we're on you know GarageBand you can make some really good stuff or you move up
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:15.120]   to logic or everything else you can put together some really really great music and the key
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.760]   is what iTunes I don't think is very good at right now is promoting stuff that isn't
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.720]   really really big right you know once you fall off the top 10 or the top 100 of any list
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:30.480]   whether it's whether it's TV shows or whether it's podcasts or whether it's individual songs
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.760]   it's very hard to find it.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:37.640]   Well I think if you look at peer to peer subscriptions or whatever I guess the number of people
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.000]   on the peer to peer networks it's been growing very steadily I think people are still stealing
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.280]   music and greater numbers than ever before.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.720]   Well I think they're just tired again I mean everyone knows they're getting screwed by
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.440]   the music industry so the thing is in a way I think a music industry is screwing itself
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:56.080]   but by really antagonizing it's potential customers it gives them it gives people a reason to
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.200]   steal it's like well those guys are jerks so I'm just going to continue to steal it's
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   when you're firing.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.600]   When you're taking a 44 cent CD and selling it for $18 it's just insulting yeah and I think
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:09.440]   people are people just get tired of it and they don't feel like they owe the industry
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.080]   anything they know that the band isn't going to get a whole lot of this you know anyway
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.720]   now the thing is is that the bands need to realize that the best way to get out of this
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.640]   eventually is just to go directly to selling it themselves not trying to go through you
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.600]   know that's the only way they're going to really get any kind of money.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.400]   I don't think there's any incentive to buy a CD for 18 bucks which by the way three quarters
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:36.480]   of the songs on it you don't want and the music business seems to just get money.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.120]   Scott's kind of having a little you're breaking up a little bit aren't you a wifi Scott or
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.120]   are you unawired?
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.120]   I'm on a wired connection but it could be the hotels band with is minimal.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.120]   All the businessmen just woke up.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.520]   I think it's really interesting to look at somebody like Jonathan Colton the guy who
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.600]   plays with John Hodgman.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.080]   He's just seems like he's got a really smart approach to this he starts out he said he's
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.160]   going to write a song a week for a year he puts all that into a podcast he pushes all
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.520]   that out through iTunes he gets this huge amount of people downloading I mean his song Web
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.480]   Monkey's been downloaded I don't know how many million times and then all the you know
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.360]   the Ricky Gervais podcast then it becomes something that later on if you miss the podcast
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.920]   you can go and then buy on the iTunes store so I mean is that working for him do you know?
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.560]   yeah he's making a living off he's not coding anymore that's fantastic and that's to me
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.960]   that's that's you know I don't know if that's sustainable I mean part of it is like we talked
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:28.760]   about this before but it's part of it is the false economy of this industry that's had
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.640]   its way for 80 years and then expecting everything to be like sheet music and so maybe it's
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:39.280]   not going to it's like piano rose we did well in piano rose.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.160]   and it's amazing how much of the infrastructure is still based on that those assumptions yeah
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.520]   it's it is it requires this this legal protection of this you know relatively scarce physical
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.520]   product anyway I just think there are people like Brad Socks people like Jonathan Colton
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.480]   who are really getting this right and are starting to understand that it starts with
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:00.400]   this relationship with the fans and then builds outward in concentric circles well you can
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.960]   see that also with like Peter Gabriel released his last he self released his last CD no it
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.920]   wasn't necessarily an all online thing but there was a lot of online support a lot of
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.640]   things that were behind the scenes of him putting together his last CD and we didn't
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.560]   hear a lot of it on the radio obviously because there wasn't a label pushing it all but it
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.440]   was a great CD and I'm sure he made even though he probably sold a tenth or of what
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:25.520]   he would normally sell through A&M records or whatever he probably made you know twice
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.560]   as much as he normally would make you know from his royalties and that's the I mean I
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.280]   think that's the thing and there's other bands that have been doing this for a long time
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.440]   you look at like and it and he DeFranco has been I don't think she's ever released anything
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.880]   from a major label label is that true really yeah yeah no I she she's she's a
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:44.480]   I'm pretty sure she's always been self published yeah yeah I see these of her but I guess she's
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.320]   able to get distribution yeah I mean you can get things yeah yeah so it's but I yeah but
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.640]   I don't think that you know and there's a lot more people that are slowly you know and
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.800]   you hear folks that are you know slowly talking about this and the big thing is eventually
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.920]   I think some of these big big bands you know the stings or the or the you two's or whatever
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.400]   will bolt you know and that's when the whole thing really falls apart and it could fall
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.840]   apart very quickly if a handful of really big ones decided that they that they would move
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:14.360]   off you know the system hey speaking of John Hodgman Microsoft's trying to do their version
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:21.200]   of the I'm a Mac I'm a PC ads have you seen this I'm a zoom I'm an iPod this just it
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:27.720]   just shows what Microsoft should not get in this business this is something that they
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.640]   actually showed at a conference so it's not let me play it I'll play the audio I mean
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.880]   you can't see the video but just you know just imagine there's a guy in a suit holding
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.640]   a zoom and there's a guy you know a t-shirt and a hoodie holding an iPod and that's pretty
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.720]   much the whole story let me let me play it for you here this is from zoom boards.com
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:55.840]   Hey I'm a Mac I'm a PC is a and what you doing over there I'm looking for that new rock
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:00.000]   on tour song my buddy's iPod have you heard that yet oh yeah I love that band no no no
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.400]   not affect I've got their new single right here in my zoom you want to listen to it I'll
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:07.400]   share with you. Oh hey watch where you're pointing that thing man my buddy's iPod is
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:13.320]   scratch as easily oh sorry it's just a quick my zoom and I can share songs and photos and
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:20.240]   videos with all my friends just as easy is clicking a button ah sorry yeah so well how
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.880]   do you get new songs oh just that easy first song I get a blank sheet of paper I write down
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:30.880]   the name of the song the name of the band rock on how do you spell rock on tours whatever
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.240]   anyway then I go back home and if my buddy's not uploading to his blog then I go on iTunes
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:39.520]   download the song buy the song after giving them all my credit card information pull the
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:49.080]   song right into my iPod sync it up nice that easy that easy or this easy he's pressing
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:54.520]   the zoom button now I guess there's different kinds of easy this is more like Sunday morning
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:02.400]   this is so bad I'm sorry it's hard to talk about it we got it so bad and it's got that
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:07.440]   al gore problem where it just keeps talking and talking and talking and it's you know
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.880]   it sounds like the result of a board meeting well and I should say this isn't intended
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.520]   it's not an ad it's it's something they showed at a conference and Apple does I mean Microsoft
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.440]   does some pretty fun conference production and the thing that we also realized is that
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.280]   I mean there's a big ad and you see and they really wrote it but that's the this is the
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.360]   typical problem that Microsoft tends to get into which is that they that they make stuff
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.320]   that is like something but not quite as good you know the way it kind of is isn't it it's
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:36.920]   just like the zoom of Mac PC ads yeah it's just that it's always gonna look just like
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.400]   it but it's not gonna be quite as good so to deconstruct it the two things that they the
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:46.320]   two negatives they found are one the iPod scratches easily and two that was pretty good
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.880]   that was kind of it's true they don't touch it it scratches and then and then the second
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:56.880]   one was how much harder it is to get a song on your iPod compared with squirting it from
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:01.600]   the zoom yeah the problem is they don't mention that nobody else has a zoom just squirt to
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.880]   yeah exactly you know I Microsoft's really going towards this welcome to the social thing
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:13.360]   I just oh god this is the awful the really truly awful slogan for the zoom but I just
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   noticed that you can do the same thing with Vista Vista will seek out other Vista running
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:23.200]   computers in the neighbor in in the room which is for it all over it seems like a terrible
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.760]   idea but apparently that's the plan I would imagine that they're gonna do the same thing
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:31.800]   in Vista that this is the new Microsoft model is you will you will like other people running
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:39.920]   Vista so much you'll want to get to know them oh yeah it's scored on them I think Microsoft's
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.400]   a little deluded I'm not gonna say anything but I think they might be wrong you want to
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.440]   squirt on them at their weight yeah at their wake yeah because in Canada when they say
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.040]   let's go to a social oh that's right what they call a weight welcome to the social is
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:59.600]   actually a wake in Canada which is just one more great thing you know there's somebody
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:03.240]   at Microsoft that's supposed to get paid to check these things out I want to point that
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.160]   out did you guys see the I don't know if we talked I don't think we talked about this
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.480]   before Greg at ideas for dozens had a nice post called why I'm a PC works we talked about
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.840]   this and he says that he thinks it's the fact we talked about before about how the hodgeman
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   character is so much more enjoyable than the Apple hipster guy and and he sees things
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.920]   that's the whole point of this that you that because it's kind of pointed at PC users it
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.440]   is quite is a hodgeman's folksy charisma lies right at the heart of the ads effectiveness
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.840]   campaign museum squarely PC users it's more than formal inheritor of the somewhat switch
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.120]   campaign you're saying that people like the PC users identify with hodgeman well it's
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.560]   you know yeah it's flattering you know he's this fees this you know it's kind of funny
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.000]   and again I mean like I the reason I thought it didn't work is probably because I'm a Mac
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.160]   user right I look you know I don't need to identify with the Mac guy I'm already a Mac
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.640]   guy I'm already a hipster in a hoodie but but the idea of this going out and like being
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:59.480]   directed at somebody who's you know kind of you know is at least in a stereotype the
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:03.960]   you know the kind of pompous befuddled you know second place guy I think it's kind of
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:08.240]   an interesting I'm confused though it's supposed to appeal to PC users because they don't want
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.560]   to be that guy in the time well just that I mean so what what Greg's saying here this
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.760]   is exactly how quote unquote normal people see themselves especially those in corporate
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:20.400]   or especially bureaucratic jobs and I think it's stuck using windows they're stuck using
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.800]   it yeah maybe yeah but I mean just the idea I just I got kind of like the idea that yeah
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:30.680]   the hodgeman character is just so much more kind of likeable yeah and oh gosh well you
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.400]   know it's again it's maybe it's the thin end of the wedge to getting people to look at
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.560]   this stuff right maybe yeah he's certainly likeable I think that was one of the problems
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.840]   that they had was he was too likeable and people were saying why is that poor guy getting
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.800]   beat up by the Mac yeah you think that but you still you still I think that you can all
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.240]   a lot of people can actually identify with the troubles that he's talking about you know
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.360]   with with right you see I mean I think that's the thing people can identify with him but
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:55.280]   they can also identify with the trouble and also the defense to the kind of defensiveness
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.480]   of being a Windows user nowadays oh no I know I have I'm gonna jump the track a little
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.520]   bit have you guys seen this building controversy over Mac heist no you know I will I have to
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.760]   say you talked about Mac heist a couple times without me I tried Mac heist and I thought
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.840]   first of all you know the when they first started off you're supposed to do this whole
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:19.600]   spy thing and I so you know you're supposed to send all email to this guy and ask him
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.600]   for some code he has sent an email to the guy said I have no idea what you're talking
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:30.200]   about so I'm like so I said okay I give up it's too complicated for me and then they
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.120]   change their model right now you buy a bundle of programs for 49 bucks well they did and
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:40.360]   that's where the controversy has been building is where the money is going so they you know
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:45.160]   they say 190 thousand dollars for charity there's a certain percentage is going to charity
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:50.280]   what they've the update here they've what charity is for as I can tell well they said
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:56.440]   it is but they've reported 14,000 units sold of this for a total revenue of about $640,000
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:03.040]   this is according to daring fireball.net this is a blog John Hoover yeah and and it says
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.080]   he's currently estimating their pain the grand total about $70,000 or less to the participating
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.120]   developers now evidently I think that what what happened was it sounded like they did
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.680]   a lump sum just telling the developers we're going to pay you and what it says in here
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:19.920]   an estimate of 12,500 per it's a good deal because for 49 bucks you got Devin think you've
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   got delicious library you got text mate you got news fire I mean it's a great it's a
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.520]   great deal that what what it sounds like those they what they weren't willing to do
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.800]   is is deal up do a percentage with the with the developers well the developers accepted
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.960]   the deal the text mate was I think text mate was one of the two apps that was locked until
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:43.200]   they reached a certain amount of oh yeah see that bothers me so if I spent this 49 bucks
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:48.040]   I might not get licensed copies of these programs but they they passed all of the
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.840]   expected they all down the big the big question now is that they've made a lot of money and
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.160]   and their the assumption is is they've made you know three or four hundred thousand you
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.840]   know somewhere between 300 and 400 thousand dollars of profit you know where the each
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:06.080]   developer is making you know all together is 70,000 now they made the deal you know this
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.440]   is an experiment it's a one week experiment let's see how it goes they made they made them
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.520]   money to get their their check but I mean this is that this is kind of a did any of
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:18.440]   you do any of the any of the so-called missions I mean that was what stopped me cold I can't
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.720]   plan to get out yeah I live in a world where I remember we used to just have to buy things
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.840]   Leo yeah you know we used to just go to the grocery store and give him money now you got
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:31.400]   to have a secret code a secret handshake a special card you know who wants to do all
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.840]   that work just to buy something yeah no I think they're looking at things like woot which
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:40.480]   have been phenomenally successful there is something it doesn't track a certain is it
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:45.480]   when you have people a large number of people who you know who went through whatever that
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.600]   is they're far more likely to buy stuff you know and that's I think that's do any of
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:54.840]   you use woot you know I don't even know what it is Merlin you know what it is do I know
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.680]   what it is what is a whoot.com.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:02.920]   That was real successful Leo it is real successful maybe it's mostly what it is what
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:06.920]   it might be with his dive use word I just I think you meant it out no no whoot.com it's
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.840]   a website where they have one deal one day it's obviously some bender who had a bunch
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.480]   of closeouts and came up with what what I think is interesting about Mac Heist and
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.360]   Woot is there new ways to merchandise stuff that seem you know within the case of woot
[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.440]   the game element of it of oh you got to get in there find out what it is you got to buy
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.960]   it before it sells out has actually driven a lot of sales it's been very successful for
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.960]   that that limited time only is very effective and it's just one product one day I know a
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:37.400]   lot of people who buy stuff from Woot and there's a lot of web buzz over Woot I think
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.000]   Mac Heist is trying to do the same thing and I think they were a little disappointed that
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.560]   people weren't willing to play these elaborate games to get you know cheap software.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:49.080]   Groupers got a on back on during fireball but I think the post that Alex is referring
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.720]   to is it the the inequities of the selfish that one Alex yeah he's got a he's got a pretty
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.880]   detailed analysis of how the solve breaks down including some numbers he came up with
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:03.920]   that's worth checking out if you're if you're interested in this story but then I think
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:07.600]   it was a good idea I do think that that it would be more equitable and I think they'd
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.600]   have a lot less trouble and this is an experiment and they did what they you know everyone signed
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:20.840]   in for it no one got you know no one was wrongly remunerated but what the I think that it's
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.640]   easier to work through if they work out some kind of percentage whether it's 20% or 30%
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.160]   or whatever it's just a lot simpler for everyone and if it's really successful everyone feels
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.800]   like they they got their cut you know I think you'll have a hard time having to go after
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.000]   this you'll have a hard time getting people to come back and do it again if he's not
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.880]   giving a percentage I think that's speaking from someone who does a lot of these does
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:44.600]   a lot of percentages who is he do we know who is Mac heist I was assuming it's a Philip
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:49.240]   for you because he did it looks very much like that yeah I would bet it is because it
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.000]   looks very much like the yeah that game what was that though where we had a pick you and
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.040]   I were both judges on that right the Mac developer thing yeah the dream out my dream that my
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.880]   dream that yeah it seems like the sequel to my dream that I by the way I've got to give
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:12.560]   points to John Gruber for calling Brian Lam of Gizmodo a jackass the jackass of the
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:18.600]   week award he gave him and by the way be the worst web person in the world and by the way
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:23.880]   he is now and by the way apparently I didn't see this Brian Lam on the Gizmodo apologize
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:29.080]   he said Mac heads right there you know he doesn't like us including those from Mac rumors think
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.040]   secret the unofficial Apple web log and cult of Mac no Apple likes to release gear on Tuesday
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.320]   so they probably didn't expect an Apple iPhone oh he's saying we should have known better
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:42.920]   Oh even after my original post if you did read into it incorrectly and feel like I
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:50.280]   misled you apologize apologies for the discomfort oh he's a turkey yeah I think this is I think
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.080]   he's this is a big this is this is one of those things that can I'm not sure if it will
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:01.080]   but it can really damage a site for a long period I will never read Gizmodo again you have my
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.960]   I think we should create the Mac break weekly seat of heat and invite him on to defend himself
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.600]   I don't even want to talk to him he's a bozo and he's not and I will never again quote stories
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.400]   from Gizmodo and gadget I'd be I declare Gizmodo dead you're dead to me
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:21.480]   in ganja little harsh there Leo I think he's dead to me I think he deserves it
[00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.680]   God now I really don't like him that was a that was a snarky apology
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.680]   yeah that was that was bad for him
[00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:36.040]   so all right real quick because we we I think Merlin submitted this and I think it's a great idea
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:42.280]   what do we want to see in OS 10 this is the starts with a post
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   why'd you set it's really computer world this was a computer world there was there was a there's a
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:54.280]   post and I'm now 15 15 things apple should change in mac OS 10 from computer world of all people
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.520]   and this was a mixture of their mac editor and their pc editor really looking at all the things that
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:04.120]   that that they should change and really it really looks to me though more like it's
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.920]   if you want to be more like wind more like vista it's exactly what it looks like to me how
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   how how oh it's 10 should be more like vista so instead of covering that let's let's just look
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:18.120]   at what what do we want to see what would we like I've changed between Leo what would you
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:24.200]   what would you change in OS 10 wow this is tough I mean I'm it's now are we talking about leopard
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:29.880]   tiger are we maybe these are things we should we'd like to see in in leopard how about that
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.120]   okay I'd like to see and I think there it's in there virtual desktops I think that would be a
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:39.000]   big improvement I think every operating system that should have virtual desktops I'd like to see
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.080]   virtualization built in although I have to say parallels is done such a spent spectacular job
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.560]   with their coherence technology that it looks great there's no reason really for apple to do
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:52.360]   anything more with that right um I don't know I like oh I you know it's hard for me to think of
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:58.040]   something that bugs me about OS 10 I think the thing that bugs me probably on a a couple times a
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.000]   day maybe 10 15 times a day I think is I just really want to turn the dock off I understand I
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.320]   understand I can't believe I understand the photo shot guy and that's what no no I'm a user of
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.920]   graphics application you don't hiding it beyond hiding it you want to be able to know because
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.040]   it keeps on popping out to no matter where I put it there's a there's a dialogue box near it and
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.960]   so every time I go over towards my dialogue box and every time I go to the bottom or the side or
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:22.920]   I'm constantly moving around trying to figure and sometimes now I've gotten to the point where I
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.480]   move it around depending on what app I'm using and it's just it's just I don't it's fine to have
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.360]   it there it's just that I can't believe they don't give us the the ability to turn the you know the
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:38.360]   dog isn't that useful either I mean most guys who really use the Mac have hardcore very rarely use
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:44.840]   the dock right yeah right wrong and I hate I hate the dock too for the very same reason Alex it's
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.240]   no matter what I'm working on it pops up you might want to look at a couple of the apps out there
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.640]   for hacking on the dock something like no here go ahead we wrote an apple script that would take
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:57.720]   the doc out so it would actually delete the doc out you can turn it off yeah it would move it and
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:01.640]   turn it off but the problem was is it causes photoshopped the crash so it's not but something
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.480]   like transparent doc or something will give you more granularity over where you can put it rather
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.360]   than just those three corners but let's talk about as long as like I post it into the trash can is
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:16.600]   the doc the best way to show applications you use a lot I don't know no but the OS 10 is not about
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.280]   having a best way to do anything it's about it's about having any number of affordances and so
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:24.040]   sometimes I want to drag on to there and sometimes I want I mean I don't use the doc do you use the
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   doc a lot the only time I use the doc I use it for two things I use it for monitoring something
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.680]   and I use it for dragging that's about it and I use it a lot it's not that I don't use the doc
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.880]   and it's not like I never want to use it and I you know I don't want them to get riveted or
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.240]   anything else it's a great you know and I have it like the little one where it zooms up and then
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.320]   you know gets all this up but but I just want to be able I just want the one little option to say
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.720]   I just don't want it to ever come out you know hide it and then don't turn it on until I ask
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:55.160]   you finish just like just add a meta key that has to be pressed for it to pop up or something
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.840]   like that well just just to have a preference just to say you know where it says hiding under
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:03.480]   doc I just want to be able to go up to doc where it says hiding and then just say hiding you know
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:07.400]   permanently or you know one little additive there that just hides it and then won't bring it out
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.720]   until I turn that feature off again you know I just you know I just want to be able and I have to
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.080]   admit that I would probably stop you if that happened I'd probably turn the doc off and I never
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.160]   look back I love the doc I use it all the time I have a whole bunch of servers in it I have you
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.920]   know all this other stuff that I use but I would still never use it again if I was able to turn it
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:26.680]   off and maybe that's why they don't do it is because half the users would stop using it completely
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:32.840]   you know I just it's just that it gets in my way all the time I mean all the time and it just
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:37.720]   it's all right enough that's it Merlin Merlin what what don't you like what would you add well I
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:43.080]   think any kind of OS 10 list has to start with the finder I think I think a basic rethinking of the
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:48.760]   way that we the finder is is put together and both visually and under the hood it just it still
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:52.840]   feels it really feels like it needs an update and so like I use path finder does do I which
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:58.200]   um see I think the response to a lot of these things is there are lots of good third-party apps
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:03.000]   that do many of these things yeah I am I would be surprised if there weren't something I understand
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.600]   Alex Mickens slightly different point but I would be surprised if there weren't something that could
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:12.600]   least in some way kind of destroy the the doc at least between law if you could make finder better
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.520]   what would you do one one or two things well I mean I think one thing it's so funny once you
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:21.160]   become somebody who uses Quicksilver for a while you start to realize the numerous deficits of the
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.640]   finder and so to me Quicksilver fixes some of these things and pathfinder fixes other of these
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:30.920]   things but for example I've gotten so used to the idea of tab browsing in um in a browser or for
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.240]   that matter and transmit which I love um I really like the idea of being able to move files around
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:39.720]   through tabs rather than having that that winded experience and pathfinder does that yeah pathfinder
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:44.600]   does it's it's almost too much and then really quickly my other one is very purely 43 folders
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:49.960]   esque which is just much much much more control and granularity over all kinds of notifications
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:55.800]   out of iCal and uh and mail dot app and to not have to hack that stuff together with growl but to
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.200]   give me a lot more granularity and how I do things like snoozing alarms and things like that I do
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:06.360]   like growl though boy I love growl all right scott born what would you change in os 10 I'd make
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:11.320]   spotlight work so that an old guy like me understands i don't think spotlight is a success at all
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:16.280]   and I have to say the search that microsoft has done in vista is so much better yeah we just don't
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:21.400]   have a good search for i i want i want a better search tool so that's my hope for the next version
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:27.320]   so that's one nice thing about pathfinder is if you love like the os 789 style of searching um
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.560]   pathfinder gives you three ways to search you can search using spotlight you can search search
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:37.320]   just inside of like say one folder by just filtering strings so just show me everything where these
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.480]   you know characters appear or you can you can do something to spotlight you can do full search
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.440]   you can do totally old school old school mac searching where it'll just search your hard drive
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.720]   I find I'm gonna confuse you know because I never know what kind of searching I'm gonna get
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.000]   because I haven't figured it out it's here's a pull down menu you got to deal with but again I
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.240]   mean like to me if I were if I were on that team on any of these teams I would be looking to the
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:02.280]   ways that people are obviously are like developing these compensatory muscles to make up for these
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:08.440]   deficits and in the basic os yeah I agree with you yeah i've never in fact i turned off spotlight on
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:13.160]   my laptop because i just never use it it doesn't make sense to me and I think quicksilver does
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:17.880]   so much I mean I live as as Merlin does I live in quicksilver and there's really no need for me
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.440]   to do anything more frankly well not to mention the fact that if you're a pro audio guy like me
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:29.000]   spotlight really can screw up applications like pro tools because the indexing of the drives
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.760]   causes pro tools to hiccup that's why I've turned it off on everything I just don't want it to be
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.440]   indexing because I don't use it all right real quickly we only have a few minutes left let's do
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:43.240]   our picks of the week who for who first who who I'm ready all right Scott go ahead
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:49.880]   remember the odd born wheel I do why do you ask me because you're the only one on the panel is
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:57.160]   old as me or close to his old as well I kind of like that old simple word processing deal where
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.640]   you just had a big blank screen and a blank cursor and away you went and there's a product down
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.680]   beta called right room it's pretty cool it lets that lets you emulate any kind of colored background
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:13.640]   you want and so I've got the old amber look that the amber Osborne had so that I could just see my
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:19.320]   word processing and nothing else gets in the way it just takes up the whole screen and it's a
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:26.520]   shareware and people should try it out it's right room WRITEROM sometimes you just want a simple
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.800]   word processor and we know you know we've talked about some other ones that are good
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.920]   we've you know we've talked about a text Wrangler and text edit but this one has the ability to
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:39.320]   fill up the screen yeah for simple yes I agree with you I'm Merlin you'd like this is very clean
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:43.160]   yeah that we I've featured this is one of the many full screen mode writers we've featured on
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.760]   the site and it's something that geeks like like me can really benefit from is having that lack
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:51.480]   of distraction you know it's yeah that's a nice app and it's it's come a long way pretty quickly
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.560]   so Merlin and I like the same app for the first time ever but Merlin still has to pick one of his
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:00.120]   own Merlin what's your favorite oh gosh I feel bad because I got this off of delicious and I want
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:07.400]   to credit the person who gave it to us but I just discovered via the mbw ideas tag something called
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:16.440]   main menu and their site has been a little pokey lately it's essay and Santa SW but main menu if you
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:21.880]   guys are familiar with things like what like cocktail and onyx and all of those apps that are
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:25.880]   really kind of a front end of the to the usually to the Unix utilities that you have kind of under
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:31.160]   the hood main menu if you're like me and you're always kind of fiddling and fixing main menu hangs
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.720]   up hangs out up in your menu bar and you pull down and it has the maintenance scripts all the daily
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:40.840]   weekly monthly scripts disk utility access you can rebuild spotlight and pre bindings you can
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:46.360]   clean your caches uh just up to the finder all the all that kind of sexy onyx sort of stuff that we
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:53.000]   all again the rubber chicken stuff that we do when things start behaving oddly and it's got a little
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:59.080]   bit of uh of configurability so you can if you're a smart uh do be restart or log out after you've
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:03.640]   made changes uh it's just a great quick way to jump straight into these tasks that we all need to do
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:10.840]   cool sounds good main menu main menu and Alex okay so I have one that uh I'm pretty sure I
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:16.040]   haven't talked about before um we I have talked about we picked transmit a while ago love transmit
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.040]   uh which is just you know I use it a couple you know I think we did a little transmit thing
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:25.080]   too on mac breaks if you want to see some features so but another thing that panic makes is a little
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:30.920]   application called uh desk task addict uh desk task tick it's hard to say but uh but very useful and
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.080]   what it allows you to do it's I think it's like ten dollars and uh what it allows you to do is
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:40.840]   actually draw over your desktop so if you have a wackum tablet or even a mouse um you can draw
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:46.200]   over top of uh anything and so um and and what this is really useful for if you're doing a presentation
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.800]   or something where you want to show something or talk about it you can have it float over so you
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:54.360]   can be using final cut pro or you can be using uh whatever you're using iMovie and be circling
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:51:00.280]   stuff and doing it now if you combine this with something like snaps pro or I show you and I show
[00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:04.920]   you is only 20 bucks and I talked about that in the past between those two for 30 dollars you end
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:09.880]   up with a desk task and I show you and you can do uh you can be working in your application if you
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.360]   want to do a little training for people uh which I do a lot of uh or if you want to ask questions
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:17.880]   of other people that you're working with and you want to say I'm having trouble with this area
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:21.960]   here or I'm doing trying to do this it's this great little application that lets you basically you
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:27.400]   know draw a pen over top of everything and it's um I use it a lot and uh we use it on the call for
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.640]   help and we use it a while it was kind of neat uh yeah it it I think it works you have to get a
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.800]   little use to it you have to um program your problem because you're really not drawing on the
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:40.120]   window it's kind of a little weird you have to you have to what you have to do is is I set up I
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:45.080]   you have to program your pen for hotkeys um and once you program your pen for hotkeys where it says
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:49.240]   be above or be below or let me erase then it works really great but it does take a little bit of
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:54.200]   learning to get to get kind of into it and you use that for the road to 1080p for the original
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:52:00.040]   road to 1080p's I absolutely I did that and and when I'm doing when I'm uh giving feedback um within
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:03.800]   the pixacord on overtop of movies I'll play a quick time movie and draw over it and that's exactly
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:08.120]   what I did for the road to 1080p now the newest ones those are just stills and I just did that in
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:12.520]   Photoshop but I could do the same thing if I was playing bag movies and I'm going to be using it
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:17.160]   for inside the black box for a couple future episodes coming up soon cool cool very cool
[00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.640]   my applications a game do you mind would you like to play a game shall we play a game
