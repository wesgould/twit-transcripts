[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:35.560]   Madison iPads you heard mica sergeant Renee Richie has the day off because apparently he's being briefed all day
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.720]   By Apple and now I know why there were quite a few products in the spring-loaded event. Hi mica
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.440]   Hi, yes, he did not confirm that it was Apple who was briefing him. So could just be his pal Georgia Dow
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.440]   Oh, yeah, he and Georgia gang brief. Yeah iOS today hosts

[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.560]   So he's he's pulling extra duty today and of course Andy and not co
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.280]   From WGBH in Boston. Hello Andrew. Hello. Oh, so I guess I'd not gonna be spending
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.080]   $1,500 today on impulse. That's good
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.640]   No, you'll be spending $1,500 on the 30th on impulse after after 10 days. That's fine
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.800]   Yeah, I almost justifies it now in fact really this is the 10 day cooling off period the to wait for the
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.560]   Reality displacement field to slowly dissipate so that you can distortion field so you can you know think clearly I
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.280]   Know I'm glad to I like it when they don't sell it right away because you know my hand is hovering over the
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.840]   Apple store button hey before we get into this show and we have a lot to talk about
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.240]   But I do want to mention an announcement we made on Sunday and I'm gonna mention it on every show this week
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.840]   Just so that everybody who listens to only one show hears about it. We have launched our
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.680]   Club to it. This is something we've been thinking about for a long time
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:05.760]   As you know since day one, you know my entire broadcast background is in free ad supported media
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.280]   That's what I understand
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.960]   Initially when we started to it the first year we thought no we won't do ads
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.080]   But but it wasn't very long before we brought in ads because that's the only way we could really build to it to the size and
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.400]   And capabilities that we wanted to build it to but now that we're a mature entity
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.200]   I think it's time to open another way to participate
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:34.320]   So club twit if you go to twit.tv/club twit you can read all about it is a seven dollar a month subscription
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.000]   There's only one tier. There's no yearly. It's month to month because you know, it's simple that way
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.400]   What you'll get is every show we do they'll be ad-free feeds both audio and video
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.840]   They'll also be additional feeds audio and video for twit what we'll call twit plus which will be bonus content
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.720]   That is not on the normal shows some of it will be stuff
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.320]   You can see if you watch the live stream like pre-show and post-show
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.280]   But there'll be other things on there as well and as you
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.440]   Probably noticed if you turned in early on the live stream, we'll also have a
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:16.200]   Club twit discord available only to club members that will allow you to participate in other ways including stage events and other things that we're going to do
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.760]   So twit.tv/club twit
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:25.000]   This is not going to replace the ad supported network and it's really important to continue to do ad supported content
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.960]   So that people can't afford seven bucks a month or don't want to pay and can still get all the twit content
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   The price you pay is there's ads
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.960]   But for those who don't like the ads don't want to be tracked or just you know want to support twit
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.280]   This is another tier and another way to do it. So thank you in advance if you decide to join
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.520]   I think it's going to be a lot of fun already, you know
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.120]   We've been spending time over the last three days in the discord and it's already feeling a little bit like the old days of
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.040]   Twit a real community developing already
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.720]   So thank you. Don't apologize for the for the little mini ad at the beginning, but I wanted to let everybody know what was going on
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.240]   All right now
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.540]   Let's talk about spring loaded man. It was
[00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.760]   Loaded I guess given that I just mentioned club twit we might mention
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.600]   Apple has added some new features to Apple podcasts including a subscription feature
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.440]   Which is very much sounds like what we were gonna do the only difference I guess from my point of view is it's it's very Apple focused
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.440]   Right, you probably have to use Apple podcasts and things like that
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.960]   Yeah, it gives a creators who have Apple podcasts podcasts the ability to
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.840]   offer a subscription service within the app and so along with a
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:49.920]   redesigned podcast app which is going to be coming in iOS 14, which is supposed to be shipping in this coming week
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.120]   We will see the ability that of course will launch a little bit later, but the ability to
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.960]   To offer a subscription that can come with some extra stuff Apple put out a press release about
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.160]   podcasts the new podcast service in particular and
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.380]   It will give you some options to along with just listening. It actually has a trial
[00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.040]   So it's a little bit akin to what developers have been able to do with their apps
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.360]   Where you can kind of start out and then pay a subscription
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.440]   Depending on what you choose to charge when Apple went to podcast started doing podcasts and they showed the old interface
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.800]   At the time I said is simultaneously the best thing that could happen to podcast because it will really you know
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.520]   bring people's attention to it and the worst thing because
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   It will it will appear to be Apple centric just the name alone made it Apple centric already
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.480]   This headline in the Apple news release Apple leads the next chapter of podcasting
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:57.680]   Wrangles just a little bit as well with Apple podcast subscriptions. I think I think we should we should thank Spotify
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:04.760]   You're excited about the the subscriptions. You should thank the the fact that we're seeing some competition
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.640]   You know for Apple and I think Apple had to respond to that so I doubt I don't think that they're really leading
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.640]   I think that they're following well
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.240]   I have to point out if you're a podcast or considering it the deal is not great
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.280]   You pay Apple 20 bucks a year for the privilege plus 30%
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:26.000]   Of your subscription fee for the first year in the second year it goes down to 15%
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.640]   But the system we're using
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   member full charges 4.99% if you pay them a hundred bucks a month and
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.360]   So it's a little more expensive in the upfront
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.120]   But it's a lot less expensive for the fee and then there's a stripe payment processing
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.200]   Which is about to I think 2.9% as as any credit card processing would be we buy
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.280]   The nice thing about member full and stripe is they offer Apple pay so that is one real benefit
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.240]   But that benefit exists to for for club to it
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.240]   I I have to say I when I look at the detail the deal itself
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.320]   I don't I don't feel like oh shoot we should have gone with this now
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.280]   I think that for experienced
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.720]   Podcasters that have been figured out ways to monetize that I don't think that this is necessarily a great deal for them for folks
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.920]   Who are just getting started just want to turn something on and start generating revenue the fact that it's completely built into the the
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   Apple ecosystem is going to be a benefit to them
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.720]   Yeah, and so they're you know they're gonna you know
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.960]   They're gonna make more money even if they're getting a smaller cut of it
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.280]   If they're just getting started and they just want I just want to make money and they can hit the button
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.560]   So I think does it have anchor style tools though
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.680]   I mean that's one of the things Spotify offers is a complete podcast studio in effect in your phone I
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.960]   Don't it's just that yeah, I think Apple's still a lot bigger than Spotify
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.680]   Right, I think that they wouldn't be if they didn't figure out a way to solve this so I think you're exactly right. Yeah
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.360]   Yeah, yeah, that's I think you nailed it. This is this is in response
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.480]   To what Spotify is up to
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:55.240]   Yeah, I'm gonna wonder though if anybody who has I think else is right and that there are a lot of people who have small podcasts who
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.520]   We're gonna say hey, I got 20 bucks and I'll take whatever free money I get from it
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.720]   But it seems like the only real advantage that Apple scheme is gonna give anybody is that it's right there in the app
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:09.000]   You have a lot of Apple people who are very much conditioned to oh, I can just press this button and I'm good to go
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.720]   I don't have to do anything, but I just don't know if anybody who has greater ambitions than just simply oh, okay
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.440]   If there's extra cash in here, I'll get it. I'm not sure if any of those people are gonna say gee
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.840]   I think it'll be great that my listeners will have a relationship with Apple and not a relationship directly with me
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.600]   I think that most
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.240]   Most of the bigger podcast is gonna want to say no, please
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:33.080]   Here's my discord. Here's my here's the systems that I'm setting up for you to interact with me directly
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:37.280]   You definitely don't want to create a middleman in Apple because Apple does not want
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.440]   Users to have direct relationships with creators
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.120]   Well, I think that you can you can still do a lot of those things
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.800]   You know you can be uploading a discord link and putting things in and there's a lot of yeah
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:55.040]   Part gets up to what Leo but what member for does is it automatically sends an invite to our discord channel as part of it's fully integrated into it
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.200]   So right that's what I was gonna say is not so easy. We don't have to do anything really yeah
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:05.240]   So I guess I guess that's just a word of warning to any podcasters listening
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.240]   There are other not warning, but just a council that there are other ways to do it
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.960]   Yeah, and I think it's fine that Apple is doing this. I don't have a problem with it
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.360]   I don't think it's gonna be it end up being a major shift to the podcast universe by any means
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:25.060]   So to say Apple leads the next I mean that's ridiculous really the neural
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:30.880]   Podcasting is ridiculous. I think the main thing we're also seeing though is the continuation of the end of
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:36.240]   I think that I think that Twitter is getting ahead of this is the effective end of advertising
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:42.040]   Yes, it's probably got another 10 years and then it's it's gonna be over we saw the writing on the wall because you know
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:47.360]   With Spotify for instance advertisers can go to Spotify and say well who you know who listens by name?
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   Spotify is your credit card number of your name you ever your address they have your birthday
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.320]   They could say exactly how much of the podcast you listen to when you listen to it all of these things
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.200]   We can't tell advertisers and I don't want to tell advertisers so
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:06.160]   Ultimately advertisers if they're if they want to track they're gonna choose Spotify or you know
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.200]   Maybe Apple podcasts. I don't know if Apple's gonna be selling I guess not selling ads against it
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.920]   So that's not what they're in business for I think that that's the issue is is that you don't have
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.880]   People aren't gonna want to be tracked forever and they don't really want the interruptions
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.200]   I mean you look at broadcast broadcast is like standard terrestrial broadcasts is trying to figure out
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:29.560]   They're trying to get more actually more frequencies so they can do more shows and get more real estate when no one wants to watch that anymore
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.720]   Yeah, the very thing that keeps them alive which is ads is what's killing them
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.480]   It's the forced interruptions
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:41.580]   Yeah, and so the the interesting thing here is that people are moving more and more away using subscriptions using a variety of other tools
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:48.120]   Brands have to become content creators. If they don't become content creators. No one's gonna hear them anymore
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.880]   I mean that's that's the next thing you're at least a decade. I know you know well
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:57.200]   It's yeah, it's coming fast now, you know like it's you know like you know especially now that Apple's really focused on subscriptions
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.160]   It's gonna it's gonna help accelerate that process. Yeah, so maybe in that respect
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.780]   It was smart of us to offer an ad-free version. Yeah prepare for this. I you know we're gonna
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.320]   I even if this is if club tour of huge success
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.440]   It wouldn't make up more than half of our revenue
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:21.640]   As long as we continue can continue to sell advertising work auto because oh, yeah, I think it's happening tomorrow
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.680]   No, yeah, it's smart to be prepared anyway back to the Apple events spring loaded
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:32.080]   The first thing Tim Cook announced and and mica you gasped was a purple iPhone I
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:39.680]   Gasped because I was so confused that they chose to add a color after the original
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:45.320]   Announcement it just it was kind of a why moment. Does this potentially boost?
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:51.880]   Do they know something about purple that I don't if I if I was to I don't know launch a new line of
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.200]   T-shirts and multiple colors and I didn't have purple by launching purple later. Do I potentially open the floodgates?
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.960]   Hundreds of thousands of more purchases. Should we launch club or quit plus in purple?
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:11.200]   I it just it was very confusing to me that there was this focus paid to purple as if I don't know everybody was screaming for purple
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.240]   Well, it's it's one of the missing Apple colors for one also
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:21.960]   Google has done purple phones Samsung's own purple phone so Apple's not exactly leading the way here and you'd be
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.960]   when it comes to phones the
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:31.480]   You companies are really really having to do whatever they have to to nudge somebody to upgrade a phone that's working perfectly fine
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.720]   The the year in which he said oh my god these new phones. They can actually take pictures in low light
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.240]   I'm definitely gonna upgrade now even though my two-year-old phone is still working fine
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.480]   It's a funny thing there are people who are who will definitely buy a new phone if there's a color that they really really tweak to
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.440]   Assuming they didn't buy a new phone just three months ago
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.760]   So yeah, it makes perfect sense why not why not have purple?
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.240]   I think they finally notice that the album are in the lower thirds and all of the
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:57.080]   backgrounds on Mac break weekly are purple and
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.660]   It's the Mac break weekly phone Mac break weekly phone
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.120]   Can you can get you know I just want to know when they when they're open up in the store
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.640]   Can you get the prince's sigil like as an engraving?
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.260]   That'd be nice, but as we think of it as the entire ecosystem
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:16.480]   They probably made it they changed the paint and they'll probably make a billion dollars. Yeah, I know
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.160]   They have done this before with product red, but that was a charity thing right right
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.320]   But I'm just saying that they probably generate a billion dollars just just just changing the love
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.320]   Yeah, I'm probably cost them tens of millions to figure it out, but but it's
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.760]   Purple people that makes money
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.640]   Purple purple lovers
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:44.120]   I know I should have taken notes during this event. I'm sure you did Andy because you you've got a pay attention
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.760]   So we got the purple phone we got the podcast
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.360]   Updates and by the way, there'll be some more some discoverability and the podcast app is changing
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.040]   But we've seen that before that's been in pre-release for a while
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.520]   You know one thing I was surprised
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.840]   I thought this would be and and I guess really the issue was you got a lot of stuff to announce in an exactly one hour
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.640]   I thought this would be the big rollout for iOS 14 5, but
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.160]   Clearly Facebook and others are more concerned about 14 5 than Apple is
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:18.320]   Yeah, and also all the these are not 14 5 isn't the sort of thing that you need to demonstrate in front of a world audience
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.560]   Whereas when you get people
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.720]   lined up to spend $1200 on a new iPad or
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.400]   $1500 on a new iMac you definitely want to hit their pleasure side is really really hard
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.820]   Yeah, and one of the things that someone in our office hours viewing party noticed was
[00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.480]   That there were only like two or three hard cuts in the whole thing
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.600]   Which would lead you to believe that possibly not everything made it to the final edit. Oh
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.440]   So
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.440]   People watching why
[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.760]   Why does that say that well because everything else is a smooth transition
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:57.280]   There's the I mean by the way the production value on this keynote was the best ever like best keynote
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:03.800]   Anybody has ever done they really hired some writers because they had the mission impossible sequence
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.560]   They had some comedy in it well they had they had they had
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.040]   It was really well toned the transitions from a technical perspective
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.720]   They were some of the stuff that they did yeah
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:20.040]   I know it seems simple, but the shot over the pool is a technocrain like that is not a steady cam
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.440]   That is not a jib they panned over and pulled back that is a technically
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.280]   They they've carted in a technocrain into that pool to do that shot
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.520]   I guarantee it like just looking at from the shot from the front end of it
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.480]   I have no idea what they did
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.840]   But I can tell you that that move is really why you watch office hours because I don't even know what a technocrain is
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.840]   But clearly
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:43.640]   It's a jib that can extend in and out right and it's you know like a really expensive things to do for a
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.400]   I don't I've never seen a keynote well
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.100]   I have actually done a keynote with a
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:51.360]   Technocrain but but I but you see you see what the whale was a mini
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.360]   Yeah, we learned captive captive whale sea world shame
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:03.480]   Transfer as Apple we finally learned that the pond at the Apple campus has a whale in it dark water the Cupertino edition
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:12.640]   But it wasn't an or something the other transition some of the one of the first transitions through the through the grass
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.920]   Yeah
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.680]   Really hard like that's really like that's like that would that cost a lot of money
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:24.900]   But you're saying there were some there were some jump cuts and that to to you
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:31.320]   That the most points they cut something out there might have been some other content there that didn't that didn't make it in
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.360]   Are they or the transition didn't work that could be the other thing?
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.360]   We noticed that with Tim Cook at the beginning was I was gonna say I remember Leo saying
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:44.000]   Oh, there was a cut because he moved to a different part without any transition a different part of the apple park
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.280]   Yeah, that's right
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.880]   I did notice that but the one through the grass was just amazing like a stunning stunning shot like an I think they got that out
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:56.200]   A tiny world I think they went back to the people did tiny world put up and said you remember that shot we did we would like you to do that
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.720]   You know
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:02.040]   Notice in frame 321 governor Connolly is still holding on to his cowboy
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:09.520]   Sorry, I did enjoy the dive in the demonstration for it takes the dive into the couch
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.240]   That's like I said basically. Oh, he's in Narnia now
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:20.560]   Which is where he's worse. So it's a good thing. I like I like the old I apologize that we're down there. Yeah
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   Yeah, I
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.640]   I really hope that Apple doesn't go back to the stage and just keeps progressing because of the rate that they're growing in these keynotes
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:34.000]   It's gonna be like a feature film. Oh, they should never never go like they should never go back to life
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.560]   Because I think what they should do is get to point because we're I was just talking to someone about this that
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.360]   And they were like well people want to they want the press
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.640]   You know people you know Apple wants the press to show up
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.360]   I was like they're gonna show up because they get to play with the hardware and they get to talk to the folks at Apple
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.480]   Just show them a great movie. You know like like just you know go in watching an incredible movie
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:55.960]   You know that that is because if they keep on if they keep growing at the rate that they're growing from keynote to keynote to keynote
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.320]   I don't think we could ever go back to a stage and not only anybody will eventually because it's just it's amazing
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.360]   Very right has passed along these Google insights into the color purple
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:08.880]   Thank you. Thank you, Barry
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.400]   The color purple, which is the green bar here is is consistently lower
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:20.760]   then red blue and orange even orange even orange ranks higher than purple but
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:27.720]   The highest interest for purple is in Arkansas West Virginia, Kansas, Oklahoma and Utah. Those are the top
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.320]   five purple states the purple estates in the nation
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   Brought broken down by sub-region
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:44.040]   Clean up the red estates. I guess are these search I guess there's searches so California purple tier
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.000]   Jordan for metallic purple. That's a sneaker
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:54.280]   Purple among us. I don't know is there a purple character in among us purple tier and purple air
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.520]   the top five purple searches
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.880]   Thank you, Barry
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:07.740]   What college sports teams college football teams have purple livery. I don't know the Trojan
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:12.280]   The US Virgin purple all the Vikings are purple NFL Vikings
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.920]   So we did I forgot to mention at the very beginning the very first thing
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:23.320]   It's interesting because Apple got some scrutiny and actually it was Goldman Sachs their bank for the apple card
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.960]   They got some scrutiny over apparent mistreatment of spouses remember David had a Meyer Hanson
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:35.000]   The creator of Ruby on rails tweeted, you know, I got a very high credit limit my wife's credit with them
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.440]   It was low. What's the deal Apple? There was an investigation the FTC ruled there was no discrimination at Goldman Sachs
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.120]   nevertheless
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:50.240]   Apple I think felt compelled to say something about it because they announced some changes to Apple card
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.160]   That allow spouses for instance to share the credit limit
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:22:02.760]   And and allowed family members to build credit in a family sharing group. So that will come in May
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.280]   That was that was an interesting move
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:10.280]   they're actually calling it as if it's a product Apple card family and I
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.960]   I still have been very very I don't I still don't really know why they felt the need to get into
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   Creating Apple credit cards if not to if not just simply to get people locked into an ecosystem from from end to end
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.360]   But I'm glad to see them at least trying to couch it in terms of specifically
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.800]   Oh, well, this is a an opportunity to extend credit to people who
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:38.160]   Can qualify but don't qualify through traditional means that's something that that was pointed out earlier today
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:44.920]   And also pointing out the opportunity to allow two spouses to build each other's credit up
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.520]   I think that there is a I have to look at the replay to be sure
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:54.720]   But the impression that I got through one of the lines that was used was that they release implying that that means that
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:02.440]   if there are if there's a one person who's staying in a relationship because they don't have enough credit to go out and
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.520]   Find living on their own
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.800]   Get an apartment get together on credit that maybe this will allow them to
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:14.240]   Exit a relationship with better credit than what they left with what they entered with which would be an interesting way to
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.720]   Place the the Apple card in terms of why Apple's interested in this
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.000]   It's surprising that they began with it and that they felt that they need to do it
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.040]   But it is absolutely a blow for equity gender equity. So I think it's a good thing
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.200]   Is it does anybody else like where they merge the no not that I know
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.040]   It's unique, but I mean I think that as far as Apple goes there they're
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:40.120]   Between Apple cash and Apple credit cards. They're like almost a bank
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.600]   You know and what you're talking about eventually if they keep on going at the directory
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:51.040]   They're going talking about a closed system there people are borrowing money from them and and putting the money in all at the same time
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:58.320]   That is that's pretty big Joe and Joe in our discord chat says it actually he thinks it's the most impactful thing they announced
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:03.480]   Could be bigger than any gadget. It's true gadgets. Honestly in the long runner our toys
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:08.880]   But this could actually change somebody's life. So you buy gadgets with the Apple
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.120]   Yeah, all right, let's I want to take a little break
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:18.200]   And then we're gonna talk about fine Mike cuz air tags baby air tags are finally
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:24.760]   Here and if you're really excited about air tags, then I want to tell you a way you can calm down headspace
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.920]   I love that space. I've been using headspace forever
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.000]   Wouldn't it be great if there were a pocket size guide that helped you sleep
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.840]   Focus act even be better. Well, there is and if you have 10 minutes headspace
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:47.360]   Can change your life look they're coming to Netflix headspace guide to sleep April 28th. That's awesome
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:54.000]   Headspace is your daily dose of mindfulness. It's guided meditations in a very easy to use app
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:02.120]   It's one of the only meditation apps advancing the field of mindfulness and meditation beat through clinically validated research
[00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.400]   They're not just
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.480]   Making this up as they go along if you're overwhelmed
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:13.520]   Headspace has a three minute SOS meditation for you. They have meditations for all kinds of life events
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:20.200]   Maybe you're having trouble falling asleep. They're wind down sessions are fantastic and for parents
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:26.320]   I love this headspace has morning meditations. You can do with your kids
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:34.280]   What a great habit to get your kids into early headspace is approached a mindfulness can reduce stress improve sleep boost focus
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.760]   Increase your overall sense of well-being
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:41.440]   In fact there they have the numbers to prove it 30 days of headspace
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:47.160]   Lower stress by 32% and for a mood boosting workout
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.640]   There's a new feature which I haven't tried yet. They just came out with this headspace move
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.240]   Headspace is backed by 25 published studies on its benefits
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:02.360]   600,000 five star reviews at mine over 60 million downloads
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.840]   I discovered headspace a few years ago. I have always loved it
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:12.120]   It makes it easy for you to build a life-changing meditation practice with mindfulness that works for you on your schedule
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.440]   Anytime anywhere it also makes a great gift. I
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.920]   Love that in fact my health care provider offers headspace. That's how good it is
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:29.680]   It's it's one of the benefits of the health insurance. You deserve to feel happy or headspace is meditation made simple
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:35.200]   Go to headspace comm slash Mac break you get a free one month trial there

[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.680]   I think you're gonna like it
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:02.880]   I really do and if you've got kids my kids are out of the house, but if you've got kids still in the house try the headspace
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:09.800]   Morning meditations with the kids and let me know how they like it. I think that's a really interesting idea
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:13.320]   Headspace comm slash Mac
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:20.920]   Break thank you headspace for an Andy for keeping me calm all these years. I really really appreciate it
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:26.960]   I got a little excited air tag. We've been hearing about air tags for a
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.120]   Year when Apple first leaked that information by accident in a video
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.720]   Here's the funny thing when you look at it remember that render
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:41.760]   That was it you Andy or Renee or saying oh, I hope it doesn't have all that writing on it
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.600]   It was me it was it was exactly right. That's what they look like
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:54.840]   Shiny on one side with the words ultra wide band air tag designed by Apple in California assembled in China Bluetooth
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:28:02.400]   lee on the other side just a sheer plastic face that you can put a name a logo a
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.560]   Happy face on
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.680]   Pops off to replace a battery. That's nice CR what did I say 2032?
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.440]   32 yeah
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   And they are 30 bucks, but you can get a pack of four four a hundred bucks
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.880]   How I
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:29.560]   Guess the biggest difference is uw being right. That's what distinction makes it distinct from say tile or other Bluetooth trackers. Yes
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:36.040]   Yeah, it's using Bluetooth 5 at to be kind of the beacon technology. That's constantly sending out a
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:44.240]   Little ping and I think what really makes this magical is what Oprah said a long time ago a billion phones and people's pockets
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.440]   Yeah, right?
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.440]   the fine my network is
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:54.640]   Hahaha, and because of that it's not just you know folks that you know
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:29:01.160]   It's not just folks that have kind of come in contact with your phone before it's anybody that's within the fine
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.880]   my network who can be a potential point of
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.200]   communication with that
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.120]   Tracker meaning that if you leave it somewhere you will be able to find it so
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.000]   That Bluetooth signal is getting sent out and that's how devices can kind of pick up on it
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.320]   But then with you doing it yourself with your own tracker once you get within get within the range of the device
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:29.000]   That's whenever the uwb kicks in and lets you see on your phone an arrow that kind of is warm warmer warmer
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.440]   And we'll point you to where you need to go to find the device and I like what Apple has done
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:43.000]   From the privacy aspect which on top of the stuff that we'd seen up to this point one thing they mentioned in the keynote that I
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.960]   Was not aware of was they're very
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:53.360]   sound focused meaning that your little thing is going to be making noise as you're trying to find it and
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:58.120]   At the same time that also means I can't hide this in someone's bag or something like that
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.600]   There's no way to do that because that's important noise
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.200]   There was fear that people could pop it in as somebody's purse and stalk them
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.160]   But that can't happen because you'll hear a beeping coming from your air tank
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.000]   Yeah, the the messaging is pretty cool is pretty clear too
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.560]   I just popped on to tile zone site and I'm clicking around and I don't see any
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:21.320]   Anything to assure people that oh and here's why here's how your tile can't be weaponized against you
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:26.480]   Whereas right in the press release Apple is going point by point by point if it's if the tile if excuse me
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:31.640]   I'm already saying it wrong if if our one of our devices is separated from its own for extended period time
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.080]   Whether or not the person activates it it will start chirping so you will be able to find it
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.560]   If they've also extended it to and if to any device that has NFC for a couple of really really important things
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.560]   One of them is simply for the for the benefit of the owner
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:52.400]   So that if I if I have my Android phone and I see someone's keys with a with a with an Apple tracker on it
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:57.040]   I can tap it with my end with the NFC chip on my phone and it will pop up
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.040]   Here's the owner of this device
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:05.720]   Get the back to it, but the other thing is that this and that if I if I find that someone has slipped if I find one of these things
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.960]   In my bag and I didn't put it there
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.200]   I can tap it with my with my Android phone and again according to the newsroom
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:17.120]   I can deactivate it from there so that I can least say I don't know who is trying to track me with this
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   But this thing dies right now
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.440]   And there are the things that are inside the end of the messaging for this so the fact that Apple
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:31.320]   This is this is quite an Apple product in that it's all about making sure you do this very very simple thing very very well
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.960]   It's very very easy to create a Bluetooth tracker. It's very very hard to create a tracker that
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:43.880]   Sanss sans over all the rough edges and make sure there aren't any streaks in the paint job and I'm still I would be shocked if
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:48.040]   Tile didn't respond to this by again adding a privacy
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:54.600]   privacy notice or privacy page on the on the tile the tile app.com page right now
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.240]   There there is a link for privacy, but it's only for website privacy
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:04.680]   There's a quick note that I want to make because I have seen a lot of confusion about this and have been getting questions about it
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:13.560]   The only way for that that the Bluetooth 5 is gonna work for any device that you have to do use the find my network and find these devices
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:22.640]   But for the precision tracking which is where you'll get haptic feedback as you're holding say your phone and moving it around along with visual feedback and sound cues
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.320]   That precision tracking is only available
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:32.000]   If you have a device that also has an ultra wide band chip in it and that may seem obvious
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.520]   I thought it was obvious and to me, but it's not all iPhones only iPhones since iPhone 11 right or correct
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:44.080]   Yeah, so do you if you're looking for that and you were hoping for that and you have an older iPhone before iPhone 11
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.840]   It is not available to you
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.320]   But Apple does have a list of the devices that will support
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:55.280]   UWB and then there are also some countries that the frequency for UWB is not given to
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.000]   companies to be able to use
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.040]   Yeah, let's let's also shout out for
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   Accessibility again, there are other journalists who are more experienced with accessibility than I will that though
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.200]   I'm sure gonna write some good stuff about this, but I did that did strike out to me that
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.320]   Not only will it use accessibility features to actually speak out to you
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   Okay, it's about nine feet away into your left
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.960]   But also the fact that it's using haptics inside the phone
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:26.400]   So you don't have to be able to look at a screen and look at a map and follow a follow an arpip in order to get there
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.480]   That's another really nice touch
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.480]   Cold warmer hot
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:35.200]   Uh, no ar it's just an arrow telling you which way to go. I think that's great
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.760]   It also uses the air pod style pairing
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.800]   That was always something that was a pain in the butt for me with a tracker was getting that thing paired
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.200]   Uh to your bluetooth was always tricky
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.800]   So with an iPhone
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:53.360]   This this will work well at a at a price. These are uh, not only are they well actually the price is not bad
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:58.080]   I think that's roughly what the other guys charge, but if you want any of the doohickeys
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.680]   To hold it those those are gonna
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.600]   The her mez line. Oh my god. I wish I so wish Renee were here
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.880]   Yeah, I knew and I saw that I said, oh, this is for Renee the the little even the apple
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.240]   Key tags are you know 50 bucks, but the Hermes tags if you want the luggage tag
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.120]   $449
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:27.280]   Yeah, air tag not included. I mean for some people. Yeah, some people. This is important. Yeah, and I think apple realizes that as with
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:32.400]   Phone cases there will be plenty of people who will make you give you a bag of like 10 silicone rubber
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.520]   Air tag holders for five dollars on amazon
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:39.200]   They're the store that will give you like the really really nice one or the the round up
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.640]   Oh, well, gee if i'm i'm already spending 30 dollars one. I round that up to 50. Yeah, there's no reason you have to buy the apple
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:49.600]   That's my holder the key holder. I like it that they they've not patented the circle yet
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.280]   I like it. Yeah, right. I like it. They put little icons on there. That's kind of the kind of fun kind of handy
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.880]   um
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:03.760]   Tile is is gonna was has been really complaining about this of course. They actually the CEO of tile
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.400]   testified to congress
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.800]   Uh that this was an antitrust issue
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:15.120]   And you can see why they're terrified because the way the tile network works or any of these other trackers is
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.160]   Somebody has to have a tile to see your tile
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.360]   But as you point out with a billion iPhones out there
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:27.600]   There's a lot larger chance that there'd be and you don't have to have the uwb to see the tracker. That's bloop zilly. That's every iPhone
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.240]   uh, we'll see that so
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.240]   That means you'll get you'll get pinged that your thing is somewhere
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:41.840]   By a much larger potential audience. It's going to be a huge network. I think that's that's that's pretty good
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:51.200]   Yeah, I mean, it wouldn't be surprised if go ahead Alex first. Oh Alex. Yeah. I I think that two two things one is is that uh
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.120]   You're absolutely right. I
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.320]   Apple
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.160]   A lot of people use apple maps just because it's easy
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.200]   60% I think are using apple maps just because it's easier than google maps to because they didn't have to install anything
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.520]   And so the fact that you can buy them with your phone is going to make a big difference going to be hard for tile
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.720]   The second thing is is the ultra wide band is just this is just scraping the surface
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.000]   We're really seeing
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   A lot of patience on apples outside of just slowly releasing things that allow people to get used to the ideas
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.680]   But but I think that when we think about AR in the future, we're gonna you know the ultra wide band and getting this all
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:27.040]   Kind of embedded it'll make things a lot easier. All right, by the way, I'm personalizing my air tags and you can have a different
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:34.320]   Personalization for each one. So this could just say, you know every it's not long enough to put your phone number on there
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.840]   Unfortunately, but it is long enough to put your initials
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.720]   Or I think I'm more likely kind of put what what it's tracking so I
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:50.240]   So I know what it is and you can have each one can have a of a different thing. I like the emojis though
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.000]   That's pretty fun too. There's a there's a whole selection of monochrome
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:37:00.400]   Emojis and numbers one of numbers actually it's mostly numbers and letters
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.440]   I'm gonna put a ghost on my air tag
[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:13.280]   Because I'm losing things one disappointment. It's not built into the new apple tv remote. At least they didn't say it is
[00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:20.800]   That's the thing I lose the most looking and I haven't seen it. Um, I haven't seen ultra wide band in in the new apple tv
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   Which is unfortunate
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:30.080]   Does find my solve tiles complaint that they the fact that apple last week opened it to third parties
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:37.120]   Tile noticeably did not sign up, but they could and then every iPhone would suddenly be part of the town network, right?
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.520]   Or no
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.480]   I'm not sure how it works. Yeah, I'm not sure either
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:46.560]   That's that's the sort of feature that they really that both sides are really trying to hammer home
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.960]   Which means that there's a big big fudge factor involved
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.800]   And I'm kind of loathe to simply quote what they're already saying, right?
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.960]   I think that if they if they join the the network it means that tile would automatically end up giving apple a whole bunch of
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:08.320]   Users, yeah, so you get to use the network, but you also are giving into the network is participating. Yeah, they're participating. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:15.520]   Um, I I can't see any reason why anybody with an iPhone anyway would buy anything else. Yeah
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.400]   And and that might might even reach across the aisle the people who don't have
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:29.200]   iPhones simply by virtue of the fact that like you said, that's a compelling it's a compelling argument that all everyone do you've seen that has an iPhone?
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.680]   I have a hard time believing that here in the United States
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:36.800]   Whatever it is I lose is not going to become across by somebody who has an iPhone in their pocket or in their hands
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.400]   and also
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:44.880]   The case that they're making about how carefully they're looking at privacy is another thing that's going to get a lot of people who
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:52.160]   Don't have iPhones to think that gee I've been concerned about this tracker that I got free for that someone gave me for Christmas three years ago
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:59.520]   Uh, and maybe I should maybe I should switch to something that cannot be used by my kids to figure out when I'm going to be pulling into the driveway
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.480]   I should also point out that it is cheaper
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:11.600]   Then the tile pro which is 36 bucks the cheapest tile is their sticker and that's four for 60. So there is a cheaper choice
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:18.400]   Um, but but most of the tile products are roughly the tile made is 25 bucks. They're roughly in the same
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:21.040]   uh ballparks so
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:24.800]   Uh, you know, I I don't think even tile has a price advantage here
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.120]   This is I can see why tile might have been a little bit upset about what they saw coming
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   Why was it delayed? Why did it take them a year to put that air tags out?
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.040]   I'm guessing 14 14 5
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.680]   Um, I'm guessing that it's an it was a non trivial exercise to make sure that it actually works
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:48.320]   As advertised and to get this to be integrated with everything else that they're doing with low power wireless on that device
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.880]   That's my guess. I don't have any
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:58.080]   That's I haven't heard anything specifically sub roso from anybody about this and I haven't seen anything online from someone who pretends to know either
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.720]   uh giero giermo rambo
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:07.280]   Uh, who uh is a you know a long time tweeter on subjects like this has posted a video he found in
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.880]   14 5
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.360]   A teaching you had to change the battery
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:19.040]   Uh on the tracker you turn it counterclockwise you lift it up put it in cr 20 32 in and then put it in
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.880]   I guess you don't really need a video to do that
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.240]   Well, it's pretty much as you would expect apple
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:30.800]   Uh, I guess really though there's an unknown about what kind of battery life we're gonna get that was one thing they found most
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.400]   They're saying they're saying about a year a year would be phenomenal
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.200]   Yeah, yeah, that would be phenomenal
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.720]   I
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:44.160]   Will I wonder what the what the alert is going to be when there's a low battery system probably just a pop up in your on your phone
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:50.640]   But this is an ecosystem, you know and and apple really benefits from this ecosystem and this is a perfect example of
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:53.840]   You know it all just works better if you're in the ecosystem
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.920]   Very pleased to see a new apple tv
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:06.000]   Uh, there were some features I did not expect I am very thrilled to see a new apple tv remote
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:12.240]   Yeah, yeah form factor for the new apple tv is identical to the existing 4k apple tv
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.960]   um, I don't they didn't even mention uh
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:21.280]   Well, actually they didn't mention the chip is an a 12 inside and that gives them a little bit more capability for things like hdr
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.720]   high frame rate
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.200]   Alex high frame rate wasn't as high as I thought I actually tweeted out because I I miss I misread it
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.240]   I thought it was 120 frames a second. It's not well the rumor was 120. So it's only 60
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.760]   Yeah, it looks like it at least on the on the fast moving action at 60 frames per second
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:44.960]   At 4k at hdr. I mean, so it's 4k vision. You know, it's that's it's hard to do one 20 and 4k
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.240]   Even the playstation 5 you get to choose you don't a lot of day
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.800]   But it doesn't look like at least I didn't see anything on the website that established a hundred
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:57.360]   120 frames a second even at 1080 but maybe no they're saying 60
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.880]   They're saying 60 and maybe and and partly that's content right?
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.280]   There's there isn't and very there's very little 120 frame per second content
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.000]   No, there isn't but it's
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.280]   There's a real opportunity for the apple
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.880]   I think we talked about it before but there's a real opportunity for the apple tv to do a couple different things
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:16.000]   And maybe it's in the next rev which hopefully will happen faster, which is
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.680]   uh that
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.520]   If you produce content at 120 frames a second you could you could you could in hardware
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:27.520]   Deliver it at 24 30 and 60 because they're all evenly divisible into 120 and reproduce the motion blur
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.760]   and so you would be able to actually
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:34.000]   uh, you know, the hardware could do that and um, you know generate
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.400]   The values that would get give you a very accurate 24 frames a second if you wanted to or 30 or 60 or 120
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:45.360]   And I do think that as people get used to I've done a lot of work where I've had to watch 120 a lot
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:51.040]   And uh, you start seeing all the frames like when you're used to one when you watch 120 for a week
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:57.600]   24 frames a second just looks like don't don't don't don't don't don't don't look really slow use soil used to it. Yeah
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:04.480]   But remember when uh when the gem and iman came out at 120 there were only four or five theaters in the country that could show it
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.040]   I mean this is but just imagine a million tv's that can show
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:13.600]   Yeah, that would be like suddenly people would especially sports content and they in the press release apple mitch's red bull and esp
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.840]   And others that that's going to be an obvious place
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.440]   Uh to do this. I should I should mention that I got an email from
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   Uh, someone who's working with it. I remember how we were talking about uh high frame rate last week
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.360]   And I talked about how uh roger ebert was a big fan of shows and when first came out
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.200]   I've actually heard from one of the people who's working
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:36.480]   Uh with uh with the creator show scan telling me that most of the theaters that have digital equipment right now are capable of doing high frame rate
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.040]   So it's not as though. This is like an imx experience
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.280]   Um, he sent me some papers some papers to read that kind of made that point
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.480]   But the the other thing that I wanted to that I thought was really cool that i'm kind of embarrassed that I missed out on
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:54.960]   Uh during the event they're talking about how they were not they they did of course mention how hey in this high frame rate hdr
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:59.520]   Is great for sports. We were talking to all kinds of different content providers about providing content
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.680]   But also made the point that uh
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:07.280]   Your phone the the home videos are people are shooting with their with their iPhones are shooting at high frame frame
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:11.680]   So why not be able to watch your kids videos in six. Yeah, they've also they've also upgraded
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:15.600]   Airplay so that it also works with high frame rate hdr
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:20.320]   So that on on that basis it certainly makes a lot more sense than it might have if you're asking about well gee
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.920]   Where's the high frame rate content?
[00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.120]   Can I shoot 120 frame 4k on my iphone?
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:31.440]   No, it looks like 60 is the is the highest so that might be that might be part of the reason
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:39.520]   Right. Well, we can't do it on the iphone. So why would we do it on the apple tv? It supports h it is hdmi 2.1
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:42.480]   Uh the latest hdmi spec
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:48.720]   Uh h.264 or high efficiency video codec sdr video up to 2160p
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.280]   That's 4k right 60 frames a second main main
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.480]   10 profile. What's that mean? Alex main slash main 10 profile those are the main profiles
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.320]   Those are the profiles. It should be vision. Is that the vision profile? I'm just looking at the apple here
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:06.400]   Look at that. This is on the apple page main slash main 10 profile
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:15.040]   um h that's just that's the h264 and there's just a variety of different adult b vision is main 10 profile hdr 10
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.880]   the um
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.480]   MPEG-4
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:25.840]   Up to 2.5 megabits 640 by 480 nice good for you. MPEG-4. Thanks for showing up 30 frames a second
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:29.840]   Okay, we won't be using that much
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.800]   Um, so yeah, those are the those are the specs
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.960]   You know what it's a it's a good step up exactly the same price is it's a
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.040]   4k
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.000]   Pro-genitor
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.800]   I think the main reason to get it is the remote and by the way the remote is sold separately for 60 bucks
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.920]   The other main reason to get it is the color the color correction. Oh, oh, let's talk about the color correction
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.960]   Like I was like
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   I was like
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.200]   At all there was no
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.960]   That was the that was the sleeper of the whole thing was like oh I can put my phone
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.200]   Up to my tv and have it actually be proper color come on
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:10.720]   Like it's going to change everything like it's going to change everything about way people watch movies because no one ever gets their tv
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.800]   Right. Yeah, you know like and and well scott
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:19.440]   What gets you so he said bring in a calibrator because yeah, we have yeah, um and he brings in um
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:26.160]   It's like a color remitter some sort of screen measurement tool that works much like what they looks like they're doing
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.280]   The second is you have a phone you have a phone that can see out and in and and look at the thing
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:38.000]   So you put the front of the phone up against the tv screen and they said that you're using the light sensor in the phone to measure
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.480]   Is that what is going on there, Alex? They they you'll it could use the camera
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.720]   I don't know why would you why would use the camera?
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.400]   Yeah, yeah, I could use a light sensor. It could use the light
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.920]   Whatever it's using to decide what the color of the light is it can it can be remember
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:57.520]   It's doing it so it will the apple tv will show you an outline of the phone on the screen and say go up to this
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:00.000]   Put it on there so they can obviously in the
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.880]   Gallop rating software project something right into that thing and then your phone
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:10.400]   Because it's in contact with the with the tv will know what to expect and say okay. That's it
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.880]   Now one thing somebody pointed out is it's not going to fix there's a lot of things that are on the tv
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.120]   That it can't change. It's only changing what the apple tv sends the tv
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:24.800]   Well, but it's but here's the deal is that what the reason it's so important is is that you have a sensor on the other end of all of those things
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:31.520]   And so the apple tv is literally making a correction for whatever you're now the problem is every time you change the color of your tv
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:38.640]   You have to you have to redo it, but and everything you watch not on the apple tv is going to look bad compared to it
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.960]   But like a family like mine. We don't watch any thall app. It's not on the apple tv
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:46.880]   It's like every like we have youtube tv and and everything else
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.400]   We don't watch anything that's not on the apple tv and and and here's the funny thing is
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:54.720]   Once you calibrate it to the apple tv and it looks great on the apple tv
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:00.720]   You won't use any other piece of hard right forget roc because it won't it won't work because it's the correction is in the apple tv
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.840]   Not in the tv and so that's going to be a lock-in
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:08.640]   So that's that if they have an apple my room it would be that they already have an apple tv
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.160]   They're probably not going to be skipping around for roku for oh, I do all of them
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.600]   But I do all of them. I think I think I think it's a great feature
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.720]   and it's it's going to be great for the people who
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.680]   Are affected by that there are a lot of people that
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:28.720]   There there I still go to some houses where they've got like hard matting white screen turned on and all their videos are like all squishy and weird
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.560]   And I have to like take the phone up take the remote away from them and fix it
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.560]   So I'm not sure if that's going to be like a selling thing
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.080]   It's still I think that apple is still struggling to
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:46.080]   Really make the argument that here is why this box is worth $200 or $179
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.160]   I'm because
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:54.480]   The high frame rate is great, but you can already buy a chromecast with google tv from the google play store
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.920]   50 bucks and it does 60 frames per 60 fps 4k
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.280]   HDR
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:04.560]   It's there are a lot of nice features, but there isn't that breakthrough feature that says here's why this is $200
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:10.240]   I keep comparing it to the Nvidia shield in my living room, which is essentially a gain console
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.520]   It can be a meat it can not it's not just a media streamer client
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.160]   It can stream media directly from the device it can record tv it can play games native
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.280]   Scaling has all sorts of things exactly
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:28.720]   upscale 1080 to 4k on the fly and it's actually very very good and it doesn't cost a penny more than this apple tv
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:32.880]   Which is not much not not visibly better than a hundred dollar
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.120]   devising by anywhere else as
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:38.080]   uh, mica said that oper said it's
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.480]   It's a billion phones in someone's pocket
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:45.760]   The ecosystem is you know providing a great solution for that ecosystem is the is the is what gets you there
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:50.000]   Is that I you know, I don't look at other things because i'm like, well, how am I gonna time my phone into that?
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.880]   Like I just I just you know, like at all that's that's that's gonna be the most that that is I think you're true
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:58.640]   You're right, but that's one that's one of the most insulting things you can say about it advice
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:01.920]   Oh, well, no, it's not it's too much and it's not appreciably better
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.360]   But hey, I already have an iPhone so I don't want to deal with something else
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:10.320]   I don't that's like hopefully that's not that's not apples like banner above apple park
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.360]   It's pretty good
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.000]   But the thing is is that like there's a lot of people that are
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.320]   That aren't that can see the difference. They don't really know how to color correct
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.320]   They're not ready to bring somebody into color correct their monitor
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:23.440]   I can see them buying this because they want a better experience
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.680]   They want that to look nicer and they don't know how
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:31.200]   And they would buy it just for that that feature that oh, I can finally like click this in and all the colors will be right
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.040]   And there's people that for 200 bucks. They'll do that because the colorimeter cost 200
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:40.880]   But I wonder what the percentage of people are that never take their tv out of store mode or vivid mode
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.360]   They sell the plastic on the bezel
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.160]   A lot of people care
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.000]   It's majority but apples never been after the apple is on the majority of anything
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.240]   You know and they they just have the ones that you know
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:59.920]   There's a there's a with apple users. I think that there are people who care but also don't care so much
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:03.600]   They want to work hard at it. Do you think this so it's can you so
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:06.720]   I mean it's cool. Do you think it will make a difference though?
[00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:08.800]   I mean, I guess we won't know until we get one
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.640]   But do you think you will see there will be an appreciable difference like you'll just go
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:14.960]   Oh, yeah, everything looks better on the apple tv. Oh, yeah
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:20.000]   Oh, yeah, because the thing is is it don't it could create it could theoretically. I mean, I don't know how it works
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.680]   So I haven't seen it so I don't know but it could theoretically be creating a lot that is basically converting
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.880]   The apple tv could theoretically convert
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.360]   Build a 3d
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:35.440]   Cube that converts from whatever messed up you have on your tv
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:39.280]   To the right colors because it just tells the apple tv to put those colors out
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:44.480]   So if you're really bright and really contrasty it makes them really not contrast it just fixes it. Yeah, it just fixes it
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.200]   So it so it theoretically I mean, it's well within the technology is how we use LUTS is how we
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.520]   A lookup table is a 33 point or whatever number of point
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.960]   3d cube that is a color transform
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:02.480]   Colors go in colors go out, you know and so you can build a transform that makes sure that those pixels
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:08.720]   This is what Dolby has been working towards for you know a decade and so more and so is apple tv still a hobby
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.840]   That's what apple famously called it
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:18.400]   I don't think I don't see any evidence that they're again. There's innovation happening elsewhere else
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   There's a big business for them
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:24.320]   I it just doesn't look like they've got you look at all the other products that they do and all they
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:30.000]   Really all the the energy level that goes up whenever apple talks about it promotes a certain product
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.200]   And then you look at the same energy level when they talk about the apple tv
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.800]   And you also you also again you look at the other things that are in the market
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:42.640]   You either see tremendous innovation at a higher price point or you see we're going to put all of our engineering efforts to making sure
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:46.640]   That you can this is not just going to be the thing you plug into the really nice 65 inch
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.200]   120 Hertz tv you've got in the living room
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.520]   We're going to make we want to get this price down
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.480]   Solo that you have all the features that you absolutely want
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.560]   But you can also have it in the kitchen tv and in the bedroom tv and in the kids tv's
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:03.760]   And that's we're not seeing either end of that kind of innovation on apple tv and that's why it's disappointing to me
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.960]   It's it still looks like it's a hundred dollars too expensive if apple
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   If apple said all we did was we dropped the price of the existing 4k product down to $99 and we added
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:19.280]   60 60 frames per second. I would think that was one of the biggest things they've done for the apple tv in five years
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.600]   mike you uh
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:24.560]   Are you a fan of the apple tv remote
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.920]   not the current one no
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.720]   I use it. In fact, I I bought these elago
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:38.240]   Go makes great accessories for things that you wouldn't normally expect including the apple tv remote
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:44.000]   Oh, they have a hold because I have their holder for the apple watch. It looks like a classic mac. I love it. Yes. Yes
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:51.920]   Yes, so they have a classic mac from my remapel tv remote that would be funny. No, but so it's just a little oh, it's a little rubber thing holder
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:56.080]   Yeah, and that makes it a little bit easier to hold and also keeps it protected
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:58.080]   But this this next one without that
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:04.800]   a huge honking glass pad at the top and a little bit more it's a mixture of tactile
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.280]   and and
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.760]   What's the word i'm looking for tactile and differential control?
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.200]   It will help you
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:15.040]   Be able to know where you are with it. So i'm pretty pumped about that
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:21.280]   But as you noted it does not seem to include find my so that's bizarre
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:27.440]   Because I know that is bizarre now and I want to put a air tag on my apple. It's as big as the apple remote
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.080]   Uh, I I told the story
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:37.200]   at a previous mac break weekly, but I had a very difficult few hours with my mom trying to explain how to use the apple tv remote
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:44.560]   I wanted to change some settings and uh that trackpad at the top of the remote really baffled her like what that's a trackpad
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.640]   So it makes sense that they've now separated that they put a ring around it
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:54.240]   The whole thing is now aluminum like the old apple tv remote and the the trackpad's still there
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.720]   but it's in a smaller circle in the middle plus there's a
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:04.960]   Touch-enabled clickpad which even has ipod style circular rotation for scrubbing you would end up at that mic
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.640]   I used that that was a big improvement. Yes, because that is so I
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:14.000]   After having used the apple tv remote for years have gotten used to it
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:17.520]   But if there's one thing that I hear my partner
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:24.400]   Crip about more than anything else in the entire world impossible is just using that apple tv remote so much trouble
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:28.560]   Yeah, and yeah, the scrubbing and you don't know like if you tap sometimes without clicking
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.600]   It will start if you don't and it's all over the place
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:36.640]   So moving that ring just makes a lot more sense and will be easier to move where you want to
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:39.760]   To get back to the part of the the scene that you want
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:44.640]   And hopefully the developers will support it better than they do right now
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.080]   I mean for instance
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.920]   If you open up youtube tv it barely works right with the with the with the thing, but if you open up your phone it works fine
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.840]   Right, so it's it it's completely not supporting the protocol correctly
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.800]   You know within it. So hopefully developers can ask
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.400]   Because that's the Google d do it right a
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.760]   I want to show their app is kind of a disaster, but but the
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.760]   but the
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.160]   Uh, but that if that scroll works well
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.640]   I think sometimes I think it's I have a theory that they don't make it work well because it makes it harder to skip the ads
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.800]   Yeah, it would not watch you scroll
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.400]   I think that when the basic things that did to improve it was just simply
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:23.120]   Uh, you can if you're if looks like the sort of remote that where if you simply
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:27.120]   Reach to the armrest of your sofa or the or your nightstand and pick it up
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:33.360]   Your hand can tell you that you've got the you've got the buttons oriented. Yes, and that you can operate it. I mean this is this
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:38.800]   Both ends of the remote are the same it's impossible to know you don't know
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.440]   And it's and it's too and it's too thin. It doesn't really hold it in your hand
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.480]   It doesn't really fit in your hand very well. It really is it seems like this is another
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:50.000]   another example of the transition between the
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.120]   super super
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:57:00.320]   Design above everything else focus of apples hardware design that it seems that that seems like now an older era where
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:05.760]   Routinely they would come up with these terrible terrible designs that they just they don't fit your hand. Well, they they're not ergonomic
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:09.200]   They don't really they're not satisfying as a as a touch clicky interface
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.440]   But gosh, they really does look great in the in the poster in the in the ads to it
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.680]   This is more practical, but they're keeping that crappy apple mouse from the new mouth. Oh, yeah
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:23.040]   So they don't they haven't given up entirely this it's it's a deck. It's a decorative object
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:30.160]   I think that I think that if you when you charge it with the or thunderbolt. It's actually an essential oil heater
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.280]   It's possible
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.200]   Just leave it on a desk and get you know keep your microsoft mouse under there so you know
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:42.000]   Peperman oil. Yeah, just the new remote has moved the Siri button
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:48.640]   Thank God because that was another problem was accidentally hitting that every time it's now on the side where you'll still probably accidentally hit it
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:56.720]   They've added a on off switch, which is great a pack actual power control the TV. Yeah hard to believe wow and a mute button which
[00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:02.880]   No one ever understood why there was no mute button on the apple remote. It's like that's the first button I hit
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.600]   Yeah, hmm. Anyway
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:09.600]   Anyway, I think that's the reason to buy the new apple tv is just to get the new remote
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.720]   But as I pointed out you could buy it remote sold separately
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:17.040]   If you want so you can buy it for your old feels like they heard some people who watch television
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.880]   In the last five years they heard us they heard us bitching and moaning
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.880]   Uh, the back looks the same gigabit ethernet. That's nice
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:29.440]   I I am actually going to put it on a hard wire with gigabit. So that's nice
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:34.640]   802.11 a x y 5 6 that's an improvement but my mo
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:41.280]   Dual band simultaneous dual band that's interesting both 2.4 and 5 gig can be live at the same time
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.640]   Which would help you throughput? It also supports mica
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:46.240]   threads
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:52.080]   I'm very pumped about this. So home pod mini was the first device from apple that supported thread over home kit
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:57.360]   Uh, this apple tv new apple tv 4k marks the second device from apple that has thread built in
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:04.000]   Uh thread is a new protocol for communicating between different smart home devices
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.480]   It uh is a really robust
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:14.160]   Networking protocol that's completely different from from what we have now and will allow devices not only to
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:19.520]   Uh continue to communicate with one another but also kind of form a mesh network throughout your home
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.800]   So what that means in the end is that you have a far more reliable connection
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   And low power devices like contact sensors and things like that can respond instantly
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.880]   I've got some different automation set up in my home where when a door opens
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   It turns on a light somewhere else in the house so that the person can go up the stairs
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:43.360]   And all that stuff happens immediately where before that was not the case because it was usually a bluetooth le situation
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:51.120]   Some companies have jumped on the thread bandwagon a little bit early and there are some devices out there now that i've been able to try
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:52.240]   but um
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:58.080]   Now that the home pod mini is joined by the apple tv it will just give more people a chance to experience thread
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:02.960]   And in many ways not even realize that uh thread is kind of part of their smart home network
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:09.840]   Which is exciting because this is one of those technologies where they say it just works and it sincerely truly just works
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:16.000]   It's a multi industry can multi company consortium that's put that's uh supporting this, aren't they?
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.920]   Is this a change? Yeah, this is a change in this ship strategy because home kit was there
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.840]   In fact the apple tv was a home kit hub. Is it still a home kit hub?
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.240]   Yes, and that's the important thing to understand is that um home kit
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:37.840]   Right now supports bluetooth as a communication protocol and Wi-Fi as a communication protocol. It's at thread
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:45.680]   Yeah, so it is home kit as a framework versus an actual communication method. Okay, so it could use any of the three
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:51.520]   Yes and thread i am all in on thread right now and uh in fact
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.400]   Uh a really quick uh shout out. I have not announced this anywhere else yet
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:02.640]   Uh, but next month we will be having on smart tech today the vice president of
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.440]   uh technologies for the thread group on uh smart tech today
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:13.840]   So if you're interested in thread at all, we'll be talking to him at that uh at that time. Nice
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.880]   That's this week
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:21.200]   Uh just start no uh it's early may i'm early may locking
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.840]   Yeah, locking it down as we see exactly probably may uh eighth, but uh could be the following week
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.240]   So yeah coming up coming up coming soon
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.880]   To a stt near you
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:40.080]   Anything else to say about the apple tv. It's 179 bucks for the 32 giversion 64 gig cost 199
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:44.800]   That's the same as the old prices order april 30th just like the air tag
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.600]   Uh actually your tag you can pre-order on friday
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.200]   The apple tv is uh order april 30th. It won't come to the second half of may
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:55.280]   So you'll be waiting at least a month for that
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:01.040]   I don't know why anyone would get the spend $20 less than get the 32 rather than 64
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.000]   I don't know why but it would spend $20 more and get the 64
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.320]   What do you what are you storing on your apple tv?
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:13.200]   Well, it depends on how it can slow down is it for games for caching oh caching
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:18.240]   But god 32 gigs that's that's that's lots of hours of tv
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.440]   It's like 20. I mean, it's 20 bucks
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.800]   I just say like 20 bucks than I just do bigger bigger one. Yeah, also apps cost you so it's not
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.360]   It's it's not useless. I
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.000]   My pre my preference is to say that if you if I have a device that has uh,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.720]   Un uh, un-upgradable storage and memory
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:38.240]   My right to get yeah
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.840]   Yeah, because if if it adds an extra couple years of life to a product
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:45.920]   It's not so much that I don't I don't want to have to replace this thing in four years
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:48.080]   But it might give me that extra year
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:54.480]   Where if I held off for another year I got the one that was absolutely revolutionary as opposed to the one which is just a marginal upgrade
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.800]   I only have a handful of apps on my apple tv
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:02.000]   But I guess if I if there was an arcade game that I said, oh, I gotta play this on apple tv that might be worse
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.720]   I I don't that's a that's a healthy amount of storage
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.160]   I I was running into the into that that ceiling
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.080]   on my google on the google Chromecast device that I have on my uh, on my
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.040]   On my bedroom tv like the new one that app that google came up with just last year
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:19.360]   And that's the one where it's like, uh, okay
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.840]   So I can only I can only have 14 apps and none of them none of them was like, you know
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.640]   The last of us the the the the tv version was like, but this is just like media players
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.120]   Why are either why am I running out of space as well apps?
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:37.840]   Well, probably the os takes a bit of that space. I guess Alex has a also also android is probably not very efficient for 20 bucks
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:44.880]   Why not get the 64 gig? You're gonna keep it for years. I mean, I don't know why mine have been there since they came out. Yeah
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:52.400]   Uh, let's take a little break and uh, we will then cover I think probably the two biggest stories
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:57.920]   Which are new iMacs and new ipad pros Alex Lindsay's hero 9/0 media
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   He's also of course rapidly becoming the empressario of the of the office hours
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.000]   Gang
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.040]   We have a lot of fun. Thank you for a much away from having a compound. Yeah. Yeah, you need the office hours compound
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.960]   I went into your uh
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:19.680]   Your uh discord because you had I was curious how it's how you were doing it and you sent me an invite. Thank you
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:27.120]   And uh, that's the compound right there. You got a lot of stuff going on. There's a lot going on in that discord. Yeah
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.320]   Wow, you know you can't tell people public that I sent you a discord because there's a rule that you have to come early
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.680]   I made different. I am special hosts
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:37.840]   You guys are special
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.240]   I because I wanted to see it. We were talking about it. I'm not special for many things
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.120]   So, but I understand that
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:48.880]   Everybody has to show up. So the way we do our discord you don't have to pay for it
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.360]   But you do have to show up in mukana for our show at 6 40 a.m
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.920]   And if you don't like we distributed it last i'll make you a deal i'll show up at 6 40 tomorrow
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:02.240]   With that we know what we should do is show up you should come on and talk about the twit club
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.920]   Okay, come on for an hour and then you can you can yell at me and tell me what if no i am and all that
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.000]   I think I think it's such a great idea. I'd love to have you come on talk about it. So we'll all right
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:19.840]   I have to say you are a stern taskmaster because before you can join get into the club
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.680]   Uh, the uh, Alex's, uh, you know office hours discord
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:27.920]   You he says you need to use your real name first name space last name
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.120]   ideally with your location and please
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.560]   Use a headshot with a white background. It looks so much nicer
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:40.240]   It does look nicer. Well, here's the funny thing is I did it all for you, Alex. I did
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:43.200]   See it
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.400]   It's a nicer experience. That's all that's all that's all i'm trying to say
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.160]   Well, I have to admit using just the generic discord icon. It's not good. So at least having some avatars good
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:57.520]   But we let our we let our discord people it's a little different yours is open to the public ours
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.280]   You have to be a member of the club. So I let people use any handle they want
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:06.240]   Your avatars can look like whatever it makes you I mean we we just spent the we spent an hour and a half
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.720]   Just picking at each other's mics this morning. I know
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.960]   I know you guys are great
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.960]   And by the way, Colleen kelly
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:20.800]   Was uh on the show last week and that's up on youtube now you can listen to it. Yep. Did you give her a hard time about her mike?
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.920]   Uh, I did not I you know
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:30.480]   We did a little we did some pre-work on it. It was it was but but yeah, I think i'll send her a kid
[01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.120]   So
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:39.840]   She I gotta tell you though. She just she's brilliant. She was cracked everybody's brain open for everybody beach who is at microsoft
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.760]   Yeah for everybody who doesn't know of course
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:45.680]   Colleen was the first engineer and really a lot of the things we do today on
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:51.760]   On twitter because of her she designed a whole bunch of stuff including skyposaurus and and all of that
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.840]   Uh went to google. She she told me the day I hired her. She came she was still in a student at san jose state
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:03.120]   And she said uh, she was a sociology student, which really cracks me up
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:10.160]   Uh, she said I want an internship and after I talked to her for a second. I'm not giving you an internship. You're hired. She was clearly
[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.760]   You know
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:16.240]   Brilliant. We were very lucky to have her, but she always said if google hires me if google more for me
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:18.400]   She's a job. I'm taking it. She like loved google
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:23.360]   Uh, and so when in fact I remember when the first google android phone came out the g1
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.520]   This is how long ago that was she couldn't wait for it. She was so excited about it
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:30.000]   Phone from google it's gonna be the greatest than she got it. I'm well
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.720]   Wasn't so great, but uh now she's at facebook doing really well and yeah
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:42.560]   Uh, that's gonna be an episode to watch for sure. Yeah, Colleen. Yeah
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:53.280]   streaming engineer extraordinaire exactly gotcha. I think her her technical term is uh, she's the cobra commander of the video special forces
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.320]   Literally, that's her technical. That's her. That's on her card
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:04.000]   Yeah, of course, of course it is of course it is she also has a stable of very nice cars, which you were borrowing for a while
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.720]   If I were you, I never would have bought a car. I just keep borrowing Colleen's
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:13.920]   Yeah, that's when you're driving around a hundred forty thousand dollar car. You're like, I think I should give it back
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:16.800]   Before I wreck it. Yeah
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.840]   So
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:23.600]   Uh, by the way, you'll probably be happy to hear this but uh, there's a story on windows central just crossed that says discord says
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.280]   It is not going to make a deal with microsoft and will remain independent
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.520]   I'm actually happy about that discord's doing a great job on their own. They don't need microsoft
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.440]   It's pretty it's a pretty cool platform. It's amazing. They're always adding new stuff
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.720]   We just just like you we spent a couple months researching what we were going to you or at least a month
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.160]   With a whole bunch of us looking at it like is there anything other than discord?
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.600]   It was kind of like is there anything else in the discord?
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:49.840]   We just want to make sure before we like start a building a community and it was the best one
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:56.560]   There's a good open source a server called matrix and if you know, I guess if you didn't want to be on somebody's platform
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.640]   That would be a good choice, but um
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:05.040]   The features that they're adding they just we used before the show. We were using the stage feature to talk to people
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.560]   Uh, in fact, we'll probably start doing that in a lot of our shows because it's such a great way to get uh, audio
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:15.840]   Feedback and we're gonna look at video too. There's we last night we tested or sunday night
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:20.480]   Man, I was because it was last night we tested video and that worked pretty that was pretty cool. It's kind of like zoom
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:24.240]   Andy and i co also here w gbh in boston
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:32.560]   Great to have you i h n a t k o dot com and rene richy has the day off micro sergeant very kindly
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.160]   Agreed to stop by from i o s today
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.720]   Thank you
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.920]   Micah
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.240]   Somebody in the twit community our forums
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.840]   Is mica from scran i think he's from scran he has a poster from scran those people behind him
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:49.840]   There's a post is his faces of scran
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.480]   You're not folks. I'm just a big officer
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:57.760]   Those are the different characters from the office array in a very cool
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:04.560]   Uh graph or chart i mean i was from scran he was very disappointed that you were from scran
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:12.640]   Last last no and not to be i showed they brought to you by express vpn
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.280]   I will not forget
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.920]   The the news story a few weeks ago
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.520]   Uh the judge who was hearing a case
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:28.720]   Uh, some people wanted to do a class action lawsuit against google because incognito mode wasn't really private and the judge said
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.360]   Wait, you're telling me
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.360]   incognito mode
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:37.920]   Doesn't hide what i'm doing from google and they said no she said class approved
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:43.680]   Uh, if you've ever browsed an incognito mode don't be fooled. It's not as incognito as you think
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:50.640]   You know, it's like the chrome browser itself a google product google has made its fortune by tracking your movements online
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:54.880]   That uh five billion dollar class action lawsuit
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:02.000]   Is accusing it of secretly collecting user data i google tells you when you're launching cognito mode that
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:08.240]   But the name even even private browsing and safari the name implies somehow it's private
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.120]   it's only private from people who live with you because
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:15.760]   Google still sees everything you do. So how do you actually make yourself
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:19.600]   As invisible as possible online with express vpn
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:26.800]   See even an incognito mode google sees everything you do they your your wet your brat your internet service provider sees everything you do
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:33.200]   Data brokers can still buy and sell your data every google search is directly connected to you
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:39.920]   Uh data harvesters can use your ip address to identify you in your location, but when you're using express vpn
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:44.400]   Your connection is rerouted through their encrypted servers your ip address
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:52.080]   Is mass because every time you turn on express vpn you're given a random ip address shared by other express vpn customers
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:55.360]   Google your ISP nobody knows it's you
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.360]   Makes it much harder for third parties to identify you and harvest your data
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:05.040]   That's just one of many reasons to use express vpn data security data privacy
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.960]   The ability to watch content from other countries
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:12.640]   And the best part is it's so easy to use express vpn
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.520]   It works on your phone your laptop your smart tv
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.560]   You can even work on some routers and it's so fast you won't even know you're running it
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:24.880]   Sometimes i'll turn it on and forget leave it on for weeks that finally go oh
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.160]   Um, but why not leave it on if it's that fast one button you're protected
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:38.960]   So if you really want to go incognito protect your privacy secure yourself with the number one rated vpn the only one i use express vpn.com

[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.120]   Okay, uh
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:10.880]   This was so i had i had it in my mind in fact lisa this morning asked me okay. What are they gonna announce and i said well
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.080]   I'm sure they're gonna announce new ipads
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:20.400]   Maybe they'll announce their tags even less pop maybe even more of us maybe
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:26.400]   Apple tv and oh there was this rumor they might announce color i max but that seems
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.120]   Highly unlikely they did it all
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:35.360]   Let's talk about the new i max uh what immediately became apparent they have the m1 in them
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:40.400]   Uh, it is a as soon as they said 24 inch display. I said oh
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:48.880]   These are the low ones low end ones just like they did low end macbook pro and the mac mini in the macbook air
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   With the m1 chip. This is an m1 chip version of the i mac
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:02.640]   Yeah, i don't know the i don't think they actually mentioned whether this was a switch from the first m1
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:08.480]   Um i was looking at the i o there are four usb type c type ports in the back of it
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:12.560]   Yeah, but only two of them yeah as i saying two of them two of them a thunderbolt which might
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.720]   With on the one hand might make you think oh well
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:19.200]   They added some extra i o to this m1 or but it might think that it might make you think that oh well
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:27.040]   No, they just essentially added like a usb bridge a usb hub inside to spit out those extra high speed usb 4 ports
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:29.280]   Yeah, i feel like
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:34.160]   You know they didn't mention clock speed but we do know that the m1 that they've used in the first three max
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:41.840]   Are all the same the same clock speed the same number of gpu's and cpus actually that's not quite true
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.960]   The macbook pro has eight gpu's there's only seven i think in the macbook air
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:53.200]   Uh, and there's a fan in the macbook pro and so but basically this is the same chip across the board
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.760]   I would bet you since they're calling it the m1
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:59.760]   I bet it's the same. Yeah, i'm looking at that at that
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:03.360]   Let's put everything up on one screen and make you screenshot at oral school miss at all
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.160]   And is just labeled the m1 not the m1x not the m1 anything else. Yeah, yeah
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:15.040]   So who is this for? Why are they why are they even why are they even doing this? What is the what is the plan?
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.600]   Stan
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:23.280]   It's time to expand the m1 to m1's authority to uh more parts of the of the product line
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.840]   Right now the at this point the only part of the product line that's missing is is the pro
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:33.120]   Excuse me the mac pro the high end and end of the line and the i'm pro the higher end
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:36.480]   There's no 27 h i'mac right so yeah
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.560]   And a lot of people are complaining on social media right now or excuse me not complaining
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:47.120]   But noting that they would be all over 27 inch m1 i'mac but not for a not for 24 inch one
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.280]   Uh, but this is it seems as though
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:55.920]   All the stuff they're talking about this is more about the design which is totally appropriate for like a lower and i'mac
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.360]   I
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.200]   One of the things that's consistent about their messaging when they design i'mac
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:06.800]   Apart from the past two or three iterations has always been that this is designed to be as invisible as possible
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:13.200]   This is designed to be as ergonomic as possible. They're making it's very and they're and they're and they're and they're making the point explicitly
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.760]   Uh that not just it's not just thin and invisible
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:19.840]   But we put the really cool fancy colors on the back side of it on the front side of it
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.240]   It's more muted to make sure it kind of blends in
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:29.520]   People usually first see the back of your i'mac and it's not not in my house. You never see the back
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.240]   I'm back. What are they talking about? You see the back of my head. Yeah, yeah exactly
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:37.280]   But I guess if you come into an office maybe
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.040]   Um this to me really looked like what the original
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:46.160]   Bondi blue i'mac's were which was a home computer
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:51.280]   Not a more computer not a high-end professional computer, but a home computer
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:57.120]   And they're making it so clean that even the ethernet cable doesn't go into the back of the i'mac
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.040]   We're at another cable to your desk, but it goes down in the power supply on the floor
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:03.760]   I think that that's kind of telling
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:07.120]   It's there's there is a there is a trade-off for that of course
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:13.040]   That means instead of having a standard like d three prong power plug that you can buy anywhere
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:18.480]   Now you are dealing with a custom thing that can't be replaced and it's a mag safe connector on the back too
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:21.840]   Which is which is which is certainly nice may as well extend that
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:26.720]   Um, it's uh the whole point is that I did like write down a few quotes
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:30.240]   They actually said we wanted to look in terms in terms of the color in the design
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:32.400]   We wanted it to look optimistic
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.200]   And and there and there
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:39.680]   Uh, what else they say I think they the back brings a sense of joy to every space
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.560]   Which is which and 2021 is a very very good year in which to say this will make you happy
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.720]   And we we're no longer making this available in gray and darker gray
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:52.560]   We're actually going to make you happy with the colors that are available for this a little
[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:56.320]   It's pointed that the chin is still there the rumors said maybe that was going away
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:59.360]   But that is where the cpu is and the bezels are not
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.280]   Not only are they not small. They're actually white
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:08.240]   They're quite so they stand out or maybe they don't stand out. That's why they're white
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:12.720]   Yeah, I don't know you need a place to you need a place to hold it if you're going to be tilting it
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.800]   One way or another and rotating it so I don't I can I can hold
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:21.200]   I'm not one of those people guess. I'm not one of those people who gets upset about. Oh, no, there's a bezel
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.240]   Right. Well, I apple apple doesn't get it. I feel like this is honestly
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:31.840]   This is really low end there there's this is replacing the 21 inch iMac
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:38.320]   This is uh, this is a low end device. Who's going to get that bright orange by the way? Wow. It looks like aren't sure, but
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:47.040]   Well, it's it's okay. Also people be happy with color be happy get orange. Here's the boy. Where's my dark gray
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:49.280]   There's a there's a light gray
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:55.440]   But they didn't have a dark gray for iMac except for the iMac. Do you want you want the Amish version of this? I want
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:57.840]   No, I don't do happy
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.080]   Serious business
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.160]   So they say they're heard of her socks sitting for edition
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:08.640]   Universes are different to our suffering. We must accept this they did bring touch ID to the iMac
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:14.800]   That's really great. It's uh, you have to have a special keyboard for it. Not all the keyboards have the touch ID built in
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:21.120]   Uh, one of the keyboards has instead of touch ID has what uh, uh, uh, was it an on off switch?
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:25.360]   What was it on the upper right hand on that one? Oh, I don't recall they showed something else
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.440]   So I think it depends on the keyboard you get
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:32.640]   I do like the fast users switching as part of touch ID. So if you have this as a family
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.480]   Isn't that cool? I Mac at home. Yep
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:40.320]   Each person can touch and switch to their account or your kids can really mess with you by just walking up and touching in the touch ID
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.320]   And walk as you're in the middle of something. I mean a zoom meeting here
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:51.760]   Um, so that's and they also by the way the keyboards the magic mouse the magic trackpad or are in matching colors
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:56.240]   So you'll get but why do they keep that again the garbage magic mouse?
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.760]   They even had the nerve to say people love the magic mouse
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:02.880]   Yeah, they found two so technically other people okay
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:06.720]   They think that was I was I thought that was a little nervy
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.720]   You mean there's still making that mouse that you charge from underneath
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:15.120]   Do they do they love it as a static object to just simply regard?
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:21.040]   Academically or do they love actually using it? I love it for heating up my tea. I use it all the time
[01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.120]   You love the magic mouse. I don't love it. It keeps that door open boy
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.720]   You know if you if you if they have a door the big thing is jam that sucker underneath
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.960]   I get used to the horizontal and so the when I go back to a scroll on it
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.440]   I do I have both I have both of them
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.560]   But when I'm like editing like being able to throw back and forth it really is
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.960]   Oh, I touched in there of everybody in the chalam
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.760]   Elon says I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:48.160]   The horizontal edge you find
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:53.680]   I don't love it, but I use it. That's you know, you know this design really isn't for everybody
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.240]   I had someone with a certain design sophistication
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:01.440]   Uh for my iMac pro a beautiful dark gray magic mouse track
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:07.600]   magic trackpad keyboard. They're all in a cupboard somewhere. I don't use any of them
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.360]   So
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.080]   I have I have I have like I have a three button mouse because I a bunch of my became with um pro apps require them
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:17.760]   But but my day to day is on the magic. Yeah, I like I like a scroll wheel
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:24.400]   But my main mouse is an alien where mouse that has 15 buttons on it. I could I could not be able to go back and forth
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:29.040]   You're like that's the thing for me is yes, Alex. That's it. That's why I use my magic mouse track
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.080]   It's right cause of that
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:34.240]   For a bad feature. I will I use here you go. That's a good mouse
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:40.720]   Give me a big curved lump of plastic that has clicky buttons in it. Yeah, that's why I'm getting a lighter
[01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:45.760]   Andy you'll appreciate this. I bought 10 of them some years ago because that's it
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.760]   That's the mouse and I'm a lefty so it works fine for a lefty
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:53.840]   And I just you know anybody comes over and says I need a mouse. I got well, I got one over here
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.720]   I bought I bought a box of I know kidding
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.320]   I I got like such a deal and someone had a must have like cleared out in the entire office
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:00.720]   Yeah
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.280]   I have well
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:02.560]   I went to the MIT flea market
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.680]   Someone had a box of like 20 from them and they took like 12 bucks for them
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:11.520]   And I've been using like them ever since and without any complaints whatsoever. It's just exactly right for me
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:16.720]   24 inch four and a half k retina display not
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:21.600]   Not many led or anything just this you know standard display
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:27.600]   Um, it does they did make a big deal about the upgraded FaceTime camera finally 1080p
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.040]   The best camera ever in a Mac
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.280]   Which is not saying much kids. Yeah
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.360]   Um
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.680]   A poke in the eye with the softest stick apple has ever mentioned point out Alex
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:46.720]   You've told me this that you don't get 1080p on uh on zoom unless you have special privileges that seven 20s plenty
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.680]   Well 720s higher
[01:22:49.680 --> 01:22:53.120]   But but yeah, I mean it's it's 1080 right now. Are you 1080 on our show?
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:55.520]   Uh, it should be
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:02.400]   Did we did we get that we had to ask for dinner? You're you're joining my my mode. We're going to you so you you give us 10 20
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.880]   1080 yeah, yeah, I think so
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.680]   Yeah, it looks better. You're right. Yeah, it's it's sharper
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:10.880]   I mean the more than more than the resolution
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:13.120]   I mean the resolution is really great that they finally did it
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:16.320]   It just been apple has had just the worst camera for so long
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:23.040]   And so you basically had to use another camera if you want to do anything that's remotely good looking on
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.760]   Now you have something that looks good and the
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:29.040]   You're putting all the tone mapping and color and everything else into it
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:35.040]   It could look better than almost anything else going to use that m1 technology that's on the macbook pro and macbook air
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:41.760]   Yeah, it also does that weird zoom effect. So I guess it'll follow you is that was that on this one too?
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.160]   Or is that only the eye?
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:49.680]   Okay, but they did make a big they did a whole hunk on the camera on the on the iMac
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:55.280]   Talking about how it's the not just 1080p, but it's also bigger sensor than they're using computational video
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:00.320]   So it'll give you because I have no idea my iMac pro. I mean it's a pretty good camera
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.800]   I mean it's it's it's also nice because if you want to yes
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.320]   You might be only streaming out 720p, but if you have a higher definition camera
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:10.320]   It'll be a better 720p, but also maybe you can do a digital zoom
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.640]   That you won't actually be throwing away pickles for it
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:15.840]   I think they I think they also gonna want it would test out the new
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:21.360]   Three microphone array with beamforming. I wonder I wonder how much of the design of this
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:28.800]   Evolved or how much more funding certain departments got like after the quarantine like after govis started
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:33.280]   They realize that here okay turns out that every computer stinks at conferencing
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.280]   Is now going to be very very that's gonna be one of the the first five questions
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:42.800]   Anybody's going to ask before they when they go into the apple store is does this new mac iMac stink at conferencing?
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.040]   Oh, I know the opposite of stinking it's
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:49.600]   Incidentally, I think it is exactly the same m1 chip because
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:58.320]   The inex less expensive iMac has the eight core cpu and the seven core gpu and the more expensive is eight and eight
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:04.880]   Uh, it has only 16 gigs of ram only two thunderbolt two points. I don't think they changed anything
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:07.360]   I think it's the same exact processor pricing
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.720]   Starts at 1299, which is the same price right?
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.760]   Or is it a little bit more? I don't remember 1499 if you want to get the uh, eight and eight
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:18.400]   And if you want to get more
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:23.360]   Memory, it's gonna it's you're gonna have to let's let's we're that you can't you can't actually configure it
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:26.640]   Like I get I can't buy it yet, but you can't go you can't do the configuration
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.680]   So we don't know what the 16 gigo cost it's 1699
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:35.520]   For 512 gigs storage eight gigs of unified memory and the eight and eight uh processor
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:37.760]   That's pretty pricey to be honest
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:40.320]   uh comparing that to a pc
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.120]   You know, that's a significant
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.200]   Well, but the but the pc you buy
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:49.360]   Of you can buy a pc that's in this that's targeted towards the same market
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.280]   Let's not talk about performance, but that's sort of market
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:55.600]   Yeah for many hundred dollars less, but if you're looking for something that will
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:01.280]   Credibly get this kind of performance, but we'll also give you this kind of style where it's not just hey
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:07.360]   We we we basically built this box out of mdf and stuck a cheap samsung's display in it
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:13.600]   Then I think I actually think this is competitive but but also for the price lineups for iMAX traditionally
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:21.200]   I think I would love to see the entry level be 1099 instead of 1299, but I don't i'm not really shocked by that
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.360]   Yeah
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:29.360]   Uh, it's interesting. They added two usb three ports. That sounds like you're right. They have a little little side car
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.120]   On there. You're not gonna you're not gonna get someone to plug in a keyboard and
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:39.920]   Oh, yeah, that's right in an external intercural hard drive and although the the keyboard they're selling with this is wireless, right?
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.560]   Yeah, but not everyone
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:48.480]   That's the biggest pain in the butt ever and the hardest answer went to answer would be why is it that I need to have a
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:54.080]   I need to have a usbc donkel on this just to have like a card reader just to have the basic stuff
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.360]   They have on my desktop
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.720]   So if that's what they did was just basically building in a usbc hub so that you at least get extra things to plug
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:04.320]   Ex into it. Yeah, that's that's cheap money. Yeah, and by the way
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:10.800]   They're really questioning their life choices at this point because because they bundle in the magic mouse which has a lightning
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:16.400]   Charging port they have to bundle in a usbc to lightning cable
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.600]   That's how I get all those extras that I give to family members
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:25.920]   Getting these different products like the apple tv remote that comes with all these charges of lightning too, doesn't it? Yeah
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:32.720]   That really that really that really was a blow to all your friends and family like when now now they're not going to get a free
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.040]   They're not going to get like
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:35.840]   Air
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:38.880]   They're not going to get a charger for christmas. They're not going to get a cable christmas
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.880]   They're not going to get earphones for christmas anymore. Okay. Let me be clear
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:47.760]   Yeah
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:53.200]   Yeah
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:59.200]   Walk away have a cable these iphone bricks and have a cable. That's like me given away my microsoft mouse's
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:04.800]   It's just a nice thing to do. Yeah, I understand here's the Wi-Fi password and have a mouse
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:10.640]   Uh, they also talked about the uh, they have three
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.200]   Microphones three array microphones in the iMac Alex is that
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.480]   studio quality studio quality is it I don't
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.800]   We're waiting to be seen. I mean turns out physics is really hard to avoid
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:28.240]   You know like it's there's you know physics is physics and when you're further away from the mic it doesn't sound as good
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:32.240]   It's still gonna get room sounds. Yeah, I think that they could probably eliminate a lot of it
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.160]   It'll just mean that it'll be thinner so you'll you'll get rid of the room noise, but it'll get that's still
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:38.880]   There that would be removed somewhere
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:44.320]   So I mean being able to triangulate some of it it probably will sound better than most other mics that are from your computer
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.880]   But will it sound as good as having them real mic? Probably not. It's kind of funny because uh
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.360]   It takes a while to design these products quarantine. We've been in quarantine for a year
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.640]   Now companies are coming out with hardware products designed for zoom calls and stuff like that
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:04.800]   Microsoft surface or actually Microsoft came out with a new well camera and new microphones and all that I think I
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:08.960]   I think the big thing though is that I think what we're gonna see is what's with covid is that
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:12.640]   You know the use of a lot of these things were like this and then it went up like this
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:15.600]   But it's not gonna come back down here. Stop showing up
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:24.160]   My word, okay folks if you're listening at home what you missed was a little flex from Alex where he tell us
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:27.680]   I'm showing you that is the best way to describe that
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:34.320]   Perfect to go up to this graph. Yeah, so not only is your picture better than mine and I'm in studio
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:40.880]   But you can tell us straight your image. Holy I just want to point out that my telestrate is actually quite look at the edges
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.920]   I'm gonna illustrate this a long time to get those edges right beautiful
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:48.480]   secular what are you using to write is it a wackum tablet or something else?
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.880]   I have a wackum tablet that is
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:55.200]   being driven by my a 10 mini or my extreme or whatever and um
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:57.440]   I haven't been mixing it in
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:03.440]   Yes, it's keyed into the into the into the switcher and then I've lever I made an app that uh does the illustration
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:11.680]   You're so funny. Oh, so it seems to be a problem is it's not it's not drawing the stink lines around your around your entire head
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.680]   Like they belong to more than
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:18.240]   vibrating stink lines coming off
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:24.320]   So I'm sorry your your your flex completely obscured. Okay, so here we go
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:27.760]   I'm like the money on that kind of stuff and I passed the savings along to you
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:30.560]   a little bit more, you know
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:33.680]   A little more selfish. What's funny is is that in office hours?
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:37.520]   I showed this like one day and everyone's building their own. No, like there's like like half a
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:43.440]   Everybody has to have it use it all the time. So so the uh, it's called keeping up with the lindsies
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:50.080]   Well, I I'm you know my camera now is like middle of the road in office hours. Like there's people that have gone
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:53.360]   Way past anyway. So so anyway, the uh
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:58.160]   But the the big thing is is covid did this but I think everybody knows that we're not going back down
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:03.200]   So it's going to drop like this and then it's going to go up like that forever. Yeah, yeah, but the you know
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:07.760]   Well, we're just going to go and so the thing is is remote work and everything else is all going to be
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.760]   something that
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:16.240]   Uh is going to keep on accelerating now and it's going to accelerate. I think through the next decade. You know, so I think it's it's
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:22.880]   It's okay to design this stuff now. I put better. Nobody's complaining you put a better camera in the iMac. Yeah, thank you very much
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:26.400]   Uh
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:31.760]   Starts at 1299 order april 30th available like the apple tv second half of may
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:34.000]   It's interesting because a lot of this stuff
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:39.360]   You know, sometimes apple does events where you can buy it in the day and date in fact the last of a few events
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:44.080]   But this one a lot of this stuff is not available for quite some time. Nothing's I don't know today
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:51.360]   I don't know how how it has affected apple, but there the word is is that the electronics industry is just in a seizure
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:54.960]   Yeah, it is between the a cam fire and some of the other stuff
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:32:00.400]   There's like a whole bunch of availability issues. There's been three ship factory fires over the last six months three
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:05.680]   Plus increased demand covet 19. Yeah, the shortage is very severe
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:08.960]   They said it's just going to keep getting constraining it through the through the summer
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:15.840]   Yeah, well in fact, uh, pat gelsinger this new ceo would intel after his meeting with biden on last monday
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:20.720]   Uh said, yeah, you're probably not gonna see this. He's up till 2023
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.400]   20
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.520]   Three
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:24.480]   two years
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:25.360]   Yeah
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:28.720]   Actually, I was thinking about that earlier that when they were going through a lot of the features of
[01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:33.200]   both of these new devices that how much of it vanished as apple have by
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:37.440]   Implicitly saying well, we've got on board graphics acceleration
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:40.400]   So if you if graphics performance is a big deal for you
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:46.480]   You don't have to spend the equivalent of the entire iMac on just the graphics card that are being ordered right now
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:51.600]   Are in completely unobtainium supply well and furthermore that might explain why it's all m1
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:58.000]   Uh apple pre-ordered a ton of m1s from tsmc. They bought up almost all the production of tsmc
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:01.120]   They may not be able to get them to in production
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:06.560]   I wonder whether also apple has is part of the seizure is that apple can buy up all the components ahead of time
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.200]   Right things they will buy the next earlier so the next three years which they rumor says have done
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:15.040]   Yeah, um, but that might also indicate
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:22.720]   That we may not get these high end pro devices in june and maybe not even in september that it might be a while
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.200]   For the uh, whatever the next generation m m1 chimp is
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.760]   I was really surprised to hear them say i'm one again on the iMacs
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:34.480]   I thought hey if you're gonna read his item put something new in
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.400]   Great
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:41.600]   iPad pro now. This is where they flexed this was wow
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.560]   Uh, the rumor was
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.040]   Alex is very excited
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:53.200]   This is excited. Alex the rumor was uh that they would use, uh mini led display
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.160]   They kind of downplayed it. I think that
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:03.520]   The industry analysts and and and we good you know enthusiasts know what a mini led is but nobody else does so apple didn't say now
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.960]   Within a mini led display they talked more about what it can do, but it became clear that it wasn't mini led
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:10.960]   Display
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.600]   Instead of what we thought the a14x
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:19.280]   Which would be essentially at m1 they just said no we're putting the m1 in this ipad pro
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:21.760]   Um, yeah
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.760]   Interesting that gives you some capabilities
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.040]   That gives you some things you've never seen on an ipad for instance a thunderbolt three ports
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:37.280]   Which can do not only fast data transfers and charging but video so you can now run an external display
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.640]   Six k external display wow
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:47.120]   It runs and I wonder whether you can you can do video out but with with that kind of connection you can do video in as well
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:50.320]   So
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.320]   Now you're really
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:57.440]   Sweet mystery of life. I mean it works in my head like I you know
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.240]   I don't know
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.560]   They didn't say anything about it. Well it could be a recording device because you can go to terabytes now
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:07.680]   So there's a lot of storage and here was the shocker. They didn't even say it. They just showed it in a slide
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:10.240]   up to 16 gigs of ram
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:19.120]   Yeah on the one terabyte and two terabyte nice computer. I mean it's just a touch it's a touchscreen computer at this point essentially your choice now is
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:27.920]   Which operating system you want you want ipad os or mac OS because otherwise it's pretty much the same hardware, right with touch
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.960]   Now we know why they have a put touch on mac OS
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:36.240]   Yeah, well, no, we it's that I think I still think that's a dogmatic thing
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:37.840]   But I
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:42.960]   I have to say that in the middle in the middle of this presentation. I was in my banking app
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.680]   I was I have a special account just for like mad money
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:50.480]   I was moving money into the onto putting them on the plane. I say suit up warning up in the bullpen
[01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:56.160]   It's $2,000 of Andy's money. I had I had a window open just in case they they they created
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.960]   They they started taking pre-orders immediately because this is apple has always tried to make the statement
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:09.360]   That oh well. No, this isn't this this isn't just a computer. It's an ipad trying to make the statement that
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:14.720]   They don't think of this as as a as a tablet that just is for reading books
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:22.240]   And for doing light computing this is a computer in its own right it does really real desktop type things only an exciting new form factor
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:27.440]   But this is the first time they've brought hardware that really just
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:31.920]   Absolutely thundered home that point that's every say
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:40.000]   As it happens just like my my my usual the the computer that replaced my ipad pro as my hey
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:43.920]   I want something ultra slim and ultra light because I'm just going out for a few hours or just
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:47.200]   Just toss my bag has been this google pixel book
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:53.280]   And it's a few years old and it chose next week for the all the but all the keys on the left side the keyboard to die
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:56.640]   So I've actually so I was actually already sort of think contemplating
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:02.160]   Okay, so what do I get as the new ultra light thing and there are so many points in this presentation
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.560]   particularly the high speed
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:08.480]   High speed thunderbolt so high speed devices to be connected externally
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:14.240]   the addition last year of the the ability to use trackpads and and mouse is with it
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:21.920]   and just the speed and capacity of this thing also also i'll say the the upgrades to the camera the the light are
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:26.880]   I really want light are on an apple device and I was actually thinking about well gee
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:30.480]   If light is going to be this interesting for doing AR and 3d
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:35.200]   Maybe I should buy a new iphone just to get it and they added that to this thing too
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.680]   It really does see it's their their the ipad pro was never cheap
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:45.600]   Uh, but I it's about the same amount of money that I spent on my first generation ipad pro 12.9 inch
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:50.480]   And I really think I can justify more than anything else. It's gotten me excited about
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:59.600]   Yep, I will I will still accept some of the downsides of having an ipad other and not a device that simply responds to a usb device by saying
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.120]   Oh great. Here's a usb device
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:08.320]   Please have access to the file system and stuff like that the software the software that they were presenting for this and also again that wonderful
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:11.760]   Just the state mission statement of oh no, we just put an m1 in there
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:17.520]   It will never it will never run max software believe it. I'm sure that 80 percent of the engineering beside this was
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:20.560]   Let's make sure that nobody can even possibly contemplate this
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:24.720]   But I really am excited about the future of ipad pro with this device
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:28.160]   I think this was it was just a demonstration and this is i'm still kind of
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:33.040]   Fill the chemicals from the andy want shiny new thing
[01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:37.680]   Experience and so i'm glad i got 10 days to sort of cool off and think about it
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:44.160]   But this is a really really shot across the bow of every device that costs about $1,000 in windows
[01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:52.400]   It tries to be hip and cool. I think the ram is telling me because up to now ipads have historically had scant ram and the and the excuse was well
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.720]   ipad os doesn't need it
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.440]   Four gigs was a lot than I think the most recent ipad pro had six gigs maybe eight
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:07.280]   But to go to jump all of a sudden you can get it with 16 gigs. What does that mean? What does that say?
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:11.520]   This is I mean it's also the price of a computer loaded up. It's $2,400
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:19.760]   Like it when you when you put two terabytes of 16 gigs of ram and two terabytes of drive space and a wi-fi and cellular
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:23.360]   You're looking at $2,400 and you put 5g in it now too by the way
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:26.720]   So yeah with with millender with holy cow
[01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.560]   Holy cow. I was I have to admit I was like, I don't think that they would work out in that boat
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:35.440]   But anyway, it's I'm gonna go for the i'm gonna go for 12 or 13 hundred and i'm spending
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:41.840]   2,500 bucks on anything that i can't ride right into town you and I have both been on that susly though fairy
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:44.640]   I don't care if it's got 5g you ain't you ain't doing anything
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:48.160]   I've got a fairy but look at the sky and the sea and enjoy the ride
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:54.320]   You know, I use I probably spend about half my time on my on my iPad at this point and I can see this increasing that to
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:58.960]   75 or 80 percent of my time on an iPad. Yeah, and you know, they're the handful of applications
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:02.640]   I it's iPad o s so you're using the iPad o s apps
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:09.760]   Yeah, you paid 2,400 bucks for this top of the line iPad pro before you got a keyboard. I put your point out
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.680]   Add a right now. It'll be a solid solid 20
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:21.680]   I mean that's crazy, but that'll be my laptop like that'll be my like canopy is the question
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:24.480]   Because always it's been a compromise to use an iPad as a laptop
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:30.880]   Yeah, the question is is that I have one looking at all this is is does does it iPad o s
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:36.640]   Matter. Yeah, like I mean could you theoretically reboot it some you're now
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:40.880]   Yeah, yeah, I mean it's like could you just put Mac OS on it and run it?
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:43.920]   We if we won't know for until the next announcement, but the
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.120]   But what was left in my head was you could just
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:53.200]   Now it's sharing all the same hardware. You could just let it run Mac OS if they did that then i'm done
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:55.680]   Like literally I would just be
[01:40:55.680 --> 01:41:02.080]   Somebody in our discord pre-show said what about xcode now it certainly could run xcode
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:06.880]   Yep, um, I I I anticipate sometime in the next few months
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:11.920]   Maybe at wwdc. I mean you already have you already have the the mac the m1
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:18.480]   Mac mini is running ipad apps right so you're so that this is like they're so close together right now
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:22.000]   It would probably be fairly simple to port xcode to it
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   I bet you they'll announce that at wwdc
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.640]   Especially if you could put a bigger screen because no one wants to code even on a 12 inch screen
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:32.640]   Nobody wants to code on that, but yeah, if you could put a big screen on that maybe
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:38.800]   Yeah, but the the larger point i've spoken a lot of being giddy about this
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:42.800]   But the the point that apple still has to make sure that they make is that
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:44.800]   um
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:50.240]   This is as we're saying this can be as powerful as a thousand dollar fifteen hundred dollar windows laptop
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:56.960]   But this does think that we all were also implicitly saying that this can be as powerful as a fifteen hundred fifteen hundred dollar mac book air
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:03.760]   But we're saying though is that this does things that a standard configuration desktop OS based device can't
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:11.200]   And I have always I've always found that in terms of focused computing the ipad does deliver a better experience and easier experience than
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:18.080]   Uh, any even the most advanced windows manager window managers that I have on the mac or any other device as a device
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:21.200]   That i'm going to take it out of my bag. I'm going to get some stuff done
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:23.920]   Not even while sitting at a table on the commuter rail
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:28.400]   I'm going to be even if I'm just in one of those three three seat benches is going to work well for me
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:33.600]   And your excellent point about the about the keyboard being magic keyboard being a few hundred bucks more
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.440]   But you don't have to buy that one
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:40.320]   And also the big deal is that I can sink the i can sink my thirteen hundred dollars
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:45.200]   Uh fourteen hundred dollars into the either 256 or 512. I still don't know whether whether
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:53.760]   Whether my dignity is retained by spending fourteen hundred dollars for the 512 gig version or whether I should just link back to 256 gigabyte land
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.440]   But the thing is you can buy that and then I hear from now buy the really really expensive keyboard trackpad combo
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:02.800]   Or don't because you found something that has an even better style
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:11.040]   Keyboard and trackpad that works better for you. I want to fit my my existing magic. I bet it will it doesn't look like it's changed in form at all
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:12.640]   Yeah
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:18.560]   So let's talk about the cameras because I as soon as I started seeing watching this whole thing. I thought then we got to talk to Alex
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:23.600]   Um, they're really pushing this as a as a creator tool like
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:26.560]   Fill me an ex movie on the ipad
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.680]   Um, are this are the cameras that much better?
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.040]   Looks like they're now at a parody with the iphone
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:38.000]   Yeah, I mean they I don't do they have the wide they do they added a wide
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:44.800]   Okay, so I missed that so so they have the all three lenses because I thought it only had it only has two lenses
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:49.520]   So that's a good question. I guess it it has the wide in the normal and not right the two x
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:55.520]   Yeah, so um, so it's probably not quite the same as the iphone, but but 12 megapixel wide though. They said
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.400]   Well, and what's interesting there is so that's a 4k, you know, essentially a 4k image
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:06.320]   And and then they're panning and scanning inside of it, which is what the portal does for instance, you know
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:12.320]   Yeah, is so what you're seeing is it kind of doing that follow along portal does it makes google uh nest home max does that
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.960]   Uh, right so that
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:18.080]   And and the thing is is that with that front facing just the face
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:20.640]   Face ID
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:23.840]   Uh, that that is still a simplistic, you know, lidar
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:30.160]   You it's probably gonna be far more accurate, you know, then then the portal as far as if you're pretty close to it
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:31.520]   You're walking around
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:35.600]   It's probably gonna have a really good idea where you are, you know better than just image analyzation
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:40.880]   So so I think that that's gonna be a really interesting way to kind of interact with folks
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:48.080]   So that that's a pretty it's pretty select a 1600 nit peak with I mean they they put the xdr display into the ipad
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.080]   like that is
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:52.320]   Is the xdr mini led no
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:58.720]   Uh, I think that the array I think the monitor is pretty close to the same thing. Okay, because sorry
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:06.960]   Yeah, so my mini led chip makes a big difference you couldn't do hdr in a in an lc screen without it
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:09.040]   Yeah, so
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:14.240]   One of the things that I don't know. I don't know if it's possible or if it'll work, but my my guess is
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.800]   Is that you'll be able to use sidecar in resolve
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:26.880]   So that while you're working I can push it to my ipad and look at how it looks in in vision or or pq or whatever
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:31.040]   So you will actually use that as a monitor that may not be a hundred percent accurate
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:38.160]   But for again for 2500 bucks for me to be able to attach it to a computer that I'm working in resolve and being able to look over at the hdr display
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:41.440]   Pretty nifty. Yeah, no, that's that that was another factor
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.680]   I whenever I'm contemplating purchase like this sometimes I break it down into
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:49.280]   Uh, for $1300 cost it sounds like a lot
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:54.240]   But how much value would I attach to being able to use it as an external display for my max?
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:58.560]   And then you say okay, well actually that would be about $200 or $300 worth of value to me
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:02.640]   And how much for having a camera a very good camera that has a light our
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:09.600]   Light our sensor on it. You know, that's probably with another 150 because there are things I can't do with my current phones my current cameras
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:15.760]   So that's I might be talking myself into it, but this is there's a lot of protein in this device. I think it's good
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.320]   $3,000 with a protein
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:20.800]   Again, I'm a
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:26.720]   I'm a muscle game. I'm using I'm using I'm using a lamp from my grandmother's house as a lighting source for streaming
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:31.680]   Do you think I'm going to be spending $3,000 for this? Yeah, but yeah, yeah, you might want to
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:38.720]   As someone as someone who has a need specifically for again, something ultra slim ultra light that I can carry all
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:43.040]   Like I've checked out of my hotel my flight home is in for another seven hours
[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:48.960]   And I don't want to check my bag with my computer in it. So I have to carry this around New York city all day long
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:52.320]   This is this is a very very viable thing for me
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:56.640]   It might it might even be the first one that I can actually like take with me as a all-in-one
[01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:59.280]   streaming streaming solution the
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:04.800]   There's the the worst part of the of any trip that involves a Tuesday for instance is that oh man
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:09.120]   If I really want this to look non crappy, I am going to have to take my macbook with me
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:14.640]   I'm going to have to take these other things with me because even the even the pixel book doesn't seem to do it for me
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:15.840]   this
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:21.040]   For some I'm one of those certain people for whom this is a very very appealing thing. I can make another
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:26.240]   $500 or if it's between an $800 windows laptop or this one
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:28.880]   I
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:34.880]   Maybe can't get back the inconvenience of having a $900 windows laptop for the next two or three or four
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.880]   years in this role. Yeah
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.680]   It's pretty impressive. Wi-Fi 6
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:45.840]   5g. I wish I could get five I can get some 5g but not the really fast 5g here
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:52.160]   Um, this is the ultra wide camera of Alex 122 degree field of view 12 megapixels
[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:55.360]   That's the one where they can pan and and zoom
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.800]   Uh, no headphone jack. Thank you very much. Yeah
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:05.040]   Yeah, gosh, you know, that's the one thing I really miss on these. That's that's stupid
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:07.840]   They don't need the space. Come on guys
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:11.360]   You're just being jerks. Here's the zoom that you were talking about so
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:14.880]   It it recognizes somebody else has come into the picture
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:17.360]   So it it follows him over to the stove
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:23.760]   And then his daughter comes in and it zooms back over to her or actually zooms out to three reframing
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.840]   Yeah, that's pretty cool
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:30.480]   And it what's funny is that they have it in front of a we're actually i'm testing a portal
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:33.760]   I just I literally just ordered a portal that's going to be showing up here in a minute
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:39.760]   Uh or sometimes today and we're testing it to use for the cooking stuff that we're doing the cooking shows that we're working on
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:44.720]   That's where that wide camera. Yeah follow the cook around while you're while you're working and it's um
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:47.520]   It's a pretty slick
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:52.320]   Uh when it works. It's pretty slick. It's really hard to do you've been the ar guy on this show
[01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:58.880]   Uh, does this any breakthroughs in ar is just it's just the light r is the same as the last years i've had
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:03.680]   Uh, well them one chip so now the so the difference now is that
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:09.840]   You'll be able to put an enormous number of polygons into the ar so the amount of detail that they can add
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.280]   Will be pretty stunning. I don't I won't know until I test it
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.800]   But my guess is
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:20.640]   You could probably support 20 or 30 million polygons, you know inside of the and that just means that you can tour
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:24.720]   More interesting things that motor that they showed is pretty a pretty complex model
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:31.200]   And so there's a lot of a lot more you can do and the light are the little space ar spaces is kind of cool
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:37.360]   So I have a feeling that you'll see a lot of people play with that. Um, that's kind of like the super advanced version of
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:43.920]   Of virtual spaces. So one of the you know virtual backgrounds in zoom and all these other things just kind of a horrible experience
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:48.560]   So the virtual spaces of the kids dancing is really cool. But imagine it if i'm going to be
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:52.320]   If they apply it, and I don't know whether they will or not
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.800]   But if you turned it around or applied it or whatever to it, you could
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.200]   Build like a real 3d background, you know for four things
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:04.960]   Um that that are you that that's your the background for whatever your direct addresses or or so on so forth
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:06.320]   So it's pretty interesting
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:10.640]   I think that the light are will be interesting. I think that the fact that they can handle a lot more polygons a lot more textures
[01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:14.240]   A lot more because the m1 chip, uh, you can do some really advanced
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:18.240]   Uh ar with it that much more advanced than what you can do on the current
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.440]   Hardware the the fact that this is uh the ar is built in the clips
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:27.360]   Means that it's going to expose a lot of normal people
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:30.240]   You know tiktok creators and stuff to this capability
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:33.440]   I think that's very important for apples long-term planning
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:39.680]   Well, if you can imagine if suddenly it becomes a big rage in tiktok then zak talk about talk about keeping up with the jones is
[01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.800]   Exactly if there's suddenly a whole bunch of this ar stuff that you can only do with an ipad
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:46.480]   You're going to buy it. I think I saw a lot of you saw a lot of ipads. Yeah, yeah
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:50.800]   Uh, and they are mentioning right now on the front page
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.560]   Thank you scooter x for a limited time buy an ipad with wi-fi plus cellular
[01:50:54.560 --> 01:51:00.880]   From apple and you'll get up to 200 back when you activate it with atnt t mobile or verizon so
[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:05.680]   Um, of course because they're going to get you every month for the rest of your life
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:12.320]   12 megapixel wide camera on the back 10 megapixel ultra wide on the back the light ar scanner
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:15.200]   So it is it's two cameras
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:19.280]   Wide and ultra wide no no telephoto
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:22.480]   That's kind of what's what they did last year. I think so
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:25.520]   I don't know. Maybe the wides new
[01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:28.800]   Anything else we want to say before we get to our picks of the week
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:32.080]   the cover at all
[01:51:32.080 --> 01:51:37.280]   So a lot to cover took us two hours what they did in an hour. They moved fast
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:45.360]   It's pretty impressive. Yeah pretty impressive keynote all the way around both from the content perspective and the production production. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Really
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:49.120]   Also, this this is two days before earth day. So they made sure that they
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:54.720]   They they they took advantage of apple park in a way that was very very beautiful and very very natural
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:58.480]   I one of the things I was noticing was that I kind of like the fact that
[01:51:58.480 --> 01:52:01.120]   uh, you don't uh
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:05.040]   The the grass is a little bit patchy and a lot of it is very unkempt
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:10.800]   And but the thing is when you see a golf course style lawn in front of like a tech center
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:14.560]   That's because they put so many chemicals and so much management on that thing
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:17.360]   I kind of like the fact that no, let's just let this let stuff grow
[01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:21.120]   Well, we'll we'll we'll have our we'll have our people like it mow the grass every once in a while
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:26.960]   But we don't we don't care about it from the east coast andy you don't understand what that grass is. That's california
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:29.360]   And it looked like a very natural
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:32.480]   California landscape. I'm sure those are all native
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:38.480]   And uh and and both alex and and mike it now now that he's out here. I think recognize
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:43.120]   That is that's what my backyard looks. Yeah, that's what a california it's what california looks like
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:46.560]   So it was it was absolute choice not to have a lawn notice
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.360]   They did have a lawn with a stage where the rainbow stages
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:53.440]   So that people could go and watch stuff, but but I think it was beautiful
[01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:57.760]   I thought they made apple park looked like a real park that you would want to hike in
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:01.280]   And I also noted one of the presenters was on a wooden deck
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:05.520]   With chairs in the sun, which is obviously on part of the ring
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:12.320]   Uh, that's nice. I'd hang out there. That's pretty that's pretty sweet. I also I'll go ahead. I'm sorry
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:18.000]   I was gonna say is that if you look at the over if you look in the past if you looked at the drones flying over and everything else
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.240]   The grass has gotten a lot better
[01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:28.320]   It's growing a little patchy now, but it's yeah, it was no no a couple of flyo's earlier like like even last year or the year before it was pretty rough
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:33.200]   Yeah, she was in the jam I'm told that's where that uh, those were those those wooden uh deckies
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:37.680]   Go ahead. I just my method has a good thing that instead. Oh, I know you just have things I know you did
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:41.360]   Uh, but we're familiar with that look very much so in california
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.600]   It's called zero escapings
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:51.520]   Uh scooter x tells me which is yeah reduces the need for uh irrigation and of course that's exactly what you would expect apple to do
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:55.520]   Lovely and it is a part. It looks like a park. It's beautiful
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:58.640]   The only other thing i'll say is that I want an interview with the guy
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.640]   Who had to run on a pitched roof near though?
[01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:05.920]   And they're the edge of apple park on the on the top there
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.200]   I want to know did he have safety lines and they digitally add them out or is that or they're just stunt people that are like
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:17.040]   Nope, this is yes. I know that i'm running at a 22 degree angle here and that there's a it's a 60 foot drop
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:22.240]   No problem. I do this I do this before breakfast that was really nice. That was a really nice truck sequence
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:24.560]   You know
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:31.760]   I wish I wish it were tom cruise all i'm all i'm watching this i'm thinking that they could have they I bet they could have made the phone call
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:38.000]   I bet he would have come in and done it and and and then at the end of the sequence when like this this the spy purse this
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:46.480]   This note this this infiltrator dressed like all in like in like a ninja sort of thing is like putting chips into like this apple device
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:50.080]   I get i'm not a word of a lie i'm thinking about oh my god
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:56.960]   They're they're about to like attack the right to repair a movement by saying and brag like and because we make sure that every component is secure
[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:04.080]   And tied to that device we keep the insides of your device as secure and privacy focused as the software and like no
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:07.360]   I was glad they're simply saying oh no we put the m1 chip in the ipad
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:14.480]   Okay, sorry one other any was being judgmental not related to the event the spring loaded event tomorrow
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:21.920]   Microsoft will launch xcloud in a public beta on iphone and ipad with a hundred plus titles
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:27.200]   So anybody who says you can't game on a mac or an ipad
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:32.640]   Get ready because yeah, this is streaming gaming that means you'll be able to play triple a
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:38.640]   Xbox titles and windows titles on your ipad and iphone. I think that's a huge deal
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:44.800]   They were sure to mention that the ipad the the xbox controller is compatible with the ipad as well as the other devices
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:48.240]   I can't wait. I'm a i'm a sign up immediately
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:51.440]   but first i'm gonna buy a three thousand dollar ipad because
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:53.680]   Just because
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:57.840]   I also want to thank mica because uh, you don't know this but behind the scenes
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:02.000]   I can't thank you enough mica. Uh, he put in our
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:05.840]   rundown all of the things all of the links
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:12.400]   Uh, so that I didn't have to remember anything. I don't know when you did that mica, but well done
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:19.120]   While we were talking it was uh a lot of multitasking very very well done. It's beautiful. It's nice
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:21.760]   Um, and I appreciate it
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:24.560]   Uh, we are gonna go to our picks of the week next
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:30.240]   Let's start the picks of the week with the hero of the hour mica sergeant. You're not normally on the show
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.240]   It's always nice to have you though
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:38.480]   Well, I have enjoyed being here. Uh, the pick of the week that i'm talking about is a really cool app
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:44.800]   Um made by pierce media limited who make a lot he makes a lot of different home kit apps
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:48.240]   And uh, his most recent one is called home paper
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:52.080]   Um home paper if you want to switch back to me actually i've got
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:58.640]   There you go. Um, home paper on your eyes. Nice. Yes is an app that you can get for on your iphone on your ipad
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:04.080]   And it is specifically for the home app. So in the home app you've got these
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:09.600]   Backgrounds and apple has some standard ones that are built in but if you want to customize them
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:12.960]   Um, the home paper app makes it very easy to do so
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:16.880]   So along with having access to your photo library where you can add a photo
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:22.880]   Uh, they he just recently added the ability to pull from unsplash, which is my favorite place to go for
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:26.960]   Oh, I love unsplash. Yeah, right. It's fantastic. Yeah, so let me type in
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:32.800]   Uh apple park here and we'll find an image
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:39.840]   Get that zero escaping. Yeah, yeah, exactly the uh outside zero escaping. Let's see
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:47.520]   Uh, we'll just pick one last third party site that has a lot of really nice wallpapers
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:49.440]   I really like the unsplash stuff
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:53.280]   So this is just for a home kit. This isn't for your ipad as a whole. This is just for home
[01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:57.440]   You could use it for that, but you can see that over in the right, uh, hand side
[01:57:57.440 --> 01:57:58.560]   We've got this
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:02.080]   Really interesting image with a kind of mask around the outside
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:07.280]   And so I can change the type of mask and choose how much is that and then change the color of it
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:13.120]   And these are perfectly designed for the home app. So you can see this one I have here of mise
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:19.520]   Uh, she's in the corner of my of my thing and that's they're made so that they perfectly work for this home app
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:23.440]   You don't want the image the background image to obscure your buttons. You you want to correct
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:27.680]   Precisely. Yeah, I want them. Yeah, just kind of up in the top right. They're out of the way
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:30.800]   I can get to what I want and uh, if you get this for iphone
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:35.120]   So it's it's a free download to do one image and then from there. It's 99 cents
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:39.360]   You get unlimited images, uh to to create if you get it for your iphone
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:46.000]   It's pretty cool because you can turn on a switch that lets you at the same time that you create the version for your iphone
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000]   It will also export to your photo library of version for your ipad
[01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:53.520]   So you can quickly go in and get that set up exactly as you want
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:58.960]   So if you like me use the home app to control your smart home as opposed to using your voice
[01:58:58.960 --> 01:59:00.800]   I'm a bit of a control freak
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:07.440]   And so I use the home app all the time and you just want a nice image in the background for for each of your rooms and spaces
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.040]   You've got to check out home paper and then while you're there check out
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:16.240]   Home pass which lets you store those home kit codes that you can sometimes lose
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:21.520]   Uh in a really handy place and then you can also use it to create NFC tags
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:26.960]   Uh of those home kits codes plus a bunch of other stuff, but yes home paper
[01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:31.120]   The latest app from uh pierce media limited
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:36.160]   It's free the in app purchase 99 cents. Let's just export the home papers so you can use them
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:38.800]   Elsewhere
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:41.280]   Mr. Andy and not co pick of the week
[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:46.000]   Uh mine is an old app, uh, but a famous app and a great app for the ipad
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:51.520]   And the mac and it's on sale and it's newly relevant. Once again, uh, it's affinity photo
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:54.480]   Uh, which is normally 50 bucks is down to half off
[01:59:55.120 --> 02:00:00.720]   199 for mac half off to 10 to 999 for the ipad and it really is
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:07.120]   What it's the sort of app you you look at when you start to make the argument that the ipad really is
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:10.560]   desktop class software desktop class power, uh, it's
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:13.200]   It's come back into the spotlight as
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:17.840]   Uh, I think adobe has recently changed some of the terms for their subscription model for photoshop
[02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:20.560]   And now people are returning to the idea of well
[02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:24.720]   What if I just give you a small a certain amount of money and I own this for forever
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.440]   And I don't have to pay you a monthly fee in order to do it
[02:00:27.440 --> 02:00:33.760]   Uh, and if affinity is very much near the top of the heap or at the top of the heap in those categories for photo editing
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:40.320]   For ipads it adds extra relevance because this is one of the most muscular apps you can get for the ipad
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:44.080]   It does things with image editing and manipulation that
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:50.720]   You're you're kind of at at a loss to see a comparable device that can work that fast
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:57.520]   Uh without without running something that will burn out through batteries in four or five hours and and wait twice as much
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:01.040]   And for the price of their asking for this it really really is terrific
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:08.720]   It is it is a factor that's kind of that adds to my influence in wanting to buy one of these new ipads
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:10.560]   Because i'm
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:14.160]   But i spent an hour on the commuter rail going to and from the city
[02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:18.640]   Oftentimes i've spent an hour in the public garden or someplace taking pictures
[02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:22.720]   And it's great to spend that time doing real photo edits and really playing with an image
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:25.120]   As opposed to pushing sliders around on my phone
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:29.520]   And this could be good enough that I would actually not even have to leave
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:32.560]   Affinity photo from start to finish to to work on this stuff
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:37.440]   So it is a value ad for an ipad owner and it's also for a mac owner
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:40.240]   It's a good alternative to spending 10 or 20 bucks a month
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:46.240]   For photoshop and lightroom from from adobe. Yeah, I just I am so done with adobe
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:50.640]   And this is this is all the power of photoshop really
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:53.440]   And to be able to run this for 25 bucks
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:59.840]   That's a max or 10 dollars on an ipad with those subscription is mind-boggling
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:05.360]   And it's available for windows too. So you can be completely multi-platform with us that this is this is this is a heck of a deal
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:07.440]   Yeah, I I think
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:11.280]   For the for your new $3,000 ipad. This is well worth $10
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:13.760]   I
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:18.240]   I've been using it for for years. Oh, yeah, it has a couple features that it doesn't there's there's some stuff
[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:20.720]   It's missing that photoshop has that I still go back to photoshop for
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:25.840]   but there is tools that photoshop doesn't have there is
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:31.200]   Like the live so the live 360 if you want if you shoot 360 images
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:34.960]   You can paint in inside of the that's why I bought it years ago
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:38.880]   What specifically did is one tool it had one tool that photoshop still doesn't have
[02:02:38.880 --> 02:02:42.640]   And uh, the other thing about it is it's just screaming fast
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:46.800]   So the lot of the filters that photoshop you apply it and you're kind of stuck in a modal interface
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:50.800]   And affinity photo just does it live and it's just it's really a pleasure to work with
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:56.240]   There's a couple things that I still have trouble with but I'm still it's what I use probably 80 percent of the time
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:58.560]   When I'm when I'm editing photos
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:04.240]   And and I've used photoshop since you know version 1.5. So so it's it's uh, same thing
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:05.760]   I tried to
[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:08.640]   Pain for subscription. I haven't been able to get rid of my subscription yet
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:13.040]   But I'm slowly figuring out what is missing and then sending the guys at affinity emails
[02:03:13.040 --> 02:03:17.760]   Hey, it would be really good if you added they added target files so that you could export
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:24.800]   uh alpha channels to black magic uh switchers so um, I don't know if they did it for me, but they they did it after you know
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:29.840]   You know, uh, they did it uh recently enough that it's useful
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:35.520]   Um, it's great great app and at this at that deal that everyone should buy it. Yeah half off
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:38.240]   And they don't say for how long but I wouldn't wait
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:40.400]   Kick going
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:42.400]   Alex, what's your pick this week?
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:47.280]   I did go a little expensive on this one good. I've been waiting for something. I know I know it's not
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:49.760]   Corably expensive, but it's a little expensive. This is called
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.640]   So we use it scopes a lot
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:55.280]   video scopes a lot and we use hardware scopes which are
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:04:00.400]   Really expensive and we're always looking for good software scopes and we've used a couple different ones
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:03.440]   The one that I'm recommending today is it's called whoops
[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.880]   Oh, I like that whatever that was that looked cool
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.720]   It
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:12.560]   I think I can't do what I was just gonna do because I'm on scope
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:18.160]   Anyway, so I can't stop myself yourself. Yeah, yeah, because I my output I have to figure that figure that out anyway, so
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:22.160]   Uh, we'll go back to just talking. Uh, so anyway, uh, the uh
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:29.280]   It basically is a really great scope systems. It's about 400 bucks and so it's not it's not free
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:33.200]   But it but for 400 you can put it on three computers
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:38.480]   What it does is it gives you a lot of the scopes that we use all the scopes that I use on a regular basis for for?
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:40.080]   uh,
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:41.280]   measuring
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:47.680]   Your video so what is the reds so there's RGB parade? There's luma scopes. There's vector scopes
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:50.560]   There's you know, there you can even see a 3d cube
[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:53.920]   But you know that we have talking about the the the cube that you would use for a correction
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.760]   It'll handle hdr
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:05:03.200]   Um, and it's really at first it was very confusing, but now it's become very very comfortable this kind of scope process of being able to drag
[02:05:03.200 --> 02:05:07.920]   You can build your own interface exactly how you want it and then every time it opens. It's just that way
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:12.000]   And it is uh, it's it's really flexible and really powerful
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.280]   It's really easy to once you get it set up you just throw it onto a monitor and it's just it's just up and it works
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.760]   And we we can just pass video. So what we do a lot of times
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:22.160]   for our
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:26.960]   Uh zoom we actually have a pro pro pro pro processor that can
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:30.000]   We can fix people's color
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.120]   You know, wow, we're you know, why when they come in on zoom
[02:05:33.120 --> 02:05:36.560]   But to do that we need to be able to it's a
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:39.760]   AJ a piece of hardware called a fs hdr
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:43.120]   So so it'll take four hdr. I mean four
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:49.280]   1080p inputs and we can go in and dial in we can even apply lots of people's
[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:51.760]   Zooms if we want to anyway, so
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:54.880]   Uh, but we can dial in their their color but to do that you need the scopes
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:56.880]   I need to see what i'm actually doing. I might you know looking through it
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:01.920]   I can't just trust the monitor that i'm looking at and so the scopes are becoming invaluable to do that and so
[02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:06.000]   um, anyway, it's it's the best one we've I mean we've been using
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.360]   Scope box is also a great one that we've used in the past for a long time
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:15.040]   No, but but this one I think is what we're kind of leaning towards because the fluidity and the kind of the structure of the scopes
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:18.640]   So if you're in the scopes and they make a lot of other really cool tools and
[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:25.200]   Uh, that are around really high-end image processing and measurement is what we're what we're looking at there
[02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:30.480]   So it's pretty slick it's a cool company and I just got about it from a colorist. It's about 400 bucks
[02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:36.000]   It's nothing. It was a Charles Klein who's in our uh, we have different you know, we have a different
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:40.880]   Charles Klein is a is a colorist in New York and he is a and
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:44.800]   While you only know of an Alex is 700 dollars. We have other increments
[02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:51.520]   There's a I'm I'm in there near the bottom. There's a charl a Charles is 11,000
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:55.040]   Because
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:58.000]   So the current you're the apre him licking
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.720]   Yeah, everything he's the
[02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:07.440]   Sorry micky is like 3200 dollars and Charles is 11 but Charles was one like oh, I really I was like what scopes do you use
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:11.600]   And he goes oh I use these this is actually really cool because you could run it right on the mac
[02:07:11.600 --> 02:07:16.880]   It supports some stream deck, which is I don't know. That's kind of funny. Yes. You can automate how it works
[02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:20.000]   Yeah, that's what the stream decks get that's what a colorizer would do
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.840]   You know a shader
[02:07:21.840 --> 02:07:26.880]   Sittin in his booth would have you trolls and and you can't cut you can't do color correction without scopes
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:30.720]   Yeah, you can't yeah. Yeah, no we we try
[02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:33.920]   And that's why we look so bad
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:38.560]   We have a scope the tri-caste has a scope, but it's kind of limited and I don't think anybody knows how to use it so
[02:07:40.480 --> 02:07:43.120]   This is for the professional no be
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:45.920]   Is that he said no be
[02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:49.680]   I mean yeah, omni scopes. Yeah. Yeah, no be an ope pixels in motion
[02:07:49.680 --> 02:07:54.960]   I believe is the name of the time in pixels no time in pixels time in pixels. I didn't come
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:59.120]   I have the link right here
[02:07:59.120 --> 02:08:01.840]   No be omni scope
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:09.360]   Well, that's about it for this edition of Mac break weekly. I hope we have obsessively dissected everything you saw
[02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:12.400]   Earlier today on the apple spring-loaded event

[02:08:52.880 --> 02:09:00.160]   I can say, you know, it's disappointing that with the ipad apple to continue so i'll turn to leave this the low end behind yet
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:04.960]   So the only thing at all disappointing to me is that I have to spend three thousand dollars
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:07.040]   But i'm gonna buy that not anything else
[02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:10.480]   It's just gonna buy the new ipad pro i wasn't going to but they sounds
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:15.760]   Like such a big improvement. I mean for for so I think for certain people it's gonna
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:20.480]   Like me it's gonna be very good. Oh my god. Yeah, it's your new laptop basically. Yeah, right
