[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.440]   >> Oh, I've been gone two weeks and my timing's off.
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.880]   That's all.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.880]   It's time--
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.880]   >> It's amazing.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.880]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880]   >> It's time for Mac Break Weekly, episode 85.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.240]   And I've been gone for two weeks.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.680]   Thank you to Mr. Lindsey who held down the fort and now he's gone at NAB, the National
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.760]   Association of Broadcasters, where Apple is also gone.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.040]   I don't know why he went there.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.000]   Well, I guess because he, you know, is interested in broadcasting stuff.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.400]   That's where Scott Morn is as well.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.800]   But fortunately, the comedy duo, the comedy stylings of Merlin Mann and Andy Inako are
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.280]   here.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.080]   And I'm just going to sit back and enjoy.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.680]   Merlin Mann has a new podcast.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.480]   We'll talk about that.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.920]   Andy Inako from the Chicago Sun Times.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.920]   Hey Andy.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.320]   He's not going to say anything now.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320]   >> Oh, he's nervous.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   You got him.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.320]   You scared him.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.720]   >> Because every time I tried--every time I had something--something I thought interesting
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.320]   to say during the light banter that we have before we start podcasting, that's when you
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.320]   start recording and then you yell at me for like messing up your recordings.
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   >> I never yelled.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.200]   >> I started and then I would stop.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.120]   You were thinking yelling.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.600]   There was a residence in the universe that I could detect that had the same energy signature
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.600]   as Leo Laporton being Miff.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   >> No.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   >> I couldn't have said something.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   >> And you and me, Andy, we should do a two act as the step on it, brothers.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.800]   Because we're always stepping on everybody else's thing.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   >> No, we all do.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.720]   To be honest, it's not our fault.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   It's Skype.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.840]   I mean, you just can't--this is why Skype is kind of messed up that way.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.200]   >> And Andy, there is not an angry bone in my body.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.120]   I loved both of you guys.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.560]   I missed you when I was in Australia.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.720]   And by the way, you've got huge fans all over Australia.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.960]   Well, I can't say all over because I was only in Tasmania.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.680]   >> Well, you see, I'm not making stuff up.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.760]   When I claim to be internationally beloved, granted, all I got to do is find one guy in
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.320]   Canada who's willing to send me a postcard testifying to that.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.520]   But still, that's international support.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   >> It's modest.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   It's modest evidence, but it's real.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520]   >> But I am.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.320]   I have to admit, I think I'm going to start calling you the wombat.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.320]   >> Good.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.320]   >> Hey?
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   >> Yeah, you're wombat-like.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.320]   Did you know that?
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.840]   >> I'm wombat-like.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.560]   >> You want to know what a wombat looks like?
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.800]   >> I'm hoping you'll explain this.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.600]   I don't know exactly how bad to get.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   I just wanted to--
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.840]   >> I have big emotions if I were you, Andy.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.840]   I'm not sure I'd want to know.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.320]   >> Wombats are super cool and super cute.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.560]   Go to my blog, leoville.com.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.880]   Click the blog link, and there's a picture of a wombat on the second posting down, the
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.280]   one that says, "No Woken Fries," which is Australian for everything is cool.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.280]   Man.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   >> That's a light spoonerism.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   >> That's a light spoonerism.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.520]   >> It's a very light spoonerism.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   >> Okay.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   >> See the wombat?
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.720]   >> I'm seeing a little look in furries.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.400]   I see some guys playing what it looks like.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.000]   Is that like a lawn bowling or something?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   >> Yeah, lawn bowling.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.720]   And then there's me taking a picture of a wombat, and then there's the wombat picture
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   that I took.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.360]   >> A picture of you taking a picture of Andy, and then I see a--
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.600]   >> My God, it's huge.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   Isn't really that big?
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   >> They're big.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.360]   They're basically the size of dogs, small dogs.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.760]   >> It looks like a baby bear.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   >> They're the cutest thing.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   They're cuddly.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.680]   They look-- I think that's where the idea for stuffed animals came from wombat's.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.560]   >> That is cute.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   >> And they're really cute.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.600]   So we snuck up on this wombat, right?
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.800]   Because they're a little skittish.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.040]   They don't know about humans.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.480]   And so we tiptoeed around, and I got in front of them and started taking pictures.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   And he looks up.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.840]   They're kind of oblivious.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.200]   Because we'll look at the size of his eyes.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.280]   So in his ears, he has no senses.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.920]   So he looks up and kind of hear this clicking camera because we're being very quiet.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.880]   And he starts to lumber towards me.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.200]   And I'm saying to my God, do they bite?
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   Are they safe?
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   Am I in trouble?
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.600]   They're say large rodent coming towards me.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.400]   >> It's amazing what a difference the scale makes because in my head, I'm thinking this
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.760]   thing is the size of a kitty cat.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.200]   When it's this big, it's menacing.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.040]   >> They like small pigs, yeah.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.680]   >> Although it would be difficult in later life to have to admit that the wombat had outfoxed
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680]   you.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.440]   Because it looks kind of like it's not going to leap out and attack you, but it realizes
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.560]   that, gee, that guy's kneeling right at the gravel on the side of a road.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.240]   If I lunch a little bit, he'll fall backwards right in the path of a recycle.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.240]   >> Exactly right.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.280]   >> And then he'll have to tell everybody the reason why he walks funny is because he got
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.320]   taken out by a wombat.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.920]   The wombat is made somewhat less threatening by the fact that he still has a piece of grass
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.120]   on his nose from where he was eating.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.560]   He's got a little food left on his face.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.360]   Anyway, I'm back.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.920]   And did anything happen in the Mac world while I was gone?
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.040]   >> Yes, that purple cloud of insanity that once descended upon Silicon Valley and Apple
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.480]   has descended upon the denizens of a small company who seems to think that they can clone
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.480]   macintashes.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.480]   >> What?
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.000]   >> It's good to see that purple cloud of insanity back again.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.880]   It has a fruity flavor that I found much of my liking.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.520]   >> So this was the first thing Steve Jobs did when he came back to rescue Apple from the
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.000]   clutches of Gilamillo and his ilk was kill the clones.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.600]   >> Yeah, and it was a stupid enough idea when it was being done with the authority and permission
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.800]   of Apple.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.600]   How many times have you seen a press release or a defiant manifesto by a company saying,
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.000]   "Oh, I know we're doing this without authorization by Apple, but what can they do about it?"
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Sure, we have a tool that lets you put iTunes content on an iPod without having to use the
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.200]   iTunes software.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.960]   But hey, what's Apple going to do?
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.800]   Make a really simple and insubstantial change to the format that costs everybody to don't
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.560]   product to stop working.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560]   >> You're talking about--
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.560]   >> The help they--
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.560]   >> You're talking about size stars.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:30.560]   And the open computer?
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   >> They're talking about computer.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.560]   >> Yes, exactly.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.400]   They had to--this is how on the ball they are.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.680]   They originally had a computer that had the word Mac in the name.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.680]   Oops.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   Until their mom or somebody or somebody with more common sense than say a broken shoelace
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.800]   told them that, "Well, I see a problem already.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.880]   If you put the word Mac in the product title, even if it's just a processed cheese product,
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.160]   you know, Apple's going to sue you.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.480]   So already you're done before you even start.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.480]   And now that they've changed it to open computer--and it's actually sort of an interesting
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.800]   way to pitch a piece of hardware.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.800]   It's a computer that you can install anything on Linux, Linux, Windows, Mac, whatever.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.200]   And okay, that's kind of interesting.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.520]   But then you get to, again, the problem of, "Well, the thing is you really need to see
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.040]   an Apple sticker on the box before you can install the software on there."
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.480]   >> Well, a couple of things came up.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.360]   You know, Wired did.com wrote an article in which a lawyer said, "Well, you know, the
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.600]   Eula does say you're supposed to put it on an Apple machine, but these are weaker agreements
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.280]   than others."
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.320]   And he said, this lawyer said, "There's basically no way to enforce the Eula."
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   So--
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.360]   >> But he agreed with you that Apple would probably fight back by just changing its code.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.320]   Well, it's curious because it seems--my understanding has always been that it's never just a box
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.160]   you install software on, that there's--you need to do some sort of serious mojo to bamboozle
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:55.240]   the operating system into thinking that it is running on some sort of Apple-approved hardware.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.800]   And there have been--if you search on YouTube, you can find people who--almost the moment
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   that the Intel compatible version of the OS came out, managed to boot it on a Sony
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.440]   VIO or something like that.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:12.000]   But that's not an ongoing--that's not something you buy, build, and use as an ongoing thing.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.240]   So it kind of inspires you to get a little bit baroque about how you think--what do you
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.080]   think size stars up to, including the idea of concerning that all the talk has been about
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.560]   how they don't think that the Eula is really enforceable, whether or not this is sort
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.780]   of a red herring, just to sort of provoke that kind of a legal action so that they can
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:35.080]   maybe put that little wedge into the Eula and then come out with the real thing that
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.080]   they want to do.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.360]   Interesting, because the Infinite Loop blog, Chris Forzman, writing at R's technical,
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.620]   actually asked, "Was?
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.620]   Was the wombat?
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:44.620]   Wasn't he, eh?"
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:49.360]   And there's a guy that really does look like a wombat coming to think of it.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:56.460]   And once again, kind of building bridges between him and Steve Jobs says, "Hmm, I
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.460]   like it."
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.840]   He says, "I need another tower.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.840]   I like the price.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.480]   I may get one."
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.920]   He says, "I'm sure that when Apple went into the included copyright code in a ROM that
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:13.920]   is necessary, but was thinks it won't work in the long term because you have a right
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.720]   to run Macsoft--this is interesting.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   I don't know, it wasn't exactly a lawyer.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.400]   You have a right to run Macsoft, we're on any non-Apple computer, but you don't have
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.740]   the right to copy codes that are built into Apple hardware, so you're stuck."
[00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:32.760]   He says, "Add a tweak to leopard, breaks compatibility, and Apple isn't, after all,
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.180]   any under any obligation to preserve compatibility with non-Apple hardware."
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.860]   Is there any evidence at all that this is anything but a kind of hold out of the butt
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.860]   prank?
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.860]   He sure sounds like it.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.860]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:47.100]   I mean, just down to--I just kind of lightly browsed this because it sounded like a weird
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.100]   story.
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.440]   They're tracking this down and it's got a residential address now for the company.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.360]   And look at the pictures of it.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.240]   They say they're going to sell this thing for 400 bucks.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.040]   I don't even think you could do the Chrome for 400 bucks.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.880]   Well, I mean, I guess what I'm saying is that this is a company that has a website,
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.240]   and we know how hard it is to get a domain name and a website.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.480]   Once you have that, so where is there anything, a press version of this, something that anybody
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   could look at it?
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.480]   I mean, there's not even screenshots.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   You're saying this is another art-levative.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.900]   When you say that it's something like trying to provoke something legally with the Yula,
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.740]   I don't think it's even that well thought out.
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.700]   It just seems mostly like somebody's pulling a gag and it's not even particularly interesting
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:28.700]   and funny.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.700]   I don't know.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.700]   That's just what it seems like to me.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.700]   Nobody's selling it.
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.580]   I wouldn't call it a gag.
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:38.060]   It doesn't have a form of someone who's trying to see how publicly--
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.900]   It does if they're not funny.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.580]   Well, that's just a gag.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.580]   Not a gag.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.460]   I think your sense of humor is so heavily developed.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.000]   That you'll find humor in places where it doesn't exist.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.840]   I'm just saying-- what's the deal?
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.380]   Is this kind of like when you go to a swap meet and you buy a Nut-N-Bolt for a dollar
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.120]   and they throw in a free beer?
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   Is that a tea beer?
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.120]   Wok wok.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.120]   They'll never figure that out.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.420]   Is that what they do in Florida?
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.420]   Good luck, Law.
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.560]   I have come up with a perfect air-tight system for selling beer.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.480]   I have a Nut-N-Bolt and we'll throw in the beer.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.080]   So you're saying that it arrives at your house and it's packed with guns and ammo?
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.880]   Like eating firearms?
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   Are you good stuff?
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.200]   You've got to be really careful to not let the good new touch the other part of this
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.160]   where like, "Ah, different install."
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.160]   Is that the idea here?
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.960]   It arrives in different boxes, from different addresses.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.240]   It's there, but you've got to figure out what to do with it.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.240]   That happens all the time.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.520]   By the new egg does that with the OEM versions of Windows, the Windows Media Center, when
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.200]   that was supposed to be installed only sold to OEMs, you would have to buy a little bit
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.480]   of hardware from Newegg to get the Windows Media Center edition.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.040]   Like a USB cable or something?
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.080]   Oh, now you're an OEM.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.800]   You must be building a machine.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   It's legal.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.640]   Congratulations on your reseller account.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.840]   Exactly.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.240]   So it does actually happen all the time.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.240]   I don't know if you know.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.520]   Well, it is kind of interesting.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.160]   If you look at the quote press release, unquote, the information that's on the site, they do
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.880]   make a big, bold point about it.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.440]   Hey, hey, and if you buy a copy of Leopard with it, we will pre-install it for you.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.960]   So it arrives ready to go.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   455 bucks.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.000]   That's maybe indicating that there might be more to installing Leopard on this thing
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.320]   than simply slapping a distance.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320]   Ah.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   Well, that's a hackintosh.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.600]   I mean, that's been going on for ages.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   And that actually might be an interesting way around it.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.480]   If every time they build one of these, they know exactly how to get around whatever Apple
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.080]   has put into to stop it.
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.400]   It comes with a big sticker on the front tray saying, okay.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.240]   If you've disabled automatic system updates, you may want to get familiar with the cancel
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.080]   button because the moment you click OK and install an update, it's going to be kind of
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.760]   pretty, but it's not going to actually run max off or anymore.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.760]   Sorry about that.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:50.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.760]   This just seems like one of those really backwards.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.280]   I mean, with all deference to the people who keep up with Linux.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.720]   I mean, somebody who's a Linux person figures out how to keep all these different pieces
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.720]   sewn together.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.880]   Somebody like me who's much more Catholic in their approach to computing enjoys somebody
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.040]   like Apple because they do all the heavy lifting for me.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   Right.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.440]   I'm going to tell you that I may be a nerd, but I'm not a geek.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.160]   I don't know, at least with regard to like hardware.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.160]   Like, there's no way I could do stuff like kernel update stuff.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.080]   I have no desire to do that at all.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.760]   So I guess I'm just not sure apart from the proof of concept and prank idea, who in a
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.360]   business context or personal context could this conceivably be useful to?
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.360]   We're also kind of assuming that this is a serious business undertaking.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.520]   It's possible that this is just a couple of grad students who just had this little part
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.440]   time project, they decided to throw together a website and they did not know that someone
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.040]   would find it and link the hell out of it.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.760]   And now these two guys are open to build a couple of boxes and get some beer money are
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.760]   now.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.920]   That's like throwing a water balloon and Hitler though.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.480]   Yeah, I mean, the fun is going to be very short-locked.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.880]   You should never throw water balloons at Hitler.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.400]   All you wind up with is a wet, angry Hitler.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.080]   That's what my grandfather said to me one day.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.320]   You know, I thought that was just my grandfather.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.520]   That must have been conventional wisdom in the 30s and 40s.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.360]   They live through that.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.280]   If anyone has said the presence of mind to know exactly how dangerous a wet Hitler is
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   when cornered.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.240]   Why they call the "voistus generation."
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:24.640]   Daniel, Daniel Dilger writing in his roughly drafted about, this is the first time I've
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:28.080]   actually heard of this happening back to my Mac actually worked.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.240]   You know about back to my Mac.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   I don't believe it.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.360]   I think this is the same people who are doing the fake Mac.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.840]   I don't believe it works out.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.560]   It's not the local network at all.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.560]   It's a clever idea.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.280]   You put this thing on your Macintosh and it waits until the...
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.440]   Then if your computer is stolen, it waits until...
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.960]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   Okay, let's...
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.400]   Okay, so here's what happened.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   I was thinking of another product.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.600]   This is back to my Mac, the program that never works for anybody.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   It's like, no, it's a dot Mac and it incorporates a dynamic TNS like...
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:04.480]   Actually, I used back to my Mac the other day to log into the computer up in Vancouver
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.480]   that we used to use for the lab.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480]   It worked.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.480]   I was able to see all the stuff they were doing and then I immediately logged off because
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.480]   I realized...
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.160]   It's kind of like the fiat of dot Mac functionality.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.160]   When it does work, you're kind of surprised.
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.160]   Yeah, but I've had it work.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.320]   I had it work from Australia to my home computer.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.400]   I keep wishing that would work.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.400]   I could so totally use...
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   I take it works now.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.400]   Try it.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   I'll try again.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   I think it worked.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   It really does work.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.200]   It uses it for the potential security stuff that it opens up.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.880]   It better be really working well.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.880]   Yeah, think about that.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   Think about that.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.320]   I mean, if it doesn't work for me and it does work for somebody else, I leave it shut off.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.720]   You have to open it.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.360]   I think it works with my home computer because I'm using an airport extreme, which probably
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.520]   opens those ports.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.760]   You've got to go in and in your airport extreme, there's a little bit you flip to say allow...
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.760]   It's okay.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.840]   Yeah, under the NAT settings.
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:58.280]   You really do have to go in to go to support.apple.com and download a really oddly...
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:04.160]   Long and Windows-like installation guide that will help you figure out exactly why it's
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.720]   not able to communicate outside your home network.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:14.360]   It really is a lot easier for using, as usual, an Apple branded access point because so much
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.200]   of the stuff that has to be done hands-on in a very fiddly way can be done with just a
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:24.360]   couple of clicks if you're using an airport extreme or a compatible machine like that.
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.440]   I'm with you.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.160]   You don't...it would be great if this were as reliable as nearly everything else that
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.880]   Apple does with the networking.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.520]   When I...before I left for Colorado, I was setting up back to my Mac because I still
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.200]   don't have a really good secure connection to post things from my blog and do stuff like
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   that.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.440]   For God's sake, you're on a college campus and I talked about this last week.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.880]   You really have to bastard-proof your machine before you use any sort of a public internet
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.920]   access on a college campus.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.600]   And unfortunately, we're great inside the house, did not work great outside the house.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.160]   One of the simplest things that Apple could do, and I don't even...I'm not even aware
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.160]   that they have this yet.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:01.840]   I'm surprised they don't, is that a simple way that right there from your land, you can
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:07.760]   just simply go into a simulation mode, say, "Well, please pretend that these two machines
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.360]   are not on the same network.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.800]   Try to connect to a Apple computer in Venezuela, then from the Apple computer in Venezuela,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.320]   try to connect back to my Mac.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.040]   I want to be able to verify that whatever my settings are, that I've got them going okay
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.600]   so I can trust this connection when I leave the house."
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.280]   I totally agree with you.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.320]   I was really kind of counting on that for a recent trip because when I should have done
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.840]   probably is go down to the coffee shop.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   Tested for a sec.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.520]   So here's what happened.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.680]   This woman in Santa Cruz had her truck was broken into.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.640]   The thief stole her iPhone and her MacBook.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.360]   So she has a friend who says, "Well, let's try back to my Mac."
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.600]   And so they were able to use it to locate the MacBook.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:54.080]   Turns out the guy has logged on to various Wi-Fi signals and they've been able to start
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.000]   screens hearing sessions to see what he's doing.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.160]   He's got LimeWire open.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.200]   He's downloading Final Cut Pro and Photoshop.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.000]   He's ripping DVDs.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Wow.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.320]   They continue to track him within a couple of days.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:09.360]   Nothing he might be employing Apple's new eye evidence generator.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.360]   I think so.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.840]   Within a couple of days, the owners are able to assemble a full profile of information
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:19.240]   on the Stoller laptop user as he signed into a hookups site, read his Gmail messages
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:23.840]   and shopped on eBay for a police scanner.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.160]   They got his birthday.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.200]   His mother's made name email address, his Comcast IP address.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.680]   They used photo booth to take a picture of him clear enough to read the lettering on
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.600]   his tattoos.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.840]   Santa Cruz police have initiated a warrant and subpoenaed process.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   They hope to bag the burglar and return the stolen equipment shortly.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.440]   This is from the roughly drafted magazine, Daniel Dilger.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.040]   I love the story.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.520]   Unfortunately, all these really funny, stupid burglar stories, they're going to get less
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.600]   and less easy to really get the joke.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.880]   It used to be, oh, while someone like left his driver's license and his credit card
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.520]   and put his picture at a photo booth right there at the bank, those are going to be less
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   likely.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.640]   Well, you know, but unfortunately, the guy was not using D.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.440]   It was had hijacked a DNS server, but he forgot.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.760]   You're going to believe you love this.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.840]   He was only modifying every third header.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:21.160]   So by unwinding the IP address, we're able to subnet him all the way back to that.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.160]   You know, exactly.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.640]   And a lot of people just sort of, oh, how forgetting to dynamically subnet.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.800]   Oh, dumb.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.320]   How dumb can you get?
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.800]   Is this the right place where I laugh?
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.040]   They don't think that I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.040]   What is he saying?
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.120]   And that is stupidest identity thieves.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.440]   Now, hey, who knows?
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:46.360]   And when my kids grow up, they may be so savvy that that is something they can laugh about.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.040]   I'm sure our parents are wondering what the hell we're laughing about.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.280]   This is going to be a ridiculously huge problem.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:56.000]   I mean, the amount of the resources that are available to work on crimes like this are so
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   out of whack to the way that it's growing.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.800]   I mean, I mean, I stuff like obviously laptops.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.600]   I mean, you hear all these apocryphal stories about people just walking through cafes and
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   snatching up laptops.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   Oh, really?
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:06.600]   Oh, boy.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   You know, let me know.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.280]   I don't know how often that really happens.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.440]   But now I mean, between the kind of petty crimes around iPhones and iPods and just kind
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.080]   of like the identity theft and of the people who stay logged in all the time, can you
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.120]   imagine like once more people are taking their stuff on the road in the open, what's
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   going to be involved in that?
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.120]   I don't know.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   That's just my opinion.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.120]   Anyway, I think people are way too loosey.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.680]   You see what that stuff.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.440]   When that's the fact that the reason why something like fact my Mac is going to be that much more
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.520]   important as the years go by, the ability to simply keep everything in one location
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:42.120]   that I think is safe and hopefully have such a secure way of connecting to it that I won't
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.640]   want to have multiple copies of it floating around the world.
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:45.640]   Exactly.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   It would be like, what is this?
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.640]   The equivalent of what?
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.680]   Like having your life savings in your bag everywhere you go.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.040]   Like when you rather have like some kind of a trusted source that says, okay, all that
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.840]   money's still in this one place.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.840]   It's not security.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   That's the for all.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:03.160]   I, you know, Steve, who does our security podcast was at RSA last week, the big security
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.160]   convention in San Francisco.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:08.680]   And he said the essentially the mood at RSA was it's over.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.440]   We've lost.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.240]   And there are so many hacks.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:16.960]   There are so many exploits out there that there's nothing you could do about it.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.440]   And in fact, we've kind of started to see that even on the Mac side with that, you know,
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.880]   we talked about this couple of weeks ago, the Pwn the Mac Pwn to own Mac contest where
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.040]   the guy uses a somewhat unknown exploit, but it was able to surf to a hacked website
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.520]   and it's safari and infect the machine and own it.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.560]   And it's really endemic in Windows.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.840]   And I think it's just a matter of time before it's endemic in the Mac.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.760]   And essentially there's not much you can do about it.
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.440]   You can download the patches when they're available, but the hackers are way ahead of
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:47.440]   the patch cycle.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.040]   And well, think about the way that your bank accounts are protected or the way that your
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.360]   credit cards are protected.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.800]   They're chiefly protected by the virtue of the fact that your credit card company will
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.040]   reimburse you for losses.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:05.320]   I mean, they're not willing to really, I was kind of, I was sort of pleasantly freaked
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.280]   out last week in Colorado.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.280]   There's a comic bookshop.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:13.640]   Let's give a shout out to Time Warp Comics and on the on 28th Street, you know, and I
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.400]   shop there exactly once a year.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.240]   And as soon as I presented them with the clerk with a credit card he'd never seen before,
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.640]   he asked for the idea immediately.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.560]   He asked me to take off my sunglasses so he could, you know, compare the faces.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.960]   The idea that someone is there.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   That is so rare.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:28.960]   Exactly.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.360]   I was like, you know, you're in the rhythm of like not expecting it.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.160]   So he actually like had to pause a second to realize he wasn't just trying to get me
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.560]   to buy, try and get me to sign up for the frequent buyer club.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.520]   But I was like, yes, absolutely here.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.840]   My mom, my mom for like, like 10 years, my mom, 10 or 15 years, my mom has not signed
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.240]   the back of any credit card she's got.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:52.400]   And she always puts in big letters across the entire white area, ask for identification.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   Right.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.600]   Just like one out of 20 times.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   They'll just look at the back.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.920]   They'll see there's letters on there.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.640]   And she's like, did you see the back?
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   Do you want to ask me for?
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.440]   And I go, no, that's cool.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   I do the same thing.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   I say check ID instead of signing it.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.440]   Somebody told me to do that.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.440]   It's meaningless.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.440]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:14.520]   I checked into a really ritzy hotel like a couple months ago, and I nearly had to throw
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.520]   a ball of paper at the clerk was checking in with because handed them the credit card
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.640]   so they could, you know, charge in the incidentals.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.480]   And rather than like keeping it like someplace as she's typing things in, she just left it
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.400]   right up there right there on top of the computer, face up or everybody could just, you know,
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.080]   all the people checking in could just get a look at my credit card number.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.560]   And I'm like, could you please just flip that?
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.840]   You know, that's a really good point Andy, because if you remember when ATMs, I think
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.120]   what helped ATMs catch on, well, let me go back a little bit.
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.720]   If you remember what, 76, 77, 78, when the very first ATMs that I can remember started
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.000]   appearing, the people's reaction was what?
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.240]   Four digits between me and all of my money?
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   Like you're crazy, but you're absolutely right.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.000]   They kind of assuage that with this idea that will indemnify a certain amount of that
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.200]   risk for you.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:01.560]   But you know, another way to put it maybe is like, yeah, they'll cover you for that $500,
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.720]   but not cover you for the exact $500 that you think.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.280]   It isn't like, so in other words, that's $500 from a big pool that they can afford to lose
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:16.160]   versus all your like particular to use specific data that gets lost, which is a very different
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.160]   affair.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.360]   Does that make any sense?
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.360]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.160]   It's easy enough to say we'll take care of this thing.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.640]   It's easy enough for us to replenish in the generic, but who's going to under sign the
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.240]   insecurity of like all your personal stuff?
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   Right.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:36.040]   Well, it was depressing to me because there's, you know, I asked, we actually, you know,
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.320]   I did this interview for the radio show where there are a lot more kind of novice users
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.800]   and I said, well, okay, great.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.800]   What can we do?
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   And he said nothing.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.120]   He said, you know, nothing.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   Patch window, patch windows, you know, do all the things we've always told you to do,
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.320]   but you're still, there's nothing you can do.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   You're still screwed.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.560]   So that's goodness.
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.280]   One of the things I noticed when I was in Australia is a lot of iPhones.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.280]   They're very popular down there.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.080]   Of course, they're all hacked.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:08.680]   But while I was down there, there, there was kind of a semi announcement.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.480]   An apple source said, Vodafone might well be the carrier for the Australian market.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:20.160]   And then once it's launched, they will sell them unlocked.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   So how much does the first time that's happened?
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.040]   No, it happened in, was it France somewhere in Europe?
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.480]   They were required to sell them unlocked.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.240]   I think it was a France.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.680]   But did anybody ever successfully get an unlocked iPhone out of France?
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   No.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   So that, yeah, that, well, maybe I don't know, you know, one quarter of all the iPhones
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.960]   apparently are being used unlocked in China.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:47.760]   China, I'd say one quarter, 99% of all copies of Windows XP are being sold for $4.5.4
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.760]   in floppy.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.240]   The business standard says that the, they're going to, first of all, they'll be the HSDPA
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.440]   iPhone, the new high speed iPhone.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:01.240]   It'll be around 700 bucks.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   It'll be expensive.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.560]   But that should be interesting.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.400]   That's so, you know, once, now didn't announce the high speed 3G iPhone while I was gone,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.520]   did they by any chance?
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.480]   No, but Brother Mossberg was very certain we're going to see one very soon.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:21.560]   And we know it's going to be like by the summer, but I was surprised to see a date of within,
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:26.160]   he was claiming within 60 days, which surprised me because it would seem like a lot of things
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.560]   have to happen really quickly and very publicly in order to make a, make the next 60 days.
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.000]   But, you know, Walt is Walt for a good reason.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.440]   Well, I think Apple pulls him aside and says, Hey, Walt, I mean, don't you think if he's
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.400]   saying that it's, it's because Apple's asked him to say that?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.760]   I don't, well, I really great amount of trouble assuming that anything that Walt says is not
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   true.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:53.160]   That doesn't mean that I don't internally think, well, gee, we're used to seeing a certain
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.760]   timeline that happens starting 90 days out and we have to start that time.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.840]   Yeah, we have to do an FCC approval process and all that stuff.
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.960]   But again, Walt is not the sort of, Walt is not, who is that, who is that really, really
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:11.240]   unfortunate old school journalist who like a day after 9/11 said, Oh, I've got documentary
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.880]   evidence that it was an inside job planned all along because of some documents he got
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.880]   off the internet.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.480]   I mean, it's not one of those, he's not one of those kinds of journalists.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.440]   He's not not only would he, I don't think he would say something like that unless he
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.040]   knew it was true, but also he wouldn't, he wouldn't guess at it, but also he wouldn't
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.480]   commit to actually saying it in public unless he felt as though he was not only was the
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.720]   information correct, but that he was free to say it in public.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.400]   How widespread is HSDP now?
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.560]   I know AT&T is trying to roll it out as fast as they can, but is, is do you have it in
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.360]   Boston?
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.360]   We do have it in Boston.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.840]   It's not 100% reliable.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:45.600]   I do have a couple of AT&T handsets that use the network and we're asked.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:49.720]   I mean, this is where you see at least part of the argument that Mr. Jobs was making last
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.600]   year that we're asked I can get an edge connection anywhere in New England except for Vermont.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.040]   I can, I can't get the super high speed connection on these other phones unless I'm in, you know,
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.680]   places where I can probably get free Wi-Fi anyway, automatically.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   Right.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680]   Right.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.120]   So, yeah, we have it in San Francisco too, but I think the same exact issue is interesting.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.520]   I used HSDP and Australia tell Strelia, Oh man.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.120]   I feel so sorry for the people in Australia.
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.680]   Telstra, which was owned by the Australian government and has been kind of privatized,
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:22.320]   although the government still owns half of it, is absolutely appallingly greedy.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.720]   And I mean, it's just, it's kind of stunning.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.120]   There are, there are competitors, but they're all small players.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.680]   I mean, when you have a government run, you know, internet service provider and Telco,
[00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.720]   it's kind of hard to compete against them.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.280]   And Telstra is very anti-competitive.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.840]   You know, if you want to be an ISP and you want a DSL switch in Telstra's offices, they're
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.680]   apparently make it very difficult for you.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.560]   But you know what they do?
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:49.440]   This is, you know, you, they have very low data caps, like 500 megabytes a month, megabytes
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.440]   a month.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.440]   Wow.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.800]   I would go through that pretty quickly.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   Like in a day.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   Yes.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:59.120]   It says somebody who produces content that's big that you want to download and I'm planning
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.040]   to do more video and I'm sure you guys are too.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.040]   That's not good news.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.040]   That's ridiculous.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.160]   It means Australia can't afford to download our stuff.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.160]   Maybe you're just a little fancy.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:14.480]   Maybe you need to start thinking about, you know, two frame per second, you know, 16 kilobit
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.480]   versions of the show.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.200]   We actually do a couple of shows with 16 kilobit version.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.000]   Or if you're special, especially Tamagotchi and oriented version of the podcast.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.720]   I just feel bad for many way, but we were using HSDPA on the road and sometimes it was
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.720]   quite fast.
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.720]   Sometimes it was not.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.600]   It wasn't noticeably better than EVDO.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.240]   It was about the same.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.240]   That's where you get into the question of I don't mind having high speed available to
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.640]   me if it's pretty much free or if I don't have to pay that much more for it.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:51.160]   But if I start, if my monthly data charge goes up from 20 bucks to 65 bucks and I can't
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:55.640]   rely on getting access to that high speed whenever I need it, wherever I need it, you
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.560]   know, that's going to make me wonder why I'm bothering.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:00.640]   We maxed out every card we had in about five days.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.800]   And I maxed out my connection.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.520]   Because by the way, it's not just downloads.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.840]   It's uploads too.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.600]   And I was uploading pictures and video.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.960]   I maxed out in a day.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.040]   And then they charge you like 10 cents a megabyte.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.040]   It's outrageous.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.400]   It's amazing though, because it really brings you back around to a different time.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.320]   I was having this conversation with someone the other day where, you know, if you've
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.720]   been around this stuff for a few years, you think about really how disruptive something
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.720]   like YouTube is.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:28.600]   I remember the first time that I tried to put up a video on my website, I'll put something
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.160]   in Premiere at what I thought was a pretty modest, you know, back in the day when you'd
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:36.320]   have like these little postage stamp size videos that were basically glorified animated
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:40.680]   chips, but still like a blow through my bandwidth for the month, you know, in a day with hardly
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.680]   any visitors at all.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.680]   And but it's interesting how to think about how even though we certainly are where we
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.120]   should be with bandwidth in this country, it is still amazing to think about the change
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.080]   that all you can eat bandwidth has made possible.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:54.120]   And we pay more here than in a lot of countries.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.120]   Oh, God.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.320]   We're probably is it Korea or Japan where they get the high speed for nothing.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.520]   I mean, get the equivalent of a T three for like 10 bucks a month or something.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.520]   Yeah, I know.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.480]   We're kind of in the middle of the pack.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   There's worse.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.680]   And Australia is one and there's a lot better Scandinavia Asia.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.800]   So a lot of a couple of attacks on iTunes lately.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:24.720]   First at ad tech in San Francisco, chief digital officer at NBC Universal, George Cleovkoff,
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.920]   says, get this, if you look at studies about MP three players, especially leading MP three
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.080]   players, I wonder what that is.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.640]   And what portion of that content is pirated.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.720]   And think about how that content gets onto that device.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.960]   It has to go through a gatekeeping piece of software, which would be a convenient place
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:50.520]   to put some anti piracy measures are NBC implying they would put their shows back on iTunes.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:56.640]   If Apple would just figure out some way to prevent piracy, which, which, which kind
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.120]   of piracy they're making this into MP three is piracy or checking to make sure this got
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.120]   bought from somewhere.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:06.360]   He said, well, kind of windows like DRM to make sure every bit of media has been paid
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.360]   for.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   Is that what they're advocating?
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360]   They're not.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:10.360]   They don't.
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.360]   He didn't exactly say, but he says we'd love to be on iTunes.
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.040]   It has a great customer experience.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.200]   We'd, this is NBC member.
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.040]   They, you know, they pulled all their stuff off.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.040]   Hulu.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.040]   Hulu.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:21.520]   We'd have to figure out a way to distribute our content on iTunes.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.920]   We, but, you know, that, you know, we don't want them stuff pirated.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.120]   You know, the Hulu prevented by being flat.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   We would be willing, right?
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.080]   More than willing to buy your carriage if you would just make room for a buggy whip.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.320]   I mean, that's stupid.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.160]   When I, when I missed an episode of house after the Super Bowl, it was just a, and I tried
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:43.240]   to do, you know, I went on to iTunes to see if I could buy it, couldn't buy it, went to
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.680]   see if there's going to be repeated anytime soon.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:51.520]   And I finally decided that my God given right to find out exactly why that Arctic researcher
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.760]   was suddenly crashing super cede to the copyright holders right to make money off of it.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.440]   It took me all of 20 minutes to get my, get a really good MP4 off the internet.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:01.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.920]   And that had, that had nothing to do with Apple's involvement.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   I mean, there's, there's obviously got to be something else going on behind NBC because
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.520]   as much as we love to say that, oh, these people are clueless.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.240]   Oh, they're stuck in an old paradigm.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.160]   They really know what the numbers are and they know pretty much what they're doing.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.920]   And they say something that's on the surface looks that stupid.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.160]   It's usually because they're trying to get some sort of other concession out of the company.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.800]   Yeah, but they also, they want, they want Apple to be participating in their little sad,
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   Vichy government, right?
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.680]   They still are looking, they're still looking for anybody.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.080]   And I hate to sound this cynical and this obvious, but I think they just want people
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.240]   to keep pretending that this, this game that they're playing makes any sense at all.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.480]   And the more people, if they can get Apple to like basically pay lip service to this incredibly
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.360]   broken model that they're trying to still run with, then that makes them look like they're
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   not insane.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.960]   And I think that's what that's all very eloquent.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.200]   I think you're exactly right.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.760]   Oh, they're not necessarily insane.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.800]   Hulu is a big benefit to users.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.440]   They're giving, so why would they pull it off there to go on iTunes?
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.240]   Hulu works initially.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   I think in the long run though, people don't sit and watch stuff on Hulu.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.320]   I love, no, I love Hulu.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   I have nothing.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.880]   You sit and watch stuff on Hulu.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:05.880]   I don't.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.880]   I got to find it.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:07.880]   Okay.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   Well, I love Hulu, but I don't use it.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.200]   My wife who my love will not watch anything on a computer screen.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.240]   Well, most people will offer.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.480]   So I'm trying to set up a Mac mini.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.600]   When I get my Mac mini, which I did buy set up, I will do that.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:19.760]   But I'm talking about something different.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.120]   I'm talking about like, you know, I don't think these companies are acting in their
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:25.520]   own best self interest right now.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.760]   Based on my observation, I'm not, they don't have inside information of these companies,
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:33.560]   but what I can continue to gather is that as long as they can pretend like this little
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.840]   game of theirs is going to make any sense.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.120]   That's the music industry.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:43.080]   Despite the way the technology is killing them, they're going to, Andy, you know, you're
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.440]   a good soul to even like sweat that.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   There are so many people out there who are 20 years old that are not going to watch TV
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   in real time.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.120]   They're not going to sit through a commercial and they're never going to buy anything on
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   iTunes.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.120]   I stand by that.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.120]   And they know how to use BitTorrent.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.560]   That's all you need to use.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.720]   And unless they can find some way to like move further up the food chain to choke this
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:04.480]   stuff, they're dead in the water.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:05.480]   We have this.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.960]   Just a matter of how long we keep the feeding tube.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.760]   I had this conversation with the photographers.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.160]   This one is really close to home.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:16.760]   Now these guys make photos for a living and you know, it's very hard for them to accept
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.960]   the fact that once stuff's out there, it's going to be out there and you can't control
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   it.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.440]   You can't, there's no digital water marking technology.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.440]   Nothing to do.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.480]   It's just kind of, it's going to be gone.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.640]   And so you have two choices, not, you know, you can put little thumbnails up and nobody
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.960]   ever see your pictures or appreciate them.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.280]   Or you can say, okay, this is the way it is.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.600]   Let's find a business model that works in the world where bits go flying out of your
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.600]   control.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   You bet the best line though, every single person who's producing content, I include
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   myself amongst anybody who's making stuff and putting it on the internet to a certain
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.600]   degree.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.480]   I'm sure that's will come back to bite me when I write a book.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.280]   But no, I wrote books that were either pirated immediately.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.280]   13.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.640]   But the thing is, if you never change your basic point of view about this and you continue
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.920]   to feel that there's a basic disparity and that you have the right to beat the crap out
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.240]   of anybody who doesn't use your stuff and exactly the way you wish they would for the
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:10.120]   amount of money that you wish they would, you need to get a time machine because your
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.440]   time is over.
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.360]   And if you can't live with that, then you shouldn't put stuff on the internet.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.880]   You should open up a little shop somewhere and make people come there and sit and watch
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.880]   your TV where you can watch them.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:23.640]   Because instead of, instead of, why not just instead see the incredible opportunities of
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.080]   having an audience that goes out of their way?
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.720]   I mean, look at Andy.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   Andy loves you.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:32.000]   This TV show so much that he goes out and does something that I sense.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.160]   He's not necessarily comfortable doing.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.880]   Why would you not provide an opportunity for somebody to spend a little money to be your
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.880]   fan?
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:39.960]   That's just so stupid to me.
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.360]   Well, it's one thing to say that.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.680]   And it's one thing to say, well, let's start giving things away.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.680]   Let's acknowledge the new model.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:51.000]   And it's another thing when you have about 5,000 people who are in your employ whose ability
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.320]   to make their mortgages are relying on your ability to make a good decision about how to
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.480]   monetize your content.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.920]   But that's not the way that's not the way free market works.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.480]   What I'm saying, what I'm saying, Merlin, is that you can't really expect NBC or me personally
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.320]   to by default say every content that I create, I'm just going to put it out.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.680]   No DRM, no charge, no nothing and hope that money comes my way eventually.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.240]   That's the strong man.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.880]   That's not what I said at all.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   That's not what I'm sorry.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.600]   But I won't respond to that.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.600]   Okay.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.200]   Well, I'll admit, Merlin, I'm having trouble really following your argument.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:29.040]   I mean, my argument is that for the last 80 to 100 years, anybody who's created content
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.400]   has had the law and physicality on their side in such a way that they held the high card
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.920]   in any kind of business relationship.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.480]   And they were able to define the terms for even the most ridiculous business relationships
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.720]   just because they controlled every aspect vertically.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.480]   And because now that that doesn't exist anymore and that model is broken, I think just saying
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.880]   that you've got a lot of employees is not an excuse to say that your business model works
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.480]   anymore because it doesn't.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.840]   And what I'm not saying that you should go out and give everything away, I mean, I'm
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.680]   saying that like in order, I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   I am smart enough to look at it and know when it's broken and it's ready to let it die.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.760]   That's the challenge is to figure out a business model that works in this world where you can't
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760]   control it.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.400]   Just because we don't know what's fit doesn't mean we shouldn't, we shouldn't point out
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.560]   what's stupid.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.480]   And I'm not saying you should go work for free or give your stuff away.
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.720]   What I am saying is that these photographers, I'll just say particularly with photographers,
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.480]   if your idea of being a photographer on the internet is putting up a low res version of
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.840]   your photo with your copyright pasted all over every square inch of the photo, you fundamentally
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.800]   don't understand and maybe even shouldn't have permission to be on the internet because
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   you fundamentally don't.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.560]   I was very sympathetic with them and I understand they're conundrum and it's the same conundrum
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.440]   that everybody has to deal with.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:40.960]   How do we find a new business model that works in the age where you want to get your content
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.680]   out there?
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:47.080]   What I'm really objecting to, Merlin, is the idea that inability to want to simply
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.840]   knuckle under and do what it has to be done to.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.320]   Again, if I'm misinterpreting what you were just saying there, please correct me.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.880]   But you really can't attach that label that you have no right to participate because you
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.440]   just don't get it.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:05.320]   I mean, I'm in the, okay, well, okay, then I'm sorry, but I'm in that execs.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.760]   I mean, I can see this from so many different angles myself.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.560]   There is a couple of pictures that I took last week from the conference on World Affairs
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.120]   of a couple of like leading, you call them leading skeptics, you know, James Randy and
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.160]   the bad astronomer Phil Plait.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.720]   And of course, happily sent copies.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.840]   Phil is a Phil of Palomine, so I sent him copies.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.960]   He put them on the website and some of the people who commented were not upset, but they
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:31.120]   were a little, oh, Jesus, too bad that he, and Akko released it as creative comments,
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.920]   but he also added the no derives tag.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.880]   Those two bags I would love to like modify it.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.720]   And of course, it's, you know, it's my friend Phil and, you know, it's his portrait.
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.000]   So his fan should have the ability to modify whoever they want.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.200]   And so of course, I released a new version of it without that tag on it.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.880]   But that was my, that's usually my prerogative as a photographer, not because I don't get
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.880]   it.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.920]   Because I don't want, you know, if we have nobody denies it's your prerogative.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:59.520]   I'm saying, I'm saying that we have bloggers who are making lots and lots of money and
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.320]   they, whereas they have the opportunity to, if I was, if I were a commercial photographer
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.520]   to pay me for my work, a very small amount of money that's not going to really affect
[00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.120]   their bottom line, or they could simply, you know, right click, save it, say the JPEG,
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:17.000]   go into Windows Paint and say, uh, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a bottom pirate.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.360]   And say, well, you can't, you can't.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.760]   I've made a modification to that.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.320]   That's, that basically that's my free speech, you know, modification to the thing.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.960]   And I'm not, I'm not saying you shouldn't do that.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.800]   I'm saying that you shouldn't pursue people that break your stuff.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.160]   My stuff gets reused a thousand times a day on the internet.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   Well, not a thousand times a day.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.640]   I'm exaggerating, but I mean, they got, they get stolen.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.040]   My stuff is stolen every single day.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.120]   And there's nothing I can do about it.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.120]   And it damages me.
[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:41.840]   It damages me because it deludes my brand and it damages me because it actually hurts
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.840]   PageRank.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.040]   It does all kinds of things to damage me.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:48.840]   But you know what, the problem with the human condition according to, to one Buddhist parable
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:53.120]   is that we get shot in the heart with an arrow and all we want to do is sit there and
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.560]   figure out what brand of arrow it is and where it came from instead of trying to figure
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:57.920]   out how to get the arrow out.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:59.760]   And so what I'm trying to say is I can't do anything.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:03.360]   If I'm going to be on the internet, I need to make my piece with the fact that I no longer
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.280]   control every single thing that I do.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.240]   And if I need to control what I'm saying to you, Andy is, and I'm saying that you're
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.240]   saying this, but if a person says I need to control all this and make sure nobody ever
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.400]   draws PP's on my face, then maybe that shouldn't be on the internet because you can't control
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.480]   what happens.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.320]   That's how that's where we are.
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.320]   That's, we'll see.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.280]   That's very true, but that's the wrong step of the decision process.
[00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.080]   I'm thinking more of NBC.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.840]   Imagine they've got the imagine they got three plates in front of them.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.320]   One plate is iTunes sales.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.360]   And here's a, you know, cartoon like little pile of money.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.200]   And here's how much money they expect to make over one year by selling things by iTunes.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:39.240]   The middle plate contains how much money they tend to make both directly and indirectly
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.600]   by having their own site in which they have some sort of measure of control over who gets
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.240]   it, who gets to download it, I.E.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.760]   Nobody, you know, where they can use it, that sort of thing.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:51.880]   And then you have plate number three, which is empty and says, look, trust us.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.840]   This is the way things are going to go.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:58.520]   If you release this as, as an open MP4, you don't have to release it at HD quality, but
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:03.080]   just release it as a 320 by 240 MP4 that people can load on any device.
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.720]   We are hopefully telling you that the new model is that you will get fans that will
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:10.960]   want it in a better format and will buy the DVDs and will become better, more regular
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.520]   viewers and you will get more money off of the streams that do provoke a revenue.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:19.480]   It's hard to get people past the site of that initial empty plate.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.840]   What I'm really objecting to is, and it's not really so much against you, so much as
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:29.000]   the frequency with which we hear the phrase, oh, these guys just don't get it.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Sometimes they do get it.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.280]   They get it far, far too clearly that their revenue streams are going down, down, down,
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   down, and when you're down to your last dollar, you want to defend that last dollar as best
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:40.280]   you can.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.960]   Well, but I think what Merlin is saying is certainly what I'm saying is the way to defend
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:49.920]   it is not to hang on to the bitter end to DRM and broken business models, but to look
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.800]   for a way to make a land.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   Maybe there isn't.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.320]   If there isn't, then, okay, hold on to your broken business model.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.320]   But I think you-
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.320]   I mean, I think you-
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.040]   I'm struggling not to use an example that's, you know, like socially objectionable because
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.600]   there's a really good, socially objectionable example I could use.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.600]   Well, go ahead.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.040]   Let's say for the sake of argument that you had an industry that was based very heavily
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.920]   on what has now been regarded as not only an illegal but an unethical treatment of other
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.920]   people.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.720]   Are you saying prostitution, slavery?
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.640]   No, let's say you had like a sugar farm.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:20.640]   Okay.
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   It was- you're making rum.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.760]   And you know what the thing is?
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:28.480]   After the- after society starts to change in a certain way and the technology changes,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.960]   let's- let's be less controversial.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.240]   Let's talk about the cotton gin.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:34.720]   Let's talk about anything that fundamentally changes the means of production and how stuff
[00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:36.920]   can be created and moved around.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.960]   I mean, it isn't like every time shipping was misplaced by trains or trains were misplaced
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:47.400]   by airlines or airlines were misplaced by a more efficient system of using- it's not
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:52.120]   like you get to just- you can keep using your old model and keep demanding that people
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.120]   follow it, but I don't think that's-
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:57.040]   At some point you're stuck with piano rolls.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   And-
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   And-
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.040]   I think- I don't want-
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   I'm sorry, but-
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.440]   I think that James Randy Photo insanely great.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:04.440]   Oh, let me see.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.840]   That is like my favorite photos.
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.840]   I got- I saw on a flicker.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.280]   I put it on my blog with attribution.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.280]   But it's a terrific photo of James Randy.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.600]   He should use that for publicity.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.600]   It's fantastic.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.520]   Were you at a James Randy concert?
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.000]   No, I was at the Commerce on World Affairs at the University of Colorado at Golder and
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.800]   he and I were speakers and I was- he's- every year there's like 100 people from all different
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.320]   walks of life invited and every year when the guest- when the speakers list gets released
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.120]   like a month and a half ago, I sort of mentally check off.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.280]   Okay, the following two people, I'm going to try really hard not to behave like a jackass
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   around.
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.640]   Because, you know, and James Randy was one of them because I've been a fan for a while.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   So-
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   I love him.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.640]   It was cool.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.640]   I got to spend a lot of time hanging around with him.
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:49.960]   Partly because he has an iPhone that he both approves of and disapproves of in many ways.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.320]   I was able to counsel him through many crises of faith.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   [laughter]
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.160]   One of which was the simple ability that he can't just take it to Germany and start using
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   it in Germany.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   I mean, that can.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.160]   But just at a price.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:01.160]   Right.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.160]   Exactly.
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:06.880]   We're talking about the premium of unlocked phones and that's might be an increasingly
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.240]   itchy hurdle for Apple to get over.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.600]   Oh, that is a good picture of him.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.840]   I'm seeing an on Flickr now.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.840]   That's a great-
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.480]   Anybody who's new to the world of James Randy has left last time he spoke RA and DI.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:21.160]   And for a little bit of fun, do a YouTube search on James Randy and less name Geller,
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.000]   G-E-L-L-E-R for-
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.480]   I showed my daughter the one on homeopathy, which was fantastic.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:31.160]   And the psychic surgery one reacts to taking out tumors.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.360]   He was one as a kid.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   I was one of the kid.
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.680]   I think he was one of my favorite guests on the Tonight Show.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:39.240]   He is a magician who is lately taken to debunking.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.240]   He's a skeptic.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.080]   He's debunking all sorts of crazy.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.440]   Like telekinesis.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.440]   Really good stuff.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:48.160]   Bending spoons.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.120]   And that is a good, that is a wonderful picture.
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.120]   So we're all screwed, basically.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.360]   I mean, I think we've had this conversation before.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.360]   I think we'll have it again.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:03.520]   And I bring it up because you still got people like this guy at NBC saying, "We could solve
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.520]   the problem with more DRM."
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.520]   Okay.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.000]   Can I make one?
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.720]   Well, I promise you this will be my last day.
[00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:10.720]   Okay.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.400]   That just occurred to me that this is probably what I'm really getting at.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:17.320]   We were making these exact same arguments years ago before the iTunes Store.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.840]   Saying, "Well, by all these record companies are doing a bad job.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:26.040]   They're trying to make music available online, but they're doing it in such a way that we're
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:30.600]   going to remove so much freedom from the user that's doomed to failure.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.840]   It's going to be file sharing, basically, for the rest of the life.
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.520]   That's going to be how you distribute music."
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.040]   Then Apple came out with a way saying, "What if we give people an opportunity, a way that
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:44.240]   they can purchase music, there will be DRM on it, but we will make it so attractive,
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.320]   this method of getting music that it will actually be more popular than stealing music?"
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.920]   And you can make the, you can certainly make the case that I've yet, I've seen some numbers
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.600]   that actually say that iTunes has made significant inroads against people actually downloading
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:02.440]   music that they would have bought had the opportunity.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:07.440]   But it doesn't mean that the idea of having DRM on a piece of content or somehow getting
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:13.040]   people to fork over some money is a terminal, a dead end sort of way of selling stuff.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:16.600]   Remember the NBC wasn't happy with the DRM at iTunes.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.960]   What they're saying is it's not enough.
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.280]   It's not aggressive enough.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:26.040]   And we're going to put our stuff on Hulu until Apple creates a better anti-piracy solution.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.440]   So you're right, it's possible to do kind of less intrusive DRM.
[00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:37.480]   In fact, one of our sponsors Audible uses DRM and it's like iTunes, it's fairly unobtrusive.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.200]   It's not ideal, but you're right.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.080]   I mean, there are degrees, it's not black and white.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:46.120]   But clearly NBC wants it to be a little bit stronger.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:52.040]   And also, 15 states in the District of Columbia say they want their money.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:57.800]   They want sales tax on digital downloads, including iTunes.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:02.960]   Wisconsin and your state, Andy Massachusetts, have formed groups to study iTunes' taxes.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.200]   What do you think?
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.600]   What happened in the past?
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.800]   And I remember that, do you remember a few years ago, wasn't California was trying to
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   do something?
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:11.800]   There still are.
[00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.760]   In fact, if you found Amazon for $50,000, did you file your taxes this year?
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.680]   It was a little checkbox on your California state return saying, "Did you buy anything
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:19.920]   online, fork over the sales list?"
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.680]   The enormous Amazon Prime box.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:28.400]   That was a big dust up a few years ago when that first started happening.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.920]   Now Mike, I imagine there's, I'm not going to say what I did, but I imagine there's widespread
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.040]   fraud on that.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:39.960]   Are you going to fess up and say, "Yeah, I bought $20,000 worth of stuff on Amazon.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.600]   Here's my 7.5 percent."
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.720]   It seems like an unmanageable way of collecting that tax.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.800]   I mean, here in the beloved Commonwealth of Massachusetts, we started a new thing where
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:56.720]   to encourage people to get health coverage, if you don't get health coverage, you no longer
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.600]   get your personal exemption from tax.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:04.680]   If you do have coverage, you have to fill out this two-page form to explain exactly
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.600]   where you got your coverage and why you didn't and that sort of thing.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.160]   That gave me absolute fits two days ago.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.320]   That was just a simple two-page form to explain, "Do you have coverage?
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.240]   Do you not have coverage?
[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.000]   If you don't have coverage, could you afford it?"
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   That was it.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.160]   If I had to go through all of my charges over the year and try to figure out which stuff
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:27.640]   applied to this tax, which did not, and then apply the right tax rate to it, I've got the
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.880]   fake beard and the fake passport waiting and a flight up to anywhere.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.120]   It is controversial.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:38.640]   In fact, in California, the Revenue and Taxation Committee defeated the proposal.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.240]   They had a download tax bill.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:45.200]   Part of it is that you can't collect the tax unless the business has a physical presence
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.200]   in the state.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:51.720]   The fear is that if California passes a download tax, companies just move out of California,
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.240]   costing them more in the long run.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:57.040]   You would see that fought out at a state government level.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.200]   Different federal.
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:49:59.200]   Not federal.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   Within the government, different groups would stand to benefit.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   Absolutely.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:09.040]   Taxation and technology, they really will just amuse the hell out of you.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:14.720]   I was talking to some of the people who work at Yahoo who telecommute, which is great because
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.320]   they're at least two people.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.000]   They essentially, they are the Denver field office of Yahoo.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.360]   So if you ever, I joke when I posted a picture on Flickr that if you ever hear that the Denver
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.280]   field office went as relocated to the Cayman Islands, it doesn't mean they're doing some
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.040]   weird tax thing.
[00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.800]   They just wanted to do some scuba diving as husband and wife.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.320]   But they're telling me about how difficult it is that they actually had an employee.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:42.200]   I hope I'm not misquoting this, but Yahoo had some employee who wanted to in Minnesota,
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.200]   who wanted to telecommute.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.240]   It cost the company a huge amount of money because according to archaic tax laws, if a
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:53.120]   company has any full-time employee living in state, they have to essentially, they're
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.880]   entitled to a certain amount of revenue that was generated by that employee in the state.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:02.480]   And so now at Yahoo and other tech companies, if you say you want to telecommute, they ask,
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.160]   "Well, where do you want to live?"
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.000]   Because there's some states that are now off the boards because it will just cost them
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.200]   way, way too much money.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.680]   That's so funny.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:15.640]   I used to be a work at home employee years ago where I was, and it was for this really
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.240]   kind of old guard company company.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:23.880]   It was an internet company, but the people who ran it, operations people have been around
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:24.880]   for 30 years.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:30.080]   I remember one day going on to my mailbox and there was one of those Workman's Comp posters
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.560]   where it's like, "Well, if you want to file a claim for Workman's Comp," and I had
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.240]   to, he demanded that I put it up in my office.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.800]   So for a long time, for a year, I had a post-
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.120]   For Workman's Comp, I had a Workman's Comp poster in my bedroom.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.520]   I'm surprised that it had to do like, get the cleanliness rated.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.440]   I was going to say, yes.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   What's your sanitation rating?
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.240]   It would not be good right now.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.480]   It would not be good at all.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:58.480]   I'm going to write my column, but I'm going to put it on my hairnet.
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:02.320]   What percentage of rat feces will we allow in the column this week?
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.680]   It depends on the column.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:11.760]   Let the readers tell us how much rat feces we have.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:14.160]   Let's wrap this up in a second with our picks.
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.840]   Before we do, it's audible time.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.040]   Did you guys do audible commercials last week in the week before?
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   I believe that we did.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   You are good.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.400]   Thank you.
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.880]   We are devoted fans of Audible.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.880]   We are.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:26.880]   We were doing it.
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:27.880]   We were sponsored or not.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:29.440]   I did a little kind of impromptu meetup.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.440]   I did two actually.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:34.960]   One at the Sydney Airport by 15 people showed up and then one in Hobart, Tasmania, another
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:37.520]   I'd say maybe 10 people showed up.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.160]   I asked the 10.
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.760]   I said, I know in Australia you don't have the same selection of books, but are you?
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.640]   They were all Audible members.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.400]   So I think at some point we've now saturated.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:52.080]   But if you're not a member, if you're one of the few, tweet listeners who's not a member,
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:58.000]   go to audible.com/macbreak and sign up because you'll get a credit toward a free book.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.160]   And if you are out of the US, you should check first to make sure that book is available
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.160]   for download.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.000]   It's different in every country because the publishers are different in every country.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.400]   So the rights, it's complicated.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   That's another.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.920]   Don't get me started on globalism because that's another issue entirely.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.240]   Some day, some day the world will all be one.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.160]   But until then, make sure that the book you want is available.
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.000]   We got a two recommendations.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.600]   I'm going to let you both do recommendations, guys, starting with Andy and not co.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:32.240]   OK, this is a recommendation that I have that I this is a book that I got, a lot of
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.080]   sheer laziness.
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:39.520]   One of the great nonfiction books really of the past 100 years has been Peter Ackroyd's
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:43.120]   book about about the history of the city of London.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:47.160]   And so it's the fact that it's not called really it's not treated like a like a here's
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.520]   a book about the history of London.
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:53.120]   They actually call it London colon, the biography, because that's the way that he really paints
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:58.520]   a picture of this living, breathing, dynamic thing that's you know, that's that's that's
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:01.160]   located at the bottom of this landmass.
[00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:06.320]   And he really digs deep down into the histories about how one event leads into another event,
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:11.440]   how daily life in the city is still being affected by a fire that occurred centuries
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:15.440]   earlier, how a simple decision about where a certain property line was going to be drawn
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:19.840]   and decided how the money how the money system went 100 years later.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.040]   It really is interesting.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:27.480]   However, it's one of those books that goodness if they're building a new school and they they
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.880]   they forgot to order a ceremonial cornerstone, you can buy this book, set it in the concrete.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.840]   It's about the same size and weight.
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.640]   So it's one of those books that when during a trip to London, I actually got interested
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.800]   in the history of the place bought this book.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.920]   I think I read the first 20 pages and I just never got through it again.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:46.920]   But then I started buying the audible audio books.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.200]   It's so big that it's actually chopped up into three different volumes.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:55.720]   So what I'm recommending is probably going to be London, the biography, the volume entitled
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:57.160]   Street Life and the People.
[00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.360]   Is that one of the bunch?
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.840]   It's I'm recommending it because it's the most recent one I've listened to.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:04.600]   I haven't gotten to the third one yet.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:10.320]   I've read I've heard all the way through that one and the section about districts and suburbs.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:15.560]   Will really appeal to you if you're one of those people who just loves the idea that
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:18.800]   all there's a reason why there's a reason why there's only two.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:22.800]   Oh, let me go into Boston history because it happens to be one of my favorite little
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:27.480]   stories about the development of the city of Boston that in the old part of the city,
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.280]   there's only two streets that intersect at right angles.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.160]   Everything else is like a big walk of former walkway or former pathway.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.400]   It's Rope Street and Rope Street crosses over Church Street at a right angle.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.560]   And there's a story behind it because Church Street, as you can guess, you used to be the
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.680]   route that people used to take to get to church.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.920]   However, to get the to take that direct route, they set to cut through some guy's property.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.880]   He used to get sick and tired of people cutting through.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.520]   So when mass when when church was happening, he would string a rope across the path so
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:55.400]   you couldn't really drive horses across it.
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.640]   So that became Rope Street cutting across Church Street.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.280]   So if that's a sort of story that you really like, you will enjoy the book that the volume
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.760]   about districts and suburbs because once again, it will tell you the history about how communities
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.840]   form and how they build and grow.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:13.600]   Great life will give you a more eye level account of what the city has been like since it was
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.680]   first founded.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.560]   But you really can't get I don't think there's a there's a loser in this bunch, the three
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:21.360]   volumes and you'll get your first one for free and you'll probably wind up buying the
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.360]   next two.
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:25.560]   That's kind of I bought the first one, not really anticipating that would be buying all
[00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:26.560]   three.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.560]   But now I'm nearly done with the second and I'll probably buy the third too.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.560]   Boy, these sounds good.
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.320]   I have to like that sounds really great.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.600]   London, the biography Peter Ackroyd.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:37.160]   Is it a C K R O Y D?
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.160]   Yes, exactly like Dan Aykroyd's younger brother.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.800]   Oh, is he?
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:42.800]   Retrivia.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:43.800]   Well, no, it's not.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.840]   It's not the same person, but Dan Aykroyd does have a younger brother by the name of Peter
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.400]   Ackroyd, I believe.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:53.160]   Oh, ACK R O Y D is probably the actual piece of information that I was meaning to convey
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.160]   to your listeners.
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:57:00.440]   And the mess of giving you Boston history and SNL writer, this is it's the rat holes that
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.440]   make this show.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:04.520]   And he also has Shakespeare, the biography.
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.920]   I'll have to check that out too.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.920]   It's like 80 volumes.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.120]   It looks like it goes on and on.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.760]   I can't wait.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:14.460]   So there's one recommendation, but that's not the only one because we've got dueling
[00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:17.640]   recommendations, Mr. Merlin Mann.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:24.200]   I am currently obsessed with a comedy duo from the UK called called Mitchell and Webb
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.920]   David Mitchell and Robert Webb.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.680]   And they are actually you will know, I'll tell you how you'll know them.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:34.400]   You'll know them from the not particularly funny UK version of the on the Mac commercial.
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:35.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:37.680]   It's not as good as the.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:39.800]   That's not their best material.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:44.880]   So these are two guys who are writers, comedians, and they've had done a whole bunch of different
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:46.640]   stuff with radio and TV.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:52.680]   Right now, if you have BBC America, you can watch their wonderful program called that
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.920]   Mitchell and Webb look.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:59.880]   They also they had a really funny sitcom that's about to air its fifth season in the UK called
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.440]   Peep Show, kind of an odd couple thing.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:06.160]   And they're just they're two just really desperately funny talented guys.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.360]   And the one I wanted to mention today is I noticed that because, you know, I'm obsessed,
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:16.600]   I noticed that Audible has their their radio series, which is called that Mitchell and
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:17.600]   Webb sound.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:18.600]   Cool page.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:23.920]   And it's a skit comedy and and like a lot of the great British sketch comedy, you're
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:25.920]   like you're in and you're out in two minutes.
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.880]   Just Zing very funny done before a live audience.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:30.880]   Very enjoyable.
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:36.080]   I you know if you if you like if you enjoy, I'm trying to think who they're kind of like
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:39.240]   they don't do like like terribly terribly broad characters.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.920]   A lot of it's just situational humor, but they do characters.
[00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.640]   Just so people can hear what it's absolutely.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:47.640]   Here's a little Mitchell and Webb.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:51.000]   So about a porn bag.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:58.880]   I'm finding that your first love is now a new demodel.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:02.720]   That would be a surprise, wouldn't it?
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:10.000]   Totally undermines the achievement of having got a nude yourself in the first place.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.840]   All those years.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.560]   I love it.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:19.320]   I just sent you a link to one of my favorite TV skits that they do.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:21.600]   It's called Bronze Age Orientation Day.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:26.800]   And it's the two is the two of them as sort of like very late Stone Age guys are realizing
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:27.800]   that the times are changing.
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   Oh boy.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:32.160]   It's a good orientation day for Bronze Age to learn how their jobs are going to be made
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.160]   redundant.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.160]   That sounds familiar.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:38.200]   It reminds me a lot about of kids in the hall.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.520]   If the kids in the hall were like not Canadian and only two of them.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.760]   Just the other night on BBC America, they had a real kids in the hall type sketch where
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:52.320]   it's an action an action TV show starring BMX bandit and the summoner of agent Angel.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:53.320]   That's it.
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.320]   That's Mitchell and Webb.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.560]   One of them is, you know, has does can do all these really awesome BMX.
[00:59:58.560 --> 00:59:59.560]   The angel summoner.
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.880]   And so here's what I'm going to do.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.040]   I'll I'll leap.
[01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:08.680]   I'll jump my bike over the hallway, do a stubble flip, kick the bandit kick the bandit's
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:12.440]   like twice in the in the in the jaw with my rear wheel wheel, then leap up on the rear
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.440]   rail boat.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.000]   And meanwhile the angel summoner is yeah.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.720]   Or I could summon a horde of warrior angels who could take them all out in like that.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:21.720]   Really.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.720]   Oh, but you're good too.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:29.600]   I'll tell you what next time we will definitely do a plan that uses your BMX skills.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.640]   That's by the way on this audio as well.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   If you enjoy them that you will.
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:38.760]   So that's to be a great pick for Audible if you enjoy comedy and I'm in a larger sense.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.280]   I'm suggesting that you go out and start googling around for Mitchell and Webb that tons of
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.440]   their stuff is on YouTube.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.080]   I post way too much of their stuff on Kung Fu grip.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.280]   But yeah, if you enjoy British comedy, I do.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.280]   I love it.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.240]   One of the things that's Audible has been doing is putting a lot of BBC programming up audio
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.800]   programming up, which is great.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.560]   I think audible.com it's more than just books, but it's a great way to listen your way through
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:05.600]   the great works, the minor works, the comedic works, the pornographic works.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.040]   It's all there audible.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.080]   I threw that in just, you know, like we'll fix that in post.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:12.080]   Audible.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.440]   Well, the reason is I'm looking for London, the biography and I found London 35 erotic
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.440]   tales.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.200]   So I thought, well, that's probably pretty close.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:21.640]   We don't judge.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.760]   We just want your money on the full.com/macbreak.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   We love them.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.000]   And I know you will too.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   Check them out.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.120]   Now it's time.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:37.840]   It's pick time among the three of us, not as many picks as usual.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.840]   Let's start with Andy Inock.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.120]   Oh, there you go.
[01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.040]   This one is going to be a call back to January.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:49.840]   There is a little item that I picked up at Mac world Expo that was not to be shipping until
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.120]   about now or rather until March.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.600]   And I'm informed that it is going to be shipping in the next week or two.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.920]   So I can actually make it a formal pick.
[01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.880]   Joby's GorillaPod GoGo, which is proving to be.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.600]   Oh, this is the one with the section kit.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   That's great.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.600]   Exactly.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.120]   Some of you are already familiar with the the eternal majesty of the GorillaPod tripod.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:14.000]   This is it'll you get it and it looks like a like an alien hand because it's a three
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   leg tripod.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.700]   But instead of having rigid legs, it's the magic like a finger with about 10 knuckles
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.220]   coated with rubber and with ball joints on them.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:25.760]   So yes, you can stand it up as a tripod, but you can also essentially turn it into a hand
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.520]   to grab a rail or grab a pole or bend it into any shape that's going to be useful to get
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.240]   your camera point in the right way.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.240]   You're going to do it.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:36.600]   And this is one of these really wonderfully subtle and brilliant ideas.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:40.600]   They thought, well, right now the GorillaPod only works with things that have a tripod
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:42.820]   mount, I.e. a camera of some sort.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:47.500]   What if we were to develop a mounting system so that you could use any device that you
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.900]   want with this tripod system?
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:53.800]   And so if you buy the GorillaPod go go, you get the compact sized GorillaPod.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.040]   It's about the size of a few pencils that lash together.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.240]   You can put in your shirt pocket very easily.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:02.160]   And you also get three different clip on mounts.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:04.640]   One of them is a standard tripod mount.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.560]   So you can use it with your little pocket camera.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:11.920]   The other is an adhesive thing that will just stick to the bottom of your iPod or whatever
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.920]   permanently.
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:18.820]   But the third thing is a really good like inch wide suction cup that really sticks to any
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.340]   smooth clean surface.
[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.140]   It works great with an iPod touch.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:24.740]   It works great with my iPod Nano.
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:29.780]   And I can't tell you how many different ways I was using it last week in any travel situation.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:32.100]   But for instance, I was on American.
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:37.940]   I was not in the Super-Elegance seat back video section, but I was able to simply put the
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:42.540]   suction cup on my iPod touch, attach it to the GorillaPod, and then bend it into a shape
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.320]   so that it could grip on to the seat back in front of me.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.080]   So I had seat back video.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:51.840]   I was recording all of the sessions that I was doing and just sticking on the back of
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.520]   my iPod Nano, put my Belkin recorder in the bottom of it, used it as a regular tripod.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:00.720]   And it became this beautiful little broadcasting mic for the thing.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:05.360]   While earlier, I was in the car helping to navigate someplace somewhere.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.760]   And I did not bring the big complicated glass mount for my GPS.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:16.540]   If I did happen to bring my GPS with me again, I was able to just wrap the thing around the
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:20.480]   visor of the car and turn it into a mount for the GPS.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.000]   The bottom line is it's one of those things where you will buy it without any specific
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   use for it.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.960]   But if you travel with it, you will be using it three or four times a day.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.120]   It's not that expensive.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.120]   I believe it's like a little less than, I think it's $35.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.440]   If you already have a GorillaPod of that size, you can buy just the mounting clip set for
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.680]   11 bucks, but you will buy it, you will put it in your bag and you will be using it over
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.680]   and over and over again.
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.840]   I was surprised to see even some of the professional photographers using the having carry and
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   GorillaPods with them.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:52.400]   And of course, they carry really expensive carbon fiber, Gizzo, you know, $800 tripod,
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:56.640]   but they have the GorillaPod also in there because it's just times when it's really useful.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.080]   And it looks like the weirdest thing.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:02.240]   It looks like you under no circumstances, but you want to trust a $400 thing to holding
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:03.680]   this thing up.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.000]   But nonetheless, you know, so you borrow it from somebody and you find out that good
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.440]   God, it actually will grip very, very securely to anything you have.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.360]   I do have some pictures of what I've been using it for during the week.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.360]   Click up on my Flickr feed.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.520]   I'm going to send it to you right now as you see.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:20.840]   You can see the seat back video.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.720]   I posted that on my very web blog or blog because I thought that way I saw you enjoying
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   house from your window.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:26.720]   See that?
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.320]   You guys just, you know, you really, there's a back and forth between you two that's just
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320]   really admirable.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.320]   You hardly need you at all, Leo.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:39.000]   Did you just leave the reporter on and just let us, I was going to take off here because
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.720]   yeah, you two get along so well.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.640]   You buy it at Jobe.com.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.200]   Is that where you buy a store?
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.080]   Yes, it's, you can, it'll be available in retail outlets.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:53.400]   If you go to Jobe.com, you will see a teaser for it because apparently they're not actually
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.600]   ready to start selling it yet.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.080]   I am told that it will be, I'm told that it really, really will start stripping shortly.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:01.040]   So their grace period is now up.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.840]   I feel as though I'm not helping them anymore by not, you know, recommending this thing.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.040]   I think that the more people get excited about it and get interested in buying it, the sooner
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.160]   they're going to say, well, you know what guys, stop fighting about whether the little
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.080]   cardboard insert in the back of the package would be blue or should have a picture of
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:15.840]   a duck or a picture of a swan.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.040]   People just want to buy this.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.040]   Please sell it to them.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040]   So let's just be clear.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.720]   Jobe sells the gorilla pod in a lot of different form factors.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.280]   You can buy a lot of different places, but you're talking about a particular one with
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:27.280]   the suction cup.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   It's called the go go.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.080]   It's not just the suction cup.
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:35.480]   If you really want to permanently mount it on, it's a hot swappable little shoes where
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:40.160]   you can just take it off the tripod and put it on the tripod with a suction cup mount.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.480]   It will stick to anything that has a smooth surface.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   If you want to use the self adhesive shoe, you can still remove it from the tripod where
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   you want.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:50.520]   But of course you'll have that little plastic triangle mounted on the back thing permanently
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.840]   until you scrape it off.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.320]   But yeah, it's the gorilla pod go go.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.080]   It is actually one of their standard gorilla pods with this special mounting, these special
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.560]   mounting adapters that come with it.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:00.560]   Cool.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.880]   And it's not available yet, but it will be any minute now.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.840]   Any second now, I wouldn't hold Brad breath unless you could pull your breath for more
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.360]   than four days or a week.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.600]   If you can, that might be a good public YouTube it.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:12.600]   That might be a good marketing thing for you for you.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:13.880]   He's turning blue.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:15.360]   He's getting bluer.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.880]   He's really blue now.
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.200]   And yeah, you can take a look at it anyway on the go go.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:25.640]   Jobe sight at goby.com and click the go go button under gorilla pod.
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:28.600]   My pick is actually a game.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.640]   I like puzzle games.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:33.560]   I like my brain being challenged and I don't really have time.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:40.160]   I wish I did for really elaborate long games like Halo three and you know, World of Warcraft.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:44.000]   I try to play them, but they just take too much of my time and I got too much to do.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.480]   So I love the little short games I can play that challenge me that I could play one level
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.480]   like lemmings.
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480]   Remember lemmings that was so great.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:51.480]   You'd solve a level.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.480]   You'd feel good.
[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.560]   You can move on with your life.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.560]   This is similar.
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.560]   It's called Enigma.
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:58.040]   Enigma two is out from Pangea software.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.520]   The folks that do nano sore.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:06.920]   Remember Bugdom used to come with Max nano series to come with Max Enigma two is 20 bucks.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:07.920]   It's hard to describe.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.120]   It's kind of like you have these little liquid drops and you've got to pilot them by cleverly
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:22.200]   placing bouncering, you know, bouncers and droppers and and and sliders and accelerators
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.960]   and sponges and and then you solve the problem.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:25.960]   You have a time limit.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.560]   You know, the faster you do it, the more points you get.
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.360]   There are 70 levels.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:34.800]   20 of them are for kids, which I think is great because it teaches kids logic and kind
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.120]   of physics too and it has a level editor.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:42.960]   Now it's $20 and the reason I thought of it is because the new Mac heist has just started
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.320]   and it's one of the items in Mac heist.
[01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:49.000]   So you can buy Enigma two for 20 bucks for 50 bucks.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.040]   You could get that bugged him to nano sort to X slimmer, right room, wallet, overflow,
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:59.440]   buy clip, Devin think personal, cover, suture, chitching, awaken and overview.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:03.680]   Those are the bundle packages in the Mac heist bundle this time around.
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.160]   Some of these are repeats from the last bundle.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:08.560]   So if you already bought a Mac heist bundle, you may be less motivated to get involved
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.560]   with that.
[01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:16.560]   And you remember we had the pro and con on Mac heist before with the Mac heist guys and
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.640]   from bare bone software, we had Rob on.
[01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.160]   And I think our conclusion, correct me if I'm wrong, was that, you know, it's up to
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.880]   the developers if they want to participate in this.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.840]   It's certainly a good deal for the users.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:31.840]   And these are 12 packages for 50 bucks or just get Enigma yourself for 20 if that's
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.960]   all you want, but a fun, fun time waster.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.240]   That's my pick of the week.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240]   Merlin man.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:44.400]   Apple sometimes figures out what it really wants to do to make something better by learning
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:49.720]   from applications that they borrow from or you could put it less generously.
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:53.240]   I think one that they will eventually borrow from that I am loving right now is called
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.040]   time machine editor.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:10:01.880]   And boy, I don't know that one hour time machine setting basically time machine is the leperates
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:07.120]   backup solution that lets you kind of theoretically seamlessly back up the stuff on your drive
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:11.000]   incrementally so you can roll back to a certain date in a certain folder or what have you.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   It's great.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   I use it.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   I didn't initially think it was very useful.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.800]   I now really like it and use it.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.440]   Side tip, if you're going to use time machine, be careful about what you choose to back up.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:26.680]   Maybe leave out stuff that's extremely heavy in terms of gigabytes if you don't need to
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.680]   back it up.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.680]   But it's great.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:33.960]   The trouble is that there's no way that I'm aware of without a non-gooey change to change
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.560]   how often it does the backing up for you.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.640]   And which can, if you're like me and you got a lot of stuff moving around, you end up,
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.280]   it feels like you're backing up all the time.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.840]   And that does start, if you start watching your CPU usage, you see that a lot of cycles
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.040]   are going toward different kinds of files sync.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.920]   And so it's nice to think time machine editor.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.200]   This is a free app that allows you to go in and does exactly one thing.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:58.320]   It lets you go in and say how often you want time machine to back up.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.920]   So you could say I want it to be every four hours.
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.520]   I want it to be once a day at 2 a.m.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.360]   And there's a couple of little bits you can flip to say back up when disks are mounted,
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.960]   back up when it wicks from sleep and so on.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.680]   Anyway, basically one very simple app that fixes one kind of annoying problem.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.920]   It's free.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:20.040]   It's available at time software.free.fr/timemachineeditor, one word.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.000]   Or you could just Google time machine editor, one word.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   Cool.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   I think that's great.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.880]   Time machine is such a good idea.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.320]   And then, but for people who are more advanced, just so frustrating.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.320]   So I think anything that's in the future.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.320]   It is.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   And man, yeah.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.360]   And the whole look with the whole space thing.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.360]   What do you think about that?
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:39.000]   It's kind of a waste of effort.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   I don't use it.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   It's weird.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:43.400]   It's kind of like in its own little Mac world, isn't it?
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   I think.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   Yeah, it is.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   I am in Mac space.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400]   Same way, spotlight.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.600]   Spotlight kind of doesn't really live where you'd expect the two on your Mac.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:52.800]   It doesn't really operate like an application.
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:57.720]   Well, it kind of violates, I hate to say it, but it violates one of the fundamental rules
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.320]   of Macdom from day one, which is not to be modal.
[01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.840]   The whole idea of a Mac is you don't go into modes.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.560]   You know, e-max is a classic modal.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.400]   You either are editing or moving.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.240]   You can't do both.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.760]   And so in response to that, I think in the earliest days of the Mac, Jeff Raskin probably
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.160]   gets most credit for this.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.760]   The idea was there are no modes.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.560]   You know, everything is just there.
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.440]   It's in a window and you can do anything.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.920]   And boy, you couldn't get more modal than Time Machine.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.280]   You have to go into a backup mode.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.040]   And I think that's exactly what you're.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.040]   I would not.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.160]   There's a part in me that I know they're really married to that whole goofy looking,
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.320]   you know, spacey leopard look, but it would not surprise me a lot to see the look and
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.320]   even functionality.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.720]   Well, to see it change, to see it become more like, you know, a regular Mac app.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:45.240]   Because it feels very gimmicky to me right now.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.240]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.240]   But it does work.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.240]   It works great.
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.240]   And I've seen some novel uses for it lately.
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.760]   I mean, one that I use it for obviously is, I mean, and let's be honest, I mean, do you
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.480]   really need every directory incrementally backed up every hour?
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.400]   I mean, maybe, you know, if you're doing a lot of development and that's your only way
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:01.760]   of controlling source, which would be nuts, that's probably good.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.520]   But you know, for all kinds of really unexpected stuff, I'll tell you where I use it as preferences.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.280]   If I've accidentally messed up my OmniFocus file, I'll frequently do that.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:09.280]   I'll frequently roll back with that.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:10.520]   Oh, what a good idea.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.560]   Any kind of that P list thing where you've messed something up, I saw somebody the other
[01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:16.720]   day mentioning it's great for if you screw up a CSS file.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.720]   How do you do that?
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.040]   Do you have to actually go back to the P list folder and you go to go to wherever the file
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.280]   is that you want to roll back to.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.440]   So you go in in the finder, you go to that, you select that file, open time machine, the
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.400]   magic happens and your screen opens up in space.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.400]   And then with with and so that will remain selected.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.800]   And then you just roll back.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:41.560]   And what I do is I generally set the window so that I can see how many K it is, how many,
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.760]   what the file size it is.
[01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:46.040]   And I look for a different file size and I think that size.
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:51.080]   And when you hit the roll back to that, you hit restore and then this that slowly goes
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.040]   away and comes back to the Mac.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.040]   And just basically, essentially, all it really does is paste that file into that window.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.040]   And that's it.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.040]   You're set.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.080]   But yeah, CSS.p list versions of graphics.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.640]   Like if you're like me and you get really fast and loose, like sloppily changing, save
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.400]   as final, final version three, like there's a lot of times, you're like, oh, God, I really
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.840]   wish I'd saved this one version of that.
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.120]   That's a great use for that.
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.120]   Cool.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.640]   And I, you know, if they could set that so that eventually, one last thing I'll shut
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.680]   up, it would be kind of neat if you could be pickier about some folders than others.
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:26.840]   So I might say, for example, yeah, incrementally back up my downloads folder at two in the
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.520]   morning.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:33.840]   But like, you know, upgrade and incrementally update my desktop like every 20 minutes.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.080]   Because that's something where there's a lot going on.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.440]   That would be you can't do that with this free time machine.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.280]   No, no, you, I don't know.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.520]   I wonder if you can do that.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.720]   My sense is that there's not that Glenn granularity definitely doing it.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:46.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.080]   That's a problem with backup software in general.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.840]   I'm surprised what I'm surprised that the only major Mac backup software, let's you do
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:58.200]   something as simple as look, I don't have a huge hard drive to back stuff up on just
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:04.000]   back up my documents folder, recent purposes and my contacts and calendars and leave the
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.160]   rest of it alone.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.400]   The rest of this ops will let you do that, but you have to point it at the folders you
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.920]   want to keep or tell to ignore everything except for these three or four folders.
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:19.520]   I think it's more of a natural language way to backing up that most people really understand.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.880]   I use Chronosync to do that.
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:22.600]   And I, but yeah, you have to point at the folders.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:26.440]   But once you set it up, then it's, it's automatic.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.680]   And I just, I'm just surprised.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:29.400]   That's not as simple as backup all my documents.
[01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.400]   I don't care about anything else.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.400]   Just backup all my documents.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.600]   I wish somebody would take maybe Alex.
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.840]   I'm almost reluctant to say retrospect because they're a little bit Byzantine in the interface,
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:43.120]   but I wish somebody would take a retrospect like experience and put that on unison where
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.160]   you could do things like, you know, like with crown, you know, how Leo and Chronosync,
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.880]   you can say this side always wins versus this side, right?
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.600]   Like it will merge these files if they're text.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.520]   I think bringing that, like that's one thing.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:58.000]   Unisynth is great at unison will do diff three on whatever it's comparing and make the changes
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.600]   based on your rules.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.560]   But that's non trivial for an average user to set up because it's all done in a text
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:09.320]   file, you know, it's all done in a dot, you know, an invisible file at the root directory.
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.320]   So I don't know.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320]   Have you guys ever messed with unison much?
[01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.320]   I've talked about it.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.320]   No, you've recommended it.
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:15.320]   Yeah.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.320]   And I haven't used it.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.480]   It's great for multiple things that you want to sync up.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.000]   Like if you've got the same folder on four different places, you basically identify this
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.200]   host server and then you kind of SSH in and tell them to do its magic and it's kind of
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.200]   like Chronosync.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:29.200]   You could probably use it to backup.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.200]   It is.
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.200]   It's very powerful.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.600]   And you can say which things to leave in and leave out.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.720]   And yeah, it's very close to Chronosync in a lot of ways.
[01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:39.400]   But the merging is powerful because if you're working with text files and you're updating
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:45.240]   them in several different places, it can do some magic to make sure nothing gets clobbered.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.240]   Very cool.
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:49.320]   I want to recommend you look nice today.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.080]   Oh, you're so nice to say that.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   I love it.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:55.400]   Well, hey, any show that has John Hodgman doing the opening?
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.240]   That's actually not just a guy who sounds a lot like that.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.240]   That's not Hodgman.
[01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.560]   It's Dr. Nien.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.560]   And he.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.560]   Okay.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.560]   Okay.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:06.320]   So, he's recently arrived from Argentina and he's got a lot of political legal problems.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.320]   Let me play a little bit of the.
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.600]   No, this right now we're telling the field, which is basically a thing.
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:12.600]   Huh?
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.040]   It's not safe for work.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   I know.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.040]   Can I play the beginning?
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.040]   All right.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.040]   I don't know.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.040]   I can't remember.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.600]   I listened to episode three B. Let me see if I could skip guys.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.840]   I think three B three B's got a little bit of blue humor in it.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.280]   Maybe I better not just you know what you listen to yourself.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:31.280]   You know what?
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.280]   I'm not sure if you're listening to the video.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.280]   I'm not sure if you're listening to the video.
