[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.280]   news from Apple. The week after iPhone announcement or two, there's usually not
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.800]   much news from Apple, but we're gonna do something. We might be talking about
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.200]   the Mandalorian, but we will do something. Laurie Gill is here. She is a senior
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.560]   managing editor at imore.com. Hello, Laurie. I like that you you've given me a
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.600]   promotion. I'm the senior managing. I don't know. You're executive vice
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.800]   president. I'm gonna tell my boss that and he's just gonna have to give me
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   that promotion now. I'm your main not even be such a position. I don't know.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.120]   There isn't. I'm making it up as I go along. That's really kind of 90% of what
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.720]   we do here. Also with us from WGBH in Boston, Mr. Andy Ennuck. A brief visit
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.560]   from Andy Ennaco. Hello, Andrew. I'm making a subliminal appearance twice as
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.240]   effective and one-twelfth was annoying. Terrifying. Terrifying. It's in your
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.640]   brain now, folks. You can't get rid of it. Also from all the way up in Moriel,
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.560]   where the snow is only three feet high, Mr. Renee Richie of YouTube.com.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.680]   So you laugh, LaPauk, but it was 24 degrees two days ago and I'm doing
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.120]   degrees today and I'm clinging to hot beverages for it just going up and down.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.680]   It's like a yo-yo. I don't know. Can't make any sense of it anymore. Yeah.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.720]   So that was those were both in Celsius. Yeah, it went from like me.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.200]   Something like 80 to 30. And then I'm sure it's gonna go back again. Yeah.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.160]   Anyway, great to have all three of you in the in the saddle. Let me just ask one by one.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.760]   Do you buy iPhones or an A or you just kind of live on review units?
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.200]   Most years I buy one of each just because I always want you have to give back the review units.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.720]   I always want to have my own handy for testing and to go back and do things like photo comparisons
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.520]   year over year. I've bought every I at least one of every iPhone every year, but there's
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.440]   only four this year. That's a lot of money. So far I bought an iPhone 12.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.920]   I did not buy the pro because I know I'm buying the max. Yes, probably the mini.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.240]   So I might get three out of the four or I might just end up buying the four in a drunken stupor
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   one. We spent the day on iOS today this morning talking about Micah's iPhone 12 pro.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:03.000]   But even Micah says, yeah, I'm going to turn it in and get the max and I'm holding out for the max.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.080]   Are you going to hold out for the max, Lori? What are you doing?
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.600]   The mini. Come on. Are you listening to me?
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.120]   You'll be the only person I know who has that little tiny phone.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.920]   Oh, God. I can't wait. I am so excited about the mini. I'm not as overwhelmed by the differences
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:28.280]   between the cameras. I've got the 12 and the 12 pro review units and I really don't see a major
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.240]   difference between these and the thing that you get with the pro max. It's big and it's cool,
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.120]   but it's not what everybody needs. So it's kind of one of those things where I think that the 12
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.040]   pro max is a little bit of a FOMO situation for a lot of people that just they're just not going
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.480]   to need that level of photography for photos that they're putting on Instagram or Twitter or
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.840]   something like that. So they just want it because it's the best, but I think that for the most part,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.800]   the 12 is really what anybody needs. The 12 plane, not even the pro.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.880]   Plain the 12 standard. Yeah. And for me, the 12 mini. In the mini,
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.960]   you're going to get everything that's in the 12 just smaller. Yeah, exactly. Smaller.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.880]   Andy, do you think you'll buy one this year or are you going to stick with it? Pics it too.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:26.360]   I don't know. As my daily driver, excuse me, I do have a brand new shining $350 pixel for A.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.280]   Very nice. But I have been like, now is around the time where I start to calculate out
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.800]   like my budget, like the broader terms, my budget for the next year. And I'm already thinking that,
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.160]   well, you know, the most recent iPhone that you actually own is the iPhone 8. It would not be
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.720]   out of line for you to buy a new iPhone so that the one that you the one in your library and the
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   fact that the fact that it happens to be a really nice camera is completely, completely irrelevant.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:06:00.360]   You are a tiny little copy. But yeah, I don't have my review yet because I'm I've basically
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.280]   made it clear that, hey, I'm going to take my time with this. So whenever you're going to start
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.600]   to come back, let it back again. So I'll probably have a chance to play with it for at least three
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.640]   or four or three or four months. Like you like Renee said, you do have to send them back.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.160]   They're Apple is usually nice enough that if I ask for an extension, they'll give it to me
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.040]   so that I can have like several several months with it at least, you know, an inventory for
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.800]   continued testing and continued software checking out. But yeah, it's there's no there's no replacement
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.040]   for having one that you absolutely own that you don't have to worry about. Well, if I want to put
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.800]   my sim in this and actually use it as a phone for a month, but gee, should I really be doing that
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.960]   if it's not actually my phone? And yeah, this is this one. I do not every time.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.360]   I'm doing for testing. It's everyone has to navigate it a different way. I don't I feel as
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.280]   a wall. I'm before I'm doing like the well, I'm doing like the big review or the first big hey,
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.000]   here's how I feel about it. Then yes, absolutely. But there comes a point for all the hardware that
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.440]   I borrow that when it becomes something that is actually part of like my daily carry that this is
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.000]   this is being used for actual productive stuff. It's like, okay, at this point, you need to actually
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.320]   buy this because you can't have companies giving you free hardware even though even if they were
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:13.240]   willing to give you free hardware with with general with which generally they are not.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.560]   Yeah, but it's changed. So like there's gift there's hashtag gift from Google all over Twitter now,
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.160]   which never used to be the case. Yeah, three years ago, just the whole thing is
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.080]   what is hashtag gift from Google? That means they gave you a something of phone.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.880]   They just yeah, they gave they give phones to influencers now, which is different,
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.720]   I think than the reviews because the reviews on a different timeline than the gift from Google.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   There was a day when I was on good terms with Apple where they would give me stuff. I remember
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:42.120]   one Christmas. I got a gift wrapped box from Apple many years ago with iPods in it like every
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:48.040]   model of iPod that they were currently selling and it just kind of shocked me. I mean, it's
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:54.120]   a Google gave you Apple products. No, not from did I say from Google? No, Apple.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.480]   Oh, so it was Apple. Okay. Okay. No, that's back when Apple likes me.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.360]   I don't think they do that anymore. No, I don't think so. I'll work at that box.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.080]   There was a very nice lady, Kerry Walker, who was responsible for their loan program. And often,
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:13.560]   when they loaned you a Mac, they would just loan it to you without end date. But those times are
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.640]   all changed. And frankly, I prefer not to do that these days. I have the resources to buy.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:24.200]   And that reminds me, Andy, in terms of your budgeting, that's actually something you have to
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   consider this year too, is whether or not you're going to have to buy that silicon Mac when it comes
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   up. Yeah, I've been thinking about that. Yeah. Well, that's that's easier because that is like
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.720]   no doubt about it. Like the thing that I'm actually doing podcasting from the thing I'm
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.880]   actually doing my writing on, that would be pretty darn obnoxious to say, Oh, like,
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:47.640]   they example for I'm giving you a fair and unbiased review of this $2000 computer,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.520]   which I'm doing much how now rely on daily to get all my daily work. No, no, that that won't do.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.280]   There is a standard among YouTube, especially YouTube influencers. And I don't mean this
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.520]   in any way to disparage you. I can take it. I can take it. But there is a lower standard of
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:09.080]   integrity these days. Well, they take it's so new to them. Like they like a lot of people who got
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.840]   into like the YouTube thing, they didn't come from the same background. They just because serious
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.480]   journalists didn't go on YouTube very rarely. And there was a huge vacuum in the market and they
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.840]   just love tech. But then you see like, Oh, you have to pay taxes on products that were given to you
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.240]   that you didn't return. There's like all these things that people find out that just not it's not
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.680]   even part of the consciousness at first. I think though, there is also a certain
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:36.920]   disregard of how it might influence your your review. And I just think anybody FTC now Leo
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:45.240]   any FTC sort of tries to but I don't know how it really depends. I mean, if you the whole point
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.240]   is that you develop a reputation and people will people will figure it out whether whether
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:54.040]   you're a bozo or not. I did see I was looking for a certain I was looking for reviews of a certain
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:00.280]   thing that I was I was interested in buying and one one one quote influencer said, and this is
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.760]   from my friends at blah blah tech who sent me what they're hot new blah blah blah for these
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.480]   they can keep. And he actually and I'm not joking. You want up licking the side of it to say, Oh,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.120]   how amazing this thing was. And that okay, that person is a bozo. There are other people though
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.720]   that are like, more subtle bozos I worry about that guy's obvious. But there's plenty of influencers
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:26.200]   out there who are on the take on the make and do not use makes it hard. Like when when someone says
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.880]   this this review was sponsored by the company of the product you're reviewing. Well, that's a
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.280]   giveaway to me that's where it's supposed to do that. They're supposed to reveal it, but that's not
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.600]   always obvious. And I don't think the FTC has a particularly strong enforcement or you put it or
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.160]   you don't take a promotion like you do the review on a video that's not promoted by the company that's
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.720]   made the product and then you have a different company sponsored. My only advice kids is to
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.760]   consider the source and do the best you can finding multiple if you get multiple reviews and multiple
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:57.400]   reviewers agree on something. Just don't base it on one or two. That's a that's a mistake.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.880]   It's Neil Seibart. Bob Avalon says that Oprah finally is right.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:07.640]   If you wait by the river long enough, Oprah will finally be. Last year at the Apple TV plus
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.200]   announcement Oprah came on stage and said a billion phones and what did he say a billion pockets
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:19.080]   million phones in your pockets y'all. That wasn't actually yet true, but Neil says now a billion
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.440]   people have iPhones. Apple doesn't say but this is not on his model. And he's pretty good. I think
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:30.280]   he did a lot of calculations. Of course, remember, not every phone sold stays active. So you can't
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:36.120]   they've sold many more than a billion phones. The point is that there are he believes a billion
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:44.520]   phones in actual use right now, which is a stunning number. Yeah, absolutely. But again, we remember
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.000]   how Steve Jobs I think probably can only was saying if we get 2% of the market next year, we'll be very,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.720]   very happy. Yeah, it's it's not it's not just the it's not just the number that they've sold is
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.160]   the number of customers that they've kept and the number of new customers that they're getting. So
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:05.000]   exactly. Yeah, absolutely 100% props to Apple. Yeah. Yeah. We don't want to give short
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.160]   trip to the other product. We'll shipped a couple of weeks ago, a new iPad Air. Any of you have the
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:21.960]   new iPad Air? Yep. Yep. Sorry. It's inside the the magic keyboard because it also fits with the
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:27.240]   magic keyboard. So this is this is kind of a little bit like a probe, but not quite. It's got the square
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:35.720]   sides. It's got the USB C port. It's the only iPad with touch ID in the power button because
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:43.240]   there's no more home button. This is actually very. Does it work? It's not only does it work,
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:52.120]   it works really fast like it like it would on your on your phone with touch ID. The button, you
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:58.280]   know, I expected it to, you know, always kind of take a second because if you remember back when
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:04.360]   touch ID first came to iPhone, it was a little slow. You kind of held your finger down for about
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.320]   a half a second before it would trigger. And I've been really, really happy with the experience
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:17.160]   on the iPad Air. It, you barely lightly rest your finger. It catches it right away, opens up,
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:25.800]   unlocks right away. Going from iPad Pro to iPad Air, the only thing that's awkward is that I'm
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:33.320]   now used to my face unlocking the iPad. So it's, it's a little like physical movement that isn't as
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:39.320]   convenient as it used to be. But most people are not going to go from an iPad Pro to an iPad Air.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:45.000]   So that's not even going to be an issue for a default iPad like that when people ask me that
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.840]   iPad to say, Hey, look at 329, the base model is so affordable. There's no reason to buy an Android
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.440]   device. I like my iPad Pro, but it's as expensive as a laptop. This is kind of in the middle. Is this
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:03.880]   you think the one that most people will get? Laurie, I, what I really think is yes. And because
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:09.960]   what I really think Apple is going to do is turn the iPad Pro into a really pro machine with
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:16.040]   those sort of extra bumps, yeah, and extra sensors and extra features that most people don't need.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:22.360]   So the iPad Air, like previously, you either went with what you could afford or you bought an
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:29.080]   iPad Pro. You nobody bought an iPad Air. You know, it was kind of the affordable iPad Pro, right?
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:35.400]   This is kind of in that space. Exactly. Exactly. This is going to be the one that everybody's going
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:43.960]   to want. It's I can't even tell the difference day to day between this and my 2018 iPad Pro.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.360]   I can't tell it all. Like I could pick them both up. I mean, literally they're in the same case.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:53.080]   I could pick them both up and not know the difference between them day to day with regular use.
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.480]   Do you see any speed difference? It's definitely theoretically the iPad.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:04.200]   The air has the new a faster version of the A14, right? But do you see is it feel different?
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.920]   My I think the iPads are so fast.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.240]   For some reason. Oh, so I can't hear it.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.200]   Is it's faster for single threaded operations? So the UI, everything like that feels just super
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.720]   snappy. The areas where it's different is that the memory bandwidth isn't as big. It's got multiple
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:26.200]   cores. It's two extra CPU cores, four extra GPU cores, and it'll go to one terabyte.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.920]   It's also about six gigabytes of RAM. So just keeping apps in memory and the amount of memory
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:37.560]   those apps can access. But you're talking about real like you're using video editing,
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.200]   a ton of photographic editing, you know, petapixel images, that sort of thing is where you'll notice
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:48.040]   the difference. Yeah. Not really consumer. In the Verge, Deeter Bone says the $599
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.960]   iPad air is the best tablet for most people. And in gadget, Dayton woman says with so few
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.240]   differences between the iPad air and the pro, I've forced to reconsider who the air is for.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:05.800]   Interesting. It's just a little bit low on storage for the 599. Like it's only 64 gig.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.440]   Then it was. Yeah. And it's 64 gigs, which if you live that streaming life, if you're all about
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.680]   the Netflix and the Spotify and all that kind of stuff, and you keep everything in the cloud,
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.640]   that's fine. I know a lot of people who don't hit 64 gigs. But for me, I still like a lot of
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.520]   local stuff. So I would splurge on the update and unlike the iPhone, it's not 50 bucks more.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:29.960]   It's 100 bucks more for 128. So that to me, it costs it increases the cost of entry a little bit.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   Did it happen with this pricing muddy the waters a little bit? Because you start to nudge the iPad
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.800]   pro comparably equipped. The iPad pro goes to 12.9, which to me is like everything else aside,
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.800]   like all the chips that in memory and storage differences aside, you just you can't get a bigger
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:49.480]   iPad air. So then I think if at certain point, like especially if it's your laptop replacement,
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:54.040]   the 12.9 is just in a category. I am fond of the 12.9. I must say.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:59.320]   It's it's a tough. It's a tough call. I think I think you have a point that Apple's kind of blurred
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:06.680]   the lines between, I think, these two categories of devices, because having I still have and still
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:12.440]   use my 12.9 first generation iPad pro, there's something about the size of that screen as a
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:18.200]   handheld screen, multi touch, whether I'm reading comics, whether I'm trying to multi task anything
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:24.840]   of that nature. However, once once we're in the category of spending $1,000 and up,
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:30.920]   what is the best way to solve a certain problem with a solid fill a certain gap in your computing
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:36.120]   of arsenal with $1,000 plus? And once you start opening up, you're thinking that way,
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.640]   you start to bring in well, how about a machine that could not just run a special
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:49.000]   coming coming attractions version of mobile, mobile Photoshop, but can actually run the run the
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.760]   entire creative suite. Certainly not the same amount of horsepower that you'll get with the modern
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.240]   modern Apple Silicon, but still it might be a more practical solution for a lot of people.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.520]   This is why I do I do think the iPad air is a wonderful, wonderful step forward, because to me,
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:11.400]   it really is in the sweet spot of a value computer and also a valuable computer that takes advantage
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.680]   of being a being a tablet while not losing sight of having to be a productivity machine as well.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:22.120]   I think that when you walk into Apple store wanting an iPad, that really is the default choice.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.240]   And if someone says that if some if you're talking to the customer and you find out that
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:32.920]   they actually just want it for occasional use, you want to downgrade them into the $329 entry
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:39.560]   level iPad. And it's hard to have a I think so much longer conversation to talk someone up into the
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:45.560]   iPad pro at this point. You can only use a magic keyboard though with this new iPad air and the
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.360]   iPad pros. That's a pretty big selling point. Did you get the magic keyboard, Laurie?
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:57.560]   Yeah. In fact, you don't need a different magic keyboard either. It's the exact same one,
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:07.480]   right? It works with both. So it's the exact same case as the iPad pro from 2018 on. So any case
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:13.560]   that you have for your iPad pro also works with the iPad air, which by the way, again, nobody's
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.800]   going to go from an iPad pro to an iPad air. So that's not really a discussion to be having.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.360]   Unless for some strange reason you decide that you want to sell your iPad pro because you don't need
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.720]   it and you'll use the money that you save to buy your iPad.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:32.120]   But you shouldn't be seduced by the A14. Absolutely not. Yeah. I mean, it's great. And it works fast.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:38.280]   But for me, just like I said, I don't really see just the day to day use that I have for it.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.520]   I don't see a difference in performance. I don't see a difference in battery life in screen.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:51.480]   I mean, I know like the screen res. Yes, exactly. But for like someone like me on day to day usage,
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:57.160]   the way I use it, there isn't a difference. So there literally is. But just for like my personal
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:03.400]   views, I would say anybody who used to want an iPad air or an iPad pro because they didn't think
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:08.360]   the iPad air was quite good enough. That's really not the case right now. And I also think that the
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:16.120]   iPad pro is going to be a huge, huge upgrade very soon, probably March, not for sure. But I think
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.960]   that Apple is not just going to sit on an iPad pro that is, you know, with an iPad air that's
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.880]   almost as good. They're going to bump that up. It feels to me like they shouldn't have these
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:31.160]   in stagger step releases that should do all the iPads at once. Then you can make a logical choice.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.520]   Now, many LEDs not ready yet. Is that the reason the screens? Yeah, the new iPad pros are supposed
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.760]   to have the mini LEDs. And they're just not, they're not in production yet. So I think if they'd had
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.160]   their druthers, if 2020 had been a very different year, I think we would have seen everything released
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:49.720]   a very different schedule. But so many of the things just didn't time out right. And I think
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.400]   that's one of the big ones. I have to wonder if they're doing an AB comparison too between
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:21:01.640]   Face ID and Touch ID to see because they didn't touch ID on the new iPhones. They only put it on this
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.840]   air. See, that's a problem with their culture. It's like they prepare these devices so far ahead.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.720]   And that sacrifices a bit of agility in order for them to be able to do the level of integration.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.400]   They do across departments and they didn't foresee the pandemic. So they had this iPhone was ready
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.040]   and going into production last spring already. And the rumor is we're going to be getting under
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:27.000]   in display fingerprints next year. But that's they can't rush that a year forward. Where with
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.560]   the iPad Air, it's just, oh, we can save a hundred bucks off the bill of goods. We don't put a true
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.040]   depth camera system in there. We have this touch ID thing. So wouldn't it be great if we just put
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:41.640]   it. I actually prefer touch ID. I'd rather see that everywhere. But that's just me, maybe
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.240]   maybe. The only down point for me like where I notice it is that when it's sitting in the magic
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.040]   keyboard, like in my hands, it's fine because I registered both of my index fingers. So whether
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.080]   it's here in landscape or here in portrait, it's super easy. But when it's on the magic keyboard
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:22:00.200]   with Face ID, you press a key on that keyboard and it just opens because it's staring right at you.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.480]   Where with Touch ID, you've got to stop person. You got to go type press. I don't I'm not going
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:09.160]   to say like an animal. You have to reach up and do like a physical act again. Like it's, you know,
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:15.800]   2018 or it's a little bit of a trip up, which is funny with when I switched over to the
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:24.280]   iPhone SE from an iPhone 11 pro. So I was going from Face ID to Touch ID. That was seamless. It
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:30.200]   didn't even matter. It was fine. I wasn't distracted by the extra step having to use my thumb or
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:37.160]   anything like that. But for the iPad going for my pet, pro to iPad Air, that is a little like just
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:43.640]   a tiny little stutter of a oh, that's right. I got to reach out and do it. So a little tiny, tiny bit
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:50.520]   of a difference. Yeah. But one other thing to we're introducing to this equation is the magic
[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:56.280]   keyboard, which is amazing. It's the it's a quintessential Apple product and it really does
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:01.880]   make the iPad pro and the iPad Air into something that really can compete as a laptop, but it is a
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:09.480]   $300 or $350 item. So once you bump that up, now we're even if we're even if we're stuck with a
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.640]   consumer who is absolutely not going to buy anything that's not an Apple, they're going to be
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:20.520]   they're looking at they're looking at this potential $1,100 to $1,300 $1,400 charge on their on their
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.080]   Visa card. And now they're thinking, Well, why if I'm spending this much on something that I'm hoping
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.120]   will behave like a notebook, why am I not going to buy a MacBook instead? And spend just a tiny bit
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:36.120]   more or buy a MacBook, hopefully an improved version of the MacBook Air. So I do think there's a lot
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:41.480]   of confusion there. I think that I think that Apple would do well to really draw a line between
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:45.640]   here's stuff. Here's stuff that the iPad pro is capable of that the other iPads are not capable
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:53.320]   of and making make it more than a vague argument about why you would want to spend $1,200, $300
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:59.960]   $300 on this combination iPad, whatever, instead of getting a notebook, because they're not only
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.120]   competing with Windows notebooks, they're also competing with themselves here. And if just to
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:09.480]   make things easier for the person to walk into the Apple store with $1,000 to $1,500 to solve a
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   problem of mobile computing, I think they really I think that's one thing they haven't done yet.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:19.080]   I think it's also hardware engineering comes into play here because at a certain point,
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:23.560]   I think they decided that they're not going to manage the releases. And all I mean by that is
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:28.760]   when something's ready, they're going to ship it when they can. And they look at the pro versions
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.080]   as the halo products where the price points are high enough, they can try out new technologies
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.640]   because they can afford it within the cost structure of that product. So it gets face ID first and
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   it gets 120 Hertz first because that's expensive. But people who self identify as pros will pay it.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.360]   And then they push those technologies down as fast as they can. So as soon as the R&D is paid
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.280]   off and the assemblies are paid off, we get that technology pushed down into like the regular
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:58.200]   iPhone 12 or the right like the new iPad Air. And if the next wave of new technologies, things
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.840]   like mini LED isn't quite ready yet. They don't they don't they don't they don't feel like they
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.240]   should hold the iPad air back. And that goes into that Phil Schiller thing where all of these products
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.880]   have to fight for survival. And it's the job of the people who make the lower rung you know,
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:17.080]   quote unquote lower rung products to be as good as possible to push up against those higher rung
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.560]   products those higher rung products have to fight for their very lives and spot in the lineup.
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.880]   And it does create a lot of confusion, especially when the schedules don't line up. But I also
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.560]   think it's good in that I don't think anybody should ever have to wait for a better version of
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:34.760]   anything if it's if it's available. I do think that's a cleaner strategy with notebooks because
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:38.600]   there's a there's a real definition of what a pro would need where we're talking about
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.200]   software developers who can count in minutes how long it takes for them to build their
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:47.160]   next project of videographers and photographers who can count in seconds how long it takes to
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.920]   apply a certain filter. And that's how they define the difference between a pro and a MacBook Air.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:59.880]   However, it's hard to say the it's hard to define the pro user of an iPad beyond people who are
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:06.280]   using it as real real intensive content creators people are using it as an art tablet. And the few
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:12.440]   people I think very few people that are using it to collect both both generate content edit content
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.360]   and distribute content on the exact same device. I know that those are those people are out there,
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.800]   but it really isn't as distinct a category. So this is why I keep coming back to the idea that I
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.840]   wish that Apple would do their messaging a little bit better or even streamline the product line
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:33.960]   a little bit better just to make just to make sure they're getting every dollar of value out of
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.000]   the customer and the customer is getting every dollar of value out of the hardware.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.440]   It was one that was one of the things Steve Jobs did when he came back from next.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.560]   His state is cut out all of the extra you know there was too many skews and it made it a very
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:51.960]   for a long time is a very clear linear progression with Apple products on the you know on the price
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:56.280]   to two by two grid. Yeah. Now it's a little more complicated. It's going to get even more
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.760]   complicated. Somebody in the chat was pointing out when the new Apple Silicon max come out if
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:08.920]   they can run iOS apps equally as well that suddenly you're you're going to be choosing between an
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:14.440]   an iPad pro and a Mac book maybe you know that that's going to be an interesting
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:21.080]   conundrum. Now we really have blurred the lines. The thing is though that back when Apple was
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:27.800]   only offering you know two options or one option even everyone complained that Apple wasn't
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:33.000]   there weren't enough options and they were angry that well I want this and I want that and
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:40.280]   why didn't Apple give me this thing and now Apple is making multiple versions of the same device
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:45.800]   and now people are complaining that there's too much. Yeah too many options. So yeah like
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:52.440]   where's the you know who's going to get happy in this situation. No one. Let's take a break. We
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:58.680]   got a lot more to talk about but before we go on with Lori and Renee and Andy I want to tell you
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:03.800]   about your new iPhone case because I know when you see this you're going to want it. I'm a big peak
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:10.600]   design fanatic. Peak design is a really interesting company. They started back in 2011 with their
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:16.840]   first Kickstarter and they have built their product line by a Kickstarter. This is their 10th
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:23.400]   campaign on Kickstarter the mobile by Peak Design Campaign and I have participated in a
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.400]   great many of them. I think I first became aware of Peak Design when our friend Trey Radcliffe
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:33.320]   said oh I've helped them design the perfect photography bag and I bought that immediately.
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   I bought I think three Peak Design bags and then this their camera straps their last Kickstarter
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:46.600]   was the incredible travel tripod which I love but now they're getting into phone cases and it's
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:55.720]   really interesting actually if I go to Kickstarter I can show you because I did in fact plunk down
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:01.400]   for mobile by Peak Design. They've done pretty well so far they've raised $1.1 million out of their
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.600]   $100,000 goal. That's always the case with Peak Design and of course eventually you'll be able
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.600]   to buy it on Peak Design site but if you want to get in on this system and by the way this is going
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:16.680]   to work with a variety of phones including your iPhone 12 and it works with the MagSafe Connectors
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:24.120]   which makes it even more desirable. Peak Design they have the hearts of photographers the hearts
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:30.200]   of users and they have created this amazing ecosystem of cases, mounts and accessories that make your
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:35.880]   phone a better tool for everything you do from photo and video creation to bicycle and motorcycle
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.480]   riding to working in the home or office in their words you don't need more screen time you need
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:47.400]   better screen time it even works with the new 12 MagSafe. Now there's two different ways they
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.520]   have a proprietary magnetic mechanical locking system on the back of the cases they call SlimLink.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:59.560]   SlimLink uses and you can see it if you look at the pictures a precision machined piece of
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:06.200]   zirconia ceramic very hard and an array of magnets that provide an intuitive connection.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:13.160]   See there it is and it just goes it just snaps in but when you need like on a motorcycle or a bicycle
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:19.640]   a better more secure connection they have hard locking security as well. It has wireless charging
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:26.680]   compatibility in fact they have a wireless charger and because it's magnetic it just snaps into place.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:31.960]   It all starts with the new everyday phone case the perfect balance of slimness and protection
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.920]   and when paired with your mobile device it opens up this ecosystem of mounts and accessories a
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:43.400]   rugged and handsome wallet with built-in kickstand a machined aluminum tripod with a buttery smooth
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:49.480]   ball head. I'm going to be doing so much photography and video with the iPhone. I'm really excited about
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:55.000]   this. There's a charging and non-charging mounts for the dash of your car look at that and it just
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.920]   snaps in. You don't have to fuss around with it just and it's secure immediately. They have hard
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.760]   locking mounts for total security when you're biking or motorcycle riding they have a charging
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.800]   stand for your desk or your bedside table there's low profile wall mounts. I'm getting a couple of
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   those. I have one in the kitchen where so when I get in the kitchen I'm starting to cook I can't
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:19.000]   just put my iPod book right there and it's there on the wall and a variety of adapters that work
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.440]   with both GoPro and the ARCA style systems everything I every camera I get I get an ARCA style
[00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:29.320]   mount for it so it goes quickly onto my peak tripod I'm really thrilled that there'll be
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:35.080]   ARCA support for this as well. And of course you can count on peak designs family of accessories
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:41.560]   working seamlessly with all iPhone 12 models not just the iPhone 12 though. So it is the world's most
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:48.200]   crowd-funded active company out of San Francisco Peak Design. They're really great people who love
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:54.440]   their customers and use their customers feedback to design amazing products people really want to
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:32:00.600]   learn more about the mobile by Peak Design campaign and mine's coming in May so I'll be showing it
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:08.920]   off then and all the other amazing products they have go to peakdesign.com/twitpeak.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:16.040]   P-E-A-K design.com/twit. Twit is really great people who deserve our support they're doing great
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:22.120]   I might say but I'm glad to be part of this. Peakdesign.com/twit thank you Peak Design
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:28.920]   for all your great products over the years. Lisa and I you know it's I joke because when you get a new
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.400]   camera it comes with the steel me strap the strap that says the camera brand and tells people
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:39.720]   exactly how much that camera cost it affects and I immediately I never leave those on my cameras
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.680]   and I immediately put on a peak design the slide belt they have is so great you can wear it over
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:51.000]   your around your neck around your shoulder over as a sling it has the quick swoop up and take picture
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.240]   feature I just think it's the best thing ever. A big fan of a peak from very very
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:00.840]   when you said that I just pictured you going lovey take this hustle blood strap and pass me the
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:07.880]   night con. I'll put one of those on we'll be perfectly safe. I have it says Polaroid on it
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:15.320]   yeah that would be better. I have Canon 5D I have Sony a7 Sony A9 you don't you it's crazy to wear
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:21.640]   that strap in public. Yes it's just say steel me it's the same reason I tape over any Leica red
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:26.120]   dots on any camera bodies you don't want to you don't want to announce and that's the value of the
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:33.080]   camera. So let's see we talked about the you know we didn't talk about the iPhone there there's a
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:41.560]   tear down now and I fix it of the iPhone 12 and the 12 Pro it's a it's kind of interesting because
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:48.120]   apparently there's a lot of interchangeability in parts the displays are interchangeable
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:54.280]   of course they're very inspect but they are they can they're the same size they can be swapped in
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:34:02.520]   and out. The looks like the battery is the same. There's a lot of similarity in parts but you'd
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:09.080]   expect that right same to 2815 milliamp hour battery they're changing. There were
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:14.600]   the nerds who were all super interested in seeing there was a not a Qualcomm MM millimeter wave antenna
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:20.040]   that was just it was adorable watching. It wasn't Qualcomm what was it? No it's a Chinese manufacturer
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.200]   but I believe they worked with Apple Apple's been doing antennas since famously since the iPhone
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:30.200]   4. It is a Qualcomm chip right. It's a Qualcomm X55 modem yeah yeah the other thing that's adorable
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.000]   to me and we talked about this a bit last week is that any problem with 5G now anything that Android
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.120]   users have been living through for a year things like no 5G on dual sim is suddenly like why is
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:45.080]   iPhone not doing 5G on dual sim like X55 modem everything that applies to it. They're all the same
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:50.520]   modem now applies to it. How long before Apple Silicon replaces all Qualcomm and Intel parts?
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:58.920]   Three years four years. It's gonna be that long. It's a non-subtle problem. It's like designing a
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:03.640]   self-driving car getting it to work most of the time is very very easy getting to work all the time
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:08.760]   is damn near impossible. And Qualcomm has a lot of experience in that not to mention all the patents
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.200]   so you're gonna be paying them one way or the other anyway. Well they have a license like ARM and it
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:17.880]   took them from the A4 which was a Cortex license design to really the A6 and A7. The A6 was more
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:23.640]   of a custom design. The A7 was their first I think full-on custom 64-bit CPU so it was a three-year
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:28.040]   runway with ARM and I'd expect it to be the same thing. Same thing yeah yeah yeah I always like the
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:33.960]   tear downs and the good news is in these tear downs they didn't didn't have a lot of glued in
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:39.320]   stuff to pry out. It looked like a you could use a screwdriver. That was actually that was the thing
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:44.520]   that I found most interesting. I think they give it a six out of ten overall for repairability.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:53.240]   Almost all the time any Apple product gets like like the worst score. Or zero yeah yeah so I
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:59.320]   couldn't believe Apple made these things more repairable. A little harder to take apart the
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:05.640]   charging puck but I would expect that right there's the coil. There's obviously.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.520]   Yeah I was thinking the exact same thing that what kind of engineering decision what kind of
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.920]   engineering changes were made in which that right before they're about to finalize things they
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.560]   realize oh crap that means this is going to be much easier to take apart. Do we have to make this
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.280]   engineering change if it will make it easier to take apart. It also actually made me think that
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.400]   is repairability something that they factor in for their own uses so that we need to we need to
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.880]   make sure that every store has the ability to do these four very very simple swaps these four
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:42.440]   very very simple in-house repairs we have to design it so that there is a very very close to 100%
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:49.160]   chance that it'll be a successful repair even if it was even perhaps it being done while you wait.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:52.920]   And that's another part of that that's another story that we will never ever ever get to get to
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.400]   the bottom of but I'm sure I'm sure it's part of the of the stew that they're cooking up every
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:02.920]   time they make an engineering change to this this machine. They say. They suppose eventually Andy.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:09.080]   The iFixit guys I'm surprised they only gave it a six but they say does displaying battery
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:14.680]   replacements remain a priority in the new iPhone design most other important components are modular
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:21.320]   and easy to access our replace they say liberal use of screws is preferable to glue but
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.360]   you'll have to keep them all organized and bring out your special drivers
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.640]   pentalobe tri-point and standoff in addition to the standard Phillips of course in some ways
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.680]   that's just a come on to say oh and buy our magnetic mat that lets you organize the screws in our
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:41.800]   special multi-tips screwdriver kit both of which I have I might add increased waterproofing measures
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:47.320]   complicate some repairs you'd expect that but make difficult water damage repairs less likely
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:53.320]   and the only real negative the glass on the front and the back doubles the likelihood of drop damage
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.400]   come on man don't drop it and if the glass you could wirelessly charge your
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:02.360]   metal if the glass breaks you'll be removing every component and replacing the entire chassis
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.520]   but that's always been that's been the case for at least a few iPhone models that back glass
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:11.560]   is integral to the whole chassis and I saw loot fight to bend it that was hilarious to me like I
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:16.040]   didn't know what to make at that video because unbox therapy hasn't bent an iPhone since he
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:21.080]   infamously bent an iPhone and put up that video yesterday and I was watching it and he put on these
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:27.240]   gloves you know real high production value and then it looked like he almost tore out of his skeleton
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:32.200]   Simpson style trying to bend them and he's like nope I'm not even in it can't even bet they were
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:39.720]   like solid tiny blocks could not could not be wearing those gloves so that I don't know what he
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:45.080]   doesn't get glass damage he said yeah he should wear safety glasses that's a lot more
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.640]   yeah no I remember watching watching a friend of mine had a sample of one of the rear glass
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.120]   panels on an early ryphone and bending it as just as I'm shouting don't do it don't do it it
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:02.120]   shattered a million pieces he's on with gutless fears yeah I'm always very very scared when I see
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:06.600]   these people trying to make these funny or you know illustrative videos it's like it's a very very
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:13.000]   easy to buy a face shield and it's a lot harder to buy a new eyeball especially in 2020 well and
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.120]   if these aren't bendable you could probably thank Lou for that right yeah I mean that's
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:23.320]   an answer to it there's there's there may have been strengthening it for 3d touch
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:29.960]   six months before he bent his first life okay so not it does not bend thank you very much it's
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.800]   a square frame so from an engineering standpoint it's kind of it's probably gonna be a lot stronger
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:40.040]   than a current frame yeah so good point however the glass will break and love and gadget bought a
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:47.160]   bunch of them and dropped them this is always such an fun thing to watch happen
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:53.160]   that's not time Warner money anymore where's that money coming yeah no kidding um CNET did the
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:40:02.280]   same but I have to say when I looked at the uh in gadget um uh picture of what was it four six I
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:11.080]   thought I just I just it made my butt hurt it was like don't doh yeah these are these are becoming
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.920]   less and less useful as time goes by all they're proving is that breakable things are in fact
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:20.120]   breakable until they come until until they decide to come up with a standardized rig and these things
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:26.680]   exist so they can have some sort of demonstrability that here is how long this this device lasted in
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:32.440]   this machine before the case broke versus how long a competitive product or last year's product
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:37.800]   the product before if you're just going to simply keep dropping it until until you then like look
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:43.320]   at the video to see how it fell and how it broke it's it's not always just a case of you you dropped
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:48.440]   it exactly the wrong way it's also a case for people in the field that you dropped it and you
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.600]   thought you got away with it but actually there are microfractors in it that made it more vulnerable
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:58.840]   to a subsequent drop so all you have to all we really need to talk about is is it does it seem
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:04.280]   to be durable enough to for for daily carry and scratch proofness and more importantly what happens
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:09.800]   when you inevitably do or excuse me I shouldn't speak for everybody but when when your back panel
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   or your front panel breaks how are you going to be buying a brand new phone or are you going to be
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.960]   out you know the cost of a couple of large pizzas I should actually correct myself it doesn't look
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:22.520]   like it was in gadget spent the money was all state which and as an insurance company they can
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.920]   afford to buy a dozen iPhones and drop them andy and i just every year we drop them from low
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:32.600]   earth orbit to see which one which one's burned faster as well this video is just painful so the
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:38.760]   real issue is does this ceramic glass look there's even have a special drop thinger
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:46.200]   does he and of course you're going to scuff those those stainless steel or aluminum edges you're
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.640]   also by the way you're also going to scuff or scratch the screen this is not four times better
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:56.840]   protection against scuffs and scratches for those people on the internets and twitter's who say
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:02.520]   yeah i still scratched my screen what's wrong with this ceramic shield it's it's drop protection
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:08.760]   it's cracks not scratches okay all state did say it's the most durable iPhone they've ever tested
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:14.360]   and that the so the ceramic shield does do something but just remember it's not indestructible
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:20.360]   yes okay in fact i'm more impressed with case manufacturers who are able to
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:28.200]   show off how how durable their cases are when you drop an iPhone from you know 60 or 80 feet they
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.880]   always do that at CES they'll be some kind of drop testing and they were they'll drop these
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:41.160]   huge heavy metal weights on these phones right on their screen faces and it's it's so amazing
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:46.600]   to like wow that case actually did a really good job protecting that phone that was impressive
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:53.080]   we have back in the old studio when we could get up on the roof we did drop some cases in
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:59.480]   some iPhones in the i think there were gorilla i can't remember which ones we used
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:05.480]   but we used some strong cases and we did drop them off the roof and i think they all survived
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.680]   every video is either iPhone versus man iPhone versus nature or iPhone versus itself Leo that's
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:16.760]   just the three yeah i have to say that this phones have been very very good about drop
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.480]   persistence for a long long time i'm i'm right now i'm thinking back to one of my standard test
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:26.680]   photos is always like a boston public library with those marble floors and i remember it must
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:32.280]   be 10 years ago like one of the second or third generation android phones dropping it right
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:39.160]   from from from i height on its corner onto this marble floor and it dented the corner a little bit
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.080]   but the phone was perfectly fine so it's not as though these companies aren't thinking about these
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:47.400]   thing of course it was it was this wasn't the days of plastic cases so well they're all uh they're all
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.080]   they're all going around the world and in football helmet so
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:59.800]   i phone uh apple does say that the lidar on these new phones and on on the new pros and on the
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:05.000]   ipad pro can be used to measure people's height even when they're sitting down
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:13.400]   i'm actually one of my co-workers measured measured his kid and uh it it seemed to work yeah
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:20.040]   wow yeah wow so they're going to do augmented reality we just define like the you define like
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:24.920]   the the the corner of the wall you're going to make the virtual like marks and every time you
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.640]   upgrade to an ike phone 14 i take a picture it will add another mark to that wall with
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:35.400]   two anytime you aim the camera at that corner i i also have very sad music that's gone this this
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:41.800]   kind of implies that it might be used by uh police uh and other uh law enforcement too to
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:46.360]   measure no we're not actually not oh really oh good but then nowadays they're asking i
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.360]   witnesses well how tall was the suspect and now you can say well according to my apple idar
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.480]   the measurements were exactly 5.37 two inches oh it's the person is that type of person who wrote
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:59.240]   down the license plate of every car on the street every night yeah now taking lidar checks for
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:04.440]   everyone who walks their dog yeah i know your height i guess you're right and i wouldn't worry
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:08.760]   police as they keep saying they're very very good at discovering people who match the general
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:12.680]   description yes so they're really they're really they're eye-calling technique is really on point
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:18.040]   don't worry about it and i love this article i need all arrest them in india today the iphone
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:24.440]   12 pro is so expensive in india you can fly to do by to buy it come back and still save money
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:31.560]   gentleman indian tariffs wow that's i believe they're going to be manufacturing more things
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:35.400]   there so that should radically change so that you think that's tariffs that are doing that not
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:41.160]   apple's exchange exchange no it yeah india wants it anyone's everything sold in india to be made
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.560]   back from india where possible so which is which is a reasonable for for a country with that kind
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:51.240]   of capability that's a reasonable play for the to make canada try they just said no we said fine
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:46:00.280]   sorry please don't have them sorry sorry we have soft wood anyway what's some soft wood uh i
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:10.760]   phone 12 pro costs 119,900 rupees so there i just thought you ought to know that not buying one
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:20.280]   yeah not buying one there okay all right now let's talk about next months because there's going to be
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:26.280]   an apple event we think now it's not that obviously it's not going to be election day so it's not
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.320]   going to be the third i would expect it to be the tenth but the but john prosser says it's going to
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:35.720]   be the 17th and that's what you have to send out invitations on the third if it's going to be the
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:41.960]   10th leo and no one wants no one wants an election day so yeah just stay at just stay well away from
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:47.240]   that it's not going to be election day this year it's going to be election week this year or maybe
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.480]   of election month so just stay away from that and the following week is thanksgiving and apple apple
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.600]   incorporated takes usually takes the week off for thanksgiving so the 17th but doing the
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:03.800]   event only possible choice and will i be able to get my silicon mac at some point
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   almost definitely almost yeah what will that be according to steven warwick writing in your
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:20.040]   august publication there will be a silicon apple silicon iMac in the first half of 2021 this is from
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:28.360]   china times there was some question whether they might launch an iMac this year so maybe this would
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:36.920]   lend credence to the idea it'll be a laptop i look forward to a new iMac with apple silicon i my
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:45.560]   wonderful hardy iMac that i've had for many many many many years is definitely starting to show
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:51.480]   its age at this point and i am just teetering on the edge of oh no i'm going to have to replace
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.720]   this before the apple silicon iMac comes out of this doesn't help it's a place when it's coming
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.520]   where you want i know of it on the machine that you're going to replace yep i know i know i know
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:06.120]   it's a big thing more than i said think of it is like the blues mobile that's trying to get you to
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:11.480]   to the assessor's office and dealie plaza it's not going to fall apart until its job is done so just
[00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:19.080]   hang with it it'll jump i i i actually my iMac pro which is fine and will be and i don't imagine
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:25.000]   even replacing that for apple silicon next year but it is definitely dying for big sir because it's
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.600]   i just it's i've had three years how long do we have to wait for big sir that's the question because i
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:36.040]   want to do a clean install i really i'm prepared i moved everything on all you know my home folders
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:41.080]   and an external drive i've done all the checks in fact i did a whole series on hands on macadash
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:47.720]   a five-part series on the road to big sir because we're going to be ready when it comes out but when
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:54.040]   you want to take their time because like katalina was a painful yeah just like there's so many
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.280]   architectural changes they're making to get all this stuff ready i want them to be sitting there
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:03.080]   polishing it until even like the engineering product managers are like okay okay you can see
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.680]   your reflection in it it's time to ship well the logical time to do it is when the
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:13.720]   actually the logical time to do it is when the new max come out but that might be like december
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:19.320]   31st right they'll probably announce it won't they do like you'll be out in 24 hours just so that
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:24.680]   every developer has just really screw it up you're gonna screw with people on Thanksgiving
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:33.000]   yeah so that upload Thanksgiving Eve it seems likely that okay so we'll have an event on the
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.520]   17th but we're not gonna that clearly they're not gonna
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:42.920]   order friday for delivery the day after Thanksgiving that's not gonna happen yeah so it will go we'll
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.720]   go into we'll go into december don't tempt them leo please don't tempt them black friday the
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:52.840]   livers up black friday the mailman could tell you that's me don't know that's a week that's a week
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.840]   that's a week that's a week that's a week that's a week that's a week that's a week that's a week
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:50:00.200]   so i think i could say go over today available end of week i mean they've done that before but my
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:05.240]   guess is that they're going to want a little bit of runway uh with these so i'm thinking december
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:12.120]   and i'm thinking there's really no urgency they have to release big sir with the new max because
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:17.800]   that's requirement so i'm thinking big sir might be december as well but that's a different version
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.840]   they could always say like this is the release candidate it's available today the apple silicon
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:27.000]   version will be available with the new max because no one no one can install that on existing
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.680]   back anywhere uh gallifrey rebel in the charams telling me that drobo is telling people they're
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:39.480]   not ready for big sir if you're using a drobo do not upgrade i'm using a drobo mini uh so i may be
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:47.080]   have to oh would i have to wait why would they not be ready isn't it just a udish one drive what i
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:53.320]   mean i don't understand why drobo has software but you don't have to use the software do you use the
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:51:00.760]   software yeah well then there you go i don't think it's a criminal extension five months the big shift
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:06.840]   on big sir from software point of view we already did the 32 to 64 the big shift is kernel extensions
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:12.920]   this time right that's why i'm getting the warning all the time on katalina you're running a legacy
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:18.840]   kernel extension it's not going to be compatible right but i don't i don't think they're removing i
[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:23.400]   think they're just they're making your life increasingly hard and then at some point it has
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:27.400]   sure it's now a separate install and you have to jump through hoops
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:35.480]   um yeah it's the drobo dorat dashboard that's not compatible is are you a dash border
[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:43.720]   uh when big sir launches you this is from drobo when big sir launches you'll be prompted to update
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:48.200]   the dashboard follow the prompts to update check the dashboard version blah blah blah
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:53.000]   the latest dashboard and firmware versions have a backup of your data
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:00.600]   experts agree having three copies of your data is optimal i wouldn't say it's optimal it's minimum
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:06.200]   yeah there's still there's still using a standard raid that is automatically supported by the
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:10.840]   OS are they no they but it's in the firmware they're using their own rate but it's not the operating
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:15.080]   system it's uh so it's a usb drive so i don't think it's gonna i think
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:20.040]   and just disconnect the drobo upgrade and then you'll still be able to see the
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:23.880]   drobo but maybe you won't have all the features the drobo dashboard offers which is minimal
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:28.840]   this is just the reason why you don't have automatic updates turned on for any mac
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:33.800]   it's just it's it's it's sad to say that i will accept automatic upgrades on my windows
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:38.520]   machine but not on my mac but they're there they're there they're considerable advantages to my
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:43.320]   mac as well but yeah there there's there are times when you definitely want to hold off for about a
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.960]   month make sure that any mission critical apps that you use you go to the websites of those of
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:52.520]   those sites to look for any news articles that are saying hold off on updating to x until we
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:58.280]   solve this problem or hold on hold off uh just uh just interminably because there is a critical
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.960]   problem that we don't know how to solve yet because we've been through that with a couple of different
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.600]   releases over the past couple of years uh and there's a lot of people that i know that are
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:11.160]   that are updating ios the day day and day to release they're updating their apple tv and they're
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:15.800]   watch day and day to release but they're still running a version of mac os is two years old because
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.640]   it's still running just fine for them and it hasn't broken anything and they don't want to go through
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.400]   whatever uh hoops is going to take to make sure that they can still get their work for
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:31.160]   accomplished my also the fragmentation between the app store on mac and not the app store on mac
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:35.080]   too so there's lots of developers out there that are developing app from apps for mac that
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:40.920]   never really have to interact with apple in any way so they're you know not necessarily
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:44.280]   either getting the right information to make sure that they can
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:52.600]   can be compatible with the new software or uh you know maybe they're just developing for a
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:57.560]   bunch of different things in apple macs it's kind of in the background and but if they're in the
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.560]   app store you know apple is constantly like sending out those messages get your stuff ready get
[00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:06.360]   your stuff ready get your stuff ready so i'm sure that kind of separation between the mac app store
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:11.160]   and not the mac app store i don't i don't want to call it side loading because that's not really
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:17.080]   what you're doing but side loading for guess freedom freedom loading yeah there you go freedom
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:27.400]   loading there you go according to john prosser the base god the 85.5 accurate base god uh he's
[00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:33.880]   getting better yeah he was down below eight-eared yeah yeah all final performance testing for air
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:43.080]   tags b three eight niner will be 100 completed november sixth after this testing products typically
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:50.520]   ship within 30 days sure looks like we're getting air tags for sure at the november event putting
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:56.440]   it all on the line is 85.5 percent all on the line with an easily testable hypothesis
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:01.640]   what do you think you said previously that makes a lot of sense
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:08.280]   Renee i was going to say like yeah because i try to look at it from apple's point of view
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:14.920]   and they're programming these mini events very interestingly like the first one was apple watch
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:22.360]   and ipad and then it was iphone and home pod mini and now it's going to be apple silicon and
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:26.840]   and they don't have to relate because the ipad and the ipad watch have nothing to do with each
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:31.560]   other but it means that there's a broader audience for that particular event which is really interesting
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:37.560]   and it sounded like air pod air pod studio was going to be the apple silicon and but then now both
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:42.280]   mark ermine and john prosser is saying that those have been delayed because of various sizing and
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:49.640]   customization options until a march event and air tags were just ready but you know apple was like
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:52.520]   eh do we launch some in the middle of covid where you're only going to lose your keys in your
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.480]   kitchen or do we wait until it's back in the world but if there's no other end available
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:01.240]   and they want another end because if you're not interested in the mac if you're an iphone user
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:05.160]   you could care less about the mac who's gonna like they still want you to watch the event i think
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:09.960]   it makes a lot of sense to do that sort of apple silicon mac but also hey there's a new iphone
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:15.240]   dude hickey that i want to watch as well as karsten points out he has apparently a very good memory
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:20.280]   uh it was only two or three weeks ago the prosser said the air tags would be delayed until mark
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:29.400]   yeah yeah i know that was that was such a confusing message it was not that long ago that the original
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:35.720]   story was air tags not until next year and then just out of nowhere oh by the way um i'm changing
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:42.040]   what i said so how does that make you accurate if you're just constantly changing what you said
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:47.480]   it's it's it's i have a lot of sympathy for anybody who wants to be in that segment of the
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:52.360]   news business because there there is a there is an audience for people who say i know i know you
[00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:56.920]   you'll never know for sure until apple confirms something but what do you have any information
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:01.160]   that suggests there is some sort of a timeline then they are delivering a sort of value and they
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:05.080]   they have to put the they have to stick their necks way the hell out every time they make a guess
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.960]   and the number times i i stopped doing any of that years ago because the number of times where
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:14.600]   i had something that was just a deadlock and or excuse me at the at the time that i had the
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:19.080]   information it was a deadlock and then everything changed two days later and i realized that if i
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:24.200]   had if i had written that column i would be looking very foolish right now would i not so it's it's
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:29.800]   to the to the degree that rumors are of any value whatsoever i will not blame if if someone is good
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:35.000]   if someone is going to claim that this is the this is their business then that's a really really
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.720]   really tough market to be in their their ballsy they agree that they both german and
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:44.040]   cross-road agree that the studios have been delayed but prosser thinks air tags are going to take
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:49.320]   their place and mark doesn't think air tags are a good fit for the apple silicon event so that's where
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:55.800]   i'm a rumor our rumor people this isn't just leaks this is also guesses this is informed guesses
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:01.560]   okay i think the the prosser's recent um tweet that you're talking about it has a little bit of
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:07.720]   credence to it because it's less guesswork and more i've got this this insider information about
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:14.600]   yeah yeah so to me that kind of that gives it more credence and and that's for me when i'm looking
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:20.120]   at different leakers who are providing all this kind of information there's those little things
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:25.320]   that help you kind of decide okay i think this one has more credence because of the information
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.760]   involved in it and i think prossers got that going with this particular tweet so
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:34.520]   i am more like if i was gonna make a bet i would i would bet on prosser i wouldn't bet a lot
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:40.120]   because you never know things change especially during 2020 well he's an 85.5 percent lock so you
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:45.640]   could those german though he's 80 so it's team it's hashtag team jern versus hashtag team i like
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:52.280]   i like this product and theory i think that's really interesting uh that makes a lot of sense and
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:57.720]   it has always bored out they never just say one thing even on the iphone announcement they had the
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:06.520]   the candle so thank you the Yankee candle the whole fog handle so uh a grooper wrote something good
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:11.160]   about this too i forget what he said but it was sort of like programming episodic television yeah
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:17.560]   to the through 2020 yeah yeah at this point apple probably can do that right they know what's ready
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:22.120]   they they know exactly what's going on they have the post they have the cards up on the
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:26.760]   board on the yeah court uh court law for like no we're gonna move this one to here and then this
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.600]   one fits in it's like using scrivener it's like Andy or i would use scrivener they're using yeah
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:36.360]   very very interesting i just wonder if there's a point in which they decide that this is all
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:40.920]   they're they're they're volunteering for a lot of stress that is not necessary just like at some
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:46.920]   point they realize that we are volunteering to give ourselves a hard deadline of january
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:51.000]   uh for the big mackerel keynote to make sure we have a major announcement ready or major
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.720]   major product release and that's totally artificial and totally unnecessary and we could actually
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:00.120]   put a lot more effort into things that actually make us let us make more products if we simply
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.560]   let ourselves make our announcements on our own schedule i wonder how long it's going to take
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:09.400]   before they do they put that kind of a thinking towards look we can air tags we can actually
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:14.120]   just make our own little video event we have all the stuff all the resources we need we can get
[01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:18.920]   we have so such better access to the specific individuals we want to talk to
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:23.400]   right now better better than we've ever had before why are we knocking ourselves out to make sure
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:29.160]   that we release things things in groups that we ask ourselves what context is the best context
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:34.200]   on under which to release air tags because it seems to us the only thing that the only thing
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:38.280]   the only limitation they're under right now is that it would be wonderful if they had a really
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:43.160]   cool apple design product that costs not a whole lot of money available in time for holiday buying
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.880]   and if they miss that window they can do it whenever they want
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:56.760]   so i guess the takeaways from this are you can't always be sure with any rumor because apple yeah
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:03.400]   can at any point change their mind or decide the time's not right there is a likelihood that if they
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:11.400]   do something November 17th it won't just be apple silicon they want to do apple silicon and i like
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:19.000]   that and then finally when you see a very detailed tip it's more likely to be
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.600]   generated by a leak than when you see a more general tip which is more likely just an
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:32.360]   educated guess have i i have now encapsulated all the learnings from the three tip readers
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.040]   it's always been this way like just now we have more access to information but there has always
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:40.680]   been products that moved that went from different times that had features dropped that the feature
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.640]   ended up in the second version of product because in the first it's just now we report on like
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:49.720]   project titan in a way we never reported on project purple right so the whole world is
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:53.960]   yeah well we're you know we're all looking at apple through a glass darkly we're kind of trying
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:59.000]   to figure out what's going on inside that box and we get little bits of information and we try to
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.480]   assemble it into some sensible thing because we got nothing better to do i guess i don't know
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.760]   it's and it's and it's fun you know we have the jobs we have because of that so
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.200]   listening to us leo i want to do some radio here
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:16.920]   gotta have something to say in between events uh there a lot of us a lot of us can pull things
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:20.200]   out of our butts very few of us can pull them put it out of our butts and then monetize it
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:29.160]   monetizing things pulled out of my butts since 1998 yes thank you very much
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.520]   apple has inexplicably removed apple card from payment options
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:41.240]   amazon has never taken apple pay but the apple card is a master card so i guess you could put it
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:46.680]   i don't use it from my amazon but there are people who are saying oh i was using it and now it's
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:53.400]   uh disappeared from the payment list so um i think i can i can add a little bit more to this
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:03:00.680]   particular bit of information um amazon did have a make a statement saying um we we have we've
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:06.360]   discovered this glitch and we're fixing it so it's a bug it's a bug not a feature yeah okay yeah so
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:11.560]   it's not like apple didn't remove it amazon didn't remove it it was a bug that they you know it was
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.960]   discovered and they were fixing it you can see how we would leap to conclusions that oh my god the
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:21.240]   apple amazon rivalries on again exactly yeah it's not it's not necessarily when the holiday
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:25.560]   spending is on the line leo yeah let's get it we'll need their points they need their cash back
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:32.520]   well so prime day's over but we do have black friday coming in a couple of weeks which is a good
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:39.800]   two weeks or it's not a month long event now yeah oh lord cyber monday remember which is a real thing
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:46.840]   that real that was a real thing with it was not a result of marketing people just like mother's day
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:52.440]   broadband connection you can shop fast it's just like mother's day uh all right let's take a break
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.360]   and we're gonna come back and we have the apple tv section i was so angry last night i'm watching
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.280]   monday night football and they played da da da da da it's a great pumpkin charlie brown
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:10.520]   and and i'm thinking oh it's that time of year can't wait to watch it and exclusively apple tv
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:16.120]   plus and even lisa's sitting there going that's a bad move apple you just in the football game
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:21.480]   did someone pull the football out at the last minute yeah really you just punked all these people
[01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:26.120]   who are looking forward to watching charlie brown a holiday tradition every year
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:31.320]   and no you won't be you won't you're gonna have to pay for apple tv plus to watch it
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.400]   i think that might have been a bad move on apple's part she said there's got to be other content
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:40.840]   they could have bought bad bad look bad look it's a bad look we talked about last week but yeah i
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:45.960]   saw that ad yesterday it's still it still stings and as as we speak i got i got a notification saying
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:50.520]   that my blue ray copy of it's a great pumpkin charlie brown is waiting for me in my mailbox
[01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:55.800]   so i did get it in time so it'll be ripped in my library and i'll take a nice picture of
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.400]   dream it don't you stream it or not color we'll come out for you well that's actually interesting i've
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:06.920]   seen people say even if i bought something uh on itunes it streams it instead of like it's it's
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:12.360]   always playing it from the streaming service that it's on instead of the which is i haven't seen
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:17.880]   that but it's so it doesn't let you download it onto your onto your mac or your phone or something
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:23.480]   like if it's available on netflix as a stream and i bought it it will play it on netflix that seems
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:29.000]   like a bug maybe in the apple tv plus apple i haven't noticed that and by the way we don't we get
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:34.120]   anybody got apple tv free because they bought something in the last year from apple that qualified
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:38.680]   is going to get it through january so you'll be able to see charlie there's also so it's it's
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:47.800]   also going to be free to watch for anybody and everybody through the tv app on um like a couple
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.680]   of days before and a couple days after so i can't remember specifically yes i have the details so
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:57.560]   this is lisa said you know if they were smart they'd make it available for free and then all these
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.360]   people would install the app and try it and that would be well they are smart there it'll be free
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:10.120]   to watch october 30th october 31st and november 1st for non-subscribers day before halloween halloween
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:16.280]   and the day after halloween see that's good marketing well it's it's good it's good go ahead i'm sorry
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:23.880]   go ahead it's still in my opinion you know i'm trying to be cool about this but not everybody has
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:30.440]   an apple product it's unfair to all those people who don't have an apple product that's the thing
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:37.800]   that gets me and yeah i know you can even use the apple the apple tv app on some smart devices and
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:44.520]   things like that but come on this is like this is for everyone and you've just restricted it to
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:51.080]   people who have access to apple things andy brought this up last week and it really i've
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:56.280]   it's been weighing on me too because i didn't hear that they took it exclusively for themselves
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:02.040]   until last week and then i thought even though they're they're making it free in on in the tv app
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:06.840]   there's still people who are not going to be able to access this and watch it it was just on
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:11.240]   television for the longest time and yeah like i don't know there's generations of kids who aren't
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:17.160]   going to get to experience that because mom and dad don't know how to or don't have a way to just
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:24.680]   turn it on you know i don't know it's sad free free is free and any sort of a gatekeeper is is not
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:29.240]   free i was trying to figure out if if you can stream it through tv.apple.com
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:34.040]   but that's that's one way to do it but i'm also trying i also don't couldn't figure out
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:40.600]   if you'll be required to have an apple id in order to in order to stream anything even if it's free
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.200]   so even that would be kind of pigish of them to say well we need to have your contact information
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:49.160]   so we know who's streaming those before we let you have it free i get again let's not so let's not
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:55.400]   you know it's it's nice of them to recognize that it would be a somewhat evil thing for them to
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:00.280]   deprive us not only of the thanksgiving of the of the halloween special but the thanksgiving
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:05.480]   special and if you if you take away you know i i know christmas is about charlie brown lights
[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:11.160]   please then then suddenly i want to sell some of my apple stuff and so all three of those specials
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:16.280]   for as lori said through a like a one-day window before and after you'll be able to stream it but
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:21.720]   yeah it's it's what what i really what really sticks in my nose is that uh not only that but now
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.520]   you can't even buy it on the itunes store you can't buy it on the emazon digital store you can't buy
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:32.040]   it on the google play store so even if you do have this the only solution is to buy the dvd buy the
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:39.000]   blue ray and it's it's just not a good look that's where it makes no sense to me like you think that
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.200]   if apple wanted it they would still have it on itunes right there must be some weird arcane
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:50.120]   licensing nonsense going on here which never benefits anybody except very so i just went to the
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:58.600]   peanuts holiday anniversary collection blue ray and says it's not currently unavailable did Andy
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   buy the last hot copy it might it might just be out of stock they people buy them i i went to buy
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:10.120]   mine like ten days ago and i found lots of copies available from lots of different outlets and so

[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:29.400]   you know here's the you understand why this is a great thing you have to understand how a

[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:50.200]   sofia copola movie that was pretty good i enjoyed that it's nice to see bill bill marie on the
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.040]   screen again that's an opportunity i've been uh holding off on seeing that i'm glad to hear that
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:59.560]   it got a good review and i'm uh waiting for the weekend to watch that one so i you know um
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:05.400]   lisa and i both said it's not a great movie but bill marie is so good it doesn't matter
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.960]   it's so true it lags a little bit uh until he shows up and then whoo
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:18.840]   bills in town it's really it's a it's a great bill marie movie sofia copola obviously has a
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:23.560]   great relationship with bill marie i feel like it may be a little bit about her relationship with
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.360]   her father uh frances for copola because it's really about a young woman's relationship with her dad
[01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:34.280]   and he was kind of a scallywag and uh it's good i think you're i think you're gonna answer some good
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:39.080]   moments and funny moments um they just landed a documentary about one of my favorite bands and
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:45.960]   i'm guessing yours too lori given a sick burn you probably love the velvet underground right lu
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:51.880]   oh yeah lurie's original band uh absolutely they're gonna they're gonna do a tat hanes who does great
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:17:00.440]   movies is doing a a documentary on the velvet underground lurie john kale was an amazing band
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:07.880]   um so that will be fun and that really was a that was quite a time and i think that it's more than
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:13.240]   just that band it was really the the period with andy warhol in new york city and it should be very
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:19.640]   interesting scarlet joe hanson is becoming the apple tv segment but they need it right because
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.200]   if they're gonna keep people subscribing after it runs out at the end of january they better have
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:31.400]   some something for us to watch uh scarlet joe hanson will produce and star in a movie uh for apple
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:36.440]   this is not one they're buying as they did with grayhound after its production called bried
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:43.880]   oh it's a marvel is it a marvel no it's just another marvel cast member showing up oh
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.960]   it seems to be doing a lot of p- movies with people who are in marvel movies oh yeah you're right
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:54.680]   because a 24 is is a great film production company they've put out a bunch of my favorite horror
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.480]   films so i love to see their name attached to it so the plot it's a good production
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:05.720]   company for sure the plot follows a woman created to be an ideal wife the singular obsession of a
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:10.600]   brilliant entrepreneur when of course it's got to be scarlet joe hanson right when she rejects her
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:16.440]   creator she's forced to flee her confined existence confronting a world that sees her as a monster
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.760]   it is on the run she finds her true identity her surprising power and the strength to remake
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   herself is her own creation sounds like an updated bryde of frankenstein maybe she's the
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.520]   entrepreneur but it actually kind of sounds well yeah it does sound like bryde of frank
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:32.200]   so but it also kind of reminds me of is it ex machina which she was also in which is about
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.680]   oh i love ex- machina i love ex- machina i love ex- machina i love ex- machina i know i
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:39.960]   has to escape from her she's not an ex machina is that was that not her uh course on the machine
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:44.040]   no i guess you're right it's not her you know yeah but so it's in the machine i recently bought the
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:48.680]   roof uh i'd watch the ex machina i recently it's alex garland who i think is a very interesting
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:53.880]   director and i uh recently bought it on four cakes i wanted to watch it again uh and it really looks
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:59.480]   good yeah that's a very interesting movie yeah it does sound like that bond which is sad i would have
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:06.760]   would have loved six so so the bond movie a time no time to kill uh which was supposed to be out in
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:10.600]   theaters ran about now in fact it was going to be the tent pole release it was going to save
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:16.760]   movie theaters in america they have abandoned movie theaters they're all going on a business now
[01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:23.480]   thanks to james bond uh they're they were gonna say they said we're gonna come out next year at this
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:29.160]   time now they're shopping it around get ready aren't they because apparently they they did like
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:32.680]   they said they're not they're not gonna shop it like i don't understand because it was all like
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:37.640]   oh mr bond we expect you to die yeah and then and then they was competing bids and then they said
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:44.200]   oh it's not for sale six hundred million dollars was the rumored price tag yeah uh even apple with
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:48.360]   their deep pockets for one movie they're not going to get that kind of subscription and they had
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.600]   cayenne with the music so you're kind of wondering oh was the music part of the negotiation like
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:59.640]   what's happening here is that a tease i don't know so blame m g m the producers of this of course
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:05.560]   um and according to mark german again in blunberg apple and netflix discussed acquiring the bond
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:14.200]   movie for streaming with m g m the film m g m said has been postponed to laper 2021 in
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:21.080]   order to preserve the theatrical experience but they did say it's not for sale however that may be
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:28.440]   because they couldn't get their price right yeah probably that's a lot of money what that would do
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:35.320]   is effectively guarantee them you know a successful box office the movie cost about it's estimated 250
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:42.440]   million dollars to produce yeah but to give you some comparison i just happen to see some box office
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.880]   figures just the other day as in the number the number one movie with on 2000 screens
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:51.960]   earn something like uh is on track to earn 40 million dollars domestically total
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   so what most you know like now in the covid era yeah meaning meaning worldwide what used to be
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.440]   considered a very good opening weekend is now like i think they're making something again a
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:07.480]   two thousand i don't know where they found two thousand screens in the united states that are
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:13.640]   open but they are they're making something like 1.5 million 2 million 3 million uh on an opening
[01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:20.600]   week and that's just um that's like 19 that's like godfather part two numbers like 1970 not
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:26.760]   like 1972 box office numbers dead deadline says and deadlines usually pretty good on this stuff
[01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:34.360]   uh that neither apple netflix or amazon would even offer half the 600 million dollar one-year
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:43.480]   license fee so producer barber broccoli uh flatly nixed the deal because in a healthy theater market
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:49.720]   they'd be expected to get a billion dollars uh and so it would be quite a big mark down for them
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:54.440]   so think think about how much firepower you'd be giving up if you invest in 600 million dollars in
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:58.920]   one movie as opposed to all the other movies and series you could buy yeah of that kind of money
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:04.280]   that's just not obvious and uh i mean it's a big gamble and it's just not worth it but it's also
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:09.640]   a gamble for mgm let's not forget because will there be a healthy movie market anytime right soon
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:15.720]   will it be like they've stacked up movies now right like they've got the eternals and black widow
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:21.240]   and shanxi just wrapped production and all of these franchises are pumped have these movies that are
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:26.680]   that were completed or are about to be completed thoris filming uh you know there's just there
[01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:33.480]   where are they all going to go yeah yeah i almost think disney is in a good position to make
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.680]   make some good profits off of that sort of thing kind of like the way they did with mulan is by just
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:43.800]   like making it a premium movie that you can stream through disney plus how much they made
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:48.120]   though they charged 30 bucks for mulan was it successful was a lot of controversy that was
[01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:54.280]   the numbers came to into it yeah yeah well it's part and but part of it is that they have to they
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:59.480]   have a schedule that if they don't if it picks or doesn't release soul this year they have a
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:04.840]   schedule for 2021 what do they do with the 2020 release they bump that until until next year or
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:09.400]   the or the end of the year season so i i have no idea what the what kind of dynamics the people
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:13.720]   are trying to solve here but as you say part of one another one of the one another one of these
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.360]   variables in the equation is what is going even when there are enough people vaccinated that people
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:22.200]   are going to feel very very comfortable going back into movie theaters even when you can schedule
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.160]   something knowing that the trend the trend is so going down consistently that you know that there's
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:32.040]   not going to be another another bump up that makes state governor say okay guess what we're closing
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:37.240]   down movie theaters again how do you make those kind of predictions and you've got these properties
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:41.080]   that are costing you hundreds of millions of dollars that are just you know they're just fermenting
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:45.400]   in your warehouse so mulan like picks are the other ones get older the actors are getting older and
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.720]   if they're on three picture deals like every year you post ball and that's an older oh Thor is 97
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:55.000]   years old now what are we going to do yeah disney did reveal that mulan and its opening weekend on
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:05.240]   disney plus made 35 and a half million so far they say box office is 66.8 million globally um
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:12.120]   disney plus did gain 68 percent in subscribers that weekend so there may be additional ways to
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:19.480]   make money uh and remember there's no distribution fees because disney owns disney plus so that's
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:28.440]   pure profit but still it's hard to say you know it needs to make more than 90 million to cover
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:34.280]   its budget so it's hard to say that's a success well you know when the power goes out of your ice
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.760]   cream parlor you just got to sell the ice cream if you just if you wait for the do you though can't
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:46.440]   you keep that i mean wouldn't mulan do or any movie do you just as well in 2023 it depends do you want
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:50.440]   do you want your movie to compete with another movie that you spent twice as much money on
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:55.800]   and where do you release it i'm not pretending that i know what the answers are but it's a it's
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:02.840]   just such a very complicated calculus that and what do you what do you do in the meantime so you
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.560]   know i hear what you're saying like put the ice cream in a different freezer and wait till 2023
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:12.680]   but then you're not doing anything at all between now in 2023 well you're not making movies either
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:17.400]   right so you're not it's not like there's a bunch of they are telling tv shows though like they had
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.480]   an act like disney's doing marvel tv shows they have wanda vision they just announced oscar
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:26.120]   isek for moon night and that that could be at least a way for some companies like maybe they have to
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:31.480]   investigate bond the tv show it's going to be on Netflix at this point just to to keep their
[01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:36.760]   their production companies going until the movies are back i really wonder if even after
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.400]   we conquer somehow some magical way because it's not clear how that's going to happen
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:47.000]   covid if people will go back to zeland says hilio yeah zeland's figured it out but they're a tiny
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:52.120]   little island nation i mean come on let's south of korea i mean the places that have solved it
[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:57.320]   admittedly they got hobbits and orcs there they're don't mess around with usually oh breaking
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:26:03.160]   uselessy oh breaking news uh john steward is coming back to tv with apple oh see that's a big
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:08.520]   big acquisition but i bet you it's not a daily show i bet you because he's been lately been doing
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:13.800]   movies and with me and you current affairs series for apple hollywood reporter that's smart they
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:19.160]   must offer him a lot of money because i think he was happily i miss him so much i do too that's a
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:23.320]   smart move from apple's point of view that's what apple should be doing not taking charlie brown
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.720]   off the broadcast but giving right not taking but give don't take
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:34.680]   i just feel like people are going to gear up they're going to get better tv's better sound systems
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:39.880]   and they're going to discover the pleasures of watching at home to such a degree that i think
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:44.520]   uh it may not be this and in meantime theaters are going belly up
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:52.680]   yeah it may not be there may not be a uh robust theater economy when we vanquish covid at home
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:56.040]   it's only lori kicking the back of your chair and throwing popcorn at you it's not a dozen people
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.800]   yeah lori could kick it back in my chair anytime i have two words for you
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:08.200]   drive-ins yeah no one wants to go to a drive it oh i just went to the drive-in last week yeah but
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:14.200]   it was wonderful really was it wonderful sitting in your car okay well we actually got out we brought
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:20.920]   some some camping chairs and we got out and sat in right in front of the car and just like turned
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:26.840]   up the stereo and it was actually really pleasant to just be just to be anywhere out in the open air
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:33.400]   and watching a movie so you know but unfortunately drive-ins are went the way the dinosaur and there
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:38.520]   are very very few of them are in the cut in the united states so that's that's also the problem
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:43.880]   with that right yeah john Stewart here we go from the chatroom scooter x found the story the still
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:49.880]   untitled show which will feature hour-long single subject episodes that there you go that's it he's
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:55.320]   more interesting documentaries will be executive produced by steward through his company bus by
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:01.720]   productions in his role as ep he'll be joined by his longtime manager james dixon and former hbo
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:07.480]   chief richard pepler uh a showrunner for the forthcoming series for which apple is expected
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:13.480]   offer a companion podcast has yet to be named will steward be hosting it doesn't even say hosting he
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:19.800]   might just be producing uh and as an interesting companion podcast that's going to be the phrase
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:24.200]   you're going to hear over and over again that's that's kind of the thing people do now
[01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:27.880]   so sick of that get out of movies get out of line line
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:35.160]   konarobraia now has three podcasts i think oh lord i can't compete how can you compete with konar
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.120]   you can't
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:44.040]   as a part of the expansive multi-year deal multi-year deal with apple the me drenched
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:51.480]   you get the m e drenched former writer producer and host of the daily show is set
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:57.320]   to front and all new current affairs series for the streaming service the show which will run for
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:04.440]   multiple seasons put steward back in the anchors chair as he explores a host of topics at the
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:09.320]   centers of both the national conversation and his own advocacy work okay you can see how they got
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:14.360]   jolly to do that yeah lacy rose hollywood reporter thank you
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.920]   emmy drenched
[01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:23.880]   can you be emmy drenched if you have one emmy but is he emmy quenched now that he's been drenched
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.240]   i am i am emmy dinged
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:36.920]   facebook has launched its cloud games on desktop and android but
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:44.680]   guess where you can't play facebook games i o s facebook says it's due to apple's arbitrary
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:50.360]   policies oh like their new oculus facebook logins where you can't have two people using
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:54.760]   advice at the same time you have to have a facebook account and if you don't also post
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:59.320]   to facebook they'll say your account is really and delete it and all the all your purposes so
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:06.280]   annoying that sort of that oh i hate you i just hate you uh michor's gonna do the same thing
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:09.960]   did you see this with with minecraft you're gonna have to have a minecraft a microsoft account
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:14.600]   that log into minecraft oh yeah i don't uh i don't just so like you have to have a google account to
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:19.640]   use like and an i cloud account but none of them feel is as manipulative as having a facebook account
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:24.280]   especially like if i don't use my google account for anything it doesn't stop me using android if
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:29.240]   i never use my i cloud account for anything doesn't stop me using ios but they're canceling people
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:34.120]   left and right who paid money for games and things on their platform and it's just like they're so
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:38.760]   real i'm not even going to get into how they're handling their news feed because today it's another
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:45.080]   it's another toxic waste dump of of bad reports on how they're behaving but just how they run
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:49.080]   oculus means that they should shut up and not say a word about any other platform until they fix
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:56.280]   their own house i'm super angry about this because they haven't used it i'm emmy dipped
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:31:06.360]   emmy surrounded is probably the closest i'm not emmy surrounded i only want it's uh
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:14.760]   let's say joined him so paul cathases is uh the guy at rogue amoeba apparently is it quite a fitness
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:22.520]   fanatic he has pea bones on instagram and apparently he has hit his move goal in his apple watch
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:30.600]   2,000 times and wow i wouldn't expect this from apple since siri won't ever say any bad words
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:37.880]   but i got to trust paul he says when he hit his two thousandth daily move goal
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:44.200]   how many years is two thousand that's like five five and a half years so almost what makes
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:48.680]   us doubly impressive is that it means that even during the first year of the apple watch
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:54.040]   one was kind of crap he still put it on every single day that is dedication sir
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:32:01.240]   and apparently we're no bugs the watch is so surprised paul says i'm not sure the apple watch
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:08.120]   is prepared for anyone to do this it says i can't say it on the show holy s word you've reached your
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:15.160]   daily move goal for the two thousandth time holy shirt in the good place holy shirt i can't believe
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.920]   apple probably really seriously nobody even looked to see what the coder put in there
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:25.640]   it's so beautiful because you imagine that you imagine that like whoever's
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:29.880]   whoever's job it is to like proofread all the stuff they went all the way up to like 500
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:34.440]   maybe a thousand and then they never even considered like when they got the oh well of course
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:37.800]   two thousand three thousand whatever and they're able they're free to do whatever they want and
[01:32:37.800 --> 01:32:42.840]   they said no no one will ever see this no one or by or by the time i think more practically
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:48.520]   by the time anybody does this we will have put out a patch like it'll be like five years later
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:53.000]   we'll do a new version the o s and we'll change this or i'll cash out my stocks and be long gone
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:00.040]   suckers yeah i was i i thought i asked i mean i know paul so i i joke with him that hey
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:05.960]   good job good job is packing the binary so that every day counts for 30 days and while you're
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:11.160]   hacking it that way mains ball hack that hack that the the dialogue box but no he said no no
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:15.400]   absolutely correct this is this absolutely what happened wow i was like linch got a phone
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:19.800]   called didn't he as soon as this went on wow i'm still more impressed that paul
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:25.080]   has i know that's that's incredible worked out i mean it was in a bug like i would have thought
[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:29.720]   that at some point walked to us would have screwed him out of a decade yeah exactly because they're
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:35.880]   right yeah and there's always been these little problems where switching from one
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:42.600]   watch to another or you know saving your data as a backup there there was all these problems early
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:48.840]   on where your health data or your step data or your activity data would just get deleted and erased
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:54.040]   he managed to serve every single day's worth of no one's ever we're gonna make sure no one ever
[01:33:54.040 --> 01:34:00.680]   reaches john john says it's because he's moonlighting as a mailman i would do it i bet mailmen and
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:06.280]   mailwomen mail carriers get their move goals every single day you can also say your move goal to be
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:13.960]   ten steps right right yeah but yeah it's not as impressive that he met his move goal as it is
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:21.640]   that he managed to preserve the daily move that's the thing that's impressive i didn't even think
[01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:28.600]   about that but for me it's impressive that every single day he put that watch on i don't know anybody
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:32.680]   who i'm not saying i'm not talking about lack of dedication i'm saying that you still like would
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:37.480]   have met your move goal but you have you have a dress watch that you wear at family weddings or
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:43.080]   or you forgot to plug it in charge at one day so you left the house without it one morning
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:50.200]   that's incredible and for all the like it's an unexpected see holy spit as like the the activity
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:56.600]   reaction they still produced a very very professional looking two thousand badge that looks like
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:01.720]   something from like art the art nouveau age so so so they still commissioned somebody to produce
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:06.120]   this beautiful badge i guess they just didn't check anybody's and he's buddy's asky screens
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:10.440]   what i'm wondering though is where's the two thousand stand in the two thousand workout
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:17.720]   badge paul where's the other two rings and what do those say would it be so sad if you just like
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:24.920]   forgot to watch where you're watch one day yeah in the spring of the day you were at the beach
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:33.160]   you were having fun i have i have talked to people who have had similar experiences where they were
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:40.760]   years into their activity rings and somehow just forgot to put their watch on her some
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:47.880]   some small thing like that one of my co-workers she exercises every day and she meets all three of
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:52.840]   her rings and there was one night where it was a little bit later in the evening and she didn't
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:58.040]   notice that she didn't meet her step goal and it was years of meeting her goals and then just one
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:02.680]   night she just forgot to to do those you know walk around the block or whatever and she lost that
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:09.880]   one ring and people are so dedicated to those rings it's amazing and and and you'll certify
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:15.800]   that there's no way paul photoshopped this or fake this this is the real deal i did question him
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:21.640]   about it he says this is the real deal and paul is follows the person who who he's the head of uh
[01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:27.240]   roger meba producer of some of the most wonderful apps i've never been made for for the mac and for
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:32.840]   the watch and for all these other platforms so i will but i'm willing to stick my neck out and
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:37.720]   believe that he is absolutely telling the truth and take the risk that he's also there be no point
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:43.560]   doing this and faking it then it's not then it's no big deal yeah it's much also also he's he's
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:49.800]   also like he's also in a race with adam angst to be the most improbably and in offensively fit uh
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:56.120]   mac gee mackey mackey in the business so i really swallow i mean he's like no no no no even worse he's
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:02.680]   got that like that wiry sorry i could i could run 50 i could run 50 50 miles every single day and

[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:33.080]   rabekka who've been making halide for a while now and it's just it's a photographer's app not just
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:39.080]   a photo app but a photographer's app for the iphone and they introduced it now with the iphone 12s
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:44.200]   especially in mind because of all the new things that you can do just the 10-bit that you're ingesting
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:49.960]   there but it gives you full manual control it lets you shoot apple's version of the photo their
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.760]   version of the photo sort of a hybrid version of the photo just a raw photo that you can do anything
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:01.400]   you want with and it's it's impeccably designed sabastian was a former apple designer and you can
[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:07.640]   blame him for stitched leather as much as you absolutely want to but he has far than far far from
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:12.360]   far more than redeemed himself with halide over the last few years so if you're looking for something
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:16.040]   i love the fact that the apple camera app just lets you take the phone out
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:21.160]   you know put it where you want it press a button and you get a a good photo maybe even a great photo
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:27.960]   almost every time but if you are itching for sort of really crunchy controls and all the sort of
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:35.400]   capabilities from controlling the depth effect the depth the api to the histograms all those little
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:40.280]   things all the tools that a photographer wants it's just i cannot say how delightful it is like
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:43.880]   it's got a grid on it and when you've got the grid centered you get a little
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:49.320]   taptic feedback that it's locked on to something and it's it's crunchy and all the best senses of
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:55.560]   the word and because the iphone 12 specifically looks it goes back it harkens back to that
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:03.080]   that likea and bra and design era of apple and sabastian is a huge huge like a lake uh i can't
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:09.000]   pronounce anything today aficionado it just feels like the pixels are such a good fit for the atoms
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.440]   so i can't if you like if you adore photography at all like i cannot recommend it enough it's a
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:20.040]   free upgrade if you bought halide one but i decided they have a subscription model now that's not
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:25.080]   required but it's available one buck a month which seems very fair i want to keep them doing the
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:29.480]   development and if you're an existing customer it's ten dollars a year i immediately sign up for
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:36.040]   that because i want to keep sabastian and company producing this stuff it's just so good there's an
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:44.680]   apple watch app it supports series shortcuts because apple pro it's apple's pro raw isn't out yet
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:50.280]   you'll be able to take advantage of features like that now and then when apple pro raw comes out
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:55.720]   you'll be able to do that too i just think it's a yeah i agree with you it's now front and center
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:01.320]   on the front on the front of my eye yeah and i can't wait to survive with the 12 pro max i'm very
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:10.040]   excited oh yeah yeah uh andy and i co pick of the week actually also a classic app for at least for
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:17.720]   me it has a major update reader is now reed er is now on version five this is a news reader for the
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:24.680]   mac and for ios the mac version is ten bucks the ios version is five bucks and i know that news readers
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:29.880]   and rss readers used to be a much bigger thing like ten years ago and i almost never hear of rss
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:35.320]   and and and news feeds but they're still very much a thing because they're baked into the systems of
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:42.680]   of wordpress and every most other uh most other uh websites and web apps and if you are in a business
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:48.040]   like i am where you have to you have to maintain awareness on lots of different topics on lots of
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:52.920]   different news sources it really is the only efficient way to start your day and having a really good
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:58.680]   overview of everything that you're trying to keep up keep up keep tabs on uh there are their web-based
[01:41:58.680 --> 01:42:04.600]   news readers i don't think they're nearly as efficient they're not as nearly as as nice to use as a
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:10.600]   very very nicely tuned uh mac os interface app like this is uh they've added a couple of simple
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:16.200]   features they've added a widget for the uh for the iphone so now you can have news on your on your
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:22.280]   home screen but they've also now added i cloud syncing uh between devices so you can start off
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:27.000]   by dragging your mac book into bed with you making sure that the world hasn't ended
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.400]   showering shaving going out getting on the train then using your ipad your iphone to continue
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:37.240]   where you're left off and then continue when you get to the office on your on your regular mac
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:42.040]   it's just like i said it's it's a very very difficult problem to solve but a very very easy
[01:42:42.040 --> 01:42:47.960]   thing to keep on top of if you have an app like reader it's kind of interesting because rss died
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:55.800]   a while ago but rss readers especially in the mac world uh net newswire is back readers still
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:03.480]   around um i use you know reader there's uh i mean there's a punch of really good rss readers i'm
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:08.760]   gonna have to try uh reader because um it does look like it's it's pretty sweet and i do like you
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:15.160]   andy i have to i've i've kind of beat checks i have to make so five dollars for reader on um on the
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:20.200]   iphone how much is an iphone and i've had uh ten bucks so they're both available for the app stores
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.160]   okay sounds like it'd be well and they sync now so that that's that makes it worth it to get both
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.120]   of that for sure yeah yeah because i don't want to have to keep exporting opml and importing it and
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:37.960]   all that stuff um yeah there's a it's funny how after google killed uh google reader it's it didn't
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:44.360]   kill rss quite did it uh but still that that's that's got to be one of the saddest headstones
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:50.440]   the entire google graveyard yeah oh and there are a lot of them all right well and he got me five
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:59.720]   dollars down the tubes uh what do you got lory what what can i buy from you so i just watched this
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:08.440]   the other night and i just found it to be joyous it's a new version of raw dolls the witches i
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:13.160]   grew up watching this movie and there was an old movie i didn't read the book yet yeah um but i
[01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:18.200]   watched the movie in the 90s and just loved it i loved it and they asked to this new one
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:28.760]   it's so good it's directed by robert zemeckis it's got an Hathaway in it and um Octavia Spencer
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:36.600]   stanley tuchee yeah it's so good it's so much fun it's actually even at parts almost a little too
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:43.160]   scary for kids like they've managed to really bring out the scariness of these witches in this one so
[01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:50.920]   it it really is good it's a great great great movie for halloween if you have kids absolutely
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:56.280]   it's a great movie but frankly if you if you were a kid or a teenager in the 90s you're gonna like
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:45:00.920]   that too just because it's gonna remind you of that if you read that book as a kid it's really
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:07.560]   well done it's it's a wonderful movie so and it's on hbo max exclusively so if you don't have hbo max

[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:29.800]   too you know i've got my like place in my heart for that for the earlier one and so i was a little
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:34.520]   like this one's not going to be any good but turns out it's it's well well done absolutely
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:41.320]   also have filters for facebook instagram and snapchat to spot a witch so that looks like a

[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:55.480]   halloween i think it sounds wonderful thank you very much when they richy do they celebrate halloween
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:49:01.320]   in canadia they do but we we tried to cancel thanksgiving because of covid and people did it anyway
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:06.040]   and we had another outbreak so now they're not sure what they're gonna do about halloween
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:12.840]   but we we seem to be failing this universal iq test real hard well you're not alone
[01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:18.440]   you're not alone here in the united states it's the worst it's ever been um it's just uh it's so
[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:22.120]   depressing it's so sad our gymnasiums and martial arts and health studios have said they're gonna
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.280]   open up despite the law saying they can't just because they're tired of being closed i'm like
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:30.600]   and then the other people are like we deserve a break from covid we deserve one like one weekend
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:34.440]   we don't have to worry about like it doesn't work that way but covid doesn't take a vacation kids
[01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:40.360]   they're like in the world during world war they take a pause and everyone celebrates for a day
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:45.080]   we can do that no no it doesn't but i understand i'm really sympathetic i think everybody around
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:50.440]   the world has gotten has gotten to the point like we're up to here with the quarantining uh i don't
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:54.680]   care we're going out except in the places that didn't responsibly begin with and have now gone
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:50:00.440]   back to a normal way yeah well there you have i'm not angry we we thought you guys did it right
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:05.880]   no not kabek kabek we have a populist nationalist government that you know wants to appease their
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:10.120]   base did the rest of canada do okay i thought i heard it was the maritimes are great the maritimes
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:15.560]   are fantastic toronto has been up and down toronto had a populist leader but he was so scared by
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:21.080]   kronova he got scared science which is a just a remarkable miraculous thing and bcs had their ups
[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:25.560]   and downs so miracle but the maritimes have done great yeah sorry and i didn't mean to cut you off
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:30.360]   go ahead no no it's just i was gonna say i wish that i want to hang a big sign outside my window that
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:35.080]   says being sick and tired of all this of all these of all these covid preparations is not
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:39.640]   does not produce antibodies to covid yeah it is not enough that you're bored it's not enough that
[01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:43.960]   you're sick and tired not enough that you want to get your hair done by professional we're we're
[01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:50.120]   stuck with this for a while i'm sympathetic but i'm also old and fat so i don't get to uh
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:53.960]   participate in any of these we actually we i don't know what we're gonna do for thanksgiving lisa
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:51:00.040]   wants to invite her parents and her sister over and their families and i think don't risk it well
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:03.720]   we're not doing an inside we're gonna i think we're gonna buy some tables and
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:12.600]   do a pilgrim style uh i don't know i might i might just sit and watch in my mask we did it we did
[01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:17.720]   it over um zoom we did a zoom thanksgiving where my sister and all of my mom who's across town and
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:24.120]   me we just hooked up uh now i can't face another zoom call which is funny because that's all i do
[01:51:24.120 --> 01:51:30.360]   in my job all day long i said pass the salt i'm in road island
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:36.760]   thank you rene you'll find his work at youtube.com/reneyrichi who caused freelancers for i'm more in
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:41.640]   many other places but uh it's all there and the twitter is at reneyrichi reneyrichi andi and
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:50.120]   not go laurie gill have a great halloween uh i will see you next on us election day and uh
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:55.160]   and andi and laurie i might be crying in my soup that day no we won't know anything yet but i do
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:52:01.640]   if you want to take the day off and vote please be my guess i'm already i already voted i'm doing
[01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:07.480]   really voting tomorrow yeah yeah so yeah we're all gonna be here i might start drinking at one p.m.
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:11.640]   though holosable we're gonna send you another ballot and you can vote up there i think you'd
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:16.280]   probably like to i i can but we don't we can't even elect our own prime minister so i just be voting
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:21.560]   for my local writing that's right you don't vote for prime minister you vote for his party
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:27.880]   yep and then whoever is head of the party yeah as bad as our system is that sounds worse
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:33.240]   no but the best thing about it is that we have a vote of no confidence so anytime a major piece
[01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:38.040]   of legislation doesn't pass yeah it can force an election to make sure everybody at least passes
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:43.480]   things yeah and then there's that pro-rogging thing which i'll never understand oh but you have
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:46.920]   a philip i mean leo we could go back and forth all day about the charming eccentricities of former
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:53.800]   american colonial yeah let's just yeah can we start over have a modern system all right everybody
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:59.000]   thank you so much for joining us we do mac break weekly every tuesday 11 a.m pacific that's 2 p.m.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.760]   eastern now i have to tell you uh we are going to the rest of the world i think has gone off
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:09.480]   summertime are you still on summertime or nay or no no i think we go off this weekend i think
[01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:14.680]   yeah so do we like you must have followed our lead because we have an agreement on one trail in
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:18.600]   tronos that if if new york stops doing it will stop doing it too but nobody's moved yeah
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:26.520]   oh please let's stop the stop the insanity so it turns out in uh in under in the bush era in the
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:34.360]   i think 2004 2005 we moved the date even later in the year but it has no to do with farmers
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:42.040]   or saving energy it was the candy lobby who said could you please end daylight saving time
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:49.160]   after halloween so we get one extra hour to enjoy the treats i don't even understand how that works
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:54.920]   but the candy lobby apparently weighs heavy on the halls of congress and they're drenched
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:54:02.920]   they're drenched in the snickers bars i guess but uh we uh we now do it uh on november first so we will
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:07.720]   the reason i bring this up is if you're in the states or you're anywhere where you're changing
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:12.360]   the time zone this weekend then that's not going to affect you but if you've already changed times
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:18.840]   you probably noticed we didn't now we will that's why utc which never moves is actually moving so
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:28.440]   we're 11 a.m pacific that's 2 p.m eastern time and it's now 1700 utc okay so you can do the calculations
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:35.160]   uh because i can't it's it hurts my brain if you want to watch us do it live that's that's what
