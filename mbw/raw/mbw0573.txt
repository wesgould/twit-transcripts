[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.760]   in video toaster mr. Alex Lindsay
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.280]   the pixe of core
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.480]   I never actually used a video toaster I tried I tried but i wasn't allowed i didn't we found that i didn't know enough about
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.320]   computer graphics back then so they forced him to use this funky old program called Photoshop and the rest is history
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.120]   Yep, the guy the video toaster expert. He's uh, he's uh, he's on the street
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.960]   But you you have a video tester was taken away in her place with an opal vision and i'm still sad about it opal vision
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.360]   Opal vision was the australian video toaster
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.480]   Interesting
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.280]   Oi
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.400]   It shows how hard it is to pick a winner winners and losers, isn't it? You just don't know you just don't know
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.320]   Like if you talk the entire nypd with windows phone. I mean you just don't know
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.760]   Well, it's uh not official
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.320]   It would be i thought that story too
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.400]   So I missed it. What was the reference to say it again? They were replacing all they just
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.560]   Nypd went with windows phone for their mobile solution and now they're replacing them all with iphones
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.640]   Oh my god
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.840]   Are and did not have the extended life that they were hoping for
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.360]   They uh when they announced this when de Blasio announced they were going all gonna give you 36,000 officers windows phones
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.400]   They said would you know technology revolution that the way it's changing the way police officers work
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.120]   They'll have excel on their
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:06.120]   Oh lord, that is so depressing millions of dollars down the tubes. I bet you microsoft said, you know all sorts of things make custom apps for you
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.160]   And now by the way, they're getting iPhones
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.800]   Yeah, the head of it would just put out a big stirring defense of her argument saying well
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.520]   We needed windows compatibility and they had the best security
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.360]   Which I actually don't think was true
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.240]   But I think they were about as good as the other guys but uh and that there was it was well under cost
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.760]   But people are still pointing out that well if you have to replace them all it's not really under cost
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.640]   Yeah, they're getting 36,000 iPhones is uh, there's something there's some cost there
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.400]   But will they get an eight that's the question will they wait and get well?
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.560]   They won't have to wait long two weeks from today according to the wall street journal
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.840]   Have the invites gone out? No, Andy. No, no in a week in a week though
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.880]   Go it's too early apple won't give us this much notice Andy might be walking already
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.120]   Well, it's really like a week ahead of time, right?
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.360]   Yeah, so uh, we got to get you a subscription on the wall street journal air cars and I can see you're getting cut off
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.800]   This was a very nervous story from the like you're reading this so cnbc had the same story
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.720]   But they just said september 12th and the wall street journal added this color to it saying that it was going to be at the steve jobs theater
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.520]   Yes, but the steve jobs theater may not be finished in time so they might change the date and or location
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.400]   Yeah, that was right at the bottom of the article. However
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.920]   However, should the uh jobs theater not be done? Uh, they could do it somewhere else
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.600]   Um
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.320]   Yeah, I'm this is town hall leo like really 500 of us just standing nose to nose and town hall
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.800]   Well, that's part of the problem is I don't know if you can book
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.400]   The bill graham auditorium on such short notice. Maybe they I mean tuesday's are not a busy day
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.440]   I don't know as far as I remember is that they could they didn't need as much time for
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.920]   For some of the other venues they were required by union rules or something to get extra days before and they they didn't want to leave the
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.880]   Venues open for as long as apple wanted to just work on them
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.600]   They thought it was bad for their image if they weren't seen as busy all all years so apple came to agreement with bill graham
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.680]   But that's still like I said a lot of headway here is the latest drone
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.400]   footage
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.360]   With the steve jobs theater prominently featured. Let's see. Are they done? Are they ready?
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.120]   Can you see the iphone in it?
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.680]   Can you see the iphone but all the solar panels are in and we know we know staffs moving in right
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.440]   Look at that. They've kind of got there's the lobby. Let me get rid of this
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.720]   Picker here. There's the lobby and they've got you know the little trees in there and stuff and
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.800]   And lights and candies and things but there's still equipment and look at that. Wait, wait, wait, wait
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.480]   I'm gonna go back a little bit here. See the grass the grass is kind of in
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.200]   They have a lawn
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.080]   Look at that. Is that synthetic or lawn?
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.240]   Well as we were saying you could roll out turf pretty quickly that you know when you take
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.080]   It would take it would take the long week to put turf out. I mean it wouldn't be much to do it
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.160]   That's the way you do it. You don't want to see things anymore
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.000]   No, yeah, just by the turf. Let me jump ahead to the uh
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.720]   Less johnny is laying it by hand, you know cutting it by eye bespoke bespoke lawns
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.840]   Although that that is kind of an interesting data point like like Alex says
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.960]   You put you put down the lawn at the last thing you do if we're expecting people in or when you're expecting to show it off
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.120]   Because you don't know that you know that the lawn will be beautiful and green and perfect for a week
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.240]   You don't know what it's going to look like in a couple of weeks until it roots in and takes so that I don't know
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.120]   Maybe that's an indication that they're planning for a lot of important people to be seeing that in person
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.400]   Not not through a drone camera. I feel like this could be done. This is
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.040]   This is uh late august
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.360]   If it was at all close that's late august
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   I it doesn't
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.360]   the guy's sweeping
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.600]   They got a guys they got people sweeping that usually means the major construction is done
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   They can see there's a guy mopping and the guy's sweeping
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.080]   I know all the press want to be there, you know, like that's where everyone wants to go
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.160]   I've actually uh I contacted people at apple said how do what do I need to do?
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.640]   Who do who do I need to bend the knee to?
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.120]   To get in there see that you can't you skype with your laptop?
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.200]   Well, I said I promise not to not to be rude and break any rules and
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.880]   I don't know. I feel like they're maybe they're clear close there they could they
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.080]   But it's the point you made Andy last week was
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.920]   Well, do you mind bringing people in when there's patently unfinished stuff around?
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:15.880]   I think that you're looking at this two weeks from now. You could you could have an event there
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.800]   They could get it in shape. I don't it's certainly no accident that the
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.240]   Steve jobs theater is again. It's not inside the campus
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.600]   It's way on the side so that again a car can come in off the highway go in there and not really be on the campus itself
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.160]   So again, if it were really important to them, they could get it looking presentable
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.360]   Even if it only had to look presentable for a week
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.920]   uh, the question is that
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.120]   You can I could make the argument either way that apple is a sort of company that says
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.640]   Hey, this is this this building is going to be here for 50 years
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.320]   We're going to be here for 50 years
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.960]   There's going to be a first event at some point. It doesn't have to be this one
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.920]   Or I could also see them saying that well, you know
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.960]   We want we really want we're very proud of this achievement and even though we can't show off the entire campus
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.680]   At this point architectural digest or to steve and leavey
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.360]   Uh, with now that all the pictures up and hung let's at least show people why we're so proud and so excited about this
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.680]   So I honestly don't know yeah, we don't know
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.800]   Uh part of it, of course is this issue of not only do you have to book a different venue
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.560]   But you have to set it up
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.720]   And usually when do when do they start?
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.240]   Putting up banners and putting paper on the windows and stuff like that usually around now or at the end
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.240]   I think they do the beginnings like they were
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.040]   For the build graves that are famously they put an air conditioning for the entire venue
[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.800]   Yeah, but a lot of that will happen a week before I don't think they would need to do it before
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:40.520]   Um, uh, a week would be enough for just an event. Yeah, wwc takes longer to build up, but but I think that the
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.600]   Uh, you know just for an event. I mean a typical event production
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.200]   If you weren't adding air conditioning people would start loading in three days before the event
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.040]   And you would Alex would know by the way, he does big events like this all the time with
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.640]   Yeah, so I mean I don't think that they would need to um to to start loading in until after labor day
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:00.440]   Uh to you know to start making that happen and they probably send out the
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.040]   They the invitations will probably go out before they started loading in anywhere
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.480]   Uh, you know to kind of get get that over with is my guess and I think that they made a decision about where they were
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.200]   Going to be you know in june like in george lai like I don't think that they they're not you know
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.640]   We may be you know talking about it. They're not going to rush the finish
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.880]   You know apple's not going to rush the construction or rush anything for them to just do it there
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.960]   The whole point of building this and by the way the wall street journal said a thousand seats
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.160]   Which is comparable in size to the bill graham, right?
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.720]   Uh smaller
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.680]   We've yeah, but they don't use all that. I mean the last time they don't use the mezzanine. I think we've used them as a year
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.600]   Yeah, yeah, oh well. There was a lot of apple engineers and a huge demo area. All right
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:45.560]   Uh, and we have a reason if you're the thing to remember is that you're gonna have millions of people watching the live stream
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.520]   There's no, I mean anything over 300 people is just optics
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.120]   Yeah
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.320]   You will I think I do think that there's a prior one of the priorities is we have to have enough bodies in there so that we get a lot of
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:00.440]   Crowd noise right that is no it's no good. It's no good to have press on their hands
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.200]   Well, because the press aren't sure that there's a presser taking notes and presser
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.800]   You know doing their jobs
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.520]   So I I would I would think that that's part of their priority too that if they can get more bodies more cheering again
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.160]   More and also to be to be less cynical about it
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.200]   They're the apple employees are really pleased to be at that place too
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.040]   They're proud of the work they did so more people who worked on this they get to be at the event
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.480]   Uh, it's it's like it's like a field trip day from school
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.120]   So and two years ago they also made a conscious choice to have a bigger demo area because of the apple tv
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.040]   So they needed all those I think it was 10 mock living rooms and also they wanted international press
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.040]   So there was less us press which caused you know
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.920]   Constination amongst us media but a lot more Chinese and Asian and european press at the event
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.080]   Well, and if the rumors are accurate
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.920]   We're gonna see a lot of new products including a new apple tv. So
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:51.480]   You're gonna see a new apple watch you're gonna see three not two but three new iPhones and apple watch and apple tv
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:59.000]   Um, you might want some demo space. I don't know. I mean, well, we're not seeing in these images is what's downstairs
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.800]   This is the entryway, but you see your go down escalators on either side
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.440]   And that's where the demo area might be all this stuff is below. We don't know what's down there
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:15.240]   That's what shape it's in to me. That's the most what that's one of the most fascinating areas of the new campus next next to us
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.840]   You know johnny. I have land because you know how you know how much
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.080]   How sticklers they are for detail how much like they like control
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:31.480]   And also how far they're willing to go during a press event to make sure the things are just so now imagine that they're building a theater of bespoke
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.840]   theater specifically for apples needs and it's not
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:40.040]   Game of thrones premiere night parties. It's going to be there's there's there's going to be
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:46.600]   Really good green room areas so that when elvis castello comes in he has a very lovely place to stay
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.800]   They're going to be it's going to be easier when you have private briefings for some press
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:13:00.680]   To make sure that they get corralled off without having to like diss other members of the press by by you know
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.840]   removing them bodily
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:10.360]   having an archangel drop in and and and uh, send rene uh to the to the next to the to the to walk towards the light and stuff like that
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.240]   Uh, it's and I and like I said earlier
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:19.720]   I wouldn't be shocked if they didn't do a disneyland sort of thing where there is again a very well-appointed
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.200]   tunnel from the theater to the main campus so that again
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.720]   Uh, um, tim and rest can just simply get in and get out without having to go through crowds. No, right
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.400]   A merge not just for privacy, but just for speed that they don't
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:38.840]   In the stage they come up and they emerge standing in the stage in a puff of smoke
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.920]   And then when they're done they disappear into the stage and it's gone and they're gone
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.600]   Well, I think I just wonder if they're gonna roll out the teleporters where they just teleported on
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.200]   Like
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:54.360]   So here's the thing to look for is there heavy machinery? Is there any equipment in the vicinity?
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.000]   of the theater
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.520]   And i'm going to jump back a little bit so you could see the the actual day on this post
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.840]   Uh, this one is it says late august so I think
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.280]   Um, i'm gonna go back a little bit more. It seems
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:13.240]   I don't see any earth moving equipment around here. I don't see any heavy machinery
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.560]   There is a little uh lift
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:19.320]   But that would you be using clean windows or or something like that
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.200]   There's a tractor
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.440]   I know you know what? I think they're done with the heavy machinery in that area
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:33.720]   Well, I understand they also uh saved saved a lot of time by moving just the headstones and leaving the bodies there
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.120]   Which is not going to and they it is on the end of the grave site
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.400]   And I understand it will be haunted for every event. No, I'm just kidding
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   Um, if this is look at their people in the r&d facility. This is already, uh occupied. Let me go back
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:54.680]   That you can see all of those tables and chairs there people in the parking lot
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.880]   Oh boy, I bet you know what i'm gonna say i'm gonna put my money on september 12th at
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.520]   apple park at the steve jobs theater
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.240]   That's what i'm gonna put my money on it is the 10th anniversary iphone after all which is steves greatest accomplishment
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   The theater is named after him
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:15.960]   And frankly the wall street journal usually has pretty good sources and this stuff, right? They just say it people in the know
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.680]   Yeah
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.160]   All right
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.200]   Well, we'll know by next i would think by next tuesday you would have your invitations those of you're getting them
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.280]   And i as i said i'm lobbying hard because i want to be there with you guys
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:35.320]   Awesome. I want to be there. I I think i've been in purgatory long enough
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.440]   Seven years is long and almost eight years is long enough to be in purgatory. I'm
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.080]   I've I've done my penance
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:45.960]   I'm an abend-a-need-a-tim cook
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.520]   And uh, you know, you know, you know what help
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:57.240]   Since you since you have that beautiful huge screen windows machine and a pencil if you wrote i will not disrupt the
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:02.040]   The event in any way a hundred times like bark simpson line after line after line by hand
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.520]   There's also i mean apples not no cut
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.320]   based to
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.320]   disrupt
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.560]   Of course we are writing on a windows
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.640]   Hey, they can't they can't hold that against me. I'm wearing an apple watch
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.360]   I got an ipad here. I got an ipon in my pocket. They can't hold that against me
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.640]   I promise not to disrupt your event. I will follow all
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.400]   Rules
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.920]   All I mean apples not always the quickest to embrace there was a whole thing bruja
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:43.000]   WDC because no podcasters got invited and podcasters thought you know, they're a legitimate form of media and there is hey I host a
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.880]   nationally syndicated radio show on traditional media
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:54.200]   Every weekend for a million thousands thousands of people thousands people no million
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.640]   1 million listeners every weekend. That's the reach
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.600]   How could you turn me down?
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:07.720]   I don't care. It's fine. If I I said if I can't go can megan go actually what I did is I talked to the iTunes guys because you know james
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.000]   And steve and tom and then tom brought up. Yeah
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.360]   Tell him what you did leo that got you on the black list. I said there's a black list. He says no, there's no black list
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:25.000]   All those are people are gone anyway. Yeah, that's you know katie cotton had it in for me, but she's gone
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.640]   I actually don't even know who to talk to so uh, I asked james james that all
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.960]   I'll get how singing some names. I'll talk to people. So he's gonna put so good word for me
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.480]   And he's he's a big he's been around. He's he's a big wig over there. He's a big guy. Yeah. Nice guy. Thank you james
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:45.160]   I would like to go. I will be polite. I will I won't be rude. I'm excited. I'm gonna buy an iPhone
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:52.280]   Uh the new iF I'll spend the thousand dollars. Is it gonna be that expensive Renee? Do you think that that's outrageous or I mean
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:58.920]   Yeah, a thousand dollars given what the galaxy note seven nine hundred sixty dollars for a night eight nine hundred sixty
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.600]   I mean, I think that's the new upper tier for premium premium phones. The wheeze although
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.640]   I got half off because I bought a note seven
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.840]   Ooh, they're gonna I bought my note eight
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.320]   I just bought it this morning because I realized I could save that much. I mean it's like giving me four hundred dollars
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.400]   Apple won't give you credit for the note seven of us
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.520]   Well, by the way, you have to trade in a phone and it could be a iPhone, but it won't be
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.880]   Yeah, I have a note. I have my note five and on my note seven
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.720]   I had to give it it but because if you bought a note seven and you're in their database
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:34.680]   Which apparently I was because I gave my email address they said okay good you can you can buy for I think was 450 bucks or something like that
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.000]   a note eight and
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.080]   And will and will expedite it to you. They said they really felt bad say I'm talking about that whole note seven thing
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.160]   But I have to send them and then I don't even have to send them the phone to get the new phone
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.200]   I just have to take the box. They send me the new phone and input my old note five in there and send it back to
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:59.000]   That's a good. You know how you know how you think about how excited we all get when black friday said do you really apple's offering 10
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.400]   Dollars off the iPhone seven
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:09.080]   Quick well, that's just I mean that's the testament testament to how how important this next phone is and I and by the way
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.720]   I'm home still holding out for iPhone pro. I think that's the name
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:19.000]   Uh, I'm sure of it and I think that so I'm gonna call it that the iPhone pro will be worth it
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.320]   I think this is gonna be the biggest advance in an iPhone. It's quite some time
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.480]   Did now now don't get a ticket
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:34.520]   No, I'm not saying that because of that. Uh, I I really do think this is gonna be especially because of a arkett
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.800]   But also, I'm very excited. I keep talking about
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.720]   Heif the high efficiency image format. Yeah
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.200]   I feel like that's got some promise
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.120]   And now hecfa too, especially with the rumors of the 4k HDR
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.000]   Is it true because will it shoot that heck?
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.320]   Well, it does it does well it does already but the cool thing is there's rumors about apple
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.000]   Or at least like you said that new apple tv and for people have been waiting for 4k
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   But previously 4k was mostly 8 bit which was just 4k standard
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.320]   Depth and now they have hdr
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.200]   Which is the 10 bit support they have it in the iphone well they have it in the new ipads will personally be in the new iphone
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.320]   So will then so will it be hdr for the new apple tv
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.240]   Uh, that's that's what it looks like. I mean even the mac has support for hdr now
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:23.480]   Will it be hdr again and dole b hdr or will it be just hdr 10 do we know and dole b stuff is fuzzy?
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.640]   There's been a lot of names thrown around okay
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.760]   And apple's releasing this they're a little they're a little slow to the 4k game
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.000]   um and uh a little the last 4k device
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.160]   Right, right, right?
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.640]   So I think there are a little slow to that. I think coming in without hdr puts them even further behind the ball
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.960]   I mean, I think that we're already with if you buy a busy o tv you're getting hdr from amazon
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.840]   You're getting you know like there's not you know, it's it's already built in
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:55.160]   I think they if they're gonna really make movement in the in that platform hdr has to be one of those things I think also
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.000]   um
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.520]   I think when we see them talking about you know higher frame rates and so on so forth. I could see them
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.200]   um
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.360]   You know looking at at doing comment, you know, I mean like there's been a lot of talk
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:14.040]   Uh about something better than 30 frames a second or 60 frames a second. Yeah, also hdr's
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   I'm important. I'm sorry hdr is a lot more important than 4k in terms of what you're going to actually see on the screen
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.720]   Uh, once you once you get a certain distance away from a 4k screen
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:29.640]   It doesn't look any different from 1080 whereas hdr is always amazing no matter how what ang you're looking at it
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:37.080]   Also, but also I'm hoping that there it's a helping that the next apple tv is is pepier and better processing video
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:43.320]   Uh because I do have three or four different boxes plugged in and lots of different sources and consistently
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:50.040]   The one that to the only box that can't keep up with absolutely everything that I want to stream is the apple tv
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.680]   Like for instance things that I record off the air
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:58.920]   Every one of my boxes can play it back. No problem the apple tv. It's just stops and buffers and then it's just
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.480]   It's disappointing for an apple product. Yeah
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:06.200]   I'm really interested in live
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.760]   Obviously given that we're a live live production company
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:15.880]   We really are curious about you know a lot of the rumors that that apple is going to hopefully focus or or put a lot of support into live
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:21.960]   Broadcast now in the beginning and probably just live from the television stations, but hopefully that's something that I want to say even
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.040]   I have that. I know this is a big deal for apple
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.560]   They really want to have this but the it's been a very difficult negotiation
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:34.040]   All of it and the carrying locals live locals isn't just doesn't just require the approval of the locals
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.760]   You've also if they're gonna put network content on it, which if they don't and it's one then who cares
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:44.600]   They're gonna get the network approval too, right? I mean this is a and so far apple's been rebuffed every time
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:47.080]   Well, I think it's a big thing to them that yeah
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   Danger the content creators. I mean or those studios not really content creators the studios are getting into is that they have
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:58.520]   Successfully turned off Netflix from buying stuff from them. They've successfully turned off fans. Yeah, it's accessible
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.280]   And so they're getting billions of dollars spent by these tech companies to
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:08.120]   To essentially build their own content. So I mean apple's only gonna put up with this for so long if they don't
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.800]   They need to they need to figure out a way that makes sense for them
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.120]   But they keep on pushing on this apple's gonna go start building their own content and and forget about them
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:22.680]   I mean the studios are really in a well, but okay apple's built its own content so far and it's not been exactly a threat to the networks
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.400]   Yes, no, I agree that they they've not I I think that they brought in new folks that
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.080]   Hopefully we'll have a better sense of what that looks like, but yeah, they're original
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:38.440]   Uh version of the apps coming on and uh, so far carpool karaoke's not exactly a winner either for that matter
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.520]   But there there's also an argument you made that if they're really pursuing the networks
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:47.960]   It's sort of like trying to get big band music on your on your music service
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.080]   I mean, it's how how many people are really interested in network programming outside of sports
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:58.120]   So really live tv is where it's at if you can get people want their football people want their basketball
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.520]   Uh, but even that's going to cable channels
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:05.560]   They're they have the money to uh to buy the licenses with those things and you can get that through sling
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:10.920]   Sling tv can get that through other things people who do like uh network programming very
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.880]   They may be they might be perfectly happy to wait for it to come to hulu a couple seasons later
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.680]   It might be perfectly happy to wait for it to come to netflix
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.000]   So you think what they would do is carry a local but blackout the network programming?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.560]   No, I'm I'm saying that it's a it's a
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.920]   Pursuing local network stations was a much bigger
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:36.280]   What was a much bigger jewel three or four years ago and that it is right now at this point?
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:45.000]   The amount of effort they have to put in which is considerable for the win that they will receive by getting that which is now much lower
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:52.520]   I mean, it's and I think would be much more interesting if apple were to say oh and by the way apple tv now supports network tv tuners
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.760]   So if you buy an hd home run you can get every single local broadcast station for free
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:03.720]   Uh, and if if they were to go even further and say that this also every apple tv is all can also work as a dv
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.160]   R that will sink automatically to your iTunes library
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:13.880]   To me, that's a much better solution than trying to keep negotiating with cbs and nbc and all these other groups
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:20.840]   I'm looking at my my ipad the tv app and my ipad right now and contrast this to youtube tv
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:26.760]   Which i'm also looking at and I have a subscription for on the ipad sign into your tv provider. I have to I have to
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:32.680]   I have to use that is like the like and you just this is the constant attack and then it's like this complicated thing and
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:39.000]   And you got a log in and then i look at youtube tv and look at i've got all the locals now that this is market by market
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.360]   But i'm in the san francisco market, so i've got fox i've got cbs i've got abc and
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.800]   By the way, this is a nice interface the only thing lacking is
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:53.400]   It's it's on a computer. It's not on an apple tv style device. I can't run
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:59.960]   Weirdly and I suspect this is a restriction that the locals and the and the content creators have offered
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:05.400]   I can't put this on my android tv. I can only which is weird. I mean, why can't i put you?
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.080]   Put other stuff on your computer it's the i don't think it's any coincidence
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   Quinses either that the amazon app is going to debut at this event and not earlier on because earlier on you wouldn't get the benefit
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:20.200]   Of the hdr content, and that's the thing it's like there was apple could have done 4k earlier
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:25.560]   But there was no 4k itunes they didn't have the deals in place even today the wall street journalist saying that apples are going over pricing
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:31.480]   They want 20 for for the 4k content and the studios want 25 to 30 dollars for it
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.720]   And it's you know, there's no there's no guarantee those deals
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:37.000]   Well, I'll get made I mean usually they come through at the last minute because you know
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.120]   They figured all this is this is as last minute as you can get this is again
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.280]   Another wall street or a box with no 4k content is a hard sell. Yeah
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.000]   Well, yeah, hmm
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.680]   So this is about buying the movie as opposed to renting it
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.400]   But I know when I voodoo or amazon or google I pay more
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:27:00.120]   For uhd content than I do for hd content and I pay more for hd content
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:04.280]   I do for a standard definition content so and we're still purchase native
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.600]   I mean a lot of people these days are stream native. They don't want anything to do with purchasing individual movies anymore
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   Yeah, yeah
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:14.280]   Hmm. Hmm. This will be very very interesting
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:22.200]   All right, well, it feels like it's just a lot of turbulence right now like they
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.800]   The hollywood is still they're still convinced that apple ruined the music business and they're not gonna let don't ruin the
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.640]   Video business. Well, the funny thing is is that they're actually getting themselves into a position where they're gonna ruin their own business because they're
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:40.600]   Not wanting to play they're so afraid of of this happening that they are you know trying to hang on to something that is moving very fast
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.920]   These companies did not want to make their own content
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:49.720]   Like they they wanted to license the easy way out was the license their own content and hollywood is very quickly persuading them
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.000]   To do something different, you know like that they're gonna have to build their own content
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.520]   They're gonna have to develop their own
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:28:00.280]   You know bits and pieces because they can't work with with the studios, you know and the studios keep on putting out when you look at television content
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.600]   I mean they just put out stuff that isn't
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:08.280]   Andy you said that live tv isn't the crown jewel it used to be but look at this interface on youtube tv
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:13.880]   I mean I think this is these are all live and moving. These are news channels recommended channels
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:19.560]   This would be a great interface on apple tv that you could put up and then you could zoom in on the channel that you wanted to
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:28.440]   Watch I mean, I think this is this is what youtube's doing with youtube tv. I think that's very compelling and I it's so it's a shame that apple can't do that on the apple tv
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.440]   There's a difficulty when there's a difficulty when it's
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:39.720]   It's important to remember how important simply training an audience training a customer is
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.920]   People for generations were trained to go to live tv for entertainment
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:55.080]   And over the years I can only speak for myself. I've been trained not to go to live tv anymore because nothing that I very little of what I want to see is actually on tv anymore
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:29:00.200]   And when it's there because advertising has become so much more
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:07.240]   Of a blood sport now instead of i'm going to get at least three or four commercials for you know, hey
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:12.920]   Let's sign these papers and we'll take your home away from you like you get your home take away from you sign with us
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.960]   We'll have your loan if you know all these commercials that aren't just annoying
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.680]   But they're kind of insulting and offensive and so which also drives me away from seeing things
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.800]   Especially when you have the opportunity to go to something like hulu where for a tie or youtube
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:31.160]   Where for a tiny amount extra per month you it'll say and we will give you no commercials whatsoever
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.960]   You just get to see the show and that's for me
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:40.600]   That's worth waiting 24 hours to just not see any commercials and have a dpr to me youtube tv is an interesting
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:46.680]   Play for google because it really does that's the the upsell right? Oh, well, you know get get youtube red
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.360]   And you can get all this stuff. I mean this is a this for google
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.760]   This makes a lot of sense because this pushes people toward youtube
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:57.560]   Yeah, I mean, I'm just i'm just saying that uh, i've even even a simple
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:06.440]   But the tv tuner app i have for the apple tv works looks a lot like that youtube tv interface where it's not live thumbnails
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.920]   But I get a thumb it's a grid of
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:12.200]   Title cards from every tv show that's on right now
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.040]   So I don't have to flip through channels. I can just scroll and just pick out the one that I want
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.840]   And again, I can't I can't imagine apple
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:24.520]   Not already having a prototype of this given that it's an open standard. They don't have to develop their own tv hardware
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.320]   They can just and the the hardware itself is
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:33.080]   90 bucks and works works really really well you plug it in and it just plain works
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:40.280]   Again, if I were in charge of this project, I would be trying to talk myself self out of trying to
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:46.040]   Work any deals whatsoever and just put all of that effort into making the best live tv app network
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.880]   Excuse me a local t might say network. I don't mean tv networks
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:58.600]   I mean the local your local digital network the best the best network ip based tv app ever and apple's definitely able to do that
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:07.000]   It's interesting imagine. I mean imagine the other thing is that other other the plex tv can even do things like
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:14.360]   I am waiting for a train in boston and there is a red socks game on I can through my phone connect to
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.920]   My plex tv back home that is connected to a local tuner and watch
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:24.200]   Stream live television to my phone from this device i've got back in the house
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:29.640]   Again, they could put together such an amazing demo that would make everybody want to have an apple tv
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.600]   And like a lot of apple's best products people would not have to
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.320]   It would take more while to figure out that oh by the way sling box has had that for like four or five years now
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.080]   And this other product has been working on windows and other platforms for two or three years
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:42.600]   And you could always get that for the apple tv
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:48.280]   But they could put it together in such a way that it immediately becomes like an appliance that you plunk down money for
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:54.440]   And it does magical things as opposed to something that your nerdy friend andy up the street does and can teach you how to cut it set up
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.040]   There are so many apple tv's in the lab that do so many amazing things
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   Yeah, we wish we will never see yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:07.880]   Yeah, I you know for all for how i'm pre i've been impressed by youtube tv since the day they launched it
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.600]   I thought this is a brilliant thing and I don't see you getting a lot of traction
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.560]   So I may be it just may be me. I just feel like this
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.760]   I mean is such a natural look at look at how this works
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:21.560]   So i've got the live channels with live video and by the way a lot of news channels
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.320]   I've got movies that they can then rent and make money on
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:34.280]   I've got uh recommended you know popular shows right beneath it youtube read originals right so youtube's original programming apple
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.440]   This is how apple promotes
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.920]   Could promote you know if they're going to do dedicated content
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:46.760]   This is exactly how I would imagine this on an apple tv on your big you subscribe to it leo
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.760]   Yeah, but this is this is the paid version
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.160]   Yeah, mine says try it for $35 a month select us cities
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.080]   Yeah, because you have to be yeah, you probably wouldn't get live locals
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:00.760]   It also has a built-in dvr has a lot of things that are are pretty sweet
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.360]   I mean I can actually record shows i'm only recording one show, but I can have it
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.840]   uh show up and play
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.640]   Because i've been recording and it's kind of very easy dvr
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.920]   But I don't hear people talking about this I when I think I think the hard part is is that for a lot of the shows that we want to watch
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.120]   There are a lot of us are the problem you get into is now there's so much content
[00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:23.320]   You know it's trying to figure out what you watch next and which ones you're gonna watch on Netflix or amazon or
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.800]   Is this too complicated? Is this too much for me?
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.400]   Yeah, well things the problem is is that a lot of the a lot of the live footage that we think of news and the talk shows and everything else
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.120]   Well, I'm kind of want to watch them whenever we're gonna watch them and it's mostly the stuff you watch in a hotel room when you know everything else
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:36.600]   You're right
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:41.560]   So you know and so the so I think that the problem is sports is still something that you want to watch live
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.520]   um
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.080]   And uh, but a lot of the other stuff you look at like um, you know, so you think you can damn it right because you know
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:53.240]   It's not on here the stuff that I watch game of thrones and the pay tv content the Netflix originals none of that's on here
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.440]   Right, and so you immediately just start you this all crap. I don't watch
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.240]   It's yeah, it's all it's all the kind of it
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.320]   You know problem is a lot of the network stuff is kind of filler
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.520]   And I mean there's definitely people want there's still a lot of people watching it
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:10.280]   You look at something like my wife likes so you so you think you can dance, but she doesn't care about voting and so she watches it like
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:13.720]   Uh, you know a year later, you know, like you know or six months later
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.160]   She watches the whole thing she can watch one every night until she gets to the end of it
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.040]   and then she you know watches, you know, my wife, you know used to
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.200]   Used to dance and so she's she watches all these dance shows, but she but um the uh
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.480]   But she's you know, it's it's one of those things that
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:33.560]   She doesn't need she's not voting and she's not voting and there's no real interactivity
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:36.280]   The problem with live video in general is other than sports
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:41.560]   You need to have an interactivity with the audience to make it worth watching live, you know, and that's the part that the tv
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.280]   Man, they they don't even get it. They don't have any
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.320]   No, I think they're experiment
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.160]   I think american idol for instance, which has live voting is experimenting because I noticed
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.840]   So so lisa and I watch that and she likes to vote
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.360]   So unlike carlita, she wants to be watching live
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:02.040]   But she will watch it taped but it was very frustrating because we're on the west coast
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.840]   For one episode they had the closed voting after it was done live on the east coast
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.080]   And I am there's no way they did that by accident. That was an experiment
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.160]   They are aware of this and they're trying to see how patterns vary
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.600]   The voting isn't enough. Like the voting isn't enough. You know, it's got to be some reason watch live
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.720]   And you're right. The only reason you watch you watch the academy award you watch football
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.640]   You watch the olympics
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.520]   Olympics are coming people are going to want to watch those live, right?
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.840]   Yeah, maybe yeah
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.760]   I mean the thing is so much of the olympics that you're watching now is not stuff that's live anyway
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:33.920]   I mean you get a hand-
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.160]   Yeah, I know isn't that terrible?
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:41.000]   EBS and you know, you imagine though this grid with live and and tapes olympic coverage
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.560]   Well, and that's an opportunity in London
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:47.320]   You know, youtube did it in london where they played they had suddenly all these live feeds
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.760]   I don't know what happened to it. It probably terrified the broadcasters to have that happen
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:55.720]   But but you know suddenly you can watch live feeds all the time of stuff that was coming from it, right?
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:00.440]   Yeah, I think I mean a question here that we're all ignoring is will they do a new apple remote?
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:06.120]   Yeah, because that current one is really the elephant in the room god awful
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.480]   Oh my gosh
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.560]   If all they do is put a nubbin at one end of it. That's all that needs to happen
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:17.880]   Nubbin not saying I'm not saying that all will be forgiven. I'm just saying that you will you will at least acknowledge to
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.320]   Apple will live in the least acknowledged to me that they have been listening
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:24.200]   They acknowledge that this is not an ideal setup
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:32.520]   So what's the problem the problem with the apple tv remote is that you trigger it accidentally all the time
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.400]   Yeah, and that's because this the question effect this thing. Yeah, this this
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.240]   Clicker track. That's clearly matt. You know, this side is clearly gloss
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.000]   You hit it and then especially if you have cec turned on
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.920]   In my in my house if I accidentally hit this the apple tv takes over the whole home entertainment unit
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:56.600]   I'm going wait a minute the dragons are attacking and all of a sudden i'm looking at holding it right side up at least
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:01.640]   Yeah, only because I was careful to look at the matt versus yeah, so they could improve on this
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.840]   It's not far off. What do you mean by a nubbin though?
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.640]   Anyway, what would well like if they put just like a little rubber bump on the back end of it
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:13.720]   Oh, so you knew which way it was top just so that you don't have to keep flipping it around to figure out
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:15.720]   But yeah, but I agree that the touch
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.240]   I have a love hate relationship. I have a love hate relationship with the touch sensor
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.320]   I do like not just swipe
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.400]   Not just the swipe but the fact that you can get velocity in there too if you want to really scroll
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:30.280]   You can just give it a savage flick, but yeah, I mean I have to I have to have a
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:38.040]   stand on the on the at my bedside to make sure that if I just leave it in the mid at some point every time
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.600]   Oh, yeah, it's just I put it
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.920]   We go down a long list and then I accidentally go a little bit sideways and it moves to the side navigation
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.680]   Then it takes me out of part into something else
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:50.040]   And then I try to get back and it's back at the top of the list again. It makes you crazy
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:53.720]   I keep it in a drawer so that I don't accidentally sit on our budget
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.120]   So it's like an special drawer
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.120]   Just so what we're saying is this is less than ideal less than ideal
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.520]   All right, so that's what we're all going to be watching for the new apple tv remote
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:09.320]   A lot of people apparently just use the iOS app now. I wasn't sure how many but yeah, that's all
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.440]   They're still remote. I lost it. I think it's ready. He said she lost her as months ago
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.640]   I'm kind of forgotten. That's all plus you have to remember to charge it right and if it's not, you know, I mean the whole thing
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.200]   That's not that's not bad. I'd love to I have to be I
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:25.080]   I'd love to have the ability to if I'm gonna buy something just use my fingerprint like I'm on my phone
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.560]   You know, I mean, you know, it's it's one of those things that you'll like
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.000]   The you know, because I have kids and so typing the
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.760]   Password and in front of them is very dangerous. You know, like they want to they want to have it
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.800]   So there's like this whole process every time they want to they want to a movie that they have to leave the room
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.880]   And then I'm gonna like click click click
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.400]   So the phone works better because I can type it in but the point is if I could just say I want to buy the
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.880]   I want to buy this and then put my finger on it. Of course my son. I'm sure would figure out how to use it while I was sleeping but
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:56.200]   Exactly just that don't don't wait for daddy to go to sleep and then guess what we get to see porkies too
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:58.920]   How
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:04.840]   How many times do I have to stop this autoplay video on fortune? Geez I stopped at once and it's playing again
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:10.920]   Fortune says survey says people don't want to pay a thousand dollars for a phone
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.840]   a
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:18.200]   Study from fluent found that just 13 percent of americans would buy a phone that costs a thousand dollars
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.560]   Only 8 percent would be willing to pay for a $1400
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.480]   Phone two-thirds of consumers said a thousand dollar iPhone is simply too expensive
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:26.920]   I don't buy it
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:32.440]   There's a huge problem is that no nobody will buy one when asked will you buy one when they see a phone or when they see the pricing
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:38.280]   The need yeah, you gotta create the need this gets back into one dodge did it's re you know its whole
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:45.640]   You know redesign of their trucks. They they had all these they had these focus groups and it was something like you know
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.160]   You know
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.800]   Seven or 15 percent just had to have it. They just thought it was the most amazing thing. They they had to have it
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:57.320]   25 percent didn't really care that didn't make any difference for them and the rest hated it
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:02.200]   Like just hated it could never and so that was the and they and when they showed it to their
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:07.320]   CEO ever said well, we're definitely building it and they said they said why and I said because our market share is 7 percent
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.760]   We are really getting 15 percent. That's all we'll be happy
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:16.200]   For popcorn, but when I'm at the movie I pay five you do because you have to have it exactly
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:22.360]   13 percent of americans is still you know 45 million people or 40 million people or something like that
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.840]   It's still a lot of zones and that's and we're talking about the very very
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:31.240]   You know top-end version and there's still plenty of people that will go buy seven s's and in five c's and you know all that other stuff
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.880]   Yeah, I mean we're talking exactly if that were if that were the new price of the
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.560]   Quote new iPhone and quote then that I think that would be a problem, but if they do market it as
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:48.520]   uh if they do market it as here is something that is a little bit extra that is a little bit fancier
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.360]   uh and
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:55.560]   Not a little bit more but enough but close enough to the base price of the regular iPhone 7 that
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:03.720]   People who are not blinking at $750 might not blink at $1,000 because in in both cases
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.880]   You have people who don't buy who either have people who buy phones every two or three years
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:11.400]   So that it's easy to sort of mentally absorb the extra cost
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:17.240]   Or they have so much money that they don't care and they buy a new phone every year anywhere and just pass down the old one to uh
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.160]   To the spouse and to the kids then to that sort of thing
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:24.600]   So, um, it's it's the thing is iPhones are iPhones are different iPhone customers are special
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.080]   I think that with the samsung note eight
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.400]   Part of the reason why they can charge so much is that they can legitimately say that well look it has a pen
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.840]   It has all these extra features. It is really a high productivity phone
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:39.080]   You can buy this almost instead of a tablet almost instead of a notebook for some people
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.920]   All apple has to do is say that this is a beautiful object that you will be interacting with from the moment that you wake up
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.520]   Until the until you take off your take off your clothes and change into your your t-shirt and sleep shorts at the end of the day
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.680]   And for a lot of those people why don't why why wouldn't I have the most beautiful thing that I can have?
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:59.560]   I think rene you're right the uh iphone pro is the $5 popcorn box
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:06.360]   You will I mean in context you want it you'll be drooling and you'll do anything to get it and guarantee you
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:12.200]   It'll be you know hard to get and people will get up at 12.01 in the morning
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.520]   People who are angry they can't get it 12.01. There'll be people who are angry at $1000 until the moment
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.680]   They realize they can't order one and then they'll be livid
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:24.360]   Let's go
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:30.200]   But again if apple if apple tomorrow just said you can order the best of what we're gonna release for
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:36.200]   $1400 20 million people would line up and buy it you as including you and me including you and me
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.880]   Yeah, yeah, sorry buy it. I want them to do it specifically. So why can't get one?
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.400]   I already know they're gonna put out this great thing and and I'm gonna and I want to have that in fact
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.640]   There are some of us who would say apple
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.480]   Spare no expense if you're gonna make an iphone pro
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:58.040]   Then don't consider no limits just just put I mean I don't mean make it out of solid gold
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   I mean in terms of pure functionality put every bit of technology that you can think of in there
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.680]   No matter what the cost
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.080]   I would agree. Well, that's I mean I think I think well keep it under
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.480]   $2,000
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:16.520]   I would say you know put whatever you think makes makes you know that you can that you can make in mass and
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:20.200]   Put it in there and and there's a there's millions of people that would pay for that
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:20.760]   No, I agree
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.040]   And then and then you can and then that helps you you know that they become
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.960]   The first level and of course all that technology becomes available next year
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:33.320]   It's one thing now they continue to sell the se the seven s and the seven s plus because there's a range
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:38.120]   And for those of you nutty enough to spend $1400 for a 512 gigabyte
[00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.520]   iPhone pro we got it
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.560]   Now i'm gonna take a break and then we're gonna do
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:47.800]   I just really want to run through all the rumors and get your

[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:51.720]   And we would know I think we'll know by next week
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.640]   Uh
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   999 the price brian x chenna new york times says thinner bezels face recognition unlocking
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:03.160]   Wireless charging those are all old rumors. We've heard for a long time. Yeah
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.960]   uh from mac rumors
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.840]   The iphone eight prime
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:16.600]   Said to come in 64 256 gig and 512 gig storage capacities all with three gigs of ram zak credible
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:22.360]   Thumbs up thumbs down. Yeah, sure. Why not ipad pro comes that way
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.920]   Actually speaking of the ipad pro apple has two patents for using a pencil
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:33.080]   On a phone. Do you think that would we have with the iphone pro would we have some stylus e kind of thing?
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:40.760]   It's a there's a couple things you have to overcome there one is you have to make sure the technology because they're using a new kind of 3d touch because 3d touch
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:43.160]   Required an led backlight
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.560]   And now they're moving to a film based technology to measure the uh the force
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.560]   Of the touch and that has to be compatible with what they're doing with a multi touch sensor
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:55.640]   You also have to increase the scan rate to 120 hertz or if they're doing pro motion anyway
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.000]   It seems like a real nice. You know that seems like a real nice solution to that problem
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.840]   I just think the current apple pencil is you know, it doesn't look like a
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:07.080]   Galaxy no pencil. It's almost as big as the phone. Right and I'd love to use it
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.440]   I mean I would love love to use it would be field notes for me gone digital
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.880]   Uh, I want it more than I want many other things. I just don't know if they'll do it
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.000]   They change the form factor for a pencil stylus or where they just say hey
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   If you want to use the pencil you can
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.200]   Maybe it's a nice pencil
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:26.600]   Yeah, but you get you know what they know they need to do a clip so you could keep it in your pocket or something
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:31.480]   And it caps to protect the nib because that's fragile. That's something
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.560]   Yeah, yeah, I think I think that if they had apple pencil support
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.880]   They would be surprised at how popular it would be
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.440]   uh because the people just
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:46.360]   More much more than the gal people have a galaxy note, but they're not they don't instinctively think of
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.900]   uh, a
[00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:49.960]   Android device as an art tablet
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:55.320]   Whereas people who have iPhones they will be drawing and they will be taking notes and they will be annotating
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.280]   Uh, so if they could come up with the apple golf pencil, maybe
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.080]   Uh, that'd be interesting a golf pencil
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.040]   And as far as I know, I mean pencil was developed agnostically they just chose
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.080]   I mean it's always a question of cost how much can you put into how much can you charge for it?
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.520]   Does it interfere with other things you want to do and then they made the decision to roll it out?
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.920]   iPad pro but it they could roll it out for iphone anytime they put those things together
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:19.560]   One of the things gal a samsung did with the note eight they have ois
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:23.640]   optical image stabilization in both lenses to lens solution
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.920]   Ois in both that's the thing apple doesn't do you think they might do that?
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:32.120]   It would be an improvement so because you can use the long lens which is really just
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:36.920]   50 but you can't use the long guns with in low light because it just doesn't have that stabilization
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.640]   Yeah, so that and oftentimes sometimes
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:44.920]   Some people get a little bit surprised that when they zoom it looks a lot worse than they thought it would
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:51.240]   That's because they're actually using the the they're using the the optical zoom on the wider angle lens
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.480]   And then visually zooming it
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.280]   Apple apple will do anything if it will improve image quality
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:02.040]   They might decide that they can do better than simple optical image stabilization on both
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.360]   They can do the procedurally better
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:09.320]   But no if they can get another if they can get another optical image stabilizer behind the the telephoto lens
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.880]   They can do that but stabilizing a longer lens is a much bigger problem than stabilizing a wide lens
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.880]   So it would be it was no room
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:17.880]   Yeah
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:23.560]   Just so I know whether to save up to take rubber scoble to dinner in paris or not will it be clear
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:27.560]   When you look that's I mean that was never like the rumor
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.600]   That rumor probably comes from a misunderstanding of what an edge to edge display looks like when it's
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.080]   Doing transparent like us doing AR mode because it's going through the camera
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.320]   Yeah, and it's showing you exactly what's behind it
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.360]   And we see pictures of a plane that that's what he meant
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.240]   I mean he should have said it back then then right?
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:50.600]   I asked him. I said you don't mean the camera and AR like a pokemon go you mean see through
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:55.640]   I don't know why he said that that was obvious. There's no technology that would make that work
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.520]   You can't well the battery wouldn't be see through so all you see is the battery right
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.040]   But definitely creating an illusion that it's clear
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.800]   I think it'd definitely be possible
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.040]   Well, that would be the one of the things that AR would do
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.760]   Yeah, I mean by the way for AR alone
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.800]   I'm interested in getting this phone just for the AR kit stuff alone
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.600]   Google today announced that they have something like AR kit
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.480]   AR core they call it AR core
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:21.080]   We can dumb down we can dumb down tango as good as apo
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.960]   So that was pretty much what that was like
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.080]   Yeah, you know the tang because tango is much more developed
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.640]   Than than AR kit just harder to use the pro well and the problem is that unlike
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.240]   Apple has a tango phone. Yeah, Google doesn't control the hardware
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.120]   So the only thing they could do it on is a pixel
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:43.800]   We got a we got a zen phone AR the the the Asus phone
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:49.320]   And I mean the problem is it does it but there's no apps because nobody's developing for it
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:55.160]   So markets because there's no market and so that's where apple just jumps ahead. They would be instantly
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.360]   You know the the largest
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:02.280]   Installed user base of augmented reality devices by far
[00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:06.840]   So this is only nougat and above but I think that's still like 14 percent
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:10.120]   Which when you take the the mass of the phone it's still a lot of phones
[00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:14.760]   It's a lot. Well and I think one I think one of the challenges really that is still like we were
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:21.160]   We've been working on a bunch of AR stuff and the problem is when we look at the markets that are going to that we're aiming at
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:25.400]   A vast majority of them at least from all the research we've done or using iPhones
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.040]   You know like they're just you know as it kind of an upper end market
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:33.160]   They're you know and we just don't you know see a lot of android penetration into those into those markets
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:36.840]   And so I think that's one of the real challenges that that uh that google will have it
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.960]   I mean again the tango technically is is definitely more
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:44.200]   Um, well that's what's interesting about AR cores. It's not does not require
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:50.760]   It's basically hardware. It's basically dumbing it down to to what what um what apples ar kit does right
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:56.680]   Sort of like you could see like my favorite thing about google is just how agile they are and as they tango tango tango tango
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.760]   Holy crap never mind
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:03.000]   No, but it's great because a lot of companies would just stick into their guns or they wouldn't be able to or they would have no buy
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.160]   In for it and they pivot so fast
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:13.160]   So a ar core works currently with the pixels and the s8 as long as they have android 7 or an above
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.360]   They hope by the end of the preview to get a hundred million devices. So I take it back
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.440]   I mean if if ar core can convince developers to create apps
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.160]   Uh google will be a player
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:27.240]   compare the challenge
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:31.880]   The challenge that we're going to see in two weeks is um is that if ar you know
[00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:35.080]   This is this definitely opens it up for for android
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:42.200]   Uh or for that kit the the challenges of apple releases a phone that has the you know, um some version of of of
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:50.280]   Distance measurement that that is already in the tango then you end up in this kind of weird position where you know apple may not have shown all their cards
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.880]   At wwc and suddenly shows oh by the way, you can do all of that too
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:57.320]   You know and I think that that is the that's the real and then that puts kind of
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.920]   uh, you know, you suddenly have millions and millions of phones going out that are able to do all of those things and
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:08.040]   You know, uh because the the ar kit stuff that is pretty pretty limited
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:13.720]   Like what you can do, you know, like like when you look at the ar kit and and this what you can actually get done and
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.520]   And figure out where you are in a space and so on so forth
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   I mean tango is the right direction. That's where everyone's going to end up because of the hardware
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:25.000]   Yeah, you need to know exactly where you are people can talk about image recognition and everything else
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.720]   But but you know that the the part that is is really needed is I need to be able to have a 3d representation of the space that i'm looking at
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.280]   You know or and then I have to be able to have a
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:39.160]   Uh something that can see that 3d information and then match those two together and be able to lock in on it
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.800]   And so and there's a bunch of bits and pieces to that
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:46.840]   But but that is the the challenge right now is that ar kit doesn't do that very well tango does it great
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:52.600]   But no one has it so there we're kind of in this kind of you know, uh slow moving morass where in two years
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:57.320]   Everyone's going to have it on every phone that's being released and it's going to be something that is part of what we do
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.800]   Um, but right now it's it's still a moving, you know a fast moving thing
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.760]   I think that
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:06.600]   Google did exactly what they needed to do which was make this easier to develop for make it easier
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:11.480]   You know make it more available so that developers had an actual audience to to absorb it
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:15.160]   So I think it makes sense, but I think that the hard part the hard pickle that they're going to be in is if apple
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:19.000]   Release is something that actually gets that 3d data. If they don't then it's fine. They do
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:26.200]   Well, if apple does it'll only be on the uh, iPhone pro and of course apples ar kit works on everything from what five s and later
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:32.280]   Right, and that's it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and this this is all great news for for ar in general
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:37.240]   It is now because it because it solves a problem that i'm sure a lot of developers
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:41.080]   We're having that if we want to put a lot of money in developing this ar app
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.160]   We have this great idea for an ar app
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.040]   Are we going to limit ourselves to just the iphone market now?
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:49.880]   It's not it's not like there's one industry standard that's so they can reuse all their code
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:54.200]   But it means that if we have this great idea that that conceptually works with ar kit
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.360]   It will also work in this other well
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.920]   Set of apis for this kind of crass plug because it uses it works with unity in the unreal engines
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:05.240]   So if you're working on what everyone's developing in right you're for ar kit
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:11.160]   They also are doing a web component in there so they'll that will work across ar kit and ar core
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:13.800]   Uh, so if i want to take my website
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.840]   Someone take my iMac out for vr. I can just load up
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:23.720]   I love this and I don't know if this is what this demo is but imagine playing crossy road on the actual street
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.000]   Yeah
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   Front that would be fun. Isn't it kind of interesting that so so many if not most of these ar core demos are outside in natural lighting
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.200]   You're as most of the ar kit demos i've seen have been just like what we're looking at right now
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.120]   Here is a table here is something on the table
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:45.720]   Yeah, or here is even though even the developer demos are here is a hallway here is what's happening inside the hallway, right?
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:49.160]   Well, hey, you know, this is good for ar
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:54.680]   Google and apple is all in all in yeah, right? They just don't go outside much. That's right
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:57:01.240]   Uh, what other rumors are we hearing three gigs of ram that seems not you know, not on sub?
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:05.720]   Oh, here's one. I think that already. Yeah, that's not that that's not anything new
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:10.040]   Uh talking about nothing new this seven s will use the a11 chip
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.640]   That's uh, yep
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.640]   Okay, is that uh, okay
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.560]   Will there be a different chip for the iphone pro?
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:20.200]   I don't think it needs it. I mean, I'm
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:25.000]   Right now portrait mode is the only thing that pegs in a 10 and if apple keeps getting the performance gains it gets
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.720]   Generation over generation with this chip. I'll be hard it'll just be computational photography
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:32.920]   Maybe the ar overhead will benefit but then I think that will just be
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:38.120]   That will just maximize the usage of that chip and everything else will follow it makes sense apple will say hey
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.120]   You're not gonna get a lower performing phone
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:45.400]   No, it's just different hardware capabilities on the pro and the x variants usually just throw extra
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.480]   You know, it's just their bigger dies and throw more
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:53.640]   More resources like more graphics cores at it and I don't think you'd need that so it would be a 11 across all three phones
[00:57:53.640 --> 00:57:56.840]   Yes
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:59.160]   I think that makes sense. I mean they could do a custom chip
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:03.720]   But I think that's a lot of investment for what was gonna be a small a small bat a smaller batch phone
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:12.360]   Will we see iOS 11 on September 12th at the same time? We will right? I mean I'm sure the gold master should be out
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.560]   They should announce the developer gold master for that date. Okay
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.920]   And then available like that friday
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:22.440]   To download they'll push it out to everybody
[00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:28.680]   Is it ready for the iPhone it works fine on the iPad, but is it ready for the iPhone Renee? You've been using on the iPhone, right?
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.200]   Yeah, I mean again
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:34.600]   I'm always hesitant to say it's ready because the next version could be terrible and then I've led you astray
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.600]   But I've been using it to my daily driver for a long time that some of the early ones had battery issues for me
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:42.280]   Or a lot of overhead it felt like and the latest ones have been really good. Yeah
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:46.680]   I'm doing them fast. They're putting about all the time now. I just download one new ones ready
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.800]   Yeah, I feel pretty good about iOS 11
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:55.320]   On my iPad there's maybe one or two applications that don't work right, but almost everything works fine with it
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.640]   And you're starting to see applications. I think update
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:04.120]   Remember we'll see a slew of applications update over the next two weeks as they get ready for iOS 11
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.760]   Uh
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.760]   All right
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:13.320]   Here's a story just passed to me by scooter x
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:20.360]   He says this is the big story of the week you missed the big story the week apple to host star wars themed in store sessions and celebration
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.680]   Of force friday 2
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.000]   Oh, cool. What is force friday 2
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.400]   Force friday is when merchant like I believe it started with the
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.040]   Force awakens when they announce all the new merchandise that's going to come with all the new star wars movies
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.040]   So things like the bb8
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:40.680]   The little bb robot and all the new lego sets and all those things and now they're doing it again
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.920]   But this time they're making it even bigger and more formal event and apple's going to do two things
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.880]   And apple select apple retail stores usually the bigger ones
[00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.520]   Definitely the ones that have today at apple setup already
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:57.000]   They're going to have a coding uh camp where kids can go in or kids of all ages can go in and they can do code for the little bb8 sphiro
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:04.440]   Uh robot that can learn to write sample programs and they're also going to have you do an iMovie workshop where you learn how to make a star wars style movie trailer
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.240]   Uh using iMovie and some stores like the flagship store in union square in san francisco
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.560]   It's going to be like a week-long event and I believe they're having people from the star wars team
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:18.200]   I forget if it's ilm or if it's the bigger star wars team are going to be in doing talks and things
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:22.120]   So it's it's going to be really cool for anyone who lives near one of those apple stores friday
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:28.920]   September 1st through saturday september 9th in the us australia kennedy at mexico time one uk france belgerm germany netherlands ua
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:32.120]   spain hong kong italy switzerland in sweden
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:40.760]   Nice by the by the way, uh if you're if you're in san francisco, um, I just looked at what they were they were showing there and um
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.160]   I know some of the guys that are going to be talking here
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:47.960]   You definitely want to go if you're in san francisco go to that go early make sure you get a seat
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.680]   Um, you know, I I worked with koli works for instance
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:56.040]   He's probably the most amazing painter on like he literally can build things that you can frame and put on your wall
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.440]   With his finger on his iphone
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.680]   And uh, so you know it hit you just want to see what he can do
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.840]   They will also though it's worth it using ar kit put star wars characters in those stores
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.760]   That's great. So you'll be able to meet ray or chubaka
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.320]   Admiral acbar apparently would be there use your crop
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:18.760]   and
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.760]   draft
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.640]   In uh ogmana reality and you can get your picture taken with him or something. I don't know
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.680]   It's this is like pokemon ghost style ar
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:32.360]   No substitute for a real flesh and blood cosplayer
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.640]   cosplayers out of business out of business
[01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.280]   business
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.240]   Uh, apple store and a bunch of other stores are gonna have ar down where you hold up ar and they'll have like ar characters
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:46.200]   In the stores with you. I think that's fun. I'm trying that is
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.200]   Sure. Yeah, really. Yeah
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.200]   New York times
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.800]   I feel like this might be something rene will debunk for us
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:55.720]   New York times
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:56.840]   Uh dyesuke
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:03.240]   Waka bi ashi wrote an article a week ago apple scales back its ambitions for a self-driving car
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.280]   they apparently
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.640]   Are uh, they're their new test vehicle is the is the in on campus apple shuttle
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.400]   Which I mean like so what when I read this I was like, oh god
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:21.160]   Can you imagine if we had these kinds of stories when apple was working on the iphone and be like apple has mysterious new purple project
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:29.400]   Building on lockdown smells like pizza apples tablet ambition scuttled apple now shrinking down to the phone market apple phone scale
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.600]   Like it's just like apple working on rocker too. I mean it's like
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:36.680]   All of it is sort of like you get a few leaks and then you try to piece them together
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.680]   But the puzzle looks like a picasso
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:44.200]   Right instead of a portrait. Right. Um as far as I know there was always talk of apple shuttles because part of this was autonomy
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.640]   And that was say, you know
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:53.400]   Saving resources and it's a logical. I mean if us bloggers can think of apple putting it in the shuttles apple has thought about that before we even learned about it
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:57.000]   Um, but it's mostly a radical part tree like the party got right and I think
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.680]   Other people have reported it previously is that they were they were working on the whole thing and now they're focusing on the
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:08.360]   Core technologies and the one thing that's so cool about that is many of these core technologies are more widely applicable
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.360]   For example, if you're ingesting vast amounts of data and trying to figure out that's a tree
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.240]   That's a wall that's just rain you can go through that
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:19.560]   All of that computer vision and image awareness technology applies to the photos app
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:24.520]   And a lot of the other technology it uses for example identifying planes and spaces applies to the AR and stuff
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.880]   So a bunch of the technology coming out of this is still super useful
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:33.880]   It's just this is a long simmering project that is probably going to change forms multiple times before we get to whatever finish thing
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:37.480]   Apple releases, which is kind of what most of the or at least many of their projects
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:43.000]   They could have picked a better acronym for it though pale. That's not I mean they're like that's an out
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.280]   I mean they're they're going to apple park now. They're not going to turn it loops
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:51.000]   I don't know how old short for Palo Alto to infinite loop. All right. Well, they have to have apple park. So it's pale app
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.040]   Yeah, now it's park or something park pack
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:57.320]   Pap
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:00.600]   I mean it's super smart super good technology and I I um
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.760]   I don't know other words. I am disappointed that a lot of the original ambitions didn't come through because
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:10.360]   I think what they were working on could have been the next next for apple and apple will eventually need a next next like
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.520]   Eventually you get you you just run out of runway whenever your current platform is and you need a next platform
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:19.640]   No pun intended, but you need you need something new a whole new technology to carry you in the next decade
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.560]   And I think that might have spun out of titan
[01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:26.520]   But you know that there's eight or nine of apple's special projects division has a bunch of stuff going on
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.400]   It's not it's not a one trick pony to me the more interesting
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:35.560]   Parts of the article were down at the bottom where they they quoted five people familiar with apple self driving
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.440]   car projects saying that the issue really was
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.800]   uh
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.240]   Disagreement about whether apple should develop a fully autonomous vehicle
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:49.640]   Or a semi-autonomous car that could drive for stretches and allow the driver to retake control kind of like a maybe a tesla
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:54.680]   Steve zadeski who was originally in charge of titan wanted the semi-autonomous
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.160]   option, but johnny ive
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.960]   Thought that a fully driverless car
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:04.520]   Uh needed to be the future and the disagreement was one of the things
[01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:07.160]   um
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:12.520]   One of the things is really complicated is really thinking about whether you see car ownership in the future
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:18.360]   You know like so if you want semi-autonomous, that's really voting for people are going to own cars and they're going to drive them around
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.760]   And then they're going to do stuff a fully autonomous
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.920]   Really is a future that is um a car comes and picks me up. I don't need to own it
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:28.600]   I you know it's what johnny was going for johnny said why are we doing this half-assed?
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.800]   Semi-autonomous right we anybody could do that gm's going to do that ford's going to do that
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:39.080]   They're already doing a nissan's was a huge question too like a lot of these discussions exact same discussions
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:44.520]   We have are held inside apple another one is is it a hybrid or is it a full electric car because if you want to sell at scale
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:48.440]   Which is where a lot of the money is you you just can't make that many electric cars yet
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:52.120]   But if you want to do something that's really transformative then electric is absolutely the way to go
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.800]   And you stack enough of these big decisions and when you're apple releasing a
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:00.600]   Amazing your product there a lot of big decisions to make and you have a whole slew of different people's opinions
[01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:03.560]   Well, but and I think there's I still think getting back to the you know
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.840]   I think that the the question really is whether people are going to want to own their own cars
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:12.680]   I mean, I think people don't really want to uh, you know a lot of people not necessarily our age but younger
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:17.320]   May uh, they're not interested in getting their driver's licenses. They're not interested
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:22.200]   You know that a car is more of a hindrance for them to be able to they now have to get off their phone and
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.920]   And they have to you know, the phone that they spent $1300 on or whatever
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:31.160]   And um, you know, they're not that interested in cars and I think that I think what we're really looking at in a fully autonomous world is
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:36.200]   Cars being convenient and taking us where we need to go and not really thinking about us actually
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:42.840]   You know owning that car that that comes by especially if it gets cheap enough that you know, it doesn't it's cheaper to just have the car take us
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:44.040]   Where we need to go?
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:50.760]   Let's take a break. That's where we need to go right now, but we'll come back with more discussion Andy and ico don't hold that thought hold that thought my friend
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:56.440]   Renee richy also here for my more calm. I'm helping Andy hold he's holding the thought too
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:00.360]   And the Alex Lindsay. He's just holding his head
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:07.800]   Trying to keep thought in there. I got something for you a good night's sleep. It'll make you all feel so much better
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.880]   I have a great night's sleep and I think I can definitely thank my castor, you know
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.800]   It the the challenge with a great mattress is getting it soft enough
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:20.040]   So that your uh your knobby parts can sink into it
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:25.400]   But firm enough so that you've got support and your back feels good in the morning and all that and I don't know how they've done it
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:30.680]   But castor has with it. I guess obsessive engineering plus it's breathable. It's cool
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.000]   And you know I love about the castor
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.800]   It you get it out of the box comes in a surprisingly small box by the way, which is very convenient
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:41.720]   It doesn't smell you don't have to air it out. I I had mattresses in the past
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.520]   That for weeks they kind of smell like rubber not the castor. I don't know what they're doing
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:53.480]   Well, they do fortunately long lasting comfort and support and by the way completely risk-free because

[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.360]   Back to mac break weekly and he held his thought
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:24.040]   Did it did it survive or did it melt in your hands?
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:27.320]   No, it just started looking a lot more silly the more I thought about it
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:33.160]   No, no, they uh, I'll I'll I'll I'm saying that there's a yeah, it's it's no
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:41.320]   It's it's uh, no surprise at apples sticking with autonomous vehicles because transportation is there's such a huge revolution coming even
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:43.800]   uh, when you talk to
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:49.800]   Government transportation people people who are designing cities architects
[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.080]   They're all thinking about the idea of if we can get rid of more cars
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:59.240]   Then we can solve so many problems when I mean we're not talking about like hippie crunchy. Oh the planet the planet
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.120]   We're talking about how do we get more people into this area?
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.960]   How do we provide services to this area?
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:09.720]   And there's a lot of motivation to get that we get that done also as Alex said there's a shift in
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:16.840]   People's attitudes towards car ownership where it's no longer kind of the symbol of oh, I'm I'm free
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:21.960]   I'm an individual. I'm 16 years old and I have a car. That's kind of been detached
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:27.000]   Uh, so the but the big problem is that it's still there's still a huge regulatory
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.160]   uh
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:33.160]   Tarball that uh has to it has to be you know processed and unpacked
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:35.400]   Uh, it's going to really takes
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.880]   Government of vision to simply say here are federal guidelines for autonomous vehicles
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:46.120]   Here is here's how we need to now build streets and build street signs so that they can be processed by autonomous vehicles
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:51.560]   We also have to get the insurance agencies in line. Uh, there's a huge the thing the thing is
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:53.720]   I've had it said that
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:55.720]   95 of the problem of
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.160]   creating
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:00.760]   Safe and functional autonomous vehicles involves solving the
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:08.120]   Last two percent of the technical problems and then you've got a problem of regulatory problems that are about a thousand times more
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:15.240]   More relevant than that. So and so and apple really should be pursuing this because it's going to be like imagine
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.480]   150 200 years ago
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:23.320]   Imagine the late 1800s the idea of electricity that at some point every single town is going to be reconfigured
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:29.720]   Based on the idea that we're going to have electricity going places and imagine 50 or 60 or 70 years ago the federal highway system
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:36.200]   That imagined that now it's going to be practical for people to live 30 or 40 miles away from work because of cars and highways
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:41.320]   That's what these changes the transportation infrastructure are going to have and so apple is very very wise
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.800]   So try to get their their hand in that till
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:51.320]   apple is also uh getting data centers closer to where you want to be they've announced a big data center
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.960]   in walkie
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.000]   Right. W a u k e e iowa
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.840]   Uh, they're going to build a 1.375 billion dollar data center
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:08.200]   The city of walkie has agreed to tax property tax rebates of
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.240]   188.2 million dollars over 20 years
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:15.080]   They still will pay you know that doesn't mean they're not going to pay property tax
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:19.720]   So just pay 71 less and you know if you're a small town and walkie's a fairly small town
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.320]   Getting
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:24.600]   You know that 29 percent property tax is much
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:31.800]   Is very very valuable. So they're going to be very happy. I'm sure to get that they'll also get tax credits from uh,
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.440]   iowa for creating jobs
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.560]   19.65 million investment tax credit
[01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:40.280]   uh for creating 50 jobs although
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:47.240]   apple said the project will generate more than 550 jobs and construction and operations that didn't specify how they break down though
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.120]   I imagine far more construction jobs and op jobs. How many
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:55.960]   Ops do you need in a data center after all apple will also contribute and I love this
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.440]   100 million dollars towards a public improvement fund for the city of walkie
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:05.080]   Uh, including a youth sports complex. They're going to build that will be open
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.440]   To all so when it sounds like a win all around
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:11.960]   Tim cook uh in demoyne for this
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:16.840]   Announcement and that he there he is with the governor of uh, iowa
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:20.520]   So it was a great interview that went along with I don't know who was this one
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:26.120]   I think it was actually the next one, uh, the next city that he visited where he said that as governments around the world stopped you
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:31.880]   I forget the exact they're dysfunctional become dysfunctional. Yeah become dysfunctional. It's up to people
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.760]   It's up to uh companies like apple and other organizations sort of pick up the slack and continue
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:43.640]   Continue us down his favorite golden path. I thought that was very interesting cook was of course on the advisory council that uh,
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:48.040]   Trump disbanded right I thought he was so that so that that was that was really weird
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:52.360]   So there was he was never on that council. He said that he was too busy to join the council
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.360]   He did go to the meetings, but then someone else said that no one was actually ever on the council
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:00.440]   They all just went to meetings. So sounds like it was something very confusing. Yeah, what a surprise
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:05.880]   Uh, and anyway, it's gone now, uh after a number of very high profile resignations
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:09.880]   So cook who probably would have resigned if he could never was on it
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:16.280]   I said I never joined so I can't resign. Yeah. Yeah darn it. Why didn't they uh, yeah? All right, uh, yeah
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.720]   I thought that was a really interesting statement. Um, it kind of
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:25.880]   You know in a very gentile way because tim tim is is a gentleman if first and foremost
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:31.400]   implying that as as worldwide governments become more dysfunctional
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:36.120]   I think it he's probably talking about certain specific
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.760]   uh governments uh
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:45.720]   Apple and others need to take up the slack. I don't think anybody would argue especially tim cook that uh giant
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:49.080]   multinational corporations should start running the world
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.840]   But I think that I do I do think that there's going to be a point in time where we start making we start
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:57.480]   Thinking about the the role of the nation state
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:01.560]   Uh, you know because the nation states in general are continuing to lose
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:06.280]   Influence over over what's actually happening. This is his quote
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.680]   The reality is that government for a long period of time has for whatever set of reasons
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:15.720]   Become less functional and isn't working at the speed it once was now
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:19.560]   I'm not sure I'd agree with him. I think it was intentionally designed at least in the us not to run
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:25.320]   At high speed for very good reasons. Anyway, and so it does fall I think not just on business
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:28.360]   But on other areas of society to step up
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.800]   I'll tell you know
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:36.200]   I've been thinking about this a lot lately and I've been reading I think I mentioned it before a fabulous book
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:43.240]   Uh called sapiens and if you get a chance go to the bookstore. You have a bookstore in town
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:44.360]   Oh, I'm sorry
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.680]   Well, if you get a chance go to the library and just thumb to chapter six
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:53.320]   Because in it he talks about the fact that really all governments
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:58.520]   All corporations. Yeah, this is it by uh, you've all know our harari
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:04.360]   All governments all corporations are imaginary. They're a ca a social contract
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.640]   They're not they don't exist in reality. They exist because we agree that they exist
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.240]   and uh corporations much like governments, but they have different
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:21.240]   Reasons for existing in different ways of continuing on he says there's a certain amount of mythology that you have to create around a government
[01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:27.240]   For people to risk their lives to defend it for people to do things that aren't in their personal interest
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.800]   Uh to support it
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.000]   And I don't think a company necessarily has those same mythology
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.840]   So I don't know if a company could just step up and say hey, we'll take it from here
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.840]   It's not merely about governance
[01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:44.280]   It's about the consent of the governed about the willingness of the governed to buy into those mythologies
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:48.520]   We have a wonderful powerful mythology in the united states about you know
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.440]   liberty and
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:55.880]   Freedom and self rule and all of that and then I don't think a company can really replace
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:01.800]   So i'm the argument that they would give everyone an iphone and a basic income and then the technocrats would do whatever they want
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:05.640]   Well, we plug into the AR kit and forget about our that's wall right?
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:09.880]   Well, we're all floating around in our little chairs with our visors and our slurpies and well
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.720]   Suckaberg and at all do what they will with the planet. Yeah, I don't think it works that way
[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:16.920]   Uh, I think you need these mythologies. Of course, we've seen you know, I mean
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:23.960]   Mythologies tumble and and once the governed don't all buy into the same mythology
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:28.280]   Um things can become a little hairy, but it doesn't mean we're all going to go to uh
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.720]   Apple and say please or mark Zuckerberg, please
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.800]   Fix this give us our social graph and let us know
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:41.080]   I don't think that the I don't think that anyone needs them or necessarily wants to change the infrastructure
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:46.280]   I think the the infrastructure underlying it could is eroding. I think that we can see that it's eroding
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:51.800]   I mean, we're we're we're thinking more and more about what corporations are doing in less and less about what governments are doing because
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:57.880]   The corporations are more agile. They're able to move much faster and the governments are you know tied up in all of this
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.160]   But they move much faster in the interests of the corporation
[01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.120]   Right, but I think that yeah, no, I agree
[01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:07.080]   But I think that the question I'm not saying that people are agreeing with it
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:12.360]   I'm not saying that we're gonna change it what I'm saying is is that I think what the reality is is that the corporations are paying a lot more
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:17.960]   They have a lot more influence. Um and you know, people aren't really can you convince an 18 year out to to
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.600]   give his give his life
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.080]   To get to keep the apple way of life
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:27.080]   I don't think you know six colors leo they've lead in six color
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:34.040]   Uh, it's interesting. We did also learn that tim cook has a very unusual breakfast to style two scrambled egg whites
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:40.120]   Crispy bacon. They didn't have his preferred turkey bacon sugar-free cereal with unsweetened almond milk
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:46.440]   Very califl- there's no if there was avocado have been very califlian. That's what he needs. That's what's missing
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:52.920]   Yeah, he was at the lbj presidential library said one of the things that hits you is that all of the major acts the legislation that happened
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.840]   Just during his presidency his eyes widened as he listed some and by the way
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:19:03.160]   Lbj only was president for six years. You have the civil rights act the voting act. You have medicare you have medicaid
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:08.120]   You have several national parks. You have head start you have housing discrimination or anti discrimination
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:13.480]   You have jury anti discrimination regardless of your politics. You look at it and say my gosh
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:18.840]   My gosh says my gosh
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.920]   Uh, he was vocal and criticizing trump after charlotte's ville
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:27.720]   Uh, but he has been kind of a little bit more careful
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.920]   Uh in his public statements as he tours the country. What is mr. Cook up to? I mean, isn't that what uh,
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:36.760]   Mark Zuckerberg's doing touring the country. They ask him that at the very end
[01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:40.760]   Is he oh, let's see what the quote is here. Do you want to be president?
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:45.160]   Uh, he says I have a full-time job. I appreciate the compliment
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:48.440]   He's added with a rye look if it is a compliment
[01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:50.440]   [Laughing]
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:57.560]   Well, I I think I refer
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:03.080]   I think it all comes down to the amount of power that a company like apple and google and facebook wield they are now
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:09.240]   They they provide so much of the social infrastructure at this point so much that we absolutely rely on that we
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:16.200]   I think that it's a good idea to keep ahead of the ball that way to make sure that the
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:21.240]   People that are create the message that the people who are running this company are aware of their importance
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:26.360]   They are aware that they're not just selling products and services that they if they were to magically go away
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:31.000]   If they were to be raptured tomorrow leaving behind a whole bunch of really expensive black
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:37.560]   Moktorl neck t-shirts lying on the ground empty that a lot of society would just simply collapse for lack of infrastructure
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.760]   So whether they like it or not they do have these roles to play
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:47.480]   Yeah, and so this is so there is going to be a political part of their job that that no longer is just limited to
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:52.680]   Making sure that they they get tax credits for building a certain plant certain places
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:58.200]   No one no one sits in Tim Cook's chair without understanding the kind of responsibility
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:02.520]   That apple has to the society to the larger world
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:04.760]   It's a very it's a very dangerous place
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.760]   I mean there are governments all over the world that are
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:13.720]   Trying to co-op companies like apple and google and facebook into being an extension of their local police force and into the
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.960]   Their local surveillance state
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:21.960]   And not not to the not even to the extent that that america does it but basically say that well if someone is using a phone inside our country
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.400]   There are citizens. We have the right to take a look at whatever information they're transacting
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:30.840]   And it's if these companies are going to have to be able to take a stand that no we don't stand for that
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:33.160]   We're not going to let you do that. We're going to be remain
[01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:38.920]   Above geopolitics to that extent where you know you just can't we we will not simply
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:46.440]   In the face of trying to sell billions of phones or billions of computers make sure that we're keeping billions of people underneath your heel
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:50.680]   Well, another thing to remember is that apple is i think one of the few
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:57.080]   Personal technology companies that is in the u.s. It's apple. It's del it's hp
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:00.920]   And then the rest are in asia
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:04.360]   Or korea on korea japan china taiwan
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:10.360]   So apple del hp they have a they have a maybe a heavier burden
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:16.280]   Because they're still in the u.s. Even although all their assembly is done out of apple is doing products
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:22.040]   But they're also doing the services that a google would do like they're providing email and messaging and and all the stuff that people get the intelligence
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.880]   Or at least the data they want to from whereas i think del is more transacting hardware
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:33.320]   Credit by the way to andrew russ sorkin and deal book and the new york times for that interview and the and quote good article apples
[01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:39.000]   Two breakfast description and breakfast. Thank you air andrew for paying i must call him erin sorkin and q andrew
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.440]   For paying attention is he in relation to andrew erin sorkin i wonder
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.080]   Oh, i think his pros would be a little different
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:47.960]   Breakfast all the way to the floor
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.240]   Much like himself
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:56.840]   It's a really it's i have to say though. It's a nicely done article and the quotes are great and uh
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.880]   It's it's quite well done
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.280]   Circuit is really good. This this circuit is really good. Yeah, it does a great job at deal book
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.920]   And i do think that that we're seeing more
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:11.320]   I think apple's definitely doing this i think a lot of these folks are seeing that that they have to
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:17.080]   Play to the public, you know, you know, that's not just them running their running their corporation or having little meetings with the president
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.240]   Or all those things that that the government's going to make a bunch of decisions and and that
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:28.280]   They learned that after sand with the san vernito case, right? Yeah. Yeah, and and i think that that um this ongoing
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:33.160]   You know, i think we're going to see more and more of this from all the technology companies of outreach of making a difference of doing
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:37.400]   All these things because that helps build that so that when they need to turn people to
[01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:41.240]   You know stop the government from doing xy and z or we're not going to do that
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.520]   You know, that's not something that you that you can turn on in a week
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:50.520]   You might need it in a week how you turn that on is over years of service and years of investment and years of
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:58.280]   Of you know working with communities you build those routes that can be used, you know when when needed to you know slow things down
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:03.720]   And they also just as part of this they enabled get once again they enabled
[01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:07.480]   Relief gifts through itunes for the hurricane
[01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:11.400]   An apple contributed to million i believe to the relief efforts as well. So he's trying to
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:16.760]   Make the most of that might for right right on policy and i think and i think that for for tim cook
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.560]   I think this is way more than just some calculation. I mean he just really you know, this is something that he believes
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.360]   Steve wouldn't do it now, but tim cook immediately
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.720]   Well, steve was very different steve would do it, but he would never let anybody talk about it
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.880]   And i think the quote was i don't believe in pimping our karma like he did he thought it was utterly displease
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:37.720]   So that's interesting because i always got the impression that they that steve did not believe in giving a charity you're saying he did
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.760]   But he would not talk about it. Yeah, he did not believe in talking about it
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:46.040]   Which tim tim believes that you can inspire others by your actions both i think reasonable points of view
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.920]   Um
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:53.000]   What what is the quote from the bible don't let the left hand know what the right hand is doing? Yeah
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.400]   Congratulations to apple their very first ai research paper
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:08.680]   Garned them a prestigious machine learning award best paper at the 2017 conference on computer vision and pattern recognition
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:10.680]   This is according to
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:14.680]   apple insider one of the most sought after prizes
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:22.280]   In the ai field the paper was titled learning from simulated and unsupervised images through adversarial training
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:25.320]   Mm-hmm
[01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:28.440]   Hot dog not hot dog not hot are you sure that's not a hot dog?
[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:34.600]   Okay, yeah, not hot dog. Okay. Go 2,680 submissions 2,620 reviewed
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:42.440]   Delegates whittled the number down to 783 presentations granting long oral presentations to 71 entrance
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:46.120]   apple submission ultimately made its way to the top of the pile
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:50.040]   And impressive feat considering it was the company's inaugural
[01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:52.920]   shelling
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:59.240]   It's it's part of having those people employed at apple. They want to publish they want to win or absolutely that's great
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:07.400]   Also, this is it's it's amazing how much collaboration there's going on between companies on ai because this is absolutely brand new stuff
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:13.160]   They don't they're I don't I've never met a researcher who really believes that the computers will take over the world
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:17.080]   If we let them go too far, but there's but there's a lot of x factor going on
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.680]   And what's the gonna be the best practices?
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:25.960]   And so it's like it really is like you're working on nitro glycerin and everybody in every lab is competing with everybody else
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:28.520]   But everybody wants to make sure they don't blow themselves up
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.520]   And so they're sharing a lot of information and a lot of thought
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:34.760]   So another
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:42.120]   Tim cook revelation 30 us community college systems will start to offer apples app development with swift curriculum
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.840]   in the 2017 2018
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:48.040]   Year
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.040]   Good news
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.040]   This is curriculum developed by apple
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:55.480]   By the way capital
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.960]   Factory you stole my logo
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.600]   I
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.720]   Screen of I don't own the gear, but that sure looks a lot like mine. It's a incubator
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:12.120]   And some high schools boy if you were a high schooler and you got to do that that would be pretty cool
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:15.320]   Another example of using your resources to push
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:18.600]   I mean it does push apples agenda because it's swift it's not something like JavaScript
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:23.000]   But it does mean that all these kids now have access to one of the biggest app platforms in the world
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.720]   Well, I think you could probably get it in the iBook store too, right? You don't have to be doing it through a school
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:29.720]   Yeah
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:36.680]   Yeah, it's there and and what's interesting is that um, this is what that they I don't think they did very well with uh iBooks
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:39.400]   You know, there wasn't a huge investment after they released it
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:43.080]   To show people what they could do to develop more of that of that process
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.920]   And then what they're really doing is they now have done they made a big investment and they are
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:53.080]   Investing the resources that necessary to make it actually successful. Um, I think it's it's huge
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:57.560]   Curriculum is meant to guide people with no programming experience
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:00.760]   toward the goal of building a fully functional app
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:04.120]   in swift
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:09.720]   Be a good language to learn. I think that I think I wonder if anybody is uh is doing this
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.680]   um
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.880]   And if you are let us know how it's going is it is it good
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.600]   Is it I'll have to try it
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.320]   Search for if you go to the iBook store
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:27.080]   I think you search for app development with swift. I think is the the keyword to look for
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:32.760]   Anybody doing that in the chat room any of you?
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.520]   I got the apple
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:39.800]   Will apple talk more about home pod on april on september 12?
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:43.080]   I think they have to because they've only shown off the apple music component
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.200]   They haven't shown off any of the syrianegration. I mean they didn't show it off publicly at least
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:49.080]   The technology itself was was there, but they didn't show it off
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:52.040]   And I think that's the story that they'll they'll want to tell at this event
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.400]   Just to remind people that it's still coming and the capability is what I'll be able to do
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:00.680]   Yeah, they they have to they were kind of obligated to do a live fire exercise with this for the first time
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:06.600]   Uh because now's the time where people start actually allocating money for things they might want to buy at the end of the year
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.720]   Uh, and so they were kind of free to just sort of give a little quick demo during wwbc
[01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:17.720]   But now now they're kind of expecting people to make sure there's 350 bucks on the on the mastercard available
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.440]   Uh, over sometime around uh, in november
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:27.560]   It's gonna be jam packed
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.880]   jam packed it is
[01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:35.480]   Yeah, another another another vote for how much prep they're gonna have to do for this next uh event
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:42.280]   Because it's okay to have a handful of people into a living room environment, but they're gonna have to give kind of wide
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:47.400]   Demonstrations, I think or have it's it's they'll miss an opportunity if they don't let
[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:53.560]   Anybody who wants to give that device a listen to a good listen to under a
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:57.400]   Under an incredible environment. I I feel I mentioned it might be there
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:02.840]   I'm I'd be surprised that they spent I mean they have so many products that they're probably they're most likely going to talk about whether it's apple tv with
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:07.400]   Um the watch the phone those are things that that seem like they're uh, very close
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.560]   I I could imagine them nodding to the to the the pod and the and the iMac pro
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:16.360]   But you know that that's an odd situation we're in because apple usually doesn't tell us anything about anything
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.600]   You know way off in the in the distance and so
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:23.720]   Uh the doer do they or don't they I mean I I kind of feel like almost we're gonna see a nod to it
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.920]   But you know say well that's coming, you know, and then it's gonna have its own event
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:31.720]   Um and maybe it has an event that shares with the i the iMac pro, you know who knows
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:37.240]   Um, but but I think that that is uh, I'd be surprised if they want to take that much energy away from
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:41.240]   Rolling out the biggest phone they've ever produced, you know to have too many things
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.840]   But it's just very unappled
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:47.240]   I kind I disagree only because the home pod is such
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:52.520]   It's based on a demo. It is it is a lump of nicely sculpted
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:56.120]   Material with a grill on it as a static object
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:59.400]   You can't really get people interested in it unless people see it working
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.800]   And you have a lot of people getting really really excited about it who say that I was there and I listened to it
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.520]   And it sounds amazing and then I gave it voice commands and I was able to say
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:10.200]   Give me that song that I was listening to when I went to that place that time and it actually
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.320]   Played radar love, which was the song I was thinking of I don't know how I did it
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:18.280]   Um, we're asked for the rest with the iMac pro. You can simply say, okay. Here's here's a cutaway view
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:21.960]   Here's how much how many fans we've got in it. Here's all the silicon we've got in there. It's good
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.040]   Um the the iPhone pro for that that's what's going to be
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:31.160]   Also, is another thing that we're going to have to get people holding it and seeing how well it unlocks
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:36.200]   And again giving telling this those tactile stories of what the experience of it is like
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.200]   You can't get people emotionally
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:44.680]   Attached to an iMac you get them interested in how fast it is and how much how much more product productive they can be
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:49.240]   But you can only sell an iPhone 8 by getting people emotional about it home pod
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:52.520]   I think this people will be happy with it whether they're emotional about it or not
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:56.280]   But it's going to be an emotional buying choice. They will imagine themselves having this
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:02.360]   Amazing piece of audio technology unlike anything that's ever been done before and being able to communicate with it and control it
[01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:07.400]   In a way that is so futuristic and 21st century that I can barely contain my lunch about it
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:12.280]   And that's the sort of stories that they want to generate by inviting people to this event in september
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:18.920]   So again, I'd be really surprised we didn't see a much more broad life fire exercise with home pod and a lot more people
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:24.840]   That can come away from that and write about it and podcast about it and tell people about what it was like to actually be using that thing
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:28.520]   They also just do it right at the beginning the way they've done apple watch in the past and just say
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.440]   You know back in june we showed you the apple
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:33.560]   They home pod and right now we're going to give you a quick demo of serie
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:38.280]   Moving right along to the iphone or the apple tv or whatever is next on their agenda. Will there be big
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:41.320]   Progress in serie as part of this
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:44.680]   There is already an iOS 11
[01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:48.920]   It does a lot more things and it's got a new engine and all that and I think the home pod is going to be very specific
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:54.280]   Though it'll be like apple tv where it's got a purpose built sippy serie sippy for exactly what it's
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:56.120]   Hey sippy
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:02.040]   I uh by the way, I just downloaded the um intro to app development with swift and app development sif
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:06.040]   There's two different books. They're free and uh on the uh itunes store for iBooks
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.240]   Which is nice
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:14.040]   They are designed to work with a mac running os sierra and uh xcode 8 which you could get both of which you can get for free on a
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:17.960]   Late model mac and I love this at the beginning. It says a word of advice
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:22.920]   App development with swift is designed to make swift and iOS development approachable
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:29.000]   But you will get stuck all programmers get stuck learning to program is hard and building apps is hard
[01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.480]   You'll feel discouraged when you can't get something to work right
[01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:37.720]   You'll feel frustrated when you've been stuck for hours in the same problem and you may want to quit when you don't understand something
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:44.360]   But it gets easier it turns into a puzzle you'll experience a rush of adrenaline when you hit the run button your app works
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:48.520]   Especially after you spend hours or days trying to get one little thing to work just right
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:54.840]   You'll smile when you write code that runs perfectly on the first try and you'll celebrate when your first app goes live on the app store
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.240]   I think that is a great introduction to programming one of my favorite codes from pencil gracias
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.240]   That a black belt is simply a white belt to never quit
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:02.840]   uh
[01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:04.360]   Perfect
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.560]   Perfect
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:08.360]   I'm gonna I'm gonna work my way through this. This looks like a lot of fun
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.920]   Very nice
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:13.480]   And uh, it's also got swift playgrounds
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.280]   In here and you can talk you could play with that and that's a really neat technology that helps people
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.560]   I'll learn how to program that is unique. I think to swift
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:28.840]   Former apple and like this karsten you must have found this former apple employee thinks touch bar
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:34.520]   Shouldn't be forced on users who want the highest end mac book. I couldn't agree more
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:37.240]   But that's just the way it is
[01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.600]   Um
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:43.480]   I my screen is now blacked out. This is what this is something chrome has been doing a lot on windows
[01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:45.560]   I don't know what's going on with this
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:48.200]   But uh, so I can't read the article power saver mode
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:50.840]   It's very frustrating
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.840]   Very fast thing with touch bars that you bait
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.480]   I don't want to say you get it for free because obviously there's a display mechanic
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.560]   But once you add the separate processor, uh, the t1 chip for the touch id
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:03.080]   Uh, you're running code anyway, then that needs a display because the
[01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:06.760]   OS 10 does not so mac OS does not run the display for the numbers
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:11.160]   They don't want anyone to be able to hack the numbers and say we're charging you a dollar and then charge you a hundred dollars
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:13.800]   So the t1 chip has to have a display to communicate to it
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:15.800]   So they're gonna put a small display in there anyway
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.720]   and once you do that just
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.360]   Making it a full display and doing extra things do it
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:23.800]   Gives them a better show piece for the whole the whole embed
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:26.200]   We won't go through this all over again
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:32.040]   But I don't think you get it for free because apple does take things away from you to give you that that touch bar so
[01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:38.360]   I just wish I agree with a sentiment that I wish the people had the people who said that this the touch bar offers me
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:43.400]   Nothing that interests me. I think it's a big pain in the butt. I would much rather have a physical escape key that's always there
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:46.920]   Uh, I I think that's a credible thing
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:51.480]   Both cut off the end instead of that dumb black end that doesn't show anything and just put a escape button back
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:57.240]   So I can't read the arc of what he's saying. I still want the fingerprint reader. I just don't want the touch bar
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:01.720]   Yeah, well, and then you need a display for the thing you need to display for the fingers. That's
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:05.720]   That's just creating another skew. I don't understand, you know, that wouldn't make any
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:11.160]   I bought the lower end I replaced my touch bar at mac pro with a lower end admittedly not as fast
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.800]   touch barless macbook pro
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:19.640]   Because I the touch bar just got in the way and I wanted an escape key
[01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:23.640]   I would like I you know, I but I don't think I can live without the fingerprint reader just
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:27.480]   Make put more processor power in the touch barless
[01:36:27.480 --> 01:36:32.520]   Soon we'll have face ID on the mac too leo and then you'll never have to bother that again exactly
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:35.160]   Exactly
[01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.880]   The future fixes everything and just creates new problems as it comes
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.160]   Yeah
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:42.600]   So it is it is another skew, but it's the kind of skew that's not a difficult
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:49.000]   Apple does all the time where you have BTOs with higher end processors more RAM that kind of thing at a touch bar for a hundred bucks
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.680]   Yeah, I guess you could do that
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.720]   Yeah, I guess you could do that
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:37:00.920]   Uh moving along, let's see. I just want to get through all of this
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.680]   Before we get to your picks of the week where you're just around the corner
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.480]   I think we've covered most of the big stories lte watch
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.080]   We'll find out about that in a couple of weeks as well
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:16.520]   Um
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:20.840]   Maybe exciting. I mean preg federiki spoke about as fast as the micromachines guy at wwdc
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:23.000]   One thing after another after another after another
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.200]   I think we'll get the hardware and not exactly the hardware equivalent of that, but it'll still be a stacked event
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.880]   Oh, I know one more story because we've talked a lot about it's not exactly an apple story
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:34.920]   But as the home hub gets cli home pod gets closer
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:39.320]   to reality sonos has got to be a little bit worried they just
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:45.480]   Submitted for fcc approval a new sonos speaker with a array microphone in it
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:50.360]   And of course they pushed out a couple of weeks ago. We talked about it new
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:55.800]   New user agreement new terms of service that would
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:38:02.440]   Change a little bit their privacy agreement in preparation for this I think in an upgrade in the software
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.240]   Do we know what I still think that they'll go with a licensed assistant rather than making their own
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.600]   This implies a lot of work. This implies multiple voice platforms and music services
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:15.880]   Oh, you could choose your own assistant that would choose your own assistant
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:20.440]   Wouldn't that be interesting if you could choose from syria or echo or google assistant or tana or something?
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:25.000]   One of the problems with course with a with a home pod is it'll only support probably only support apple music
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.760]   I want to use say yeah, as far as I mean, I think they'll grow that over time
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:32.120]   You'll be able to say no no you gotta be in the apple ecosystem
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.920]   I mean, I think it'll behoove them too over time add
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:43.080]   Additional features and what we're all waiting for is just the syria kit plug-in for music and and all those things
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:46.120]   And then it really it'll just support anything over the syria kit. Yeah
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:50.280]   Well, we'll anyway fcc approval
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:56.360]   Pending that means you're probably not too far off from an update, but if you had to buy all new sonos speakers
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:01.080]   That's gonna be a non-starter. Not doing it. It's not gonna do it
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:09.320]   When be pregnant this dunk I would hope they would sell a little plug-in that would plug into my speaker that I could use or something like that
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:13.880]   All right. Yeah, the you know, they're all networked. I mean all the sonos are network
[01:39:13.880 --> 01:39:17.560]   So yeah, it doesn't even have to plug in just let you tie into it and echo dot
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:22.920]   Actually, really all they have to do and I guess it's just harder than it seems is to have a skill on the echo
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.080]   for sonos
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.520]   Right. I mean I think that if you're if you're if you're thinking about your sonos as a as a network where you have lots of them
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:34.920]   You know, you have 10 or 15 of them or five of them or whatever. I think you know, I think you're still going to do that
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.920]   I don't think the the current speakers
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:41.880]   Reprise that the ability to do that but I think that as a single where you are
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:44.760]   But if you're but if as a single
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:47.400]   I think the problem they have is that there's no reason to buy a sonos
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:51.400]   Uh, if you're only buying one of them like unless you're gonna buy a bunch of them for rooms
[01:39:51.400 --> 01:39:54.600]   I think that it's it's not a very compelling solution anymore
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:04.280]   Well now amazon echo has added the capability to support echo free multi room audio
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:10.680]   So that's fine, you know, and i'm sure the home pot will do this. I think sonos has got to be at this point
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.960]   Fighting a you know, this is a this is a losing battle
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:18.760]   Yeah, I mean I think that they're they have a better a better opportunity with their connect
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:23.720]   Products then with you know that are connecting to professional stereo systems and so on so forth
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.760]   Then necessarily the I have two of those I have two stereo systems connected to sonos
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:32.200]   I also have a and this might be another area where sonos can survive
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:38.360]   Uh, they also with the sound bar and surrounds subwoofer. They could do home very dude very nice
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:43.800]   Theater audio. They've been very reticent to expand like I would have in an instant right now. I have the this one
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.400]   Oh home theater, but it's still uh just the basic home theater setup
[01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:51.160]   I would have loved for them to go to 7.0 for example or to offer an atmos
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:53.640]   alternative or something but they seem to have been incredibly
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:41:00.200]   Conservative with what they would offer there and hopefully either this pressures them into doing it or someone else comes along and
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:05.880]   Maybe yamaha puts out us a smart speaker that does atmos. Well, yeah, I think everybody's gonna I mean
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:11.640]   Anyway, uh, it's only frustrating for those of us who spent thousands of dollars on sonos
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:14.600]   I we have a support club lio
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:17.160]   I tried the other day. I put a dot on the sonos
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:20.840]   uh through the uh auxiliary jack hoping to add
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.040]   But it won't use stereo. It was one per speaker
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.560]   You can't do this room thing and it forgets it so you have to
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:32.280]   Every once in a while tell the sonos speaker. No, no you get your audio from the jack
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:37.480]   It's not an airplay. So I had an airport express and now I have an apple tv hooked up and I can use that
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:40.440]   But it's just it's not not native. Yep. Oh well
[01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:43.800]   All right, let's take a break and uh move on
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:50.040]   To our picks of the week in just a moment with andi and anaco from the chicago sun times run a richy from i'mor.com
[01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.680]   the pixel cores
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:53.800]   handsome
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.480]   Alex lizzy who got his rapping he got his yearly haircut. It looks like
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:05.400]   Exactly gotta do it once a year once a year came. I wandered up to petaluma. So yeah, we we have we share a hairdresser
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:10.600]   I uh, I actually just I missed my last appointment and I decided i'm just gonna let it all grow out
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:15.320]   I want to look like uh the unibomber. Oh, there you go. Oh, you're gonna say hipster
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:19.800]   Oh, you think i'll have a little I think I would like to have a hair hair
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.040]   A man bun a man or a bun. I think you grow it out. I think you grow it out and you and you braid it
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:26.120]   I think yeah a little a little leo braid
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:31.880]   Don't break. No, no just one big break in the bag like yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah, dothraki would be good too
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:36.200]   Oh, yeah options once you grow your own. I was thinking ponytail, but a man bun sounds awfully
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:43.320]   Go away. Go for a battle on five like mambari up sweep. Oh, yes, fangir. Yeah, I think that's ready to come back
[01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:47.400]   I just bought all about one five on itunes. So i'm really digging in these references this
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.960]   week
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:53.080]   I show today brought to you by
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:55.640]   zip
[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:57.160]   recruiter
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:43:01.080]   I love zip recruiter. I'll tell you what they have solved a fundamental problem
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.400]   We were talking about the difference between governments and companies
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:09.960]   Companies are amazing. It's the same thing there. They're they really don't exist in reality. They're a fiction
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:15.000]   A legal fiction that there's a company, but it's more than that. Steve jobs was very aware of this
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.080]   He said the company is one of the greatest inventions of humankind the idea of
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:26.120]   a bunch of people uniting around a common goal and a hundred people or 25 people or a 10,000 people can
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:33.880]   do something completely different than what one individual can do and ultimately building a company is is an incredible lever
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:38.120]   And and if you're in a company especially if you're a person does the hiring for the company
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:42.280]   You know that intimately because hiring the right person can forward you towards that
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.640]   That goal hiring the wrong person can hold you back
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:50.680]   It's like you're all rowing in a ship and you get one person rowing at a sequence. It's terrible
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:55.400]   So that's why when you're hiring your your it's um, it's like the most important thing
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.120]   The company is made up the people you hire
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:03.480]   So that's where zip recruiter comes in zip recruiter makes it easy to find the right person
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:07.320]   Fast the right person's out there, but how do you know where to go to find them?
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:11.000]   Where do you post jobs to find the most qualified candidates that varies
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.480]   With one click at zip recruiter you can post to 100 plus job sites
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:17.880]   Really improving
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:21.480]   Your chance of hitting the right person then also twitter and facebook
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:26.840]   So your chance of of of the right person seeing that posting goes up exponentially
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.960]   And then I love this
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:35.160]   All those applicants run roll into the zip recruiter interface not to your inbox not to your phone
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:41.080]   And their powerful technology can efficiently match the right people to your job. It does better than anyone else
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.680]   Unlike other job sites zip recruiter doesn't depend on candidates finding you it finds them
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:51.800]   In fact 80 percent of employers who post a job on zip recruiter to get a qualified candidate
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.920]   Through the site within a day within a day

[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:29.240]   So this is not something i've tried myself yet because they have just been announced but uh, whenever there's new home kit kit
[01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:33.720]   So to speak I always love it because it just increases the functionality of what I can do around the house
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:37.960]   And elgato has a bunch of new stuff that they announced today. I believe it's part of the efa
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:44.760]   preamble so they've got the eve thermo, which is a connected radiator valve. We still have radiators
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:45.720]   Why?
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:48.360]   Wow. Oh my god. That's hysterical
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.360]   Radiators are humans too. Really?
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.880]   I mean if you live in an apartment or something where I mean, yeah, of course
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:59.160]   Absolutely total and they have the eve smoke the eve window guard the eve lock and the eve
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:04.760]   aqua, which is a connected irrigation controller and I just love that this stuff is spreading like it's it's going to be everywhere
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:11.400]   Soon. I'll just be able to walk around with my iphone or other guys and just say uh water on lock open
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:18.920]   Radiator 30 degrees and this is the george jetson future that I have been looking forward to for low those many years
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:23.720]   Well, and I love elgato. I use their tv tuners for years and i'm just glad they found another
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:25.160]   uh
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.560]   Avenue to for their great engineering
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:32.120]   Absolutely and they've been all in from the beginning and one of the nice things about it is that they don't use a hub
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:35.800]   I mean, there are some advantages to hubs and that you can just buy the satellite device
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:39.560]   You can swap out a new hub if the technology changes and keep the satellite equipment
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.280]   But it's also one more thing to buy and with elgato all the logic all the encryption all the transmission
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.200]   Is built right into the device and that way you just buy the components you need
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.840]   You don't have to worry about anything being connected to your router or anything else
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.120]   They just all
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:58.040]   Work intelligently and you know, I think that the the radiator valve has to do with the fact that elgato is a german company
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:00.920]   Yes, and these must be but just become more common in
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:02.920]   Das radiator das laity eta
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:10.280]   I just want to know why the sphere is not available in my country the sphere the ava sphere that they have there
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:16.200]   I can get the the flare and I can get the bulb, but the sphere is not available in my country
[01:48:16.200 --> 01:48:18.600]   And there must be some very what does the sphere do?
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.080]   It's a light it's one of their lights. Oh, it's like they're one of the controllable lights
[01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:25.800]   They have three lights and one of them. I was learning the website while you
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:28.120]   Was it a voltage is it a voltage issue?
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:31.560]   No, it just it's not available. It's like
[01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:36.280]   Transforms your home with beautiful dynamic light moods because it available in Canada
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:38.520]   I don't think so. I haven't seen it
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:42.760]   They do have an eve core though. So other companies now can also just get the car to make their own home
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.760]   So this is very much like the hue
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:51.560]   Well, I like the sphere that is avia. I think that's avia. That's not the eve stuff. That's the avia stuff. Yeah
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:54.840]   Look, you can get an egg that glows on your deck
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:49:00.200]   I like it. Oh, I want this you're right. Okay. Now. I agree with you, Alex
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:03.240]   100 bucks
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:07.480]   Oh, man, the sphere is even cheaper. Yeah, it's not available in Canada either
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:12.600]   It pairs with your watch
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:15.800]   Or your phone so you could have your apple watch you could choose to make your
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:20.840]   Oh, I want this they got all spheres and flares
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:27.000]   Well, why are they product not available in your country, but they charge $99 us so I don't get it
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:33.960]   You know, I'm gonna it's available for european sockets. That's why oh type c sock
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:38.360]   Doesn't see you could have a green egg next to your green egg. Oh, yeah
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:42.920]   I love that. Okay, so they haven't made it for our socket yet
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:45.000]   You gotta get there eventually
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.800]   Elgato despite the name there in germany elgato.com. Thank you Renee. Good pick
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:51.640]   So
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.640]   Andy and aco pick of the week
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:50:01.880]   Uh, this might be an old one, but someone uh friend just gave me a copy of iconic a photographic tribute to apple innovation
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:06.760]   Oh, that's such a pretty book. Yeah, it's an amazing it's an amazing coffee table book
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:10.360]   Uh apple of course came out with their own like self tribute book
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:15.080]   But it this one remembers that there was the time before steve came back to apple
[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:20.280]   So it covers all of the cool apple design even like you know apple to game controllers
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.880]   Like every it's all the frog design stuff
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:27.720]   Uh the challenges of even making i'm sure i wouldn't find it
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:34.760]   But even like a of the apple file server, which is of course the ultimate in just plain gray boxes
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.880]   But you have to yeah, I think they're like the quadra 950. You know again you have really really
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:45.560]   uh utilitarian max that have to look good too and it really is the sort of thing where
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.120]   Uh every single page is beautifully photographed
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:52.440]   There are quotes from johnny. I have another people who are involved in apple design
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:57.720]   Throughout that are relevant and informative. Uh, there are a lot of stuff that they uh,
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:03.800]   Product they have a lot of stuff that they didn't actually wind up making as well. Uh, you can see
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:05.400]   I
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:10.920]   Remember when like everybody had you had to make at least one version of your machine
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:14.040]   In like clear acrylic for demonstration purposes
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:19.160]   And you would beg and borrow to see who has one of these and how you can get them for yourself
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:25.400]   Uh, it's just an amazing book and it's it's it's really just another hour of your life
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:30.200]   sped just sitting or standing right there at the door because you took it out of the amazon box and
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:33.560]   You just wanted to glance through it and it's an hour later. You're still looking through it
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:35.640]   It's available in a whole bunch of different editions
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:40.760]   The cheapest one is like something like $50 which for a book as beautiful as this
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.400]   Is just not doesn't seem like a lot of money
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:46.360]   Uh, but then you can spend a little more and get the slipcase edition
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:51.880]   Uh, or you can even get the one that is housed in special table top slipcase
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:54.360]   That looks like an apple too
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:58.280]   That's hysterical. Yeah, that is so that's terrible
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:03.000]   That's the special edition very special edition very special
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.800]   Yeah, wow, and I think I think it makes a hell of a gift against it's not it's not a lot of money
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:09.880]   But oh boy the amount of impact
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:15.800]   That that it creates by just being for anybody who has been a fan of apple anybody who's been an apple user for a long long time
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:19.560]   Uh, it's not just nostalgia. It's just appreciating the beauty of design
[01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:22.840]   Uh, apple designers have come and gone
[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:26.840]   Perp me up before johnny. I came and came to prominence
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:31.800]   But the commitment to design was always there and you can definitely see that throughout this entire book. So
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:37.400]   They also have an edition that looks like it's got a glowing on off switch
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:46.680]   That's hysterical. You know, Alex gumple who is a not a he's a windows user, but he's a collector of vintage max
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:50.600]   He has a copy of this. So i've actually seen this book. It's beautiful. Yeah, it's really cool
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:56.040]   Iconic and you could find it at iconic book. Oh look in Alex's
[01:52:56.040 --> 01:53:01.240]   Is this is a different one? He says I have a post it note that says this is good too
[01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:07.000]   This is new. I haven't seen is this new? This is from uh harkton with ecelynger the founder of frog design
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.360]   Keep it simple the early design years of apple
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:14.760]   Um, Alex collects all this stuff Alex gumple. Oh, this is nice
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:17.640]   Look at that
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.000]   Wow
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.760]   I missed the frog design design language. I thought that was really really pretty. Yeah, they just some interesting stuff
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:28.440]   They were Lisa era designers
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:31.800]   uh Alex wenzi your pick of the week
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:38.520]   So I have been uh, I got a one of those little mavics the mavic pro to fly about
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:44.600]   It's probably one of the easier ones to do. I'm not recommend. I'm recommending the mavic pro, but that's not my recommendation
[01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:47.080]   I'll do something a little less
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:52.920]   Less expensive. Um the the mavic pro is great. Uh, and the dji products in general are pretty pretty fun
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:58.360]   One of the one of the one of the avoc there was a thousand bucks. That's uh, that's too much for me. Yeah
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:01.000]   Yeah, yeah, but it's it
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.320]   It's kind of a nice mix of it's not it's not as expensive some of the other
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:11.080]   drones we have right, uh, so and it's also super compact you can carry it around um and uh
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:15.480]   But what i've been using with it if you have already have a drone if you're and you're listening
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:22.920]   Is this thing called drone deploy and and branch nah on our team recommended it to me and uh, so drone deploy what it does is you take
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:27.160]   You literally draw a little and this is just more of like take a look at it
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:35.240]   And look at the technology now, uh, but you literally go to a google map essentially and you draw an outline of I want to map this area
[01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:40.280]   Um, I want a 2d map and I want a 3d a 3d map of it, uh, you know 3d
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:46.680]   You know and and you hit go and it literally just goes up and the the it takes over the drone the drone just goes
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:49.720]   Oh, that's what I'm exact exact exact exact exact exact exact
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:55.240]   It just and it builds the whole grid you say I want overlap of 65 or I want overlap of this much
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.400]   And it figures it all out of what it needs to do to do that and it'll tell you oh you need two batteries for this
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:02.280]   So it'll go out and it'll go halfway it'll go halfway done
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:07.400]   And then it comes back and it lands you swap the battery and then you start it up again and takes off again and goes
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:09.480]   That starts where it left off and just keeps on going
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:13.880]   And uh and taking the photos and and then if that wasn't good enough
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:18.520]   You take all those photos and you uh, you just upload them to their website
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:24.760]   And you get back a stitched photo of your of your area and a little 3d, you know, little 3d model of the area
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:28.520]   It's extruded it all out and you know popped it all up and I was um
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:33.720]   Playing in my family's golf course and I'm trying to map that place for 15 years and I finally, you know
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:37.560]   It was 15, you know, it took 25 minutes for do it and then I uploaded it
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:41.320]   I came back six hours later and it was cooked, you know, and there it was, you know
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:46.760]   And so uh if you already have a dji drone it integrates with it very well and it's just a lot of fun
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:51.720]   Uh, and and it shows you the technology of where it's going where you're you know a lot of these apps
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:56.520]   What's incredible is is just being able to control these drones without you're not flying it around which is fun
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.520]   Um, but you're literally saying I need this this this and this and you can even have it
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:06.120]   It'll do this thing where you it'll map the whole thing and then around the center. It'll do this big circle kind of at an angle
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.760]   Um, so you kind of get all the extra kind of side information as well and and watching the drone
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:13.320]   Kind of do all that work on its own is
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:17.240]   Something very filling about that. I don't know what it is. What do you think is this spark?
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:21.560]   So I don't I almost bought a spark. I almost bought a spark
[01:56:21.560 --> 01:56:27.320]   Um, the problem is it doesn't fold so like I was kind of surprised that they built one that didn't that didn't fold
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:31.400]   So I was literally I went in to buy I went to a best buy to buy a spark we
[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:32.920]   um
[01:56:32.920 --> 01:56:34.920]   We were doing
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:38.680]   Laser scanning of a location this is light r and um
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:44.040]   And what happened was this the line to our system stopped working and so I was like, oh, I gotta get something
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:45.880]   I gotta I gotta walk away with some kind of data
[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:48.840]   So so I was like I went to best buy and I was gonna get the spark
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:50.680]   I figured out that'll be enough to do what I need to do
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:55.400]   Uh, and then when I opened it up and the and they showed to me I was like, oh, you can't fold the wings
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:58.840]   and uh, and so I I went to pack it
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:03.880]   It would be very hard to pack and that's the big advantage of the mavic and and the go pro
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:05.400]   solution
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.000]   Um, I chose the mavic because of the integration with all these tools that are already out there
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:13.800]   Um, but the the problem is is that the uh, I mean the the advantage of the mavic is man
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:16.840]   You can just you throw that I throw that into my my carry on all the time
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:20.440]   I mean it's like a little little box and I throw it in the carry on and and you know
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:23.560]   You get to a location and three minutes later. I'm flying
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.000]   You know like I just kind of open it up and turn it on and boom it's up in the air
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.440]   You know and I don't have to you know, it's not like this huge pelican case
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:33.960]   the obviously this this little the little spark wouldn't be a
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.280]   a huge pelican case, but it's still
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:40.440]   You know with all the wings and all the other bits and pieces it's still going to take up some space
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:46.040]   You know and you're getting a much lower res camera. You're getting you know, there's a lot of things that a lot of quality that you're giving up
[01:57:46.040 --> 01:57:49.000]   Um for not a lot of space and to me I'm
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:55.080]   Space is a premium for me, you know in general when i'm traveling around so so um, that's why I chose the mavic
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:58:01.720]   I'm pretty happy with it. You know, I don't think that the camera, you know, the the camera is not replacing a go pro or a zen moose
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:05.320]   You know x5, you know, those things are at a much higher level
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:08.040]   But it's got a reasonably good camera
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:14.040]   And it uh and it's really really easy for me to launch and and get the easiest the mavic pro has been the easiest
[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:20.200]   Uh drone for me to work with and I've been flying crashing and destroying drones. I have crashed so many drones
[01:58:20.200 --> 01:58:22.440]   I don't know. I don't know I know I want a drone
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:26.680]   But I don't care by one this one this one is definitely been
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:31.720]   By far the the easiest one to to work with there's some funky stuff that you if you haven't used
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:33.720]   And you that you have to learn like how to turn it on
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.120]   And and stuff like that it's just an rtfm problem
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:40.520]   But it's but it isn't like you just push the button you gotta push the button and then you go let let go and then hold it down
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:41.160]   and
[01:58:41.160 --> 01:58:45.400]   um, you know, there's a lot of little things like that but uh within 15 minutes after I
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:51.800]   Charged it all the batteries. I was flying, you know, now it's just like I fly almost every day with it
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:56.280]   You know somewhere in the world. I need a I need a leo safe drone
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.880]   Safe, although you do, you know, it's got little radar
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:01.800]   It's got like it'll tell you when you're getting close to things
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:06.440]   Although if you can I found I almost backed into a tree and backing up with the drones
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:11.000]   You want to make sure you got enough so if I get this software then you don't drive it at all
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:15.080]   You just say go no no you say I just want I want this information a little void trees
[01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:19.720]   Well, I usually when I'm mapping I'm mapping from higher than the trees so
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:22.440]   A lot of times I'm you know
[01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:26.280]   I'm getting up and then I go up a little higher from the trees like the map that I did
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:28.280]   I think the drone was at 250 feet
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:33.400]   Um your maximum, you know altitude is 400 legal altitude is 400 feet
[01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:39.240]   So I haven't DJ and I announced that anybody who bought a spark has to get the firmware updated. It'll stop working
[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:44.040]   September 1st because yeah, that's uh they fall out of the sky sometimes
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:49.640]   Well, I don't know. I thought that was a no fly zone issue. Um, you know, I thought it was too
[01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:52.920]   But apparently they've had some defects that uh, it will just
[01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:55.640]   It will just go turn off and fall
[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:58.520]   That would be a problem, right?
[01:59:58.520 --> 02:00:03.320]   I had a phantom that did that that just it was it was going it was fine and then it fell from 20 feet
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:05.640]   But your mavic pro has been rock solid
[02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:11.480]   It has been rock solid. It you know, I just I I've been flying it almost every day and it's been
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:15.960]   And what's the name of this software the mapping software? Uh, it's called drone deploy
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:18.280]   deploy
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:23.400]   All right, and it's what's crazy is looking at what they're doing like they it'll actually look at your it'll map it
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:28.120]   And show you based on the RGB values and the and whatever else it's pulling in it's actually mapping
[02:00:28.120 --> 02:00:33.240]   uh, the uh, like the health of the grass so it's you know for agriculture and
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:37.720]   So there's a lot of things that you know, this becomes a much more industrial solution for your drone
[02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:43.800]   Of being able to track construction projects, you know, look at your crops. Uh, look at your yard, you know, all that stuff
[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:51.160]   That's probably not what donk and sinfield is using for his apple canvas drone. No, I don't think so he's probably using an inspire
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.120]   X wing
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:57.400]   Hey guys, it's it that's it. We're done
[02:00:57.400 --> 02:01:01.160]   But thank you so much for being here always great to see you Alex lindsey at the pixel core
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:06.360]   If you want to know what Alex is up to the best thing to do is to follow him on the twitter at alex
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:09.000]   l-i-n-d-s-a-y
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.560]   And um, we are finally after
[02:01:11.560 --> 02:01:16.840]   All of this stop start stop start start start start we're gonna open up the pixel core membership again for beta
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:20.280]   Oh my god. You're kidding. Yeah, so so we're gonna
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:24.680]   You if you go up and get on the mailing list from the web on the website just sign up for them interest
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:26.680]   That'll be aware of the we only have a limited number of
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:33.880]   Openings we're gonna send it out to that list first. Um, but if you're but it's gonna be mostly focused around live streaming training
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.200]   related to live streaming AR VR that type of thing so
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:44.280]   Uh, so they're um, I think that there is a interest button there. Yeah, you can fill that out in the interest list
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:48.840]   Uh, so if definitely fill it out. Um, there'll be more of that over the next a couple weeks
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.880]   Um, but we're gonna again send out the the blast
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:54.360]   Um to everyone from that that web page
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:57.880]   Well first to the former members and then and then to that that list and so
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:03.480]   Um, and then we'll uh, they'll make it more public, but uh, we we're pretty excited about it. I think it's gonna be uh
[02:02:03.480 --> 02:02:06.120]   Uh, we're gonna dump a lot of information
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:09.000]   So very nice very nice
