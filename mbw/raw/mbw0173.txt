[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   A whopper Jr.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It is A whopper Jr.

[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Mine has been to add the season one of Man vs. Food to my
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Roku box that I have in the kitchen.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   When I'm cooking food and eating meals, that's on it.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Maybe I won't have a little whole pork tenderloin.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Maybe I'll just leave half of it for tomorrow.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   A little less of that.

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Good to see you, Andrew.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Also the wasting away Alex Lindsay, who has -- have you made
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   your goal, Alex?
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   No.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   In fact, I lost a little ground.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I lost a little ground over the -- my mother-in-law was in town.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It was Christmas.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You got to eat.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I was in the middle of the year.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And people keep sending -- you know, people are undermining
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   us because they keep sending us food.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   We've got cookies.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   We've got --
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Those are the temptations.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   The only thing that's really a temptation is my mother-in-law's
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   cooking.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   She's from Louisiana.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It is -- it is -- it is -- it is -- it is -- it's like
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I had peas for New Year's.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Black-eyed peas and sweet potatoes and incredibly cooked meat.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   She makes sweet potato pie.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   No, she just makes -- she makes sweet potato that's better
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   than pie.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I mean, it's -- it's better than pie.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Oh, it is so good.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And so I'm afraid that I -- I -- I -- I -- I indulged.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And now I'm going to -- I'm back on the wagon.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I fell off the wagon, back on the wagon.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I -- I noticed you're eating out a little can of dog food
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   yesterday.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Cat food.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Cat food is not dog food.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Cat food is a cat food.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yes.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   We -- we traded cat food.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   We did -- your cat food is better than my cat food.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   Equally tiny portion, however.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   But that's the key to the operation.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   If we're in operation, I would get the operation to leave me.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Item 1, AT&T announces -- iPhone 2 Good for You, New York City.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   AT&T stops selling the iPhone online for like two days.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And now it's online again.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And I -- I don't know.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   It seems to me like a tempest in a teapot.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   What happened to Anionaka?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Well, according to multiple sources, it's -- it's -- it's -- you can -- you can track
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   where this started.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Ground Zero was, I think, an e-mail to the consumerist blog explaining
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   its experience that someone had trying to order a phone online through
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   AT&T.com and being told that no, this is not -- this is not available
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   in any New York area code or zip code that he plugged into the site.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   So we called -- he got in touch with customer service and customer service
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   and said, "Oh, well, I can see why your area is not ready for the iPhone.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   It does not have enough cell towers."
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And of course, this was a good thing to -- to start e-mailing people about.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And that got blogged and retweeted just about all over the place.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   AT&T started to backpedal saying, "No, it's not that there's -- isn't enough --
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   is enough coverage in the New York area.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's because we've been having a lot of fraud online with orders shipping
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   to the New York area.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And so we shut it down for a little while.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Meanwhile, Apple was saying, "Well, no, you can go and -- we'll sell -- we'll sell you a phone."
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   We got phones -- phones, phones, phones.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Come on here.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Makes a great Christmas gift.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   If you're going to start trusting AT&T customer service reps,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   you've got a problem anyway, right?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I mean, come on.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It's not like they're the most informed folks.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So in AT&T, they said it wasn't this.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   This wasn't the problem, right?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Yeah, they -- I don't think we'll ever know what the problem was.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   They're claiming that it was because there was online fraud,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   but that seems like the safest -- it might even be true,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   but it's the safest thing they could say at this point.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   The reality is that online sales have been resumed pretty much just over and done with.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And so if there was ever a really good reason why that was going on,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   we'll never know what it was.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Well, the thing is, is that I think the conspiracy comes from --
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   the conspiracy theory arises from the fact that AT&T has been having --
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   making such a fuss about the -- you know, trying to get iPhone users to use their phone
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   less.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It's all happened at the same time.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So the timing of this was particularly bad given that AT&T seems like can't handle the push of iPhones.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I know I didn't -- I thought about this later after talking about it the other --
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   on another show that, you know, if AT&T just fully subsidize the iPhone,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   it would take over the market, and I suddenly realized that that's probably not what they want.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   You know, what they want is not so many more than themselves.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Well, isn't this -- Aren't we heading into the year, you know, 2010,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   where AT&T loses its exclusive?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Isn't this the year that AT&T loses its grip?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I think everyone's been guessing, and no one knows.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   I think that the problem that AT&T has is that someone asked me over -- actually this morning --
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   about why does an AT&T just let other -- you know, why don't they let other people share the pain,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   you know, and take, you know, take some of the iPhone.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   The problem is that for the first time ever, I think, people are far more attached to their phone
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   than they are to their carrier.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   In fact, they dislike the carrier, just a little bit less than they like their iPhone.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   You know, Colleen's been doing tests because we're going to be using a 3G network in Las Vegas for CES.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Right.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   And she says that the bandwidth she's getting on AT&T is the best of all of the -- now, that's here, not in Vegas,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   but here in the Bay Area is the best of all of them upstream than with fantastic --
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Upstream.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Upstream.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But the question is, is whether the other side of that, though, is consistency in downstream.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   It's not consistent, we know that.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Because I know that on the bus ride down to San Francisco when I'm on the bus, my Verizon, my FIS,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   which is roughly using the same thing that the phones would be using, is much more stable
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   than what I'm getting more from.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And that's kind of somewhat more important, maybe than just upstream bandwidth.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   But from the point of view of streaming from CES, we'd like the best upstream bandwidth.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Of course, AT&T doesn't really have much of a presence in Vegas.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And if you get thousands, hundreds of thousands of things there with our iPhones, it's not --
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Yeah, see, that's another problem.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   That's one of the reasons why I like my MIFI.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Just on principle, it's good to have your data connection separate from your phone connection.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   So at least between AT&T and Verizon, I think I'm confident that no matter where I am,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   and even if I'm in an Expo hall with 1.5 million iPhone users,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I'll still be able to get my email and stuff.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   What is it like -- I can't remember.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   How does the iPhone work at Macworld Expo?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Where presumably there are more iPhones per square inch than any other --
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Pretty damn poorly.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I've had situations where I've tried to get a call through but get drop connections or can't --
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   it just can't make the call.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   bandwidth, which was perfectly fine when I'm 10 or 15 miles outside of town,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   is just suddenly terrible when I'm inside that one cell site.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   It's gotten better than it used to be because they've done a lot better load balancing.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   But the difference between -- in many situations,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   the difference between having this Verizon box and having an AT&T USB modem,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I'm pulling it into my laptop, has been just so obvious that I don't even borrow anybody's AT&T card anymore.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Alex just broke his microphone.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Just broke his microphone.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Let me know if that high-catch sound is gone now, now that I've thrown the mic around.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I'm sorry, Eddie.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   We weren't paying any attention.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   We were messing around in here.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   That's okay.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Once again, you're leading the audience.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   We're just messing around.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   So anyway, if you just send the first 100 emails to that address, we'll get $50 from makeover.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Oh!
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   That was me who we're listening.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Rewind.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Oh, damn it, I forgot.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   There is rewind.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   You definitely get in a situation in San Francisco, fairly regularly, where you see five bars.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   It seems like you're getting something and you start making phone calls and they just --
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   It's an assumption.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Well, they just know they just drop.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   It's not going to go down.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.840]   But the drop calls related to 3G are at a separate thing.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.160]   I think it's related to too many people connecting at one time.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.880]   The only other place I saw -- I saw that before San Francisco.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.000]   The only other place I saw that was in Zimbabwe.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We have third world activity.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I have experience.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I was like, "I've seen that before."
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And it is funny because you do hear stories about how each of these different carriers
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   tend to set up their network to get the result that they want to be able to advertise.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   One service will say, "Oh, we leave the nation in completed calls."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.160]   Well, that's because you have set up your network so that it will not reject marginal
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.400]   connections because you want to be able to say, "Yes, we connected you.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.000]   We just lost the signal later on."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.720]   And then there are other people who are going to -- who want to get the fewest drop calls,
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.120]   which means that you won't be able to get that 30 seconds and say, "Hi, I'm straight
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120]   by the side of the road.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.120]   Please pick me up."
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.120]   And then you lose the call.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.640]   So there's so much monkeying around with these figures.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.840]   It's almost like the gigahertz wars and the megahertz wars and CPUs where people realize
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.840]   that that's the number they want to advertise for.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:59.200]   So they engineer their entire system to produce the numbers they want.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.320]   Well anyway, we'll find out when we get to Vegas.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.800]   You know, Vegas has this new sprint thing, this clear, which I think is YMAX.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.120]   It'd be very interesting to see how that works.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.120]   And YMAX should be really fast.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.920]   Well, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.440]   I think YMAX's chief strength is you can have a lot of people have decent speed as opposed
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.280]   to really fast.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.240]   But I think it's like guarantees one and a half megabits.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.240]   I don't know.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.240]   We'll see.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.240]   I'll find out.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.920]   They're going to sprints having some event on Wednesday for their 4G.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:31.240]   And it's an invitation-only event.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:34.520]   And traditionally when sprint does that, they give you a crap.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.360]   I'm hoping they're going to give me a 4G modem just in time for our live broadcast the
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.200]   next day from CES.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.120]   So speaking of events, we got two events coming up.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:51.640]   January 5th, apparently, Google's having an event at its Mountain View headquarters.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.480]   January 5th in the morning day before Macworld Expo begins.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.600]   Probably the morning they say it's an Android announcement.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.280]   It's a big Android announcement.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.160]   Now, that's the day, the 5th as you may remember.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   There you go.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160]   Are you?
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.160]   Are you?
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   I'll try.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160]   That's the day.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.760]   I'm going to do it because we're doing Macbreak weekly in January 5th.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.760]   Of course.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.760]   I can check in.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.520]   We can do live coverage during Macbreak weekly.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.760]   But that's the day that everybody says the Nexus 1, the Google phone, will be available
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   for sale.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.240]   Now, some are saying it's an invitation-only sale.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.520]   I think that's an event to go to.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.640]   I think you might find something under your seat.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.720]   Like a golden ticket.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   Ready.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   Mm-hmm.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   Willy Wonka.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   I'm ready.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   And then--
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720]   They're not going to write video about you.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   And then--
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   I haven't gotten an invite yet.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   And then--
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   Macworld-- sorry.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.720]   Day before CES.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720]   Macworld in February.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   But--
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   But--
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:51.840]   January 26th, everybody says that Apple has reserved the Yoruba Buena Center.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.000]   For a couple days.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   For a few days.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   A few days.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Three-hour tour.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.200]   Well, they'd have to have a couple of days ahead to set up and to roll Steven.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   And then--
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.840]   You think he's living in a pot now?
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   He's like, well, Disney, this break him out for--
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   It's in a hyperbaric chamber.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   And--
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   I would be if I were him.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.960]   No, in fact, we were talking about this on Twitter.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:19.400]   And the consensus among some Apple pundits is this might be Steve's last big announcement
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.800]   is this tablet.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.880]   Certainly, you saw the New York Times article that said Steve Jobs approves.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.240]   He's finally satisfied with the tablet.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.360]   New York Times-- this is quoting an insider at Apple.
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:34.040]   They also quoted an insider at Apple saying you will be very surprised by the user interface.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.520]   It is not what you think.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.160]   It's leading some to speculate.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.400]   Maybe it's a camera where you wave at it.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   Hello.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.400]   Hey, isolate.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.200]   It's me, Leo.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.840]   I don't know what that means.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.600]   Maybe like a Tom Cruise minority report, you like a next page.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   Next page.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   That'd be kind of fun.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.800]   It would be fun for 40 seconds.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.520]   So the question is, whether you're going to actually be able to use it on the phone.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.240]   You don't really want to sell a product that makes people look like morons while they're
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.240]   using it.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   I think that's probably--
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.240]   Bluetooth headset.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   Oh.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.240]   That's a Bluetooth, yeah.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.040]   You've already figured that one out.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   That's true.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   That little board light is the dead giveaway.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.720]   The blue board light over your ear.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   So, yeah.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.000]   So there's some big announcements coming.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   This is genuine.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.400]   It's interesting because remember Apple eschewed Mac world expo because they didn't want to
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.920]   be forced into a big announcement.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.480]   And here they are making a big announcement on January 26.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.440]   What I think it is also, I think part of the-- I know part of the upset for all of us
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.840]   that were part of Mac world and now with the CES was that it was right after Christmas.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.840]   And so there was a lot of--
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.080]   This gives them a little more time.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.160]   I know for us, we're going to have a very large presence of Mac world and there's a lot
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.640]   of planning that we're doing for it.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.760]   And usually Mac world meant we didn't have a Christmas.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.360]   Yeah, no, it makes sense.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.360]   But it's interesting.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:57.920]   It seems like we're coming to a head here in January both what looks like a Google phone,
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.040]   which will be a very interesting product if Google actually sells a phone directly, an
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.360]   unlocked phone directly, maybe a T-Mobile phone that's from Google.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.160]   I'm not sure what it would be.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.560]   And Apple-- who knows what Apple announced though?
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.200]   January, they could be announcing an iPhone in June.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200]   I mean, that wouldn't be unheard of.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.480]   It wouldn't be unheard of, although I think that-- go ahead, Andy.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.920]   I was just going to say, my two candidates are-- one would be a tablet.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.840]   There's been-- so it's not so much the quality of the rumors that are flying around over
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.520]   the past couple of weeks, but the velocity of different data points that makes it a Wall
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.520]   Street Journal.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.520]   Exactly.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:30.520]   So I mean, that's--
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:32.520]   Greatness, New York Times.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.880]   Each of them has one little bit of new information that they say they've come up with over the
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.280]   past two or three weeks.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.200]   And we're talking about the tiny trivial little slips that could come out as opposed to,
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:48.120]   oh, well, sure, we have-- well, I was at a copy store in Daytona, Florida, and someone
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.640]   happened to live with the above a print job for banners.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.840]   No, that's not the way these things come out.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   But that's one thing I'm looking at.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.520]   But the other thing could be revamped Apple TV announcing a whole new TV deal.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:59.520]   We're too for that, aren't we?
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:04.600]   But I just think that I think that, man, I think Apple would get a pretty hard hit at
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   this point.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.760]   I don't-- it's hard for them to announce any--
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.080]   Look at their stock price, which has been like a going up, up, up, up, up, up, ever since
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.160]   these rumors started flying about a month ago.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.160]   Right.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.240]   And clearly, the stock market thinks that a tablet's going to come out and that it's
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.520]   going to be an iPhone or iPod level announcement.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.720]   There's been trains from the marketplace.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:27.480]   And it seems to be-- we were talking about it on Twitter with Kevin Rose, who has pretty
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.680]   good Apple connections.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:35.320]   And it seems to be that they're pushing the e-reader side of this.
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.320]   Does that make sense?
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.320]   I think it--
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.320]   Yeah, that's totally what I'm wondering.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.320]   It's--
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   Why?
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   Go ahead.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.320]   I'm sorry, I have her up, you.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.400]   Oh, all I was going to say is that I think that in addition to the e-reader, I think that
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.240]   the stuff that they're doing with iTunes related to the LP--
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   LP.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:54.760]   The LP-- the iTunes stuff with the LP with the extra stuff that you can get, extra interface
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.680]   for movies.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.000]   I think all of that.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:04.040]   And if-- and I have no information about this, this is just me making stuff up-- is that
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:09.520]   if DVD Studio Pro, for instance, was able to author the Apple or even-- I DVD or DVD
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.200]   Studio Pro is able to author the LP as well as the movie stuff.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.760]   And then you had a little player to do it, and Apple really has this--
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.760]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:18.760]   I mean, I mean--
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.760]   That's coming together.
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.960]   Don't they traditionally announce a new iLife right around January?
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   So you announce a new iLife--
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:23.960]   I think iLife--
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:24.960]   I don't believe it.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.960]   Well, it hasn't.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.480]   It was every year, and you're right.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   The last--
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.480]   It's really every other year.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   --it was a delay between the two.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.880]   But this would be a sensible new app for the iLife or an improvement to iTunes.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.720]   Or an improvement to iDVD or DVD Studio Pro.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.520]   I mean, just the e-mail thing is anymore.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.520]   I mean, you know, it's--
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   You're right.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   I mean, you're right.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.520]   Authoring a DVD.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.520]   Yeah, you know.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.520]   Are we ahead of-- I think, though, you know, this is something I've been kind of starting
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:52.360]   to think of, is that things are happening so fast now that the population of the world
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.080]   lives in different time zones, you know, different eras.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.680]   So you and I and Andy, we're kind of all ahead of the curve, you know, the people who listen
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:01.880]   to this show, the people who host these shows.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.040]   We're in the future.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.360]   We were talking to the other day about how, why would anybody use a yellow page?
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.360]   Well, I think probably the majority of people still use a yellow page.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360]   Really?
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.360]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.720]   Is it you and I and Andy are not living in the present?
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.200]   Well, I have to admit it.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.320]   Yesterday we were talking on this week of media, and I was saying, you know, do people
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.320]   actually still use antennas?
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.320]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.720]   I think people still make DVDs, but we are kind of a little ahead.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.680]   But the sales, so I think we're living in the future.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.480]   The sales of DVDs have been dropping pretty.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.480]   They have.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.480]   They peaked a couple of years ago.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480]   Nobody's buying DVDs.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   Not nobody, but less.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.480]   Not nobody.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480]   Not nobody, but it's less.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.720]   It's it's it is definitely on the decline at this point.
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   Andrew.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.520]   I was just going to say that's backed up by the problems that are having even they're
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.760]   having even pushing Blu-ray when it was first conceived.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.040]   The marketers thought, Oh, well, of course, we'll we'll let them have their $20 DVD's.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.240]   But if they want Blu-ray, of course, we'll make them pay a premium price for that.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.000]   And then, you know, it'll kill the unbreakable.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.240]   And now we're down to the Blu-ray is $22.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.080]   You also get a DVD copy.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.880]   You also get a digital download copy.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.880]   Please buy.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880]   Please buy.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.880]   Please buy.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.080]   I'm so close to being fired over this.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.040]   Please buy up on the DVD and for Blu-ray.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.600]   I want to do a podcast called Time Travelers where we come to you from the future.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.800]   I we've been talking about doing that called we want to do.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.640]   We come from the future in the future.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.840]   There will be no DVDs or yellow pages.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.680]   You will be using a cube embedded in your forehead like handheld videos of like someone
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.840]   who got into the future and sent this back to us.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840]   Let's do that.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   Oh, that's a great idea.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   Oh, that's a great idea.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.440]   I was first online to get Godfather Part 4.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.440]   I look forward to enjoying this and come after both boys.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.920]   I'm involved.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.800]   They got him back.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   Leave the gun.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.400]   Take the cannoli.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.760]   We'll return with more in just a bit of time travelers from the future on Mac break weekly.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:08.160]   But first, hey, you want.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.640]   Oh, he's still eating the Godfather.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.840]   Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:18.080]   Oh, I'm going to have a title.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.560]   You're eating the Godfather.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.120]   I want to mention our friends who live in the future.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.400]   The future of websites that is squarespace.com.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.960]   Squarespace is a great place to get your website going.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.400]   In fact, if you've already got a website, they make tools available that import very easily
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   into Squarespace.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.640]   So you can try it for free with your existing content.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:49.960]   I want you to go to squarespace.com and use a coupon code MACBreak.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.320]   Squarespace.com coupon code MACBreak.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.040]   And you can try it out for yourself.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.880]   We've lost the connection here to my Squarespace computer.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:00.400]   There it is.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:06.160]   The secret behind exceptional websites, blog, build, host, design, impress, starting at $8
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.360]   a month, Squarespace is the easiest way to design a beautiful website.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.520]   Just ask Alex Lindsey who we've been doing.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.760]   We've been slowly rolling all the front ends for our sites over to Squarespace.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.400]   Do you like the stats package?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.680]   I think that's so sweet.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.680]   The statistics?
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.760]   Yeah, it's really good.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.520]   What I love is I'm sitting there two mornings ago, I'm sitting there talking to someone who
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:33.720]   is Carolyn who is running the new, running the PIXA core end of things.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:37.240]   We're talking about the new webpage and I'm sitting there changing the colors and talking
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.240]   to her about it.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.240]   She's changing some of that too.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:43.160]   The idea that we just do the updates and talk about it without calling a programmer,
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.400]   without going through a process, we can play with it.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.400]   It's just so powerful.
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   Just take a look at places like DaneCook.com, Jamie Kennedy.com, Triune Films.com.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   These are Mark Echo Enterprises.com.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.880]   These are GwenBell.com.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.520]   These are sites designed with Squarespace.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.200]   Templates, modified and they're looking fantastic.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.400]   There's an iPhone app that's the best to post.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.520]   The Copenhagen World Wildlife Federation Climate Summit site was created in Squarespace.com.com.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:16.160]   That's cop15.panda.org.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.360]   Of course, our friends Tom and Veronica do their sword and laser podcast site.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.240]   Look how gorgeous this is at squarespace.com.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.440]   The neat thing about Squarespace sites, you can't look at them and say, "Oh, that's a Squarespace
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.440]   site."
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.000]   They all look hand designed and unique and I love that.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.720]   Whether you've got a photo business and you want to show off your pictures or you've got
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.480]   a blog or maybe you've got a podcast, squarespace.com.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.400]   Use the copemackbreak weekly or I'm sorry, just Macbreak and you'll get to 10% off.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.600]   But you can try it free for two weeks without even a credit card.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.600]   Just go to squarespace.com.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.600]   It's definitely worth a try.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   Definitely worth a try.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.600]   Just to open it up, it's free.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.600]   There's no credit card.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.000]   There's no sign up and it's really worth just seeing if it's something that would work.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.760]   I was so glad when the iPhone app came out.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.400]   It's just such a great way to post.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.880]   It couldn't be easier.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.520]   We've got our inside Twit, our corporate behind the scenes blog is on Squarespace.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.560]   It's just fantastic.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.640]   Nokia is getting a little feisty.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.640]   Did you see this?
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:21.920]   First of all, they were suing over feisty.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.640]   They were suing over the iPhone.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.480]   They filed against Apple claiming that the consumer electronics giant was infringing its
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.880]   wireless patents with the iPhone.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:36.400]   Now they filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission alleging that Apple is infringing.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:42.240]   This is from Mashable.com, an article by Barb Dibwood.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:47.080]   The Apple is infringing Nokia patents with almost every product it produces.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.800]   From the iPhone to the iPod, all the way to its line of computers, they listed seven different
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:58.280]   patents in the complaint relating to innovations in user interface, camera and TENNA and power
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.200]   management technologies.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.360]   Paul Mellon, the company's general manager of patent licensing said this action is not
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.200]   about protecting the results of such pioneering development.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.040]   I don't know where he's from, so I'm making up a nonspecific accent.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.720]   While our litigation in Delaware is about Apple, where do you think that's from?
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   I just made that up.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.680]   It could be anywhere.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.400]   It's a Eurotrash accent.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.560]   While our litigation in Delaware is about Apple's attempt to free-ride-
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   Right.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.560]   ... a little more French in there.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.320]   ... on the back of Nokia and Vastement in the wireless standards.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:37.040]   The artistic asfow today is about Apple's practice of building its business on Nokia's proprietary
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.240]   in a way.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:44.040]   I think the big issue is Apple is infringing on Nokia's ability to sell smartphones.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.040]   Yeah, no kids.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.040]   They're terrified.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.040]   They're terrified.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.480]   Well, for a lot of these companies.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.440]   And by the way, Apple's countersuit saying, "Yeah, I think the technical term was boom,
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.440]   we have Latin."
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.440]   I think there were some fingers.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.440]   There was like a...
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.440]   Up yas!
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.240]   A fart in your general direction.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.040]   No, Nokia.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.360]   They claim that the Finnish mobile device maker is infringing on 13 of Apple's patents.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.360]   Good Lord.
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   You can go to Engadget.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.320]   There's a 79-page PDF that you can read.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:22.800]   It says, "In dealing with Apple, Nokia has sought to gain an unjust competitive advantage
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:28.640]   over Apple by charging unwarranted fees to use patents that allegedly cover industry
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.640]   compatibility."
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   That's a Cupertino.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.040]   Now, the layman terms for that is, they're being big jerky jerks.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.920]   Jerky jerks and by seeking to obtain access to Apple's intellectual property.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.560]   So who's right here?
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.560]   Who knows?
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.560]   Who knows?
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.120]   It'll depend on what judge or what jury or whoever is sitting in front of it.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.120]   It's all...
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.520]   They're all supporting hairs and someone will end up paying somebody else a billion dollars
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.760]   and then we'll call it a bang.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.760]   Stop it.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.200]   It's what happens when you feel you can't compete.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.200]   You sue.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.200]   Right?
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   That is what you do.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   Or that you want to...
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:05.280]   I mean, maybe they feel legitimately being infinitive.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.840]   It does seem like a law.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.320]   Especially that it took so long for them to get around to suit.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.920]   Oh, now you tell us the Mac-a-Tush and fringes.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.960]   Now that your sales have been dropping.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.760]   This is the classic slip and fall lawsuit at Walmart saying that, "I know that I'm not
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.720]   going to win the $18 billion that my lawyer is asking for, but I know that they'll give
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.600]   me $80,000 to go away.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:31.000]   And maybe in Nokia's case, maybe it'll hassle Apple just enough to maybe do something productive."
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.600]   Apple say they want a business writer.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.640]   They want a business writer writing about them.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   Talk about Nokia technology.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.640]   Yeah, we're talking about it.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.440]   When was the last time anybody talked about Nokia technology?
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.080]   You know, it's kind of what the lowest low that Nokia has ever hit is the fact that
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:51.200]   I have seen more positive buzz around the media packaging for the N900 phone than for
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   the phone itself.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.600]   Do you hear about this?
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.120]   No, I haven't in 900 and I do like it very much.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.400]   Although I don't like it so much that I didn't give it to my daughter to take to France with
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   her.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   Right.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.680]   But for a number of different bloggers and colonists, what you got was not just the usual
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:09.360]   cardboard box with the consumer packaging.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:16.880]   You got a blackboard smooth cube with no buttons, no lights, no nothing, just a tiny mini USB
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.120]   port on it.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:23.000]   And if you care to hear to you to say, "Okay, I'll plug this into my Mac or my PC and fire
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.760]   up a terminal and see what it does."
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.040]   You get a sort of a Unix prompt.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.640]   If you know what commands to enter, it'll say, "Here are the available commands."
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.380]   And they say, "Okay, what if I say box open?"
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.380]   There is a click.
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:35.540]   The box pops open.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:38.640]   There is a puff of smoke that emerges from the box.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.040]   You open it up and that's how you get to the phone.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.040]   Did you get this?
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:47.480]   Well, it only went to the most exclusive and respected.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.400]   So I got three of them as a matter of fact.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   I had to buy it.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   I'll tell you where I am on the totem pole.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:59.440]   I spent $600 to get a 900 and I get no cube that had smoke.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.440]   Your videos are this.
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.440]   It's the most...
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.800]   Sometimes you do get these elaborate packaging things just to make sure that you actually
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.200]   pay attention to it.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.200]   But it just occurred to me that...
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.960]   You kind of buried the lead.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.400]   No one was talking about the technology of the phone.
[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:14.560]   Everybody was talking about, "Hey, here's the most awesome unboxing video ever."
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.040]   And it is the most awesome unboxing video ever.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.400]   I mean, I would return the phone.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.160]   I definitely would not be returning the box because it seems like a good place to store
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.160]   knickknacks.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:29.240]   There's something wrong with your product when you're willing to return the phone but
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   not the phone.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.240]   I'll review the box.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   Yeah, I'll keep the box.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.240]   Let me see.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.880]   Here's the unboxing video.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:42.920]   By contrast, when Apple ships the slate is going to arrive on a plastic Walgreens bag.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.920]   Yes.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.440]   We really weren't thinking about the packaging.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:46.880]   We were really focusing on the product.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:47.880]   That's true.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.880]   That's true.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.400]   I have to say, if you've got a great product, you don't really need the...
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:57.760]   And what's amazing is Apple's product packaging is generally really, really nice but it's
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.280]   not like I save it.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   Let me...
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.880]   I always just open it and go, "Wow, they thought of everything."
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.840]   So it's usually that when you open the box and you go, "Oh, and then this thing."
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   And you're always like, "Wow, they thought of that.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.840]   They thought of that."
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   No, I thought of that.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.320]   Here's the hacker box.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   From unboxingstuckknacks.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.920]   I'm Tracy Matt.co.uk and here I have.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.080]   Well, have a large black cube.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.080]   It's beautiful.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   It's not piano black.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   I'm maybe wondering what it is as I was a couple of days ago when I actually received
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   it.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.320]   It weighs a good couple of kilos.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.320]   This is brilliant.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:29.960]   I love the USB port on it.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.200]   The first thing you do is you plug it in, right?
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.600]   It's a way of actually opening it.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:41.200]   It kind of looks a bit like a bass speaker, but for the fact that it has a mini USB connector
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.680]   on the front and not a lot else.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.680]   I mean, you must be rather feet on the box.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.640]   Yeah, but not a lot else to give away what's inside.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.120]   So what we have to do, natural fact, is...
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.960]   And it's great that the guys are British accent.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   It makes it much more interesting.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.480]   It actually facts what we've got to do is plug it in.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.480]   Yeah, get you all laptop.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   We actually have to do this.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   Yes.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   You have to do this.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   Yes.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:06.480]   We actually have to hack in.
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   Oh my.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:08.480]   To get to the content.
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.760]   Well, let's see.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.760]   Can you use Windows?
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.560]   You have to use Mac.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.520]   It'll work with anything that has terminal.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.200]   What I was trying to figure out is it does it appears a mass storage device to give you
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.120]   any clue as to what to do because probably my first guess would not be I got to go through
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   the terminal.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.840]   No, I wouldn't launch a terminal.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.800]   This is really...
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   Oh, look.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   I'd like to think that it gets there eventually.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   Right.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   There's a Nokia prompt in ASCII.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.800]   Wow.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.720]   It's a terminal text, right?
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.320]   It's like a VT 100.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:40.320]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   I wonder.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   So who got this?
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.760]   I would have loved to have gotten one of these.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.760]   I would have been just like...
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.400]   We apparently don't run these people.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.600]   The reason they didn't send me one is I'd be like, "What is wrong with these people?"
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   I'll send you one of the seven that I got.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.920]   Oh, which is seven of them?
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.080]   I do put up a sign before the show starts to say UPS, don't ring their doorbell.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.880]   They'll probably know the three by the door right now.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:00.880]   Who knows, right?
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   I'm just like, "What's the label on it?"
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.880]   I'm actually just typing that in.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.880]   Okay.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.520]   He's typing in the command now.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:08.680]   Initiating sequence, and I'll move out.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.680]   Initiating sequence.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:10.680]   Shh, shh, shh, shh.
[00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.840]   Oh my gosh, it popped open.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   Completely.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   I don't know if you can really...
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   There's smoke coming out of it.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   Spam out of smoke.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   Oh, this is brilliant.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   He messed the box.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   Oh, he's a bad sign.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   Oh, he's a bad sign.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   If something arrives to be like, I'm already smoking, I'm like...
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.840]   That's not a good thing.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.640]   Maybe I won't talk this to my computer.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.840]   One of my good computers.
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.360]   Well, I like the N900, but it is not...
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.600]   It's MAMO 5, it's Linux, and it's not as responsive.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.480]   It's the same processor as in the pre and the 3GS.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.320]   It's that Cortex-AA.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.880]   It's not super responsive.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.560]   You have to use really a stylus because it's such a high-res screen.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.400]   There's a lot to be said for, but I'm sorry.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.400]   It's not an iPhone.
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400]   It's not even a Droid.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.800]   But it comes in a nice box.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.480]   But isn't everybody's problem right now?
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.480]   Is anyone really...
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.280]   I guess this new Google Droid maybe is more competitive with the iPhone, but it just seems
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.800]   like everybody I talk to is what happens.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.880]   The Droid is darn close, and I think this Nexus One may well do it.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.880]   We'll see.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.880]   We'll see.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   It's an App Store issue.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.200]   And they're getting close.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.560]   They've got Evernote on there.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.560]   They've got a lot of the...
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.920]   A lot of the apps that I use are now on here.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:15.560]   Do they have LastPass?
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.120]   Do you have a defense?
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:18.120]   You know what?
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.120]   Gaming is not good.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.120]   On the Droid.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.120]   On the Droid.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.120]   No Geo Defense.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.120]   Forgot it?
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.320]   No, no, no, it doesn't even have Bejeweled.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.320]   No, no, no.
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.320]   I mean, come on.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.920]   Bejeweled isn't that important to me, but the Geodefense isn't right.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:36.520]   Well, Bejeweled is the Geodefense of the 90s.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.880]   Or the last decade.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   We did a whole thing.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:44.480]   In fact, you did a great video, Alex, on Twitter.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.320]   It's the end of the decade.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.720]   Oh, yeah, that turned out really well.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.760]   What the big stories of the last 10 years were and so forth.
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.760]   I didn't hear from you, Andy.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.800]   What do you think the big story, Apple or otherwise, of the last 10 years is?
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:02.640]   The last 10 years would probably have to be Unix because now every single device of
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.760]   any note is Unix based now.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.120]   Even the iPhone, really, isn't it?
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.520]   Every major operating system, every time there's a brand new device that comes out.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.920]   Of course, when I say Unix, I mean Linux, but I just want to tip it a hat to the core
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.080]   that started it all.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.560]   I can't remember the last time that I saw a major device.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:24.560]   Again, not just the laptops, but a book reader, a phone, a music player, that when you dig
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:30.600]   deep down, deep down, deep down, it's using some, it's using Unix or Linux at its core.
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.880]   And so it's, of course, it's very, very tempting to also go with, well, of course, it was the
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.880]   iPhone.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.520]   Of course, it's the concept of the App Store, of course, of course, of course.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.480]   But every time I come up with something like that, it turns out that, well, what power
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   is that?
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.480]   Linux.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   Okay, cool.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:46.720]   Let's give it to Linux, which is amazing because the last thing you would think about
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:53.840]   in the year 2000 is Linux as the core of consumer devices because even in 2000, it
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.960]   was the most, it just, it was that Tony that did not want to be broken.
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:03.840]   It wanted to kick the face in of every cowboy that tried to throw a saddle over it.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.800]   And it was the most untenable, unmanageable device, untenable operating system for anybody
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.240]   who wanted to do anything productive with it.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.960]   So I think that's probably the big story of the last 10 years.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.720]   Yeah, and I mean, oh, it's 10 is Unix based, BSD based.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.320]   I mean, technically, I think it's the largest distribution of the Unix in the world, right?
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.520]   Yeah, I mean, it's real Unix.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:22.520]   It's not even Linux.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:24.400]   It's real Unix under the hood there.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.400]   Just do a top and a kill and you'll know that it's really Unix.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.400]   You're writing it.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.680]   I hadn't really thought of that, but you're absolutely right.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:37.720]   It is the decade that Linux or Unix in Linux and other forms emerged as the dominant operating
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.320]   system everywhere but Windows.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.320]   Right.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.400]   So we can actually say that they're the minority operating system.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   They are now.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.160]   They're the only ones who are thinking differently now.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.160]   Windows.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.160]   Think different.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.160]   You're the one.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.160]   Here's the guy.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:59.040]   Here's the operating system that wasn't invented in university by eggheads.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:03.560]   We're going to actually, I want to talk a little bit about an interesting contention
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.440]   that Apple will in fact have three operating systems in just a second.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.440]   Before we do that though, I do want to mention our friends at Ford.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.960]   I'm sorry, I'm not supposed to say Ford.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.840]   They told me, you know, we just want to call it sync because it's not just fords.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.840]   Let's make this very clear.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.360]   It's on Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:27.400]   Sync is the voice activated technology that just transforms your experience in your car.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:34.840]   Voice activated sync is hands free calling, music and podcast search, turn by turn navigation.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:39.160]   You can find out more at syncbyride.com and we are going to be going to CES.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:46.760]   They're supporting our CES coverage live from Las Vegas next week, January 6th through 10th.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.280]   Our CES team is going down in a Ford vehicle.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.600]   I think we're going to do our Lincoln.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.760]   I'm starting on a Ford, a Lincoln, the MKS.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.760]   Everybody's going to be down there.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.800]   Paul Thorett, Dick DeBartolo, Ryan Block, Will Harris, Dr. Keke and I.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.000]   Alex Lindsey will be there.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.760]   We're Ford is also underwriting our sync is underwriting our shooting for Mac Break excellent
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.760]   video.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.240]   So we'll be shooting, I think, 15, I think 15 episodes.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.000]   Sync's got something big to announce there by the way.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.560]   CEO Ford is going to be making a speech.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.720]   We're going to talk to the head of engineering at sync.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.720]   What are you laughing at, Andy?
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.600]   I'm thinking it's an invite only event underneath everybody's seat.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.120]   A brand new Mustang.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:24.600]   You got your car.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.600]   What the?
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   Hey.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.600]   That would be good.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   I'm super good.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   Just remember, the keys would be fine.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.600]   The keys would be fine.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.720]   Oprah did that.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.280]   Everybody in her audience got a new car.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.280]   Remember that?
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.280]   Man.
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:38.280]   I wasn't high there.
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   We could do that.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.280]   Everybody in this room is getting a new car.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.280]   Hey.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.280]   Thanks.
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   Kevin and Chris are very happy.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.800]   They just showed up.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.920]   Their girlfriend's not so happy.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.360]   Chris's girlfriend's not so happy.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:57.760]   So we're going to have a lot of fun listening and watch live January 6th through 10th live.twit.tv.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.200]   We have a new feed, a Twit Live at CES podcast.
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.800]   You can download daily summaries and iTunes.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.360]   And of course, for more information about the Ford Sync, give it a try.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   You're going to love it.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.360]   Syncmyride.com.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:14.360]   We are very excited, and we thank Sync for supporting our trip down.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.040]   And I can't wait to tell you what's new in this sync.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.640]   It's very, very exciting.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   Syncmyride.com.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.880]   Andy, are you, you're not going to see?
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.880]   Yes.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   I'm not going to CES.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.720]   It was a complicated decision that started off with dude $1200.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720]   Dude $1200.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:37.720]   And also went with the, but the, the, the, the closer was really dude for the first time,
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:42.840]   literally in your adult life, you have the ability to not have to prepare for a huge week
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.760]   long trade show over the holidays.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.760]   So excited.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.360]   You want to screw this up.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.760]   So you, you, you would normally do Macworld not CES.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.080]   Normally I would do Macworld not CES.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:59.520]   CES is a, is a tough show to meet for me to cover because with CES, you can cover it
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.720]   if you, if you treat it as one show, if you treat it as just a phone show or just a television
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:08.760]   show, just one area of consumer electronics you want to cover aggressively, you can do
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.920]   it.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:15.680]   Or a guy like me who writes about general technology, just going from things that invites I've gotten
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.880]   through the mail from not being a participant.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.260]   There, there are three things I would want to go to that are all taking place either
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.960]   on the same afternoon or they're so close to each other so far apart that I've never
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.920]   been able to get to the three things I want to do at that time.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.960]   I'll, I'm going to think about it next.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.480]   I'm going to think about it for next year because it's been, I think I've went to CES
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:36.640]   twice in my lifetime.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.120]   It's, but it's, it's such a hard sell for me.
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.000]   I haven't been of course since 2004 because of Mac world to be honest.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Yes.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Right.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   We couldn't do both.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.440]   And so that's why I'm going for the first time since six years.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:52.880]   I haven't, I've never been to CES because it can feel so much fun.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   It really is fun.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.080]   Andy, we'll make sure you get to go next year.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.000]   I'm sorry we didn't plan this better and we'll bring you next year.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   That's, that's okay.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.440]   Again, that way I can, you know, I usually spend years, even years day drinking alone,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.280]   quietly thinking of myself of all the mistakes I've made in the previous year.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.240]   I'd probably still be coming off of that buzz by the fourth of the fifth.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240]   Sounds good.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.080]   You know, I could be doing that too.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.680]   I probably worked out for the best.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.200]   All the places I screwed up.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   In two thousand.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:19.920]   The face of those wrong, floating in front of you.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:21.920]   That upset doesn't help.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920]   That's held a liquor.
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.920]   We had it.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.600]   We used to have a great, a great tradition.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   Me and a friend of mine in Denver used to write all the things that we remembered from
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   that year.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.080]   We'd write them all in pieces of paper, all the good stuff we did, all the mistakes we
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.600]   did and we write these all out and share them with each other and then we throw them in
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   the fire.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.600]   Burn them one.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.600]   Even the good and the bad.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   Burn it all.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   It's burn it all.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   Burn it all.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.800]   So I, now I'm trying to find this article.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:51.280]   I wish I could, but a very interesting point somebody's making about operating systems saying,
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:55.400]   essentially what's going to happen here is Apple's going to have a desktop OS 10.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.360]   They're going to have a phone OS 10.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.240]   But this pad, this tablet in the middle can't really shouldn't be an iPhone because it's
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   going to need a multitask.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.000]   It's going to have more capability.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.400]   It should be kind of a third version of OS 10 for medium sized devices.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.560]   Does that make sense?
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.080]   Remember that the iPhone isn't the, the Apple made a very big distinction.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:20.120]   If you're taught, if you start telling them about OS 10 for the iPhone, they always make
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:24.680]   sure they made a distinction between Mac OS 10 and OS 10 running on iPhone, meaning that
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:30.480]   it's, if you can imagine Mac OS 10 as a big ship that's made out of Legos where they can
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.120]   easily break off every part of it that they don't need.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.160]   So they took off every part of the OS that has nothing to do with a desktop operating
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.680]   system, put on a whole bunch of it that you would need for a phone operating system.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.760]   I think that for the, for the slate of the tablet, you'd wind up with exactly that same
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:48.640]   situation where you start off with a core OS 10 that has nothing to do with a phone,
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.040]   nothing to do with a desktop.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.080]   And then you add on the stuff that makes sense for a multitouch tablet.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   You agree?
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.080]   Alex?
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.080]   Yeah, no, I think, I think the, I think you definitely, I think that they're related.
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.760]   So I think, and this is one of the powers is why there's so many apps in the app store
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:07.080]   is that they are, you know, some of the infrastructure, the, you know, the environment, everything
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.800]   else that takes to create it is related.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.360]   But I think that it'll definitely be its, its own, it'll have its own needs.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.760]   I think I think it'll be more, it'll be closer to the iPhone than the, than the OS, but I
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.400]   don't think, I don't think it'll be the same.
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.120]   I think developing for it will be its own, its own thing.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:28.480]   Here's the, here's the articles from Steve Sandy and the unofficial Apple web blog to UAW.com.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:35.680]   And actually he's saying maybe four, he's quoting a fellow Apple consultants network
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.120]   member, Michael Kimball, who says, quote, I've been wondering if Apple on their January
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:46.160]   26th product announcement won't start to differentiate OS 10 to include OS 10 mobile,
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.160]   OS 10 touch, OS 10 desktop.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:53.680]   And we left out an existing version of OS 10 server.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:57.160]   Rather than discrete versions of the OS, it's a spectrum where features of one version
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.000]   can, as you said, Andy slide up and down the scale, depending on functionality of the hardware
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   platform.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.480]   If that's the case, though, it really shows what a great bet Apple made on OS 10, right?
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.040]   How flexible OS 10 is.
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.600]   How flexible is the Unix is?
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.360]   Well, yeah, Unix on it, Darwin, you know, essentially, but, but also all of these, these,
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:19.800]   these Lego pieces that Andy was talking about, like quartz, you know, all of these, uh,
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.040]   kits, like web kits.
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:26.840]   To say nothing about the simple fact that it was so easy to move it from one CPU to another,
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:31.720]   uh, it was impressive enough that they could make the transition from power PC, uh, so easily.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.280]   But the fact that they could say, well, we now we have a mobile processor.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.280]   Great.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:36.280]   We'll just put on this mobile processor.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.760]   Well, now we've got this brand new mobile processor.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:38.760]   Great.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.760]   We'll put it on this other new mobile.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.960]   And Apple TV is OS 10 Tiger running on a very slow Intel processor, but there's nothing
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:47.480]   to say that Apple might announce a new Apple TV.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.440]   You can see it improved that and improved.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.320]   Well, and I think that one of the great thing again is that the fact that all of this can
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.840]   be built on, you know, Xcode, you know, so that's free.
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.600]   And I think that I love it that it comes with it.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.320]   It's, it's, it's, that's an interesting theory though that I'm not sure if Apple would ever
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:13.440]   break up Mac OS 10 and promote it as the unifying Latin that connects every single Apple device.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.040]   I'm not sure how they would sell that to a consumer as an advantage.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.360]   I think they, I think they'd start with one ring to one ring to find them.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:26.000]   One ring to rule them all.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.560]   It's a, it is a good, it is something that should probably explain more to analysts and
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:34.380]   to, and to press because that is something that really makes it, it's, it is like the
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.000]   fourth act of a James Bond movie.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.320]   We find out that no, the villains, the, the, the arch villains plan had nothing to do with
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.760]   simply stealing the gold.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.800]   It was about irradiating the entire gold supplies that his old holdings were even better.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.440]   But I'm not saying anybody else they've come up with this really, really cool master plan
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.640]   to make it so easy to churn out new devices over the next 10 years, not only that, but
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:00.560]   make it very, very easy to, to convince a developer to please invest in learning how
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.560]   to program an X code.
[00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:07.040]   You can't simply transmogify your Mac app onto the ice later onto an iPhone, but the
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.800]   thing is you will not have to learn a whole new set of tools.
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:11.880]   You'll just need to learn a whole new set of APIs.
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.860]   And that's it, which is why I think that I think that one of the biggest problems they're
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.140]   going to have with the, the slate and hopefully they've kind of figured out how they're going
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.660]   to handle it is that they are, you know, they're going to have a hundred thousand
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:21.660]   apps in two months.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:22.660]   Is it going to be called the slate?
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:23.660]   I don't know.
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.220]   I mean, I just say whatever you think that that I don't, I just find that hard to believe.
[00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:28.660]   That's such a crappy name, the isolate.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:33.020]   Do you think iPhone is, it's, it's on the nose that a lot of people were, we're guessing
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.740]   that would not be called the iPhone.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.740]   Or iPad.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:37.580]   The excuse me, I'm sorry.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.460]   No, the phone was not going to be called the iPhone.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.460]   You're right.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:42.460]   We don't think it'd be the iPhone.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.460]   You're right.
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:48.340]   One of the brilliant things about the iPod was that it just looked like a consumer device.
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:53.540]   They tried to redefine media player by saying, we are not going to call this an iMusic
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:54.540]   device.
[00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:57.580]   We are not even going to be putting a big, a big play button, a big next track and a
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.580]   big previous track button.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.660]   We're going to say, this is a brand new device.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:04.060]   Please do not use your old preconceptions when you use this.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:08.140]   As far as isolate, well, I think we are, we're all familiar with all the discovery that's
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.460]   been done by other journalists over the past couple of weeks discovering that Apple has,
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.020]   Apple owns Islate.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:18.740]   Apple has it did it through a dummy company called, I think called Slate Computing, waiting
[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:22.220]   was registered with their usual intellectual property attorneys.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.700]   There's a pretty strong paper trail going back, but that could be nothing.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.860]   I bet they were registered dozens of names all the time.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:29.860]   Right.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:30.860]   Exactly.
[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:31.860]   They hold a lot of different names.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:36.020]   They also own tablet Mac or tablet Macintosh for much the same reasons.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.020]   So who knows?
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.260]   I mean, the name is going to be the last thing in my mind.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:44.860]   If I get invited to a press event in San Francisco and in January.
[00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:46.460]   You're coming to that.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:48.260]   I'll find the money for that.
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.620]   And also, the first thing I'm going to be writing down is now, please tell me that it
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:52.620]   has a cool name.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:56.180]   I'm going to say, please tell me that I can take the one home with me today.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.620]   I have to say we have not received any invitations.
[00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.060]   Nobody I know has received an invitation.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.100]   So we don't know what's going to happen on January 26.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:08.260]   But even if we don't get invited, we will be standing outside the door with our tongues
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.260]   hanging out.
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:13.260]   Don't you think saying saying it's what's inside.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:15.620]   We're here outside.
[00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:18.220]   Evidently, something's going on inside.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.700]   We have no idea what.
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:20.940]   We're not special enough.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:22.540]   Well, that's the last two events.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.260]   We I didn't I didn't get an invite.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.760]   We're bitter.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.780]   Not that I'm bitter, but but we but what I did is I sent Dane the great Dane outside
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:36.060]   with a cardboard box, a laptop and a camera and the cardboard box being the key.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.420]   The cardboard box, well, that was for the laptop and a little stool.
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.580]   I think he had a little stool.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.260]   I offered I offered something more, but he wanted to be he liked the austere.
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.420]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.180]   It looked like he was begging to be honest.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.180]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:52.100]   You might as well had a sign that said, you know, we'll we'll we'll podcast for food or
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.660]   something, but in retrospect, Leo, do you think it was a little misleading to have them
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:59.300]   referred to it on air as Twit Mobile Chopper one?
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.740]   We're here above Moscone Center.
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.980]   Oh, no, we got we part of the other news.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.780]   All you have to do is hammer his chest a little bit.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.780]   All right.
[00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:11.780]   We're going to take a break.
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:12.780]   Come back with your picks of the week.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:18.580]   Gentlemen ready your picks while we listen to a little gangster rap for all the Mac folks.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.020]   This is PC pain.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.620]   You might have you might recognize the tune here.
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.860]   This is we call it.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.860]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.380]   Oh, for Mac book.
[00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:32.940]   Now who should I share this with?
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:37.220]   Pete and PC pain.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.220]   Two.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.220]   Oh, ****.
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.220]   Get your laptops ready.
[00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.220]   It's about to go down.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.220]   Everybody on YouTube.
[00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.220]   Watch the **** screen.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:45.220]   But still on this **** age.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   We're running the ****.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.220]   Let's go.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:49.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.220]   Everybody look at me.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.220]   Cause I'm clicking on the Mac.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.220]   Everybody look at me.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:56.220]   Cause I'm clicking on the Mac.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:46:59.220]   Everybody look at me.
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.220]   Cause I'm clicking on the Mac.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:03.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:04.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.220]   Take a good one.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.220]   Look at the **** you're Mac.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.220]   I'm on the Mac.
[00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:08.220]   Take a look at me.
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:09.220]   Straight.
[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.220]   I'm holding on.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.220]   Got the 3G.
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:12.220]   Open eye.
[00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.220]   Dudes.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.220]   Cover float of the exact.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.220]   You can't stop me ****.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.220]   Cause I'm on a Mac.
[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:18.220]   Bro.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:19.220]   You rocking eight cores hard.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:20.220]   Watch the screen go.
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.220]   I got my super drives.
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.220]   And my mighty mices.
[00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:23.220]   I'm plucking girls.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.220]   You can't stop me ****.
[00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:26.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.220]   Bro.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:28.220]   You rocking eight cores hard.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.220]   Watch the screen go.
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.220]   I got my super drives.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:31.220]   I'm plucking girls.
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.220]   You at work.
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.220]   Plugging into vices.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.220]   I'm on a tandem fixie.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.220]   And a 64-bit.
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:36.220]   Friends of jealous.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.220]   Cause parallels can run their ****.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:38.220]   But this ain't easy.
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.220]   This is real as it gets.
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.220]   I'm on a Mac.
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.220]   Don't you ever forget.
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.220]   I'm on a Mac and it's running fast and I'm allowing me a green green scuba sleeve shell.
[00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.220]   I'm the king of the job.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:46.220]   Zone of Mac for real.
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:47.220]   If you're on a PC, then you're not CEO.
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:48.220]   Get back.
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:49.220]   Don't you ever forget.
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:50.220]   I'm on a Mac and it's running fast and I'm balling the up-ream scream.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.220]   Screw my sleeve shell.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.220]   I'm the king of the job.
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:53.220]   Zone of Mac for real.
[00:47:53.220 --> 00:48:00.220]   If you're on a PC, then you're not CEO.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:01.220]   Get the **** off.
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.220]   This Mac is real.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.220]   Cause you're not on the Mac.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.220]   **** off.
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.220]   All right, Glenn, you won't be touched.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.220]   **** off.
[00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.220]   **** off.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:10.220]   I can't with my voice **** off.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.220]   This turtle next ain't **** off.
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.220]   Hey, y'all know I'm an apple wiz.
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.220]   I never need to learn what a driver is.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:24.220]   Going to say goodbye to all viruses like a nano and pink.
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:29.220]   Anything is possible.
[00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:30.220]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.220]   Never thought I'd be on a Mac.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:37.220]   Well, I guess we're all just so happy.
[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.220]   I'd like to help out our listeners.
[00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.220]   I'm sure not for our listeners, but you can spread it to other people.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:47.220]   Like if you're going to be in a body suit like that for a camera's YouTube video
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.220]   or a Comic-Con two worlds.
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:55.220]   There's a very easily obtained and expensive undergraphic known as a dance belt.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:49:01.220]   Yes, because normally war to keep certain details of your, let's say, of your personal
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:05.220]   life from being broadcast to the entire two words.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.220]   You can find it practically everywhere folks.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:10.220]   That's kind of hard.
[00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:11.220]   That video.
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:13.220]   It's like I'm keep looking down.
[00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:16.220]   It's like, so it looks like Mr. Mac dresses to the left.
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.220]   Does he?
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.220]   Okay.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:22.220]   Aren't you glad you didn't watch this on the video?
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:24.220]   That is on YouTube.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.220]   It's I'm on a Mac.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:27.220]   You can search for it PC.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.220]   How many views?
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.220]   Pain.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.220]   That's a good question.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:31.220]   Let me see if I can.
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:32.220]   It's cute.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:36.220]   I mean, I'm going to see like after the next Steve Jobs keynote or how long we're going
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:40.220]   to have to wait before we see the first auto tune Steve Jobs on.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:41.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.220]   105,000 views so far, but it just went up yesterday.
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.220]   So that's pretty quick.
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.220]   Get 105,000 views.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:52.220]   And it's painless nights.
[00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:54.220]   Well, appropriately.
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:59.220]   Switch to Mac.com.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.220]   All right.
[00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:01.220]   Coming up in just a bit.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.220]   Our picks of the week and you're not going to believe mine.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:07.220]   Well, you guys know it's a doozy.
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.220]   It's a doozy.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:13.220]   But before we get to that, it's almost as revealing as that video was actually.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.220]   Before we get to that, audible.com/macbreak.
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.220]   That's the place to go to get your free audio book right now from Audible.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:24.220]   Audible is of course the wonderful source of audio books that we have been telling you
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:25.220]   about for some time.
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.220]   I hope you've checked them out by now.
[00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:30.220]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:36.220]   I started with audio books, you know, in 1997 I think when I started actually even before
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:40.220]   then when I had a long commute, I went down to Cupertino for a while to do a TV show for
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.220]   Ziff Davis.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.220]   And that was like a six hour commute.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:48.220]   I had to have audio books.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.220]   And I've been listening to them ever since.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:54.220]   But when Audible came along, it just transformed my experience because all of a sudden I could
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:51:02.220]   go to a website Audible.com and browse 65,000 books, pick the one I want, and a minute later
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.220]   have it on my iPhone or my iPod.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.220]   If you've got a Zoom, it works on that.
[00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:09.220]   The Kindle, almost any of these MP3 players.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.220]   Great quality.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:14.220]   In fact, they're four different or five different audio types.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:18.220]   So if you want a smaller file but lower quality, you can type type one all the way up to the
[00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:21.220]   enhanced, which is perfect quality, CD quality.
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:23.220]   It sounds so good.
[00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:30.220]   Audible.com/MacBreak and Andy and NOTCO, you I think have been browsing through your Audible
[00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.220]   library looking for something suitable.
[00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:38.220]   Yes, now is the time of month when I get my Audible credit from my Audible Gold account.
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:42.220]   I spend the month shopping putting things into my wish list.
[00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.220]   This one is a book I've been looking forward to reading and listening to for a good long
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:47.220]   time.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.220]   It's called Googled, the End of the World as we know it.
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:55.220]   An excellent, excellent recent book on the history and the importance of Google.
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.220]   I've read the first couple of chapters digitally.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:05.220]   I also heard a really great interview with Ken Aulleta, the author of the book.
[00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:11.220]   From what I've read and from what I've heard about it from now, it's a great balance between
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:18.220]   a factual based history of the company, a very insightful look into why it is so important
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.220]   and what this company is up to.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:25.220]   But the thing that sets it apart from the rest is the fact that it tries to psychoanalyze
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:26.220]   the company as a personality.
[00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:28.220]   Companies do have personalities.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:33.220]   You can think of them as one single person that they're things that they're capable of
[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:34.220]   doing.
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.220]   They're just psychotic.
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:39.220]   And sometimes they aren't deep psychotic.
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:43.220]   Google is like Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory.
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:49.220]   That's the point that Aulleta makes in that they often do things that are completely harmful
[00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:51.220]   to a lot of different people.
[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:54.820]   But they do it because not because they want to harm people, but because they think they're
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:55.820]   doing what's best.
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:53:02.900]   Just like if you ever had a Brainiac borderline Asperger's roommate who you come home from
[00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:06.780]   a trip one day and you find out that everything in your refrigerator, like all the cooks,
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:10.740]   all the cakes, all the meats have been cleared out, replaced with these really weird little
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:11.740]   boxes.
[00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:15.060]   They say, oh, I improved everything in our refrigerator.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.780]   It turns out that the food that we had was taking up way too much space.
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:19.580]   It wasn't giving us calories and nutrition.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.060]   So I found this tofu product.
[00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.380]   I found this mineral enhanced artificial base gel.
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.060]   And you can't argue with their logic.
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.340]   It does take up less space.
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:29.780]   It is more nutritious, but that's not what I wanted.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.540]   That's not something that I really wish would have happened.
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:35.940]   And those that seems to be endemic of the lot of decisions that Google makes that will
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:39.860]   do something like we're going to give away an operating system.
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.580]   Okay, but it's not a really good operating system.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:43.980]   Oh, it's perfectly functional.
[00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:46.980]   Yes, but you don't understand why people select operating systems.
[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:51.020]   And you're also making it more difficult for companies who, like Apple, who want to put
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.260]   together a really good looking forward operating system.
[00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.340]   It's going to be harder to make the business case to put that to market.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:53:58.820]   But this is so much better.
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:00.340]   I know that on paper it's better.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.380]   Well, I want to do is help you.
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:03.780]   I don't know why you still want to grab.
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.820]   Why does all mean that's a logical way?
[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:08.660]   You're suing me.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.060]   So it's a very, very readable book.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:11.980]   Again, I've only seen that.
[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.780]   I've only read the first two or three chapters of it.
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.940]   I love Ken all that.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:19.860]   I mean, he's he's written so many great articles about the media for New Yorker magazine.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.860]   Many, many great books.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.740]   He's one of those analysts, you know, he totally, not only does he totally get it, but he's
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.220]   a really good writer.
[00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:30.300]   He understands that I'm not just here to consume information.
[00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:35.380]   I'm here to be told a story and even a story that's not fiction and totally factual, you're
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.380]   telling me a story and they do it.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:40.940]   He does a great job of building this character known as Google.
[00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:42.140]   Googled.
[00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:45.660]   The end of the world as we know it by Ken Oleta, it's unabridged.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.180]   It's available and audible and it's yours free right now.
[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:52.420]   If you go to audible.com/macbreak, but you know, you could pick any of the books on here.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.420]   You get it.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.300]   But basically what happens is you're going to sign up for the gold account, which is
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.660]   a book a month.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.660]   The first one's free.
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:58.660]   You cancel it anytime.
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.140]   You get to keep the book.
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:04.340]   I have a feeling though, once you start listening to audible books, you're going to have a
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:06.420]   very healthy habit that you will keep for life.
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:11.300]   I listen to audible everywhere I go in the car, at the gym, even when I'm just going
[00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:12.300]   out shopping.
[00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:13.300]   I love it.
[00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:14.300]   Audible.com/macbreak.
[00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:16.540]   Get your first book free right now.
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.900]   And we thank audible for their support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.900]   I'm going to do something I rarely do.
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:24.420]   I'm going to start the pick of the week.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.060]   Usually I let you guys go first in case we overlap.
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:28.580]   But I know you're not doing what this.
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.020]   I'm the only one doing this.
[00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:33.340]   I know I have an exclusive on it.
[00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:36.580]   But I have a feeling Alex may be doing it soon.
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:37.580]   Oh yeah.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.780]   So I found, I was invited actually.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:46.180]   You know, Pud, Philip Kaplan, the guy who started Freaked Company or F'd Company.
[00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:50.460]   He has a new site that he's started with a couple of other people called blippi.com.
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:51.460]   It's not public yet.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.420]   I was invited into the private beta.
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:54.980]   But soon you'll be able to do it.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:56:00.740]   The whole idea of blippi.com is it's a Twitter that your credit card, your Amazon account,
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:03.940]   your Netflix, announce what you've purchased.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:04.940]   So you don't.
[00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.940]   I don't think that's a good idea for me.
[00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:09.860]   There is no way I would put that make that.
[00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:11.460]   It's pretty cool.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:14.820]   What you do is you follow people just as you would on Twitter and see what they purchase.
[00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:15.820]   You can comment on it.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.820]   You can like it.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:17.820]   You can favor it.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:19.940]   But even more, you get some great ideas for it.
[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.380]   You know, includes your iTunes account.
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.900]   You can see what they're listening to, their Netflix account.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:24.900]   So you can see what they're watching.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:25.900]   I really like this.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:33.020]   And one of the things I saw on it, Pud was buying this scale, this bathroom scale.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.900]   In fact, he wasn't the first to buy it.
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.940]   About five people on blippi have bought it.
[00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:40.820]   And I fell for it because it's such a great idea.
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:46.260]   It's called, it's a withings W-I-T-H-I-N-G-S-Y-F-I scale.
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:49.580]   Now, I should tell you, $159 is not cheap.
[00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:51.180]   I would have bought this in a second when I bought it.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:52.620]   I bought a Bluetooth scale.
[00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:54.300]   Now I feel like, and that was advanced.
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:55.300]   It was advanced.
[00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:56.300]   It is Wi-Fi enabled.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:00.260]   If I had known that there was a Wi-Fi scale, I would have left my Bluetooth scale like,
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.780]   you know, in the trash.
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:08.260]   So when you first get this scale, it has a USB port.
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.380]   It's a lot like that black cube, actually, from Nokia.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:15.100]   It's shiny, beautiful, it really looks good.
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:18.340]   You hook it, now you can, it has an iPhone app and you can configure it with the iPhone
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:19.340]   app.
[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:23.540]   If you don't have the iPhone app yet, you can also configure it using the USB port connects
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.540]   to a Mac or Windows.
[00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.180]   You download the software.
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:33.740]   You set up the Wi-Fi, the scale uses four AAA batteries, and now it's on your Wi-Fi network.
[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:39.700]   Now you have an account on withings.com, and you can share when you weigh yourself.
[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:40.820]   You can share your data.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:43.620]   You can share it with other users on the withings site.
[00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:46.500]   You could publish it on the web and bet it on your web page.
[00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:49.140]   But this is the part I like.
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.700]   You can put it on your Twitter.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:54.820]   I actually created a Twitter account just for my scale.
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.300]   People aren't forced to see my way.
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:58.700]   You know, I thought about doing this when I started losing weight.
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:57:59.700]   And I should have.
[00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:01.660]   It's a very brave thing to do.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:02.660]   Yeah.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:04.060]   I mean, because, you know, you're living in public here.
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:08.820]   So I have Twitter.com/leoscale.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.620]   And now I only got it yesterday.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:16.060]   So it's only got every time you weigh yourself, it automatically tweets your weight.
[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:20.420]   But it also has a really great web page that will show you your progress.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:25.740]   It also measures your fat percentage of fat.
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:29.500]   So for instance, I know that I'm 29.7% fat.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.460]   And I should really be getting that down to what Alex 10 or 15%.
[00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:33.860]   46 pounds of fat.
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:35.660]   12, 15, I think is the target.
[00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:39.820]   I'm 46 pounds of fat, only 155 pounds of lean tissue.
[00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.300]   So I want to get that down.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.140]   And you see my weight is way out of the range too.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:44.340]   So they show you the range.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:45.780]   They show you your graph.
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:48.340]   You could share it with Google Health, which is kind of interesting.
[00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:50.260]   That's one of the things you can link to it.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.500]   So it can be part of your Google Health record.
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:55.140]   But I thought the thing that I really--
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.060]   and it's a beautiful scale, by the way.
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:05.620]   I mean, it's a really gorgeous kind of piano black, shiny scale with a really great readout
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:07.060]   that's easy to see.
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:11.820]   And it's the first scale I've seen that has a iPhone app.
[00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:16.660]   So you can also, as I said, you can configure it with your iPhone.
[00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:20.700]   But you can also go to the iPhone-- let me go to the iPhone here and show you.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:26.460]   You can also see your measurements on the iPhone and see how you're doing.
[00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:27.980]   And it's a beautiful interface.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.900]   Now, negative, 159 bucks.
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:34.260]   The other negative is-- well, you're telling the world that you're fat.
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:35.100]   TMI.
[00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:36.100]   TMI.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:36.980]   That's the negative.
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.140]   It's a TMI.
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.460]   But it's really fun.
[00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:45.580]   And I think that this is going to incent me because, frankly, every time I weigh myself,
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.100]   there's no button to push on it, by the way.
[00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:48.100]   It just tweets.
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:51.060]   It definitely helped me because I have to admit that once I started talking about it on air--
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:51.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.660]   I felt like there was a serious pressure.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:54.260]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:58.860]   And by the way, according to my scale, Hartwell says, I gained 0.2 pounds in the last 12 hours.
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:02.900]   At that rate, I should weigh about 330 pounds by January 1st, 2011.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.260]   It's going the wrong way.
[01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.820]   But that's, as you know, Alex.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820]   It goes up.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.340]   It goes down.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:10.260]   I have fluctuate bluster minus well.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.260]   It's fluctuate.
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:12.260]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:13.260]   A couple of tenths of a pound.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.540]   We're looking for the overall.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.100]   So follow my scale.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.180]   It has its own Twitter account.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.180]   Leo's underscaled.
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.380]   Leo's going to have more followers than me by the end of the week.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:24.180]   I already got 549 followers.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.180]   I know, I was like--
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:27.980]   This is stupid.
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:31.420]   And your scale is following seven people.
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.220]   Yeah, I don't know how that happened.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.860]   It's following the gizwiz, my daughter, my dog, and Kristen Sanford.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:37.860]   So the scale is good to--
[01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.340]   I wonder if you have the scales follow each other.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:40.340]   So then it goes.
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:44.420]   So then it would say Leo is doing much better than you.
[01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:45.580]   Scale trash talk.
[01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:46.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.580]   Exactly.
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:51.260]   Does it have a look at Don Rickles mode or twill tweet one at a time?
[01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:55.020]   You can have multiple-- it can show you multiple graphs.
[01:00:55.020 --> 01:00:56.300]   Here's where Alex is.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.300]   Here's where Leo is.
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:58.580]   That's a great idea.
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:00.500]   You can add other people to your scale, by the way.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.500]   It's not just you.
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.260]   You can have other members of your family.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.300]   And you don't have to tweet.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.660]   You can totally control--
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:08.660]   You have to calculate combined loss.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.660]   You guys lost.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.660]   That'd be great.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.660]   Do you have a group and all of that?
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.660]   That'd be really cool.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.660]   I think that's a great idea.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:17.060]   Then what you should do is put electrodes in it so that any time you go up, it gives
[01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:18.060]   you a little shock.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:20.060]   A little reinforced.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.060]   It's a nice UI.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:23.460]   I mean, these guys-- I think they're in France.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.380]   Somebody told me they're in France.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:27.860]   The more you gain, the more you get in shock.
[01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:28.860]   It does.
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:31.860]   That's how it measures your fat percentage, though, is it does send a small electrical
[01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.540]   current through your feet.
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:38.220]   So if it sends a little more through your feet, Alex is having way too much fun planning
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.860]   additions to this scale.
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.660]   I could see you and your son are going to rewire your withings.
[01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.660]   No, no, no.
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.580]   Here's the next Arduino project.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:52.620]   You set up the scale so it's at the top of an incline on top of your treadmill.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.340]   And so when you step on the scale, it'll just keep-- depending on how much you weigh the
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.420]   last time, it'll just keep going until it figures you've lost and they might have been
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:59.980]   against your next goal.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:05.860]   I do want to-- if you are also doing this, send me an email or something, telling me--
[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:09.300]   I'm going to make a list on my scale with all the other scales on Twitter.
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:13.300]   Yeah, we have a scale list so people could follow all the scales.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.300]   I'm getting one.
[01:02:14.300 --> 01:02:15.300]   I'm getting one.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:16.300]   I'll get one.
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.300]   I'll get one.
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.780]   But not only owns his own, but he gave one to a friend.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:23.700]   So I think it's ridiculous.
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.700]   I know I know.
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.700]   It's ridiculous.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.700]   It's just absurd.
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:29.020]   I'm just updating that list of things that my grandparents would never understand.
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:30.020]   My parents would never understand.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.020]   No one.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.020]   Parents.
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.220]   I'm telling you, we live in the future.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.220]   We're time travelers.
[01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.220]   Come to you from a time--
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.220]   I was a kid.
[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:42.220]   My mom once got really upset that I phoned into a radio contest because we were--
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.620]   "No, you're on-- oh, for-- hang on.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:45.620]   Hang on.
[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:46.620]   Oh, for God's sake.
[01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:47.620]   You're on the radio.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:48.620]   You're a kid."
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:49.620]   You're putting your weight.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:50.620]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:52.620]   Oh, was it a contest?
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.060]   Oh, it was like a name, that tune sort of contest.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.020]   I won a Marillion album, I believe.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:02.020]   Which even then I'd know-- who the hell's Marillion?
[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:03.020]   Marillion.
[01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:04.020]   You won?
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.020]   Anyway.
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.940]   So that's my pick of the week.
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:11.940]   It is withingswitngs.com.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:16.340]   I got it on Amazon for 159 withings, at least for Christmas, was offering it for that same
[01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:20.740]   price without shipping, free shipping.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:24.340]   And it's-- I don't know.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.380]   You know what's going to be embarrassing is if I don't lose weight.
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:28.380]   You've thrown the gauntlet down the gauntlet.
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:29.380]   I've thrown down the gauntlet.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.380]   That's the way to do it.
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:31.740]   That's the way to do it.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:33.580]   You're pick my friend Mr. Linzah.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:34.780]   I'm using my pick right now.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.820]   I noticed you're holding up your phone.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.420]   Is that-- like, does it have an X-ray vision?
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.060]   Are you seeing who might close?
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.100]   Are you looking for my underwear bomb?
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.100]   Is that what you're looking for?
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.100]   [GASP]
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.100]   What is that?
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.860]   Is that the newest thing from the TSA?
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:51.780]   Yes, this is evidently all TSA folks are going to have an iPhone soon.
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:54.340]   And it will have an X-ray in it.
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:58.580]   And they will attempt to keep this private so that the public does not have an X-ray in
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.060]   their iPhone, but it will not work.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.580]   And then people will be upset.
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:04.180]   People, little kids will be walking around the street going like this.
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.340]   No, so this is quick.com.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.340]   Oh, quick?
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.580]   It's been available on a lot of phones.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:15.020]   And up until today, or yesterday, or sometime soon, quick, you could only record something
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.020]   and then upload it.
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.020]   Yeah, because that's all I had.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.540]   I had everybody that I pulled out my quick and that's all I could do.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:20.540]   You kind of like--
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:21.540]   You were doing it.
[01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:23.540]   You could do it.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.540]   Two words.
[01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:25.540]   Upload your back at Stan's Bell.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.540]   So is there anyway.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.540]   So they--
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.540]   Another show title.
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:32.540]   A show's laden with titles.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:36.580]   So anyway, so the-- so this is live though.
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:40.900]   So if you go to quick.com/AlexLonzie-- not if you're listening to the recording, but
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:41.900]   if you're going live--
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.500]   Well, you'll be able to see the video that you're recording after the fact saves it
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.500]   and showing around.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.900]   So but right now it's live.
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.900]   And it's a little choppy.
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:52.740]   I think that the bandwidth here is not the public bandwidth.
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.340]   That's because we have three other people quicking as well.
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:56.340]   Pretty well, same time.
[01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:59.020]   Everybody's quicking at the same time.
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.020]   We've got lots of quicking.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:04.100]   Keith and Chris are both quicking as we spin.
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.420]   So there's a lot of quicking going on at the moment.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:09.260]   And so anyway, it's a cool little app.
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:12.620]   I mean, I don't know what I'm going to use it for, but I love the fact that if I wanted
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:13.620]   to I could pop up a lot.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:14.620]   If I was in a band--
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.620]   If I was in a one-teachable--
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.620]   I'm telling you do this.
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:17.620]   This would be awesome.
[01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:22.780]   So yeah, no, there's a bunch of people there have been a lot of people watching either
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:23.780]   on and off.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.780]   It's so choppy right now.
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.780]   I think they just mostly go on and go, wow.
[01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.780]   It's cool.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.780]   And then they go off.
[01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:30.580]   But I'm glad that Quick finally made it to the iPhone.
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:31.580]   So I wanted to give them props.
[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:32.580]   Yeah, there's a chat room.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:35.060]   A little chat room that people can talk about it.
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.860]   So it's a slick idea.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:39.900]   I've been using it on the Droid and on my Nokia.
[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.540]   I think they've had this for a long time.
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:46.100]   It was just a long time to get Apple to give them the throughput to get it up.
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.660]   I think that was the issue.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:52.380]   Now one thing that does happen is even though if you watch it live and it's choppy, it does
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:54.940]   record in full frame.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:55.940]   And then upload it.
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.540]   So when you go back to watch it, I think you get better quality.
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:05:59.540]   I think it is.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.140]   It's highly compressed.
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.140]   That's the negative of it.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.140]   It's not super good quality.
[01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.340]   But hey, it's working.
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.340]   I'm seeing myself.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:10.060]   And when you're in a live situation where you want to do a live thing like this show.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.060]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.100]   And you don't, you know, it's something fun.
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:15.260]   We'll be using it in CES.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:18.300]   Yeah, I mean, I'm going to try to use it in CES as well just to kind of show some kind
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.300]   of fun.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.300]   I'll be using Vegas.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.580]   In fact, I think like an Al Franken little hat to wear it.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.580]   That's what I'm missing right now.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:28.100]   Like a little neck thing that a little hat with a can't with your iPhone stick out.
[01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:30.500]   So I can actually that be good if you had it in front of you.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.500]   Right.
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:32.900]   So it's just you're as you're walking around.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:36.780]   I could I could I think you I think you become well known as that guy.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.860]   In fact, I know how to do it too.
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.820]   I have have the tool for that.
[01:06:40.820 --> 01:06:43.020]   I think you could just put a gorilla pot around your neck.
[01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:44.020]   No, no, no, there's there's a company.
[01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:47.780]   There's a little a little stick that you actually put a phone on that stick.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.340]   And I put the stick on the.
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.540]   Oh, okay.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:51.740]   How can he do it?
[01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:52.740]   How could he do it, folks?
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:53.740]   I'm going to work on it.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.140]   I'm going to work on it.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:59.220]   The fish crew uses it to stream concerts, says Tyler Curtis fish fans.
[01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:00.780]   Well, there you go.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:01.780]   Yeah.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:02.780]   Yeah, you could do a lot of things.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:03.780]   I've streamed a lot.
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:07.700]   In fact, if you go to our page quick Q I K dot com slash twit.
[01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:08.700]   There's a lot of video there.
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.860]   I'm trying to meet me dropping my pants.
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.860]   Not intentionally.
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:16.300]   Well, see, yes, we'll be the I'll test some people are probably, you know, if you're just
[01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:20.940]   listening to show for the first time, you get a very bad impression of me.
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:21.940]   Like something's really wrong.
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:23.540]   All of us, of all of us.
[01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:24.860]   We're a little punchy today.
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:25.860]   Maybe that's it.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.860]   It's, you know, it's the holidays.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.860]   Is this the holiday show?
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:28.860]   This is a holiday show.
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:29.860]   We've had a little too much eggnog.
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:30.860]   Where's the eggnog?
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:33.300]   I got left out on that.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:35.740]   Alex, thank you for your pick.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:39.740]   You just go to the iPhone store and search for Q I K. Is it free?
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:40.740]   299.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:41.740]   299.
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:42.740]   It's fine.
[01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:43.740]   To Dada.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:48.260]   Now it's time for Mr. Andrew in not go and his pick any.
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:50.500]   I don't think I've picked this one before.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:54.940]   This is on this is in that category of I'm it's the day before the show or the morning
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:57.060]   of the show and I'm thinking about what I need to recommend.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:01.780]   I'm looking for things and then I forget to start looking at those icons inside my dock
[01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:07.420]   that I've been using every single day, every single week, but never even get sitting recommending.
[01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:13.060]   So my pick of the week is the ABBYY fine reader express edition from Acantosh.
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.540]   This is my favorite OCR app.
[01:08:15.540 --> 01:08:20.940]   I spent the with the past several months looking for good OCR apps for just about anything
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:26.660]   that would work and been very disappointed because it seems like it just seems like this
[01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:31.700]   category software category just ground to us thinking a halter on 2002, 2003 hasn't
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.940]   moved forward since nuanced bought everybody and then that was it.
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:35.940]   It was over.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:36.940]   Yeah.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:41.820]   And the the emergence of free OCR engines also sort of stagnated things because now there's
[01:08:41.820 --> 01:08:46.620]   not there's not a whole lot of money developing a really good OCR engine and because and I'm
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:49.940]   sorry, but this is this is true more often than it is not.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:54.460]   When something becomes open source, the idea of making it easy, simple and practical stops
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.740]   dead as long as it works, long as it be operated from a command line.
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.740]   Good.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:08:59.740]   We're done.
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:00.740]   It's perfect.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.740]   Let's stop working on this.
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:04.980]   So but that absolutely changed when I came across ABBYY fine reader.
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.500]   It's not as good as an I app, but it's pretty darn close.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:15.420]   It turns the subject of turning either a three page document or 300 page book into an E text
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:20.460]   or to a board to a PDF or to a word or an RTF or anything into a very, very simple and
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:22.300]   streamlined process.
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.620]   You just scan all it.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:25.700]   You can do it all within the application.
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.580]   Just scan all your pages in.
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.940]   It will do the OCR in one big long percolation.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:35.980]   You walk away for a few minutes and come back and you have E text, but what makes it head
[01:09:35.980 --> 01:09:40.500]   and shoulders above the others is that if you are trying to process a long document,
[01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:44.020]   there is no software that can really do it in one go.
[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:48.460]   Even the really expensive stuff, if you're trying to OCR a book, it's supposed to be
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:52.220]   smart enough to tell the difference between the page headers and the page footers, the
[01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.860]   title and the author, the page numbers, but it really is not going to be 100%.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:02.140]   Also, if it's one of those books where you're reading along, reading along, then they reproduce
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.140]   a letter.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:07.940]   It's in italics and there's a date here and a little subscript over there.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.540]   It's probably going to screw that up too.
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:13.580]   The next step is definitely going to be going through, go through this page by page and just
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:16.620]   help the program along a little bit.
[01:10:16.620 --> 01:10:21.620]   Fine Reader does the best job of this part of the process where you just simply draw rectangles
[01:10:21.620 --> 01:10:23.300]   around.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:27.900]   It takes very intelligent guesses as to the parts of the page that it's supposed to OCR
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:30.100]   and the parts that it's supposed to leave alone.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:35.740]   It does a great job of showing you what it's thinking on a page by page basis and then occasionally
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:38.940]   letting you say, letting you go through an occasional say, "Oh, no, actually, they screwed
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:39.940]   up.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:40.940]   That's actually just a piece of artwork.
[01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:41.940]   Don't try to OCR that.
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:42.940]   Just include that as a text."
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:45.540]   I find that I can give a 300-page document.
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:51.260]   I can easily process after it's been OCR through this interface, second process, a page every
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:54.740]   three or four seconds because it's very very, yep, good, good, good, good.
[01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:55.740]   Oh, fix that.
[01:10:55.740 --> 01:10:56.740]   Good, good, good, good.
[01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:58.740]   Oh, should have OCR that.
[01:10:58.740 --> 01:10:59.740]   Good, good.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:07.260]   us not text. There's no way to make the process of OCRing an entire book painless, but the goal
[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:13.580]   is to turn it into dull drudgery. Kind of like crochet in Afghan. It's not meant to be an
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:17.820]   intellectually stimulating challenge. It's meant to be something that you just a repetitive task
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:23.020]   that's almost meditative in nature. With this app, it's very, very easy to, after you've got
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:28.700]   everything scanned in, to just go back in, put on a good movie, or a couple episodes of good tv show
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:33.260]   and within an hour, within an hour and a half, you will have, you will fine tune this OCR and
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:38.940]   turn it into a really good ebook. So that's what I, it's, it's past the point of my experimenting.
[01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:43.020]   And now it's every time I've got a long book that I want to put on my Kindle or I want to put on my
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:48.140]   iPhone, I just use this tool and I expect it to work. It's 99 bucks. It's not, it's not
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:53.980]   freeware, but you definitely get what you pay for. This is an actually useful OCR app, as opposed to
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:59.180]   the free and well, you know, all you got to do is write a little Python script. No, I don't want
[01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:01.580]   to write a Python script. I want a useful piece of stuff.
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:10.140]   And there is, there's Windows version too. So you need to go to products and then look for the
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.140]   Mac version. Right, exactly. They're very popular in the Windows world as well.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:22.220]   Abbey, ABB, YY, fine reader, 10. Hey, Alex, I'm just looking and there are two quicks on
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:30.140]   the iTunes store. You want quick live live and it is free. Is it free? It's free. Oh, I bought a
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:34.220]   time-lapse software right after it. Okay. That's $2.99. Never mind. This one's
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:37.820]   free. That's for this week of photography next week. Yeah. So do with, you know, I have,
[01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:42.060]   I had on here, that's what was, I was trying to do it quick for three GS, but that wasn't it.
[01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:47.900]   Okay. It's live live. Okay. So especially as a free app, it sounds like one of those many apps
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:53.260]   that I will, I can't imagine a use for it right now, but I will download it and install it because
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:57.500]   maybe in two weeks or two months time, I'll be somewhere watching something happen.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:02.940]   Exactly. Damn it. I wish I had the quick application up and going. I was, I was, I was in Boston for
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:07.580]   an appointment meeting a few months ago. Didn't I didn't even know that Obama was going to be
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:10.300]   coming through town. And well, what do you know, I was sitting on the street corner where the
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:13.740]   motorcade was passing by. Yes. That would, that would, that would have been to do live.
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:19.500]   You could be an eye reporter. Exactly. Yeah. I could be Edison Carter. Edison Carter,
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.540]   I reporter so quick live. Yeah. I think it's your absolute rights. Worth
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:25.820]   installing, setting up a quick account. It's free. I think, I think playing around with it. I think
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:29.340]   there's going to be some, you know, that's the kind of thing, exactly what Andy's got. I've had it for
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:32.860]   a long time and I only do it once in a while. I want to have it available. So if there is a news
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:37.260]   event that I want to start streaming something immediately, you know, because something's happening,
[01:13:38.060 --> 01:13:41.420]   I like the idea that I already have it set up. You know, you know, when those kind of things happen,
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:46.700]   you know, no truth to rumor that they're going to build that into my scale because that you really
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:57.020]   don't want that. Little tea, that's TMI. Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, you have been listening to
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:02.540]   another episode, another thrilling gripping edition of Mac Break Weekly. You could find this show on
[01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:07.500]   iTunes in audio soon to be video. We're working on it after we get back from CES. We will solve
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:11.980]   the technical issues. There were some, well, what's happening is that the video that we're putting
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.220]   out plays on the 3GS and up, but nothing below, doesn't work on an iPod. And so we're working on
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:24.300]   that. But you can get the video high and low quality at twit.tv. We're also on YouTube, youtube.com/twit.
[01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:28.860]   There's a Mac Break Weekly playlist. And we're getting it now to where it's almost a 24-hour turnaround.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:33.740]   We're getting faster and faster working on that. So you can't get your video version,
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:37.660]   your fix of this show. And of course, you can always watch live every Tuesday afternoon, 2PM
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:46.940]   Pacific. I'm sorry, 2PM Eastern, 11AM Pacific, live.twit.tv. Alex Lindsey is at the pixelcore.com
[01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:53.500]   for that great guild of multimedia artists who live, work and play together. Pixelcore.tv for the
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:58.780]   many podcasts you do. And we're talking about doing some very interesting new podcasts. We're
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:03.660]   stressing ideas for a couple of good ones that I really like the idea for. But we won't say
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.860]   because people steal. Not until we do it. Yeah, we've learned that lesson boy. Oh man.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:18.220]   Andy and I go at the Chicago Sun times and also of course his website, www.cwob.com, the
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.860]   celestial waste of bandwidth. Thank you, sir. All the best to you. We'll see you in the new year.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:27.980]   Happy new year, everybody. Another, what do I say? Get back to work. Get back to work.
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:39.420]   Break time is over. See ya.
