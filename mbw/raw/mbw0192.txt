[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.560]   It's time for Macbreak Weekly, the stolen iPhone edition.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.360]   And joining us, we've got, I think, finally,
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.000]   the definitive panel to talk about this and all the Mac
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.920]   News this week, starting in the upper left corner
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.480]   of the block.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.880]   Mr. Alex Lindsey, who was in Zimbabwe today,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.760]   but couldn't miss this episode.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.280]   It was just-- we thought that there was going to be no news
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280]   to burn down that there.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.200]   It was, but yeah, I'm here in Harari Zimbabwe, which the news
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.080]   got here probably almost as fast as it got there.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.960]   Yeah, probably did.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.520]   A little bit of news.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.960]   Because actually, the big breaking story,
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   we knew about-- it happened on Friday.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.400]   We didn't know about it until Monday.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.800]   But we'll get to that in a second.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.200]   And next in the rotation, Andy Inako from the Chicago
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.240]   Sun Times and the Celestial Waste of Bandwidth.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.000]   Are you still chewing?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.320]   I'm not hearing you, Andy.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.320]   You're muted.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.120]   Hello.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.680]   There you go.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.960]   There he is.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.000]   There he is.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.080]   I muted my hardware, Mike, but apparently,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.760]   Sky decided that no, he's probably not
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.960]   going to say anything in the similar--
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.040]   We'll keep it muted.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.720]   Let's just keep it muted.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.680]   We'll keep it muted.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.560]   It's good to have you, Andy.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.320]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.360]   Good to be here, as always.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.280]   Good to have you.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.520]   Now, we thought we really ought to get some expertise
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.040]   in the picture here today.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.440]   Not that we are in an expert panel,
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.600]   but wouldn't it be nice?
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.520]   We've often thought this.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.200]   Wouldn't it be nice to have an attorney, an actual practicing
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   attorney on the panel?
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.000]   Unfortunately, though, you're invalidating
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.080]   this entire discussion about this iPhone thing.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.160]   Because if you have actual legal experts--
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.080]   What am I going to talk about?
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.800]   --the applicants.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.400]   I mean, sorry, because you're supposed
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.880]   to just have someone who has an uncle who has an attorney who
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.680]   is an attorney who said, you know what?
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.480]   California statute number A for THX, 1138, clearly states.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.880]   Well, Denise Howell knows better.
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.440]   She's here.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.320]   She is from this week in law blog, a practicing attorney,
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.040]   and the author of the--
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.760]   is it "bag and baggage" blog?
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.440]   And "bag and baggage" this week in law podcast here on--
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.560]   This week in law podcast and blogarithms on ZDNet.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.440]   Yes, hello.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.120]   And if it makes you feel any better, Andy,
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.160]   I don't actually practice criminal law.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.200]   So I'm speculating along with the rest of you.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.640]   Really?
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.600]   Oh, how disappointing.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.080]   You will still be citing episodes of Star Trek,
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.600]   the next generation, as your citations, though.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.920]   I expect that's what I plan to do.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.400]   I'll try.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.560]   Also with this, John Gruber, who has dropped off.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.280]   Let's get him.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.880]   Why were you just not having a good start today?
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.400]   I'd have to start the whole thing over.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.040]   John Gruber is a blogger at DaringFireball.net
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.120]   and has been covering this since day one.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.320]   Hey, I think I'm back.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.000]   He's back.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.120]   So John, it's good to have you.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.760]   John has really been doing a swell job of covering this.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.480]   Let me ask before we begin, John, a lot of people speculate
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.840]   that you have some magic resources, some sort of insight
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.680]   tunnel to Apple on this matter.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.640]   Do you?
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.160]   No, nothing at all.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.440]   Honestly, it's armchair lawyering.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.000]   But I think the big thing is that everybody
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.120]   is looking at this the wrong way.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.520]   I think right and starting with gizmodo themselves
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.560]   and the way they acted, that they're acting like this
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.560]   is a typical leak of information.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.800]   And that's not what law enforcement is looking at this as.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.840]   Well, let's start with Denise, who, despite her protostations,
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.040]   knows a hell of a lot more about this than any of us.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.520]   Actually, I'll do a quick recap of the latest.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.760]   It started, of course, a couple of weeks ago
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.520]   when Engadget first showed pictures,
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.640]   and then gizmodo claimed to have possession
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.120]   of the fourth generation iPhone, the provenance of which
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.000]   is somewhat cloudy.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.160]   But gizmodo says it was lost by an Apple engineer
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.400]   at a Hofbrou.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.200]   He was drinking during his birthday.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.920]   Someone found it, looked for the owner, couldn't find him,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.040]   so then offered it in sequence to Engadget and gizmodo.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.560]   Gizmodo's Nick Denton from Gawker says he paid $5,000
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.000]   for the phone.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.120]   Jason Chen did a number of stories on it, including pictures.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.840]   Took it apart.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.760]   Apple wrote a letter saying, we want it back.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.880]   Gizmodo apparently gave it back.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.360]   Then the newest news, Friday, detectives from React,
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.840]   which is a high-tech law enforcement team
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.400]   that is composed of a number of different agencies
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.920]   in the Silicon Valley.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.760]   About 8.30 at night, raided Jason Chen's home.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.200]   Jason and his wife came home to find law enforcement in there.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.320]   They said they'd been there for a couple of hours.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.560]   He showed him a letter that Gawker's COO and Chief Counsel
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.960]   had given him saying that he was covered by the shield laws.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.760]   The detective confiscated that along with four computers,
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.240]   his business cards--
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.880]   not sure why his business cards--
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.080]   his iPad, a lot of material from his house
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.600]   they've taken off with material.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   Gawker still says we're protected by shield laws.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   Big debate, of course, on the internet.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.920]   When this news came out, by the way,
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.080]   didn't come out until Monday.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.280]   Over A, whether a crime was committed by Gizmodo,
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.200]   the detectives say from the San Mateo police
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   force say that they are not accusing Jason
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.480]   or Gizmodo of any criminal act they're investigating.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.960]   All they're doing is investigating.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.480]   Are those the facts, Denise, pretty much?
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.520]   Yeah, pretty good.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.320]   There, Leo.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.400]   My best.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.400]   The React rapid enforcement allied computer team,
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.560]   I almost expect Kip from Knight Rider
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.480]   to be pulling up to Jason's house.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.560]   No kidding.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.240]   With these guys.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.880]   And one little detail that I think
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.440]   is kind of an interesting and important one
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.760]   is I don't think the letter that you're referring to that
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.000]   Gizmodo published on its blog, their response to the search
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   warrant, was after the fact.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.880]   He had an email from--
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.240]   Right, right, right, right, right,
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.120]   which I think is really interesting,
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.480]   because somehow, Gawker had noticed
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.200]   that this was going down.
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.760]   When did the police ever give you notice
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.320]   that they're going to search your home with a criminal search
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.640]   warrant?
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.200]   Does it seem unusually proactive?
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.480]   I mean, if I were the chief counsel,
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.600]   I might knowing that the shield laws are--
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.760]   by the way, the shield laws say,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.000]   do they not that you should have a written letter saying,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.520]   I'm protected by the shield laws in your possession?
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.760]   I actually don't know that off the top.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.040]   I read that in--
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.160]   I was looking at the codes, and I
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.880]   think it's the California code.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.240]   And I believe it said something to the effect of,
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.840]   upon written notice, they're supposed to withdraw.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.800]   There's something we need to parse here, though,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.720]   because the shield law is getting confused here--
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.880]   There's two laws.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.640]   Right.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.560]   The other law is the law that governs issuing a search warrant
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.160]   for whatever may be in your home.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.520]   And that's the one that's actually at issue here.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.680]   There is an exception to that law that says that if you're
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.880]   going to go after a warrant, it cannot be under the circumstances
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.080]   and it cannot be for the items specified in the shield law.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.560]   So the shield law is brought in indirectly.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.680]   The shield law comes up in the Valerie
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.400]   Plame Judith Miller kind of circumstance, right?
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.200]   So that's the case with Judith Miller, New York Times
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.280]   journalist, knew the identity of Valerie Plame,
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.080]   or actually had revealed the identity of Valerie Plame.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.360]   Right.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.040]   Covert CIA agents.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.320]   Refusing to reveal her sources and went to prison for that.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:08.760]   Right.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.440]   She was held in contempt for not revealing her sources.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.760]   And that's typically what happens.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.400]   And that's what shield laws are supposed to guard against.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.000]   So they're part of the evidence code.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.760]   They govern what evidence can come in at trial.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.960]   What we're talking now about is part of the penal code
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.760]   that governs when a search warrant can issue.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.160]   And I don't see any exception to this part of the penal code
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.440]   that says, oh, if you're investigating a crime involving
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.960]   the journalist, then it's OK to go ahead and issue the warrant
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.560]   anyway.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.480]   That's where the debate comes down.
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:47.440]   There's-- look, we didn't see the affidavit that prompted
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.360]   the warrant, but a judge did issue the warrant.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.480]   It was a search warrant that was being executed.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.400]   Presumably, the judge knows the law.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.800]   And so there's two possible reasons
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.120]   that the judge might have issued that warrant.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.440]   One, because she didn't feel that Jason Chen was a journalist
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.640]   or that his place of residence didn't reflect
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.040]   wasn't a journalistic place of business.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.560]   Right?
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.160]   That would be one exception.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.160]   The other would be what-- there are some limited criminal
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.520]   activities that can be going on there.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   Well, but--
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.600]   My area of confusion is that--
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.880]   I mean, I'm a journalist, but if I steal a car,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.280]   that doesn't mean that they can't enter my residence
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.640]   and find out how I stole that car.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.640]   Well, what about that, Denise?
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.480]   Is that the case?
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.000]   By the way, let's assume you're in California
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.200]   and because the laws are different in every state.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.880]   I'm sorry, just to qualify.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.560]   Every time I look at the papers that have been filed
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.880]   and the arguments about it, they're
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.200]   about the idea of a journalist's right
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.720]   not to divulge a source for a news story.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.600]   My area of confusion is that it seems to me
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.320]   as though this is possible they're not
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.840]   trying to get him to give up a source,
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.440]   but they're trying to figure out where you paid
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.840]   $5,000 for property that may or may not have been stolen.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.800]   We want to basically investigate you
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.160]   on the transfer of that stolen property.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.960]   So that's where I'm--
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.480]   Awesome.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.240]   Wait, hold on.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:03.600]   I want the attorney to answer.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.160]   Sure.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.120]   So you're absolutely right that what they're engaged in
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.080]   is a criminal investigation here.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.960]   They're not engaged in trying to make Jason or anybody else
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.800]   divulge their sources in court, which
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.240]   is what the shield law applies to.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.920]   But the question then becomes, well,
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.560]   how can you go about that criminal investigation?
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.440]   Well, you can issue search warrants.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.400]   Or can you?
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.880]   Because here there is an exception that specifically says,
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.240]   if what you're going after with your warrant
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.520]   is the materials used by a journalist
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.200]   in connection with their story, then forget about it.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.600]   You can't get that warrant.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.880]   The reason is it's an umbrella protection
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.600]   because if you do, as the police did,
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.040]   confiscate everything, other sources can be revealed, right?
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.480]   So this is a very overreaching.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.240]   These shield laws are very broad,
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.720]   but it's to protect--
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.800]   in other words, it doesn't mean he can't be prosecuted.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.480]   It doesn't mean there's not a way to do this.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.800]   But it has to be done in a specific way
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.080]   because he's a working journalist.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.360]   Is that correct, Denise?
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.160]   That pretty much captures that there
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.880]   are different criminal charges that they are investigating.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.200]   In California, we have criminal consequences
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.480]   for misappropriating trade secrets, which I haven't seen
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.880]   a whole lot of people discuss yet in connection with this case
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.520]   and what liability might attach to gizmodo/gocker
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.680]   under that provision.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.000]   I have seen a lot of discussion about receiving stolen goods
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.320]   and how that might be something that they're being
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.360]   investigated for.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   But does that change the fact that their ability to do
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.800]   a broad search and seizure?
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.360]   Does it change the fact that there are--
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.600]   That they could do this, execute this kind of search warrant.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.240]   It seems to me that that's prohibited by the shield law,
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.280]   except for the--
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.360]   does the federal law allows it in child pornography
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.840]   and terrorism?
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.280]   I don't think even gizmodo went that far here.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.640]   That's my question.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.360]   There are a couple of things that I worry about.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.840]   One is that the judge decided, oh, they're online.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.240]   They're not a journalist.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.360]   And there's California case law that says that's not the case.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.560]   In fact, it was an Apple case, which you wrote about
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.360]   in your bag and baggage blog.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.240]   Or that there's the other thing that maybe they're somehow
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.240]   let off the hook because it's a criminal investigation.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:22.760]   Right.
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.480]   The EFF does not believe that's the case.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.440]   The EFF wrote and Wired republished this opinion
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.600]   that Jennifer Granik said, it doesn't matter.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.520]   I put out on Twitter last night, if anybody, any criminal
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.920]   lawyers out there who are looking at this,
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.040]   no of any exception to this provision that says you can't
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.160]   get a warrant, let us know.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.320]   Let's start talking about that.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.800]   And I haven't gotten any answers back about that.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:53.240]   The most I've seen on this is some arguments that were asserted
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.720]   by Apple in the case you just mentioned, Leo, which
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:02.120]   was against Jason O'Grady and some other online journalists
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.600]   concerning the asteroid device.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.200]   And there was a leak about that.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.960]   Apple contended that there was criminal conduct there
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.400]   for violation of trade secrets and got the trial court
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.120]   to buy into that.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.560]   So the trial court refused to grant a protective order
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.840]   under the shield law there on this theory that, OK,
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.400]   well, the shield law wouldn't apply if there are criminal acts
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.280]   going on.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.760]   But I haven't delved into Apple's briefing there.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.080]   It's all there on the EFF site if anyone is inclined to do that
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.680]   and see what arguments they made if they actually have authority
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.760]   to back that up.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.280]   I haven't seen that authority yet in this discussion,
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.440]   and I would like to.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.400]   Until I do, as I read the statutes,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.600]   I don't see any exception.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.160]   I see that if you're going to get a warrant,
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.240]   you need to comply with the warrant provision.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.320]   And these things are carved out of it.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.920]   So I think that's OK.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.560]   So that's the legal.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:05.080]   And apparently, according to TechCrunch, the San Mateo DA
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.920]   or detectives are pausing-- that's the word that was used--
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.240]   in their investigation to see if they, in fact,
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.640]   have the right to this evidence.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.360]   Would it jeopardize the case if, in fact,
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.960]   that was an illegal warrant?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.440]   I mean, would that--
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.400]   Would it jeopardize the criminal investigation?
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.560]   If they decided to do a criminal investigation,
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.120]   wouldn't that throw everything out?
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.680]   If you obtain evidence using an illegal warrant,
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.520]   that evidence can't be used.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.920]   So they're saying, we're not going to look at anything.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.200]   We're going to pause the investigation.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.320]   We're going to put this aside.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.640]   This is what TechCrunch says.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.880]   We're going to put it that they said.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.800]   We're going to put it aside.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.160]   But we're going to take our time.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.040]   It may take a few days.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.560]   If I were Jason, I'd be a little upset.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.040]   OK, so--
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   Go ahead.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.360]   So I just wanted to get that kind of legal groundwork
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.680]   out of the way, because there's been a lot of discussion
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.200]   on the web about whether it's different because it committed
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.480]   a crime or whether he committed a crime and all that stuff.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.400]   And that seems to really be moot.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.080]   They haven't even been charged with anything.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.920]   Nobody's charged with anything.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.760]   It's just investigation.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.920]   So John, go ahead.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.440]   Well, I think there's two possibilities.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.000]   There's the possibility to start off with.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.080]   What are they investigating?
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.480]   I mean, clearly, they are investigating what they think
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.120]   may be a felony.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.480]   It says felony on the search warrant.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.560]   I mean, they don't break into people's houses
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.320]   scoothing around.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.720]   Just because they want to not be able to--
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.000]   The phone wouldn't be any reason to break into somebody's house.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.120]   So possibility A is that the felony
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.000]   that they're investigating is specifically and only
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.640]   about the guy or guys who found the phone
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:44.520]   and gave it over to Gizmodo.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.080]   That that's who they're investigating for a felony.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.800]   And if that's the case, then I think clearly,
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.960]   what they did to Jason Chen was absolutely--
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.360]   it was both wrong and almost certainly illegal.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.960]   That's exactly what child laws are about.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:03.840]   You can't issue a warrant against a journalist
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.680]   while investigating a crime like that.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.040]   But I think the other possibility
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.920]   is that the felony they're talking about
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.000]   is the purchase of stolen property.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.600]   That Jason Chen is the target or suspect
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.000]   or whatever you want to say of the investigation
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.480]   and Gawker media, his employer.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.640]   And in that case, I don't think that the shield laws are
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.640]   going to be much help.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.640]   Now, it is interesting.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.160]   Exactly as Denise pointed out.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.480]   I do think that the letter of the California law,
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.000]   that the actual plain reading of it,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.560]   does seem to suggest that they--
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.280]   you could read it and say they can't issue a warrant
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.480]   against a journalist period, even if the journalist--
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.240]   no matter what they think, even if the journalist himself
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.960]   is the target of the investigation.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.720]   That-- as far as I can tell, and I've
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.560]   done a little bit of research, and I've seen some posts
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:05.400]   from actual lawyers and a law professor somewhere who looked
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.440]   at it, that doesn't seem to have been tested in case law,
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.160]   that provision.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.080]   It doesn't seem like that's actually--
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:16.480]   that there's any case law deciding what that means.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.560]   It looked like the law said you need to,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.560]   instead of a search warrant issue,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.280]   a subpoena so that there can be an argument about what
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.480]   is appropriate in this investigation
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.480]   and what is protected so that other sources aren't revealed
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.560]   in kind of a fishing expedition.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.640]   But I think I would be very, very surprised if a judge were
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.720]   to rule that this shield law means
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.200]   that a working journalist cannot have a warrant issued
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.360]   against them, no matter what they themselves
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.800]   are accused of doing.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.240]   I don't know.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   It seems reasonable to me.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.960]   It provides a way to investigate that is protecting
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.600]   the journalist's sources.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.400]   Well, the thing is that we're saying
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.080]   that we're protecting their sources,
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.200]   but we have to remember they already divulged the source.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.560]   I mean--
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.280]   But the law is--
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.800]   you can't apply the law.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.360]   I mean, I guess you can apply the law selectively,
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:06.400]   but a judge can.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.640]   But it seems to me, if you're going to have a shield law,
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.080]   it's going to protect them whether or not you believe they've
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.200]   revealed everything or there's nothing to hide here.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.960]   We don't know what other sources are there.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.800]   We don't know whether the stories Jason was covering.
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.080]   All of those things are protected.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.240]   The point of this is you have to bend over backwards
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:25.880]   to have a free press.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.720]   And what happens, the chilling effect,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.880]   is if a law enforcement could say, oh, no.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.400]   Oh, no.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.640]   Leo, we think you stole a car.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.440]   So we're going to come in and take all your stuff
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.360]   because they don't like something else I said.
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.360]   That's where you kind of--
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.200]   that's why these laws exist.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.800]   I mean, isn't that the point to these?
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   But what if they have really good, probable cause
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.480]   that you actually stole a car?
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.320]   I don't know.
[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.600]   Does that change it?
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:54.680]   In your reading piece--
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.280]   I don't think it does.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:55.640]   I think it does.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.440]   I think it's ever been tested.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.880]   It's not talking about how does stealing a car
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.640]   have anything to do with doing journalism?
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.120]   Well, right.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.400]   So why would they steal my computer?
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.960]   So maybe stealing a car is a bad thing.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.400]   Let's say I'm engaged in a blackmail.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.160]   And I'm a working journalist.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.200]   And they're investigating the blackmail,
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.000]   but they take all my stuff.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.600]   And in the process of taking this stuff,
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.840]   they happen to find material about sources
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:25.720]   that they were curious about in a Valerie Plainlike case.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.320]   I think that that's my sense of what these laws are about.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.240]   Go ahead, Andy.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.960]   I was going to say, to the issue of stealing a car,
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.200]   if I'm an auto journalist, I can find a source who has access
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.960]   to the new Pontiac, whatever, and give me information about it.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.040]   I can't bust into a test track, steal it,
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.480]   take it apart in my garage, and then write about it
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.800]   on this aspect that, well, I just-- I returned the car,
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.120]   and so everything should be cool.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.960]   And nobody's saying they shouldn't be prosecuted
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.840]   criminally if a crime was committed.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.200]   That's not what's going on here.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.040]   I'll say, I've been very silent because I know nothing
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.640]   about the law, and I should make sure--
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.680]   that's the sort of thing where professionally I
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.800]   consult people who can advise me about the law.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.480]   That's why I would get Denise on.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   Exactly.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.080]   So that's really the only thing that I'm still
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.640]   fascinated about, that there seems
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.880]   to be two different areas to this case,
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:19.760]   the area in which they might have had property that did not
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.200]   belong to them, and then so that by one reading the law,
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.560]   that might be stolen property, and then the area in which they
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.880]   took a trade-- what might be construed as a trade secret
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.200]   and published it.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.400]   So that's why I'm-- you can tell me
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.440]   I'm listening closely, because I'm like, when he cuts me
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.280]   accidentally, I'm like, looking like this, because I'm--
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.080]   Well, I agree.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.520]   I really want to--
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.760]   And this is why people get into the law, by the way.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.760]   This is a fascinating intellectual question.
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.120]   But it has some--
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:42.620]   Really?
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:44.440]   Criminal procedure was always one of my favorite classes
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.280]   in law school.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:45.780]   It's been known.
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.520]   I never practiced it.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.720]   It's fun.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.640]   But at least you, Andy, and I, and John and Alex
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.760]   have a dog in this hunt, because we are online journalists.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.320]   And if the judge's opinion was, well, Jason Chen's not
[00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.400]   a journalist, then that is worrying.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.040]   And it's important to us as journalists
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.960]   that shield laws are upheld, I believe,
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.560]   because it protects the practice of journalism,
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:12.680]   even if it makes it a little harder to prosecute somebody
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.800]   who stole a phone, if that's what happened here.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.240]   It's not-- it doesn't let them off the hook.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.960]   Nobody's suggesting that there shouldn't be a criminal procedure
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.800]   here.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.600]   It's just that instead of the search warrant,
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.360]   it should have been a subpoena.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.200]   Is that right, Jason?
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:25.200]   I see.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.800]   But I think that that's--
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.200]   I do understand.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.840]   I totally understand that the plain reading of the law--
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.720]   of that California statute could be interpreted that way.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.440]   I don't think that when this is finished,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.920]   that that's the way it's going to be ruled.
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.680]   Because it's not about finding--
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:49.560]   it's not about criminal actions of gizmodo sources, I believe.
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.880]   I believe this is about a case that they're building
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.920]   against gizmodos and gizmodos editors and Jason Chen.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.760]   And presumably in the affidavit to the judge,
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.840]   which has never released, they would have said that to the judge.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.400]   And the judge would have then said, oh, well, in that case,
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.360]   that is what I-- that's how I believe that when we find out
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.840]   the details, I believe that that is
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.520]   what we're going to find out.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.080]   And I think that the payment is going to be a key piece of this.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.480]   It's the actual payment for a piece of stolen goods.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.280]   I think that the actual transaction, a lot of times,
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.600]   creates-- opens up a can of worms.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.800]   And I'm not the lawyer.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.680]   But I think that--
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.360]   That's something that comes up under the trade secret laws, too.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.440]   But again, this case is so interesting and unique,
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.160]   because what the trade secret laws are trying to prevent
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.800]   is you going to the individual-- what was his name,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.080]   Mr. Gray, in the bar--
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   who had the prototype and bribing him to turn it over, right?
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.560]   Or somebody else at Apple.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:53.880]   But here we have the whole intervening layer of it
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.360]   having been lost and recovered.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.720]   And then the person who got paid was not an Apple employee
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.880]   who had those trade secrets to begin with.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.320]   We should point out that we don't really know that's--
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:04.880]   any of this.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.480]   This is gizmodos story.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.720]   And it's only if you believe everything gizmodos said--
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:13.520]   and perhaps-- I mean, it's very possible
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.800]   that reacted to some investigation and found out
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:20.000]   that gizmodo went to Mr. Gray--
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.080]   we'll just call him Mr. Gray for now--
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.520]   and said, we would like this phone.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.880]   And Mr. Gray as an Apple employee sold it to them.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.080]   Now, if that's the case, then there is absolutely
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.640]   trade secret violation.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.320]   There's a whole bunch of stuff going on there.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.120]   That doesn't seem to be the case, though.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:38.200]   It does not seem to be the case.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.640]   We don't know, though, do we?
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.440]   Well, I mean--
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.280]   Couple of points, Leo.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:45.840]   You keep saying, well, shouldn't a subpoena have been issued?
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.000]   And I think we're confusing apples and oranges there.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.440]   A search warrant is what you want to have in hand
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.960]   when you're an officer, police--
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.400]   To go in, you can't come to the--
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.400]   --coercent, yes, to seize and obtain evidence.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.320]   A subpoena is something that anybody can have issued
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.720]   in a civil case.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.880]   And that's how typically the shield law is triggered.
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.520]   Oh, I see.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.440]   This information is subpoenaed.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.560]   And so that's why the code of civil procedure
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:19.200]   where the shield law appears talks about--
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:19.880]   Civil, yeah.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.320]   --penus.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.480]   Yes, it's brought into the penal code through this warrant.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.040]   So what would have been the--
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:30.000]   well, how would the police have then properly done this?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.280]   Well, how can police investigating a crime
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.840]   get information from a journalist's house?
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.040]   I don't know under this provision
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.040]   that they can get the items that are specifically
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.840]   discussed there.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:51.440]   Now, if they're going after things that do not relate
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.080]   to the journalist's function in doing the story
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.640]   and are not their materials related to that,
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.080]   but do relate to the crime in some way,
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   then that might be the path they could take.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.240]   A stolen car in the backyard, they can take that.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.200]   They can look for that.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.880]   Right.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.800]   They can't, though, just say, well, you got a stolen car,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.000]   but let's take all your computers, too.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.640]   So here the fourth generation iPhone, say,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.600]   if that had still been--
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   If they found that, OK.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.400]   Although it was part of the material that related
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:27.640]   to the story, it was not notes and preparation and stuff.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.360]   I think that a distinction might be drawn there, but--
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.120]   What I'm not seeing, as I said before,
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.040]   is an exception to this provision that says,
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.920]   no, you cannot get a warrant in these circumstances.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.920]   Now, while we've been on the call,
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.520]   an undisclosed friend on Skype who's listening to the show
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:54.960]   sent in a copy of an old 1975 California decision
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.880]   that went through this kind of analysis.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:03.040]   It's called Rosado v. Superior Court of Fresno.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.280]   If people want to look that up on Google Scholar legal,
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.200]   that is where it's residing or one copy of it.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.120]   And at page 217 of that decision,
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.240]   it gets into a discussion where the court apparently went
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.280]   through this and looked at the statute and decided,
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.480]   well, yeah, we don't see a whole lot of guidance here,
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.960]   but we're going to interpret this as not triggering
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.560]   the show block.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.400]   So you could see the court's not struggled with this.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.680]   Now, this is an old case.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:35.080]   And as I said, it would be interesting to go through Apple's
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.200]   briefing in connection with the Apple versus Doze case
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.200]   and see if they even raised this or what other sort of support
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.480]   they had for this argument that, oh, if there's criminal proceedings
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   involved, then we can ignore this whole shield block, annoyance.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:57.080]   But as I said, until I see a lot more authority
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   about taking the exception out of play,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.040]   the exception for getting a warrant, I think it applies.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.520]   But this might bolster John's argument
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.280]   that, well, there was a crime committed here,
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.320]   so that then all bets are off.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.680]   Nobody's been charged with a crime.
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:13.600]   The police say we're just investigating.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:19.480]   But they could say to the judge and asking for the search warrant,
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.840]   well, what we're doing is investigating Jason Chen, right?
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.840]   I mean, the judge that that doesn't have to be revealed.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.280]   Just because that's what the police say publicly.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.120]   So what is-- OK.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:31.640]   All right.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.760]   I think we've gone as far as we're going to be able to go.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.320]   And I hope that at some point we will get some clarification
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:39.960]   from somebody.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.160]   I guess you won't till it goes to court.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   Do you think-- now, here's the other thing
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.120]   that people are assuming is that Apple-- because Apple
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:52.320]   serves on an advisory board for this React team--
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.440]   Apple actually prompted this investigation.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.080]   The detective in San Mateo says, well, yeah, Apple called
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.520]   and said there was some stolen property.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.720]   How much did Apple have to do with this?
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.920]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.160]   Unknown and unknowable.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.840]   I'm not even going to guess.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.560]   Oh, come on.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.520]   How about you, Alex?
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.960]   You want to guess?
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.240]   I'm sure that they called them.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.760]   I'm sure that they were upset.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.200]   But that's like--
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.000]   I'm certain that they would not have done anything
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.680]   to jeopardize any present or future prosecution
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.400]   if anybody who may or may not have committed
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.640]   to crime against Apple.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.600]   They would be intelligent and certainly wouldn't--
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.720]   I'm just saying for me to speculate
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.560]   would be nothing but one-house-and-speculates.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.040]   I don't have any information about that.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.320]   Does it seem like an overreaction to bring this React team?
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.520]   And somebody said, boy, I hope the next time I lose a phone
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.840]   in a bar, I get the React team on my--
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.960]   I mean, it seems like there has to be a trade secret issue,
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.240]   right?
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.600]   Well, now I think--
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.680]   I think largely has to be just a don't push
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.320]   a surround issue.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.560]   It's bad for business if you put it out there that no matter
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.920]   how you get your hands on one of our trade secrets,
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.400]   you can do whatever you want with it,
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.560]   and we will just do nothing about it.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.920]   So I'm going to do this.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920]   Go ahead, John.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:10.640]   Imagine that this guy who lost the phone, the guy from Apple,
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.640]   let's say his family lives in--
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.480]   let's say Philadelphia here.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.800]   And he was visiting in Philadelphia and lost the phone
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:21.240]   here, and the police get involved.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.560]   But the police have any idea what--
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.320]   the police in Philadelphia have any idea of just how special
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.000]   this phone was.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.280]   And we all know-- anybody who's listening to this show
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.000]   knows this was an extraordinary device to--
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.800]   let's just assume that that's what happened.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.600]   They left it behind in a bar.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.200]   Would the police here have any idea
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.520]   just how extraordinary that phone is?
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.320]   Probably not.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.840]   The React task force, the whole reason I were commissioned,
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.760]   is-- and that's exactly what the district attorney in San
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.520]   Mateo said was to why they were called in,
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:55.040]   is it's their job to assess unusual situations like this
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.560]   and determine, is this just a phone, like somebody
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.040]   lost a phone, or is this an extraordinary, important,
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.720]   million dollar trade secret to one of the companies
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.480]   in Silicon Valley?
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.320]   I mean, that's exactly what they're for.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.000]   I was going to say is that I think
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.280]   that we do have to remember that this was a crime that
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   did occur in the middle of Silicon Valley.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.520]   The thing is, is that you are going
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.500]   to have a police department, just like in Hollywood,
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.080]   that's going to be more sensitive to certain things
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.520]   around those issues.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.880]   You're going to have people very sensitive.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.480]   There's a lot of companies that are very sensitive
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.360]   about their trade secrets.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.560]   And what they don't want to see is suddenly a lot of money
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.080]   being thrown around to steal those trade secrets,
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.000]   and the ability for someone to say, well, we're press,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.240]   and we're not--
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.400]   we can do whatever we want.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.000]   I mean, I think that's a fear that would affect
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.960]   the police department in that specific area.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.840]   That's a good point.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.880]   It's a company town.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.440]   Not in my neighborhood do you do that.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.000]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.020]   I would say it's a little bit more fair to say.
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.300]   It's an industry town.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.620]   I think Hollywood's a better--
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.900]   Yeah, industry town.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.140]   But it's not one company.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.580]   It's not Apple's town.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.180]   I mean, Apple's obviously a very bright fish.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.020]   But it's-- I think Cisco, I think--
[00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.500]   Right.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:03.980]   Any of those--
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:04.480]   Any of those--
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.940]   Any of those could expect this.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.780]   Yeah, I think that's fair.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.820]   All right, well, I want to take a break.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.020]   Denise, if you-- we only wanted to--
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.860]   we didn't want to take your whole day if you want to split
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.620]   you can, if you want to stick around, you can.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:15.940]   I'd love to stick around if I can.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:16.420]   All right.
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:16.900]   Thanks.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.720]   We appreciate having some actual--
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.720]   Exactly.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.720]   That's great value.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:24.120]   Before we go much further though,
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.840]   I do want to mention our friends at Drobo, who
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.880]   have come out with yet another fantastic product.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.840]   They just keep doing it.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.520]   And I've got some special deals for you.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:35.360]   If you want to take advantage of our Mac break web page,
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:38.720]   Drobo.com/Macbreak, Drobo, of course,
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:44.080]   the company that created the amazing Drobo storage products
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.680]   a couple of years ago, starting with the original Drobo
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.100]   with four disk bays, complete redundancy.
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:51.980]   You can mix and match drives, lose a drive, no problem.
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.540]   You swap in another drive, boom.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.620]   Rebills your-- you're never without your data and never
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.620]   at risk.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.820]   You want to expand capacity, take out the smallest drive,
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.740]   put in a bigger one, boom, automatic expansion.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:06.220]   The newer Drobo S has five bays.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:09.260]   That means both more storage and better performance,
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:11.340]   perfect for creative professionals.
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.860]   I use the original Drobo for backing up my iTunes library
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.660]   and all that stuff.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.220]   Because I think I put--
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.660]   I think there's four or five terabytes in there.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:19.860]   You go up to 16 terabytes.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.880]   Of course, you put two terabyte drives.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.020]   10-- I'm sorry, did I say 16?
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.980]   8, two terabyte drives.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.880]   And 10, if you have in the Drobo S. The Drobo Pro
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.920]   is the one with eight bays.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.700]   That'll give you 16 terabytes.
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.620]   That's for small businesses, creative teams.
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.520]   ISCSI built in the new Drobo Elite
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:41.120]   has dual gigabit ethernet ports.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.060]   So you can get multiple network connections.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:45.480]   I think 16 different users can use it at the same time.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.100]   Great for editing teams.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:49.860]   It's basically a SAN.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.580]   Small businesses, VMware certified,
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.820]   great for virtualization, the new Drobo FS as well.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:58.440]   All of these drives are available at Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:03.760]   And we have discounts from $75 to $500 off populated systems,
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.080]   some significant savings.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.000]   I want you to check it out.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.520]   Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.580]   I think almost all of us on Macbreak weekly
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:15.240]   use Drobo's for our own backup solutions.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.700]   And we have to say, we think you should too.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.540]   Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.660]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:23.660]   A Macbreak weekly and the entire Twit network.
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:27.720]   So OK, so we're agreed.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.380]   Apple has an interest in this.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.720]   React has an interest in Apple.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.300]   But they're not Apple's minions that they're acting
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.000]   on behalf of the tech industry in general
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.200]   and doing exactly what they were formed to do,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.100]   which is investigate high-tech crimes.
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.700]   Well, I think the other thing to remember, too,
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.680]   is that district attorneys are--
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.560]   it's a political office.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.320]   They get elected.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.600]   They run for election.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.880]   They tend to-- the position tends to draw people
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.760]   who enjoy attention.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.960]   So I think the fact that-- do you think this case is
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.720]   getting attention?
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.640]   I mean, I would say so.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.960]   So I think it's unfortunate for the targets
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:07.840]   of the investigation.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:12.320]   I think the fact that it's going to draw significant attention
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.560]   only makes it more likely that the district attorney
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.240]   in San Mateo is going to pursue it vigorously.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.000]   Makes sense.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.280]   Sure, of course.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.320]   And I think we haven't talked at all about poor Sampp
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.080]   who sold it to Gizmodo because once they get ahold of him,
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.800]   he's going to definitely pay a lot more than the $5,000
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.760]   he got.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.720]   Even if he's found not guilty, it's
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.320]   going to be if they really take him to task.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.080]   Is that who they're looking for?
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.480]   Is that what this is really all about?
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:40.320]   Is who found this phone or stole his phone?
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.120]   Is he the guy they're going after or are they
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.360]   going after Gizmodo, too?
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.880]   I think they're probably going after both.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.360]   I don't know.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.520]   But I think that they're probably going after both.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.400]   But I have to say that there is almost no defense for what he
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:51.920]   did.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.680]   And so there's not a shield law.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.560]   There's not anything else.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.160]   Once he's sold that, I mean, he's in deep, doo-doo.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:01.720]   Yeah, that was the part of the whole thing that really got
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.880]   to me, the idea that, oh, we tried really hard to return it.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.920]   What else could we do but try to sell this phone for $5,000
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.320]   to Gizmodo?
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.960]   We had no choice.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.960]   I mean, he lives there.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.560]   The closest I ever came to a situation.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.800]   Passes out on the way to work.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:16.880]   I think it's interesting, though.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.200]   He must have known somehow.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.120]   He must have known that this--
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.520]   something about the Gizmodo story does not smell right.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.680]   Something.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.160]   OK.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.920]   I mean, the guy who-- the guy that's
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.040]   interviewed this mysterious Mr. X who took the phone
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.160]   or found the phone and got it to Gizmodo,
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.920]   how did he know what he had?
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.680]   And at what point did he know what he had?
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.400]   The phone was disguised.
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.920]   And even I, I mean, you fooled me.
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.000]   And you had a 3GS.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   You put it in a Mophie case.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.640]   I didn't know it was a 3GS.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.280]   But realize that the phone that I had was--
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.720]   even if it was outside of the case,
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.120]   it was absolutely indistinguishable from the real thing.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.440]   It was built to look like--
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.920]   there was a production 3GS.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.120]   And that's the only reason why I was using it out and about.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.800]   How this person knew what he had is sort of immaterial.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.960]   The question is-- and this is more of an ethical thing
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:15.040]   than anything about journalism or about the law.
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.680]   It's about who, when they find a phone in a bar,
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.440]   does not think I will hand it over to the bartender.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.600]   Or I will simply say, I found some guy's phone.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.640]   Here is my phone number.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.400]   Here is my address.
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:29.120]   Here's how you can get in touch with me if someone finds it.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.000]   I would never even think about handing it over to a salient
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.840]   or doing anything personal with it
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.320]   until every avenue had been exhausted.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.920]   And all I was about to say is that the only thing
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.000]   that I can say that's similar in my own existence
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.560]   was that I was taking a walk sometime.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.800]   And so I guess one of the postal workers outside the post office,
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.600]   this is like long after the place closed,
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.760]   had left his master keys inside the mailbox
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:54.920]   after taking his final collection of the day.
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.160]   And so I pounded on the door.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.480]   No one came by.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.440]   I pounded on the back door.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.120]   No one came by.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.520]   They must have thought that it was just someone
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.600]   who was trying to mail a letter.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.000]   So the next-- I didn't think, well, great.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.120]   Now I have a free set of master keys to the post office.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.800]   You can sell those to Gizmodo.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.300]   Exactly.
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.440]   No, I got it my cell phone.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.600]   I call the local police saying, hi, I've just finally
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.600]   set up master keys.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.480]   I'm on my way there.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.200]   I can't get them to come out and get them.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.840]   I'm driving over one mile and I'm going to walk home,
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.480]   get my car, go over to your police station,
[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.120]   and drop them off.
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.880]   I'm the person who has them, and I'm turning them over immediately.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.040]   No, it's clear.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.560]   It's just--
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:26.080]   It's not--
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.960]   Any normal person would have given it to the bartender.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.760]   It'd be an interesting question if the Gizmodo guy actually
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.560]   had found it himself.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.080]   That would be more of an interesting ethical--
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.240]   I don't think that's the one reason, because you could say,
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.200]   you know what, it's going to take me a half an hour.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.800]   I'm going to have someone drive me to the police station.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.360]   And during that 22-minute drive, I'm
[00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:48.800]   going to document the hell out of this, which would not
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.880]   be illegal.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.560]   I would still return it, but I'd look at it.
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.040]   Well, I'd say I'd still return it.
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:56.720]   I would look at it.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.120]   That would be very well documented.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.200]   And then, of course, I would have
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:02.560]   the conversation with my editors saying, find out for me
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:04.760]   whether or not I've just broken a whole lot of laws.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.080]   And if I'd break a whole lot more, if I actually
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:08.720]   published any of this information.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.000]   Denise, what were you going to say?
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.640]   Oh, I was going to say that my husband who I told this story
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.960]   to you this morning, in addition to being convinced
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.040]   that Mr. Gray must have been trying
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.720]   to pick up women in the bar by showing off the new iPhone.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.720]   Uh-huh.
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.720]   Uh-huh.
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.920]   No, we have a motive.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.720]   Trust me, that doesn't work.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.160]   That totally is--
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:27.920]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.760]   I just said, is it 44% of women would date somebody with it,
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.560]   just because they had an iPhone or something.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:33.080]   I agree.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.080]   It probably wouldn't work.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.840]   Why, you know, why go to Gizmodo?
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.400]   Why not go to Apple, who's going to pay you a whole lot more
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.440]   than $5,000 to get this thing back?
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   No.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.880]   Apple's going to be zero.
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.960]   And if you ask Apple for money, maybe they would say--
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.160]   Well, that would be extortion.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.800]   And maybe he was smart enough to figure that one out.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.440]   It was pretty smart.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.960]   Because he had to know what he had immediately,
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.720]   or he would have slammed it on the bar and said, hey,
[00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:01.080]   somebody left his phone here.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.680]   So I think you're right, Denise.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:07.040]   The Apple engineer is saying something publicly.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.480]   What do you think, John?
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.000]   I think Apple has a very keen interest
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.440]   in the broad sense of discouraging any sort
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.800]   of bounty market for these sort of devices.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.440]   And that is why, for example, if somebody who was completely
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.480]   honest-- let's just say Andy found this phone instead
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.280]   of this guy.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:31.160]   And Andy recognized it and immediately took it to Apple.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.240]   Took, drove it to Cupertino in the middle of the night.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.360]   Or the most honest thing you could possibly do at the phone.
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.000]   That there would be no reward.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.960]   They might say, thank you.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.080]   They might shake your hand.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.520]   But they're not going to give you a financial reward.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:44.400]   I mean, that's just one of many ways
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:49.240]   that they're going to do whatever they can to discourage
[00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.520]   either the perception or the actual justification
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.200]   of a bounty market for these sort of devices.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.240]   We don't negotiate with terrorists.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:57.800]   Exactly.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.120]   I mean, that's obviously a rare thing.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:02.440]   Radical analogy.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.360]   But it's the same--
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.000]   Same game--
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   Apple, it's a great thing.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.080]   Well, you have to check for your--
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.040]   We just have no idea how this guy got the phone on there.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.840]   I mean, we can say we found it in the bar.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:16.160]   But I've had a camera, a little HP 20,
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.400]   taken out of my coat pocket, didn't even feel it.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.480]   I mean, the thing is that someone could have noticed
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.080]   that he had the phone and pickpocketed him,
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.080]   as far as we know.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.560]   Was it wrong?
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:26.000]   We don't.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.200]   Was it wrong for Gizmodo to pay $5,000 for the phone?
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   I know.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.000]   Absolutely.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.120]   Well, we have two different issues here.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.520]   Again, personal ethics and your ethics as a journalist,
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:40.040]   because as uncomfortable as it is,
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.160]   you do have a responsibility to your readers,
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.360]   that if you have information that is of paramount value
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.400]   to readers, or that just simply needs to get out,
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.400]   that doesn't absolve you of any legal problems you're in.
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.520]   But that could be a justification for actually going ahead
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.200]   and publishing this.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.320]   I remember a judge when asked to visit in the public interest,
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.680]   he said, is it public interested?
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.920]   It's in the public interest.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:00.320]   Right.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.440]   But in this case, I think that anybody
[00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.720]   that you would float this by would say, well, what can you--
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:06.240]   what do the public-- what will you
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.320]   be telling the public about this phone?
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.360]   Well, you'll be basically telling them things they already
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:10.960]   know.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.680]   You have exactly three data points,
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.320]   none of which are earth shattering.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.400]   It just wouldn't-- to me, ethics are subjective.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:18.640]   They're not universal.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.240]   To me, that would not have--
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:22.400]   that would not have trumped the legal problems
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   and the personal ethical problems of not just simply
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.800]   returning this phone.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.600]   Anybody else?
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.800]   John, you think it was wrong for them to write that check?
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.480]   I do.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.160]   I think because they took possession of the phone.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.800]   Honestly, immediately.
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.160]   As soon as I heard this story, I mean,
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.360]   it's one of the reasons I've been fascinated right
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   from the get-go is as soon as I heard their story.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.160]   I mean, effectively, to me, Gizmodo published--
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.800]   if they-- if this ends up going as I think it's going to,
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.600]   and so far, I've been fairly right,
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.400]   I think they're going to get prosecuted
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:55.160]   for a felony of purchasing stolen--
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:58.200]   knowingly purchasing stolen property.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   And that is illegal.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.840]   And it is a felony that's over 900 bucks.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.120]   I don't think that they ever really saw it that way.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.920]   I think that Gizmodo treated this the way they treat
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.680]   other scoops.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.080]   And look back at the stuff with Apple, the Asteroid case,
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.920]   with Jason O'Grady and ThinkSecret.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.960]   That was not number one.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.040]   That wasn't a criminal case.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.640]   It was a civil case and trade secret.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:22.320]   But one of the reasons it wasn't a criminal case
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.800]   was that they didn't get a unit.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.040]   They didn't get a prototype.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.760]   A unit, they got information.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.520]   They got, like, emailed.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.920]   It was sent over as ones and zeros, these plans.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:37.800]   And I think like a keynote deck describing the product.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.120]   That's information.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.880]   And that's the way almost all of these scoops,
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.720]   all-- everybody just thinks information.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.920]   It's all scoops, scoops, scoops.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:46.720]   What's the phone like?
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.840]   Here's pictures of the phone.
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.720]   Here's what it does.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.480]   Here's the information.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.920]   They crossed what I think is a very, very vivid line
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.880]   when they took possession of the phone and paid money for it.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.840]   So here's a hypothetical.
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.400]   And a whole bunch of daring fireball readers
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.640]   have emailed this to me reading about this.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.520]   I've gotten at least a dozen emails asking more or less.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:09.400]   Here's just a hypothetical scenario.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.920]   Why didn't Gizmodo, when they were contacted by these sources,
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:17.160]   why didn't they say, hmm, let's go check it out?
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.280]   Go look at it.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.920]   Bring your nice SLR.
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.120]   If you want to, even if you pay for access
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.400]   for the scoop, for the information, just for the privilege
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.840]   of meeting you fellows, here's $5,000.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.480]   Take your photos of the phone that's in their hands.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.680]   Don't touch it.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.160]   Take all your nice photos.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.200]   Look at it.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.760]   Get their story and then say to the guys, well, what you guys
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.840]   should do is call this number at Apple.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.840]   Take it to an Apple store.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:40.800]   Get rid of it.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.400]   Go back, write up their story.
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:47.880]   Put their big scoop on Gizmodo and say everything they know.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.960]   I think that they're in a totally different legal situation
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.000]   if that's what they had done.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000]   Troubled wine.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:54.840]   Never taking--
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.360]   Troubled wine.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.080]   And you can argue then about the ethics,
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.800]   the journalistic ethics of paying for the access.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.080]   That's just like when you pay for an interview or--
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.880]   Nick Denton says, that's what we do.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.920]   Gophers of checkbook-- we believe in checkbook journalism.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.200]   But they should have-- I don't think they should have ever,
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.360]   ever taken custody of the phone.
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.880]   And I think I know why they took custody of the phone.
[00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:14.640]   I'll tell you that.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.160]   Why?
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.520]   Here's my theory on that is because the phone wasn't operating.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.080]   It didn't-- it didn't--
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.040]   It didn't bridge.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:25.360]   However, that happened, whether it was remotely disabled
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.920]   because they knew it was lost or otherwise broken
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.320]   by the guys who found it.
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.720]   It wasn't working.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.600]   So all they were able to get were what we've seen,
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.720]   these photos of a prototype iPhone that doesn't turn on,
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.000]   which is nowhere near as interesting as an iPhone that
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.320]   does turn on and has the iPhone OS 4.0 with all of the--
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.040]   this front-facing camera, the high resolution screen,
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.560]   whatever other features are in the new OS that aren't
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.680]   in what we've seen in the beta releases for old iPhones.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.600]   That's way more interesting.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.520]   I mean, Andy's pointed out that the only thing
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.400]   that we've found out about-- we know what it looks like--
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.800]   but the actual technical details that are revealed
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.720]   are stuff that we all sort of knew anyway.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:12.520]   You believe it actually was a product the fourth generation
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.520]   phone.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:13.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   I think it's very, very close to what they're going to show.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:16.400]   So I think--
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.600]   based on the numbers on the back, I saw it in your post.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.640]   It said, N90_DBT.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:27.960]   I knew from other sources that N90 was the code name,
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.480]   internal code name for the next generation iPhone, shipping
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:34.320]   that sometime this summer, I guess.
[00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:39.200]   And DBT is design verification test, something like that.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:42.000]   But it's very, very close to production.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.480]   And that would give this Apple engineer reason
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.760]   to have it out in the wild.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.600]   It was being tested.
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.880]   So I think as Moto wanted the phone--
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:53.440]   and that reason it took them six days after they took the phone
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.800]   from these guys and before they published anything--
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:58.360]   is I think they were trying to figure out some way
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.720]   to re-enable it.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.800]   So much bigger story.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:01.960]   Right.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:04.760]   And hooking it up to iTunes and calling around
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.560]   and seeing if there was any possible way
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.600]   that they could re-enable the phone.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.760]   Does that make them more culpable?
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.720]   I think because they took possession of the phone,
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.960]   I think that they're going--
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.200]   What if they didn't pay for the phone?
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.360]   Is that changed it?
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.480]   If troubled wine suggests in the chatroom.
[00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:23.280]   How about if the guy who found it just gave it to them?
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.160]   Does that change it?
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.640]   I--
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.920]   Does it change-- Denise, does it change the law in California
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:30.560]   if you don't buy it?
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.000]   I mean, I know it's no longer a felony
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.880]   because it's not worth over 900 bucks.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.160]   Right.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.840]   And again, we were talking about the trade secret laws
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.680]   before, which specifically are designed to discourage you
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.560]   from having someone in possession of a trade secret.
[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:46.600]   So someone working your album--
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.560]   I am from an engineer, right?
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:52.240]   And there's all kinds of language in there about how,
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:55.440]   if you benefit from that in any way,
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.600]   then you're on the hook for liability too.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:59.040]   So if you're the person who pays off,
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.000]   and then if you do a big story, then, yeah, you can't do that.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   And that's one kind of checkbook journalism
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.920]   that you simply cannot do to appropriate your phrase
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.920]   there, Leo.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:14.160]   But here we've got this whole layer that
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.240]   doesn't seem to be dealt with specifically
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.200]   in the trade secret laws about the person who found it
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.560]   and then attempted to just happen to find it.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:28.160]   You know, didn't try and get it off the guy or anything.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.440]   And then attempted to capitalize on it.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.800]   So I think we're in a bit of a gray area here.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:35.680]   One thing I was finding interesting
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.080]   as John was talking, he mentioned
[00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:42.600]   that this, unlike the Ogrady case,
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:45.320]   is a criminal investigation.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:47.840]   And I think that's a really interesting point
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.320]   because in the Ogrady case, Apple went the civil route, right?
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   They had a civil subpoena issue.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:56.800]   They were trying to get at the sources through an Apple
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.160]   versus Doze case.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.360]   The Doze were the people who had leaked the trade secrets.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.840]   Presumably the Apple employees who Apple wanted to identify
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:10.160]   and get rid of for engaging in such conduct.
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:16.560]   Here, in that case, Apple got its hat handed to it, right?
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.240]   It lost that case big time.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.840]   And we have precedent now on the books
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.960]   about protecting journalists and online journalists
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.240]   in that situation and about what's permissible
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.520]   under the Stored Communications Act
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:34.520]   in going after things that are held with an ISP,
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.280]   which was what was involved in that case.
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:37.560]   They were trying to get at emails
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.840]   that were not locally stored.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:45.160]   So here we have Apple now going a completely different route.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   And I don't mean to sound to conspiracy theory oriented here,
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.800]   but with Yahoo doing its bit of good journalism
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.520]   on the fact that Yahoo was actually
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.800]   on the steering committee of this--
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.280]   - Apple is, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:00.120]   - Of this React task force.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.760]   Corey Weather, Apple looked to the past and said,
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.480]   "Well, we've gone the civil route before
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:09.040]   "and that didn't go so well for us.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.440]   "Let's stick the React guys on them
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.040]   "and see what we can shake down."
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.160]   - A criminal conviction will improve the position
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.560]   of a civil case later.
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.360]   Well, no, they can still sue.
[00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.200]   - Yes.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.560]   - The thing is that once they get a criminal conviction,
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:26.720]   they can pull a lot, the knives get a lot longer.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.720]   (laughing)
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:31.480]   The thing is that when it's all,
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:35.200]   'cause then you have that toe in the ground
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:37.280]   that you really can push on.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:43.200]   From my limited experience working in a law firm.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:45.320]   - You know, that was--
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.600]   - Interesting note, Wozniak went to Wired,
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.360]   Steve Wozniak went to Wired and said
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.960]   that the engineer, Apple engineer had not been fired.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:58.840]   And then really revealed that an engineer
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.040]   who had showed Woz an iPad at midnight
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.220]   on iPad ship day was fired.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.200]   What do we deduce from that?
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.560]   Wired deduced that perhaps the engineer
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.800]   who showed him the iPad had broken explicit rule
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.320]   and the engineer who lost the iPhone was just a victim.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:20.800]   It was a mistake and so Apple couldn't fire him.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.960]   - Or-- - Actually, let me ask you, John.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.520]   Have you heard anything about whether
[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:25.840]   Mr. Gray had been fired?
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.760]   - Mr. Powell.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.760]   I know his name, I'm actually saying is--
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.080]   - Mr. Gray, Mr. X, okay.
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.560]   - I call him Mr. Blue.
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:34.440]   - All right, Mr. Blue, Mr. Gray.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.800]   No, ours I know, he's still on the job.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.880]   I can't confirm that, but I mean--
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:41.440]   - Wozniak-- - Everybody at Apple
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.120]   seems to know it's still in the company directory,
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.800]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.680]   There are many people who are very surprised about that.
[00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:49.400]   - Yeah, why would-- - I mean--
[00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.680]   - Well, unless Apple determined,
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.400]   and it sounds to me like Apple just said,
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.880]   "Oh, well, it was,"
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.640]   you know, I think maybe he's unlikely to get fired
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.800]   if it was stolen and there's no evidence
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.640]   that he went around saying,
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.080]   "Hey, I've got the fourth generation iPhone,"
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.320]   then he's a victim.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.720]   It says if it was stolen from his office,
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.400]   he's not, he was doing what he was supposed to do
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.400]   and it was stolen.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   If he went around saying,
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.800]   "I've got the fourth generation iPhone,"
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:13.640]   maybe he's culpable.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.280]   If he left it on a bar stool, I'd fire.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:19.880]   I mean, but maybe that's Apple's way of saying,
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.400]   "No, we think it was stolen."
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.520]   - Well, and what also if,
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.960]   even if it was genuinely just left behind,
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.960]   absentmindedly and general principle,
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.000]   they would like to say,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.240]   "You know what, for being that careless
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.000]   "was something that's important,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.880]   "you're done, pack your stuff and get out."
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.800]   What if, though, see the difference with the Woz thing,
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.880]   which is interesting, and I heard from somebody else,
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.240]   I just was like secondhand,
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:49.200]   but somebody else confirmed that,
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.080]   yeah, the guy who showed him that the iPad was let go.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:58.480]   What he was shown though was not the Wi-Fi iPad.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.800]   It was the iPad with 3G.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.120]   - And there's even a picture of him
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.960]   with the 3G iPad that night.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.240]   - Right, it was like 12 hours after the debut
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:10.840]   and somebody noticed that the iPad that Woz was holding
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.240]   had the block, the black,
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.720]   it's got, it's like the original iPhone,
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   it has like an inch and a half black plastic thing
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.560]   at the top and they're like,
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:19.280]   "Whoa, he's got the one that's not coming out
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.840]   "until May."
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.040]   So that is, I don't know, I guess he was not authorized
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.760]   to take that out about or show it publicly and he did.
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:30.600]   But now in that case,
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.040]   now you can say whether it's right or wrong that Apple
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.120]   cans a guy for that, but it's the end of the story.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:40.320]   The interest is the rule is if you've got that device,
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.680]   the 3G iPad and you've got it for field testing,
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:47.680]   just like Mr. Gray had the phone for field testing,
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.320]   the rule is you can't show it to anyone.
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.360]   And this guy broke it and that's the end of the story,
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.200]   they still had it, it wasn't lost.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.840]   We're sorry, but we have to let you go.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.320]   Now with Mr. Gray, even if, now let's say they had just
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:02.840]   gotten the phone back the next day, right?
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.160]   They'd gotten the phone back.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.800]   Maybe then he gets fired because the story's over.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.360]   Maybe Mr. Gray is still on the job because Apple's,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.920]   the larger interest is Apple's now interested in pursuing
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.200]   the case against gizmodo as vigorously as they can.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.680]   And it might be in their interest to keep Mr. Gray
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:24.680]   as a gamefully employed and very thankful employee of Apple
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.560]   in the meantime.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.560]   - By the way, I misspoke while I read the story
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.200]   about was in the Wired epicenter blog.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.560]   In fact, it was a gizmodo story.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.920]   He went to gizmodo, oddly enough,
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.880]   wasn't he, I went to gizmodo to tell this story.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.480]   - Hey guys, here's something breaking,
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.160]   something that went up on the web at 1043,
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.320]   right before we started to record two
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.560]   of my favorite tech law journalist,
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:53.840]   Declan McCullough and Greg Sandoval at CNET,
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.520]   have an article up now saying,
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.960]   it's called Journalist Shield Law
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.320]   May Not Halt iPhone Probe.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.600]   And I posted the link into the chat room, Leo.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.440]   - Okay.
[00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.080]   - It goes through and it's funny because last night
[00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.400]   I was looking for Professor Eugene Volak to weigh in on this.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:15.800]   He's a long time law blogger and very smart thinking
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.920]   about these issues.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.160]   And they quote him in here.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:25.800]   He brought up that 1975 case that we talked about
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.600]   before on the show.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:32.120]   And I haven't read through this thing in great detail yet,
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:37.160]   but jumping to the punchline at the end,
[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.480]   it looks like a California court would still have to break
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:46.480]   some new ground here in California to find that
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:50.880]   this exception to the warrant provision wouldn't apply
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.160]   because of the investigation of a crime aspect.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:58.720]   So they go through and have some discussion here
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:00.940]   about how well, you know, of course it makes sense
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:04.440]   that if you're investigating a crime that shouldn't apply,
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:06.400]   but it looks like a court would still have to jump
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.480]   through some hoops to say, yeah, okay, we agree with that.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:14.960]   - That's presumably what the DA is now, you know,
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.760]   inquiring with their lawyers about
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.720]   because they don't want to go forward
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.920]   if they can't use that material.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.480]   In fact, they probably don't want to even look at that material
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.320]   to protect it.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.120]   - Right, Professor Eugene.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.200]   What would their culpability be?
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:35.880]   What would their liability be if the judge ruled,
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:37.960]   oh no, you shouldn't have done that.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.200]   Can Jason sue them?
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.040]   - Can Jason sue the--
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:43.880]   - React?
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:47.200]   - React, no, they would be immune from that.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   - Their shielded as well?
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.280]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.200]   The government is allowed to make mistakes
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.720]   as they go about their functions, unfortunately.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:00.640]   So yeah, they would be subject to immunity for that kind.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.440]   - But they give stuff back, let's--
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:06.200]   - And they theoretically followed all the rules
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.040]   that they knew of.
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:08.480]   They went to a judge, they got the warrant,
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.160]   they went through the process,
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.440]   the due process that was required in that,
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:13.640]   to their best of their knowledge,
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.800]   to the best of the judge's knowledge.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.280]   It's not like that, it doesn't,
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:18.480]   right now it doesn't look like there's any matter to us,
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.040]   specifically, nothing will be manipulated that we know of.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:27.200]   - It's a good, actually, it's a really good article
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.200]   by Greg Sandoval and Declan Kola.
[00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:30.040]   - Right.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.560]   - Well worth reading.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:35.400]   - One thing I agree, I haven't seen the law enforcement folks
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:39.360]   come back on, and obviously they're gonna be covering
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.800]   their own tracks at this point,
[00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:43.000]   but Leo, you mentioned that tech crunch piece
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.600]   about how they're pausing.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.360]   Seemed to me a pretty glaring thing
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.920]   that the warrant clearly stated they were not to go in
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.320]   and do a night search,
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.240]   and that's exactly what they did, apparently.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:58.120]   - No, no, California statute says that night search
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:00.200]   is 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.880]   - So they went in a 4 to 10 p.m.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.240]   So they're okay there.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.080]   - All right.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:08.840]   - Yeah, you were saying--
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.040]   - Well, I'm just saying that Declan,
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:12.440]   Mccola and Greg Sandoval,
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.000]   they broke the story on Friday
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.320]   that that reaction was doing this.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.600]   I mean, they were way ahead of this.
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:21.480]   And they only cited unnamed sources,
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.120]   but I know from Declan Mccola's record
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.360]   over the last 15 years,
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.080]   that when he says that there's a criminal investigation,
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:30.040]   there's a criminal investigation.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.160]   - They say in that article that Apple has spoken
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:33.840]   to local police about the incident,
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.560]   and the investigation is believed to be headed
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.080]   by the React Computer Task Force.
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:43.360]   So they got it right on.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.440]   - Let me ask you guys something about
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:53.960]   why you think they would go after Chen's materials.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.760]   - Why didn't they go to Gawker's office, you mean?
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.200]   - Well, not just that,
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:02.560]   but let's presume that Chen is the right person
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.440]   to have the information that they're actually looking for,
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.440]   the source of who this person was who sold the phone.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:12.480]   Let's presume that.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.840]   But let's also think about the way you guys do your own
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.520]   online journalism.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.720]   Are you storing a whole lot of this stuff locally these days?
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:24.000]   You know, I mean, and are you also, you know, leaving--
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.520]   - Yeah, it's a lot harder to go after Google.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.360]   (laughing)
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:30.400]   - Exactly, that's the point I'm getting at here.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.200]   - So maybe we should be storing our stuff
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:33.560]   in the cloud these days.
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.400]   - Uh-huh.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.360]   - Well, then, yeah.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.520]   - Beep, bulb.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.360]   I, if I started doing that,
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:44.640]   then I would have to take three times as much time
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.240]   examining every single TOS
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.520]   of every single cloud service that I use,
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.560]   because I'm actually a little bit more comfortable
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.240]   with law enforcement turning my office,
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   'cause you know exactly, they have to document
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.160]   everything that they took.
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.360]   There is no question as to when they were there
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.720]   and what they got.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.320]   The idea that maybe a month later,
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.000]   I get some sort of email notification saying,
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.080]   "Oh, by the way, we had a request
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.720]   "in law enforcement about a month and a half ago."
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.360]   So of course, we handed over everything
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.960]   that was in your Dropbox or anything,
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.560]   everything that was in your box.net
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.560]   and gave them free access.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.000]   And they've been basically looking at everything
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.760]   you posted there for the past month.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.840]   I think that's one of the reasons why there's some things
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.360]   I simply do not put on cloud storage of any kinds.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.200]   - Interesting.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.760]   - Not only for that, but also because there are times when
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:28.840]   you have to be able to tell a certain party that,
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.680]   no, I have full control of this information
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.280]   or this document or this device at all times.
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:37.400]   There, you can say that maybe some will break into my house
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.840]   or will break into my safety deposit box and get it,
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.720]   but you can say that there is no point at which
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.040]   someone could access that without my knowledge.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:48.440]   - Right, so I guess that begs the question
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.200]   from me to all you, Mac, aficionados.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.960]   How do I encrypt my home folder?
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.840]   (laughing)
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:57.920]   - You know, I was always told from day one,
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.960]   you write things in a reporter's notebook
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.000]   and you file them and you store them and you keep them
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.200]   and you know everything, you write everything down
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.160]   and you file it all.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.240]   - Yeah, I mean, I don't have one here,
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.920]   but that's people wonder why I have this,
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:13.840]   the Claire Fontaine notepad.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.360]   My salon, I've seen it frozen.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.440]   Okay, good.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.880]   Yeah, sometimes people wonder, make fun of me
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.280]   because at a conference or any place where I'm actually working,
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:26.080]   I'll have Claire Fontaine, like spiral bound notebook in here.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.280]   And that's because you, that's, if you need to prove
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.440]   that you're actually there somewhere and you actually talk
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.880]   to somebody and that this was actually the information
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.080]   that you got from them, it's not 100% fireproof,
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:39.640]   but the fact that you can produce, well, here are handwritten
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.640]   notes of everything that I saw and did
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.360]   while I was covering this event or talking to this person.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.640]   So if he's gonna say that later on I made something up,
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.640]   he can say, well, here is, there are no pages
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.080]   have been asserted, no pages haven't changed.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.120]   The exact same color ink pen for all the notes
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.120]   in front of this and behind this,
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.720]   we're also in the exact same thing.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.840]   And there is bleed through from the page,
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.440]   in front of it to the page behind it.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.080]   But also that also say that yes, we were on the record,
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:04.440]   you told me this and I wrote it down.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:05.280]   So-
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:06.680]   - So at least it might be the opposite.
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.680]   (laughing)
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.160]   Start buying more of those notebooks
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.880]   and writing things in ink.
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.880]   (laughing)
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.240]   - The high tech way to do things.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.880]   - Well, it's interesting, but I was always told that.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.520]   I was said, they, NBC used to tell us that,
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.440]   don't put it on your computer, write it down.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.280]   - Yeah.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.160]   - For that very reason, you can't, you know,
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.360]   you can't always prove where something came from.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.480]   I also wonder how frequently this React task force
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.120]   does this sort of thing.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:35.040]   I mean, obviously in the case of something being high profile,
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.320]   being somebody who's a member of the press,
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.040]   this is the first time.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.040]   But-
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.160]   - They must know how often do they do it in cases
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.160]   that are more like what you think of as corporate espionage,
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.280]   where you're selling it for money and not,
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:54.960]   you know, trying to keep it off of the, out of the press.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.320]   You know, like if a company calls the React task force
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.880]   and says, we have an employee who we suspect is,
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.360]   you know, selling trade secrets to a competitor,
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.680]   you know, here's our evidence, you know, backing this up.
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.880]   How often do they do that?
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.800]   I mean, it seems to me like it was a very, very well,
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.520]   or, you know, that they knew exactly what they were doing.
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.960]   You know, and the warrant, you know,
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.480]   I mean, to my lay person's terms,
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.320]   I don't know about the legal aspects of it,
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.280]   but in terms of what they were looking for was,
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:27.240]   you know, it was very intelligently.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.320]   - Really? It seemed like they cast a pretty broad net.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.880]   I mean, taking his business cards, taking his iPad.
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.400]   - Taking his airport base station.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.400]   - Yeah, it seemed like they cast a frankly,
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.920]   a too broad of a net.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.800]   - Well, I think the business card,
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:42.440]   that does seem silly and it was the first thing.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.440]   And I, my wife, you know, has been to law school,
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.120]   as they say, and she said it's probably-
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.640]   - We should simply-
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:57.640]   - It's just simply a matter of establishing that,
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:03.600]   establishing that he worked for Guizmodo.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.440]   I don't know.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.280]   - Yeah, who knows?
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.920]   I mean, I'm sure there's a reason why they take what they take,
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:08.760]   but-
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.600]   - It doesn't look like a law.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:10.680]   - Like an indignity though.
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:12.080]   Like, you know, it needs new sense cards.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:12.920]   - Yeah.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:13.760]   - I-
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.600]   - Whole litany of things taken,
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.960]   and the litany of things permitted to be taken
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.200]   under the subpoena is pretty funny.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.920]   I mean, just classic ancient lawyer legalese
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:27.920]   about how including, but not limited to CD-ROMs and floppies
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.840]   and, you know, what decade are these folks operating in exactly?
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.600]   - It was tapes that I really are digital.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.960]   (laughing)
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.840]   It's like, when I, unfortunately,
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:39.760]   I'm in the wrong room for this,
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:43.600]   but one of the few OJ-DART that I have in my house
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:46.320]   is this 1.4 gigabyte huge,
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.600]   but gorgeous like Winchester disc pack
[01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.160]   from like 1973, 1974.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.680]   It's all steel and smoked plastic and orange safety.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.400]   Don't drop this on your toes, sort of disc storage.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.280]   And I just, I don't want, I don't want ever law enforcement
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.800]   to come into my house and see stuff.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.840]   - Oh, we got to drive.
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:05.600]   I love the fact that it would make me feel better
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.680]   to know that somebody's gonna have to figure out
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.480]   if they spent $80,000 bringing out how to mount this
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.160]   on something and get whatever like,
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.400]   whatever like, you know, bank information from 1973
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.840]   was on this when I bought it at the MIT flea market.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.360]   That would at least give me some,
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.920]   (laughing)
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.160]   at least a small amount of comfort in this time of fraud.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.800]   (laughing)
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:28.640]   - All right, we're gonna take, go ahead Denise.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.080]   - Just talk about insult to injury.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.560]   They took his iPad.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:34.120]   - I know, that's what, look at his apps.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.800]   - But he's downloading, maybe he has some
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.200]   - That's a broke my heart.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.120]   - A property oriented app that he's got from him.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.600]   - Leave the guy his iPad,
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.560]   at least he can get some work done for crying out loud.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.520]   - He should be allowed to have an iPad
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.360]   the way he's behaved.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.200]   (laughing)
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.520]   - Kinda worst part would give him a month without Apple products
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.320]   so we can think about what he did.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.240]   (laughing)
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.280]   - The worst part is Apple is enforcing this rule
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.560]   that you can only buy two per person.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:58.920]   So if he's already bought two, he can't even replace it.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.160]   Can't even, the poor guy's got no iPad.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.640]   - I told this story last week, John,
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.960]   that I got an email after I'd already ordered an iPad.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.720]   And a couple of days later saying,
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.840]   well, just to make sure everybody can get one,
[01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.800]   we've canceled your order.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.920]   Thank you, bye.
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.560]   - Oh, they did that to me too.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:14.360]   (laughing)
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.960]   - I called up and was like, well, can I,
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.560]   I'd already ordered one.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.720]   And the one, the order they canceled was for two more.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.640]   And they canceled the whole order.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.520]   And I was like, well, can't I get,
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.760]   just get the one and have it put back in the queue
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.600]   at the same place?
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.440]   And they're like, no, there's no system for that.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.360]   - Funny thing is you can walk into a store and get one.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.200]   - Yeah.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.400]   - So I guess that's what they want you to do.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.080]   Make sure everybody has access, that's okay.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.920]   And Jason.
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.320]   - Surely on this side of Jerusalem,
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.200]   none suffer as we suffer.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.960]   - Actually, Israel has allowed the iPad back in.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.000]   So that's good news also for those of you headed to Israel.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.840]   We're gonna take a quick break.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.240]   We're having fun talking about the latest Mac news.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.080]   We'll probably move on.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.080]   I think we've covered this story.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.440]   Although I have a feeling we haven't heard
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.440]   the end of this story,
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.400]   Denise Howell is here from this week in law,
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:00.120]   bags and baggage and the Blogger-Rithms blog
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:00.960]   on ZDNet.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.360]   She's an actual attorney.
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.040]   Wow.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.120]   Also John Gruber from DaringFireball.net,
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.880]   Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.400]   Alex Lindsey from Zimbabwe and the Pixelco.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:11.840]   We're getting a good picture and good sound
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.680]   from Zimbabwe.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.500]   Where are you?
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:17.120]   - I am at the Solutions Center,
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:20.680]   which is the Apple reseller here in Zimbabwe.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.640]   So this was a, he's got a fairly good connection.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.880]   And although I have to admit,
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.040]   the connection in my hotel has been really good.
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.320]   I just wasn't sure if it was,
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.040]   during the day it's not as good.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:32.960]   At night I was getting 350K a second,
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:36.760]   which is better than the Hilton in Las Vegas.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.120]   So, so.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.440]   - It's really a conference.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.440]   (laughing)
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:41.960]   - Not that I'm sure.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.040]   - That's gonna be, anyway.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.600]   - This is gonna be the best trip ever for you
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.040]   because now you have like the item one
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.480]   on every single comment card of every single hotel
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.480]   you ever check into for the rest of your life.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.360]   I was in Zimbabwe.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.600]   (laughing)
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.120]   - And I was in Zimbabwe and it was
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.840]   in the Chicago Hotel, thank you very much.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:05.160]   - Well, we're glad we had,
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.000]   we thought we wouldn't get you.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.240]   We're glad we could get you from Zimbo.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.920]   What time is it in the, are you in Harare?
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:09.760]   Where are we?
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:14.280]   - I'm in Harare, I'm here for the Harare International
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:16.200]   Festival for the Arts and it's nine,
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.040]   nine PM and stuff.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.120]   - That's not actually true lately.
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.320]   We're about nine hours ahead.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:21.280]   - Glad we could have you here.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.760]   Before we go much further with this great panel
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.240]   and this great show, we're gonna talk a little bit
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.120]   about Citrix, the folks who do go to meeting,
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:31.320]   go to my PC, the Citrix Mode Access tools you use
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:33.680]   in the Windows Professional Environment.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.400]   They've got a new product, brand new,
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:39.640]   just came out last month that a lot of us who help
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:42.280]   teach people how to use things will find very, very valuable.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:45.000]   It's called GoToTraining.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.040]   It's the latest and greatest e-learning tool from Citrix.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.880]   It allows up to 200 people at once
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.040]   connect to your training session,
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.600]   right from their desktops in real time.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.200]   You can actually save it, you can record it
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.720]   and have them do it on demand as well.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:04.560]   Later, tests, polls, chat, feedback, all available.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.640]   You can pass presenter control from one computer to another
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.760]   so you can have multiple presenters
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.120]   and multiple locales.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.120]   The recording is really handy,
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.160]   but even more than that, you can upload documents of any kind
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:18.920]   to a training library, a curriculum
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.160]   so that your trainees can read ahead
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.280]   before the training begins or afterwards.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.800]   Customizing the tests is easy,
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.040]   you can send out email invitations with a click of the mouse
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.760]   to all of your participants.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:33.840]   Really, I can go on and on, this thing is really fantastic.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.320]   I love the polling feature.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.440]   A great way to keep your trainees involved,
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.240]   excited and pay in attention.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.000]   If you're an IT manager, you might want to bring up
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.560]   go to training at your next staff meeting.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.720]   If you've attended a training session recently
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.880]   and you thought they could be better,
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.760]   drop a line to the trainer and tell them about 30 days
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.160]   free of go to training.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.600]   If you're a trainer, test drive, go to trainingfree.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.920]   Just go to go to training.com,
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:05.600]   G-O-T-O training.com, 30 days free,
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.560]   simple to install, simple to use
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.760]   and your trainees are gonna love it.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:12.240]   Go to training.com.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:13.080]   You mentioned the floppy,
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.520]   as Sony has announced it's gonna,
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.760]   it stopped making them last year,
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.200]   it's gonna stop selling them next year,
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:20.000]   which shows you that you can stop making something
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.680]   and then two years later still be selling it,
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.400]   shows you there's not a lot of demand for it.
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:25.640]   The end of the floppy.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.200]   This is also, I saw a really good article from Macworld,
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.600]   the 25th anniversary of the laser writer.
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   Ben Genward's wrote a great kind of reminiscence
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.560]   about the first laser writer.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.960]   I remember my friend Tom Santos,
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.840]   who later started the Mac Adam store in San Francisco,
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:47.320]   had one of the very first laser writers,
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.520]   there were $6,000 at the time.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.800]   He had a Mac, I guess it was a Mac plus
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.200]   and a laser writer in a van
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.120]   and he was going around doing portable desktop publishing
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.120]   for people.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.840]   He'd drive up and park out front
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.640]   and do desktop publishing.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.600]   It was a breakthrough in the 1985,
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.720]   the first laser, any of you ever have a laser writer?
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.040]   You guys are also young.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.440]   - No, I actually bought Don Lancaster's
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:17.800]   really great post-grid books
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.920]   'cause he was promoting it as a computer
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:22.880]   and at the time it was Apple's most expensive
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   and most powerful computer.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.200]   - I guess that's true if you spoke post-grid.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.040]   - Right, right.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:31.280]   And so I was in college when it first came out
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.880]   and it first appeared in a lab.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.480]   And as I was told by the administrator,
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.800]   job number one of the person who administrators this lab
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.040]   is prevent like stupid, like college students
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:41.400]   from printing like a thousand sheets
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:43.040]   of their own letterhead on it.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:43.880]   (laughing)
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880]   It's like, okay, for,
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.840]   one of the big, big bold letters,
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.960]   it says that any page over 20 pages you print on this
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.720]   will be billed to your student account at $20 per page.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.560]   - Yeah.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.880]   - That had to happen because it's like, you know what?
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.480]   There's a reason why nobody on the campus
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.320]   can print to the sprinter.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.040]   That's because, you know,
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.840]   and of course the other guy's name,
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.320]   the guy's address, the guy's phone number
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.000]   has to go over and over and over again.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.160]   It was, it was, but it was a miraculous thing.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.840]   You can't really accept what a miraculous thing it was
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.240]   to be able to print at this kind of resolution
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.680]   and it's beautiful. - Beautiful.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.280]   - 300 dots per inch.
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.920]   Set the $7,000 that cost according to Ben Genwards
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.120]   would be about $15,000 in modern dollars.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:24.960]   That just to give you an idea,
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.840]   I mean, this thing was expensive.
[01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:28.320]   It was really expensive.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.440]   I have a friend, a fairly well-known person
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:31.960]   and listens to me. - It was magical though.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:35.160]   It was magical. - It was what magical it was.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.000]   - Yeah.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.080]   - I have a friend who-- - Sorry, I'm gonna find.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:39.920]   - Yeah, you are.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.760]   You're getting a little latency.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:41.600]   That's all right.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.760]   Just answer the question before I ask it
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.800]   and I think we'll all be fine.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:47.760]   Two, three, no. - Yes, no.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.600]   In fact.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.600]   (laughing)
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.440]   - Perfect.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.280]   (laughing)
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:53.440]   It's exactly, it's a typical Mac break weekly.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:56.480]   This guy was looking on eBay and noticed
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:57.640]   how much iPads we're going for
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.040]   and then he noticed how much old leases we're going for.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:00.880]   He went in his garage.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.560]   He has a vintage Lisa in perfect condition.
[01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.520]   And he said, "I wanna sell it, but I need to wipe the hard drive."
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.120]   And does anybody know?
[01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:13.360]   (laughing)
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.680]   I mean, talk about it, a bizarre problem to have.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:21.200]   - Well, I'm trying to think about first of all,
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.960]   anybody who might have liable is probably dead by now.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.960]   - Well, that's true.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.760]   - Any porn is gonna be like one bit,
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:29.000]   like eight pixels by 16 pixels.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.360]   - Yeah, I don't think it's porn he's worried about.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.200]   You're right.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:33.120]   No, he said he did a lot of M&A stuff
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.880]   and not B&D M&A.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.400]   And so he's worried that they're--
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.240]   - Is that what they're calling it now?
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:39.360]   I'm trying to list it.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.200]   - Private deal details would be on the hard drive still.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:45.400]   But I think I'm probably the case
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:46.720]   that the operating system for the Lisa
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.720]   was on the hard drive as well.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.160]   So you really kind of want to be judicious
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.160]   about wiping that drive.
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.040]   He wants it to be a working Lisa.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.560]   So if anybody listening to Mac break weekly
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.600]   knows how to solve this person's problem,
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.280]   let me know.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.080]   I asked on the radio show, nothing.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.720]   You have to have a Twiggy drive.
[01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.680]   Just crazy.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.120]   - Oh, it wasn't the chance that the Twig even works now, yeah.
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:09.960]   - Right.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.240]   Well, he says there's a pristine shape that it's a,
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.000]   he turned it on and booted immediately.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.920]   It's kind of amazing that the hard drive works.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.120]   - According to AdMob who's paying attention to these things,
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   Apple's iPhone has nearly half of all global smartphone use.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:30.280]   They know that because of course,
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.000]   they've got statistics on ads.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.840]   Turns out all these statistics were getting these days
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.960]   are from companies that serve ads on various platforms.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.640]   They know more than anybody.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:42.520]   For instance, that the iPad is selling really, really well.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.200]   AdMob-- - How about the statistic
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.760]   that Wired made available?
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.760]   - What was that?
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.800]   - A huge boost in, I think that iPads are now
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:58.760]   the most traffic generating device for Wired.com.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.960]   - Whoa.
[01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:01.320]   - Yeah. - Wow.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.480]   That's interesting.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.400]   You know, I read a lot of periodicals on,
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.960]   I was actually very excited 'cause a New Yorker
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.920]   has a digital edition and then they do this really stupid thing.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.240]   It's like a PDF and you can't,
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:13.920]   it's just, it doesn't not only does it not work well
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.280]   in the iPad, it doesn't work on anything well.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:17.920]   But I did hear rumors that they're gonna be doing
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:18.920]   a New Yorker application.
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.360]   In fact, most of the Condi publications
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.920]   will be doing applications for the iPad.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.160]   That seems to be the way to do it, which is too bad.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.100]   I wish they do a web OS kind of a version.
[01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:31.960]   - I'm not sure about those AdMob statistics
[01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.960]   because that's AdMob is in-app advertising.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.160]   - Right, right.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.160]   - I don't know how fair that is to non-iPhone OS devices.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.200]   I know that they sell ads for Android apps
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:48.160]   but I'm not sure that we can conclude
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.160]   that Android apps are equally, for lack of a better verb,
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.440]   AdMobbed as iPhone apps.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:57.680]   I don't know about that.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.600]   I think the more interesting statistic
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.680]   are the web servers statistics.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.040]   You know, that if you run a web server
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.120]   and look at your logs and see how many hits
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.080]   are coming from these various devices.
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.720]   And they look very, you know,
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:10.840]   when you look at mobile devices,
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:14.280]   look overwhelmingly in favor of the iPhone OS devices.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.120]   - Yeah, yours, I'm not sure.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:15.940]   - I'm not sure. - I'm not sure.
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:16.780]   - But, you know, I don't know.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.040]   We'd have to look at see what wired
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.800]   and other tech blogs are saying, right?
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.140]   - Correct.
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:22.040]   - What about iPad?
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.640]   Do you get a lot of iPad visits, John, during Fireball?
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.480]   - Oh, a ton.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.320]   I forget.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:29.240]   I think it's like 8% or something like that now.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.320]   - Wow.
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.160]   - That's really interesting.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.560]   I wonder when this--
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.560]   - So I just looked at that up
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.680]   of the mobile devices accessing wire.com.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:40.680]   In the short time, the iPad has been available.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.440]   It's now 26% of the traffic.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.520]   - Nope. (laughing)
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.360]   It's amazing.
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.040]   Nobody at this point could gain say
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.520]   that the iPad has a huge success.
[01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:53.520]   - And you-- - One thing that--
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.080]   - Yet there is this,
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.960]   and it seems to me even more strident than ever before,
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:02.200]   group of Apple haters that are,
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:05.000]   if anybody says anything positive about the iPad,
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.320]   immediately say, "Oh, you're a fan boy."
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:08.640]   Are the Apple haters, John,
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.680]   you would probably be subject to more of this
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.560]   than any human alive?
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.480]   Are the Apple haters getting worse?
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:18.160]   - I don't think they're getting worse.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.080]   I think that it's,
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.280]   I think that the arguments are more or less the same,
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:27.280]   but it's that they seem to be getting more agitated
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.600]   as because Apple is succeeding so well.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.880]   You know, it's sort of like,
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.040]   like take the,
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.720]   not to say whether,
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:37.920]   you don't even have to say whether we agree with them or not,
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.120]   but take like the Tea Party guys in national politics
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:41.960]   in the US,
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.280]   who are in this Tea Party movement.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.720]   I don't think that their positions have changed,
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.800]   you know, in recent years,
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.640]   I think,
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.880]   but they've become more agitated because politicians,
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.040]   who they disagree with have, you know,
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.440]   taken the White House and Congress.
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.280]   So I think that the people who really, really are just,
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.480]   you know, Apple haters or whatever you wanna call them,
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.520]   I think that they're just,
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.440]   they're a little bit more vociferous now
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.680]   because Apple is succeeding so well.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.600]   That'd be driving them crazy.
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.600]   - Right, I mean, I just asked on Twitter the other day,
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.960]   how many, if anybody could figure out
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.400]   how many newtons sold in total a decade ago?
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.240]   And the best guess,
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.760]   somebody, the Wall Street Journal had a thing in 1998,
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.640]   right around when they canceled the project,
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.320]   that it seemed like the best number
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:30.880]   that anybody come up with was about 200,000.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:35.360]   So that from 1993 to 1998, Apple sold 200,000 of them.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:38.240]   They sold 300,000 iPads the first day.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.080]   - One day.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.080]   (laughing)
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.800]   - Which doesn't count the pre-orders for the 3G
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:43.800]   that didn't ship yet.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:44.640]   - Right.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   - I mean, it's a very different Apple
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.560]   than the Apple of a decade ago.
[01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:51.600]   But I think some of the arguments against, you know,
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.040]   the products and the people who enjoy them the most
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:54.960]   haven't changed.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.160]   - There was a rumor, very strong rumor
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.520]   that broke just after we did the show last week
[01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.680]   that Apple might spend $8 billion of its $32 billion
[01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:07.840]   war chest on ARM.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.920]   ARM is of course the fabulous chip foundry
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.000]   that designs many chips for many mobile devices,
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.560]   including all the Apple mobile devices.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.520]   And in fact, the A4 and the iPad is based
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.000]   on an ARM platform, it's best we can tell.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.560]   I supply actually, and ARM itself,
[01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.640]   poured some cold water on those reports.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.080]   I supply, said it doesn't make any sense
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.360]   for Apple to do that.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:37.800]   Unless they somehow decided it's a very costly acquisition
[01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:42.320]   with very little in the way of true strategic benefits,
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.160]   it would not give Apple's price competitive edge
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.160]   or differentiating value,
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.240]   mostly because ARM already has deals
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.160]   with all these other companies.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.840]   He says there would be no visible end market impact scene
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:55.480]   for two years at a minimum.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.960]   And I supplies, chief executive itself said,
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.520]   Warren East said, "Exciting though this is to have
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.360]   the share price pushed up by these rumors,
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.400]   common sense tells us that our standard business model
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.040]   is an excellent way for technology companies
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.440]   to gain access to our technology.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:10.880]   Nobody has to buy the company."
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.200]   - Yep.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.320]   - You throw that rumor out the window.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.520]   I don't usually do rumors on the show.
[01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:19.360]   Now it's grabbing me, it's biting me for doing those.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.080]   How about this one?
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.680]   I wanted to get Victor Kyo on.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.040]   Andy, you talked about it a little bit.
[01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:29.840]   Victor discovered that you can use the camera connector
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.800]   to import audio.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.840]   - Yeah, iPad camera connector, yeah.
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:37.760]   My camera connection kit just came in this morning.
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:40.240]   And so the first thing I wanted to do with it,
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.640]   I first heard about it from Glenn Fleischman's
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.240]   really great piece on tidbits.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.840]   And the funny thing is, if you plug in a standard,
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.640]   any like standard USB audio device,
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:55.320]   just like this USB Yeti microphone
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.400]   and launch any application that expects
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.240]   an external recording device,
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.240]   it will actually work just fine through the iPad.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.480]   So I plugged this in, I loaded up a recorder pro,
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.520]   which is my favorite iPhone recorder app.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:12.280]   No must, no fuss, it used it as an audio input device.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.720]   You said it as an audio output device
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:15.800]   'cause I got my headphones plugged into it.
[01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.640]   Recorded beautiful audio, I posted a couple of sound clips,
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:23.640]   some music, ukulele to my website
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:27.040]   and also some spoken audio.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.240]   It worked with this microphone,
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:30.400]   it worked great with my USB headset,
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.280]   worked great in Skype.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:34.480]   The only thing that I tried that did not work with it
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.760]   was oddly enough, this is my USB ukulele.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:41.600]   And for some reason it did not like this device,
[01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:43.600]   I don't know whether it's just that I didn't have
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.640]   the inputs set correctly.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.480]   - Sounds good.
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.400]   - Yeah, in the back.
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:53.000]   I think that it's gonna be mostly limited
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.480]   by the quality of the sound app that you're using.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:00.280]   - So it's full wave audio.
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.160]   - Do you think it's an oversight by Apple
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.200]   or it must, it couldn't have been,
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.200]   they must have engineered it.
[01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:07.080]   - I think, well, see it also works with USB keyboards.
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:10.920]   I used my classic iMac keyboard with it
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.440]   and that works just fine.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.960]   Including all this, all that other stuff.
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.160]   I tried, I guess where I was doing my tests,
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.400]   I tried a USB mouse, that doesn't work,
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.240]   I tried me to do that.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.280]   - Does not work, does it work, right?
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.960]   - I think it just tells us that when internally
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:30.080]   the hardware architecture,
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:33.160]   when it sees, like, we realize that the iPad
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:35.640]   is designed to work with mechanical keyboards.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.280]   It ships, you can buy a mechanical keyboard for it
[01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.840]   that connects to the dock.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:43.840]   The iPhone also can work with external audio
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:48.200]   if you plug it into a device that goes into the dock.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:50.280]   I think this basically says that internally
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.160]   the iPad sees those devices as things that are connected up
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.120]   via a USB bus and for that reason, speculation, of course.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:01.640]   And for that reason, the iPad OS has built in drivers
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.800]   for these universal type apps,
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.200]   excuse me, universal type devices.
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.720]   If you try to hook up something really clever,
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.320]   like you try to hook up a USB hard drive to it,
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.600]   that's no go.
[01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.480]   If you try to hook up anything else
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:19.880]   that's sort of out of the mainstream to it,
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.200]   that's not gonna work either.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:24.000]   The only other devices that I was able to get to work with it
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.520]   are USB key drives.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:28.280]   If you have-- - Really?
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:31.920]   - Well, quick qualification.
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:34.120]   - You can't do anything with them, but it'll see it.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.440]   - Well, yes and no.
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:39.680]   The whole point of this device is to basically slurp in
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.480]   pictures and video from USB.
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:46.400]   The way that that happens is that there is basically
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:51.240]   a simple standard that's along as the device is formatted
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.200]   in exactly the right way and presents itself
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.520]   to the master device in the right way.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.920]   It will present, it is findable,
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.240]   the pictures and video to the master device.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.360]   So if you were to format this key drive
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:07.040]   as like a FAT or a FAT32 device,
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:10.640]   which is what the camera cards are formatted as,
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.080]   and you put a bunch of JPEGs on that key drive,
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.200]   then those can be slurped into the pictures app.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.320]   The big limitation is just simply the idea
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.120]   of is there software on the iPad that is designed
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:23.480]   to be able to access that sort of stuff.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.720]   So again, if you put a video file on there,
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.840]   you will be able to import it into the pictures app,
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:29.240]   but you can't do anything else with it.
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:32.000]   If you were to put a Word file onto that key drive,
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.280]   you would not be able to get it at it with pages
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.480]   or any other app because it's just not designed to do that.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.080]   If you were to plug in a USB printer,
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.560]   that also would not work because there's nothing on the,
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:44.120]   there are no drivers or printers on there,
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:46.400]   nor are these apps designed to support them.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.840]   The interesting thing to me though,
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.320]   and this is what I put up in the blog post,
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.080]   is what if some, there already,
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.080]   there's a pretty emerging market for third party apps
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.520]   that will allow you to print documents via Wi-Fi
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.120]   shared printing off of the iPad.
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.840]   What if one of these people decided to say,
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.040]   you know what, let's create an app that has
[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:08.640]   all the printed drivers for epson, HP,
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.320]   let's you download printed drivers.
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:13.920]   And so it will give local hardwired copy,
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.760]   copper wire, USB local printing capabilities to the iPad.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.360]   I think that even if such a thing were possible,
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.920]   I don't think it's possible.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.280]   If such a thing were possible,
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:27.880]   that would be an easy no from the iPad app store
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:29.440]   if they try to get that for approval.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.320]   I don't think that Apple would try to shut down,
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.440]   yeah, keeping these USB keyboards and USB microphones
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:38.320]   from working 'cause that would probably be a technical
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.360]   can of worms to shut down devices that don't belong to them,
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.080]   but make sure that people can still use approved devices.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:46.280]   But I think that that's, you know,
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.040]   enjoy what you got while you got it.
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:52.200]   And don't try to tip the vessel of knowledge too early.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.440]   - It's good news for people to audio.
[01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:55.360]   It's very good news.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:58.040]   I mean, see my big point is that the purpose,
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:00.400]   the big deal for me personally for the iPad
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.920]   is that it's supposed to be the computer I take with me
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.560]   when I don't really need to take a real computer with me.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.720]   And for me, that's a short list of things
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:10.160]   that are just sort of deal-breaker sort of things
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.840]   where I'm gone for three days,
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:13.360]   I have no intention of doing anything,
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.040]   but unfortunately, I gotta do a live Skype call,
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.760]   Skype in for podcasts on Monday, so I have damn it.
[01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:20.920]   That means I really do have to take my MacBook with me.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.320]   Now all I gotta do is take my headset and I'm good.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.240]   - Ah, I love that.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:27.080]   So yeah, that's awesome.
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.400]   - Yeah.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:32.080]   John Gruber, you mentioned that you thought WWDC dates
[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.920]   would be announced today or tomorrow, is that right?
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:40.320]   - Oh, hello, can you hear me?
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.160]   - Yeah.
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.680]   - Are you not saying anything?
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.520]   Are you there?
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.280]   - Got real quiet.
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.520]   - Got real quiet.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:48.520]   - Got it up.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.520]   - Is it me?
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.520]   - Is it me?
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.520]   - Can you hear you?
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.520]   - I see it.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.520]   - I can hear you.
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.520]   - It froze up on me for a second.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.520]   - Oh, okay.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.520]   - Good.
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:58.520]   - You said something about WWDC dates.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:26:59.520]   Do you know those yet?
[01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:04.520]   - Do I know now or do I think I know?
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:06.520]   - I think you know it's fine with me.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:07.520]   I'm not picky.
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.520]   - I think I know, but I'm not gonna say
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:11.520]   'cause I don't want anybody out there listening
[01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.520]   to go book tickets and then when I'm wrong,
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.520]   they send me the bill for the airfare.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.520]   - Ah, okay.
[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:17.520]   So you know nothing?
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.520]   - I believe that an announcement is imminent.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.520]   - Any day now.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520]   - And it's relevant.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.520]   - We need an hour.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.520]   - Yeah, we care because we think that's when
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.520]   the iPhone will be announced or...
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.520]   - Well, there's another reason to care too,
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.520]   if you know anybody who's a developer,
[01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:32.520]   is if it's the case that they're going to announce it
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:37.520]   very soon and the date is in June or even early June,
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.520]   it's really cutting it close.
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.520]   Like if you perhaps like me, we're online shopping
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.520]   for airfare last night.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.520]   - I wonder why.
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:49.520]   - And looking at dates in early June,
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:52.520]   it's really a lot more expensive than if you know...
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:53.520]   - Right.
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:27:54.520]   - They announced it a month ago.
[01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.520]   - Wish they could have been a little more upfront.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.520]   - Right, and for European developers,
[01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:01.520]   I think it's even worse.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:02.520]   I think it's a lot worse.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:06.520]   I think that with only five or six weeks or seven weeks,
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:09.520]   whatever, it might end up being noticed.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.520]   It's really a lot more expensive.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.520]   So color me shocked that Apple doesn't really have
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:20.520]   a ton of respect or consideration for developers that...
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:23.520]   - Hey, we're making you plenty of money.
[01:28:23.520 --> 01:28:24.520]   What do you need?
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.520]   What are you complaining about?
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:30.520]   Here's an interesting app that won't probably
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.520]   ever make it to the App Store,
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:37.520]   but I sure would like to Wi-Fi syncing.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:41.520]   Like the ability to say use a camera or a variety of other things
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.520]   with the iPad, it would be sure nice to be have Wi-Fi syncing
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.520]   with my iPhone and iPad, another Wi-Fi, iPod Touch,
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:51.520]   Wi-Fi-enabled iPod devices.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.520]   - I emailed the developer of that app.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520]   He sent me an email.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.520]   I guess he's submitted the app, but it hasn't gotten an answer yet.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:59.520]   He sent, showed me a video and I emailed him and said,
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:02.520]   "Are you sure you're not using any private APIs or anything?"
[01:29:02.520 --> 01:29:04.520]   He said, "No, it was a lot of work,
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.520]   but as far as he can tell, he's playing it by the book."
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.520]   I don't know though.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.520]   That seems like the sort of...
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.520]   - Serious voodoo.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:14.520]   - Yeah.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:17.520]   I mean, if the video is even vaguely accurate,
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:20.520]   it's exactly what everybody has been sort of asking for
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.520]   ever since the iPhone came out of.
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.520]   If my iPhone has Wi-Fi and my Mac has Wi-Fi
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:29.520]   and my iPhone is here in my local network,
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.520]   why do I have to connect my iPhone by USB to sync?
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:34.520]   - Right.
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.520]   - But I don't know.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:40.520]   That seems like that that's the sort of features that are like
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.520]   should be in the system itself are the sort of things that apples
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.520]   seems to reject apps for.
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:47.520]   - Well, the developer has two points.
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.520]   He's kind of pulling an opera saying, "Well, I challenge you."
[01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:51.520]   - Right.
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:52.520]   - "Look, I did it.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.520]   I challenge you to say, okay, and if not,
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.520]   the other point he's making is you can do this.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:58.520]   Why didn't you do it?"
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.520]   - I mean, if it comes through, I mean,
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:02.520]   I'll be first in line to buy it.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.520]   It looks amazing.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.520]   - Hell's.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:07.520]   Especially on an iPad that would be very nice to have wireless
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:09.520]   syncing on an iPad.
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.520]   - But it foregoes the iTunes.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.520]   - No, it syncs to iTunes.
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.520]   - Oh, it does?
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:16.520]   - I think it has some...
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:17.520]   I think it requires...
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:19.520]   - It's using iTunes, I think.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:20.520]   - Yeah.
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:22.520]   I think you install something on your Mac, too,
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:24.520]   that is sort of like the listening device.
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:27.520]   And then the software that's running on your Mac
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.520]   talks to iTunes locally on the Mac.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.520]   You know, I made perhaps through AppleScript
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.520]   or something, you know, the scripting interface
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.520]   or something like that.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.520]   - So, you know, as you can see in this video,
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:40.520]   it suddenly Ross's French phone shows up,
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.520]   French iPod shows up on the iTunes and his syncing.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:48.520]   Unless this is one of those, you know, David Blaine videos.
[01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:49.520]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.520]   It just seems too good to be true.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.520]   - I don't know.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.520]   - But when you're putting your iPhone in its little cradle
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:57.520]   to sync in front of your computer,
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.520]   you have to look at iTunes and maybe buy a song.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.520]   - Ah, it could be.
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:01.520]   It could be.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.520]   And of course, a lot of what Apple does...
[01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:07.520]   This is something, by the way, Microsoft's done in Zoom
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:09.520]   and will do, and it's can and probably will do
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:11.520]   in Windows Mobile's phones as well.
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:13.520]   So, Microsoft's way ahead on this.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.520]   But it does look like the kind of thing that Apple might not want
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.520]   to do for some sort of reason having to do with piracy
[01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:20.520]   or its agreements with the record companies.
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:23.520]   They seem to really not like to give you too much access
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.520]   to what's going on inside those devices.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.520]   Even though hackers love it.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:34.520]   - I mentioned that the Israelis have lifted the ban on the iPad,
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:37.520]   but it is still day eight of the iPad held hostage at Princeton
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.520]   University.
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.520]   Let's see.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:45.520]   Job says there will not be an App Store for desktops
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:49.520]   as there is an App Store for phones.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:54.520]   Fernando Valente, developer at Keyaro Software,
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.520]   emailed Steve Jobs, and this is another one of those great.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.520]   Steve Jobs' email replies.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:03.520]   Remember, last time I think he said, "Yep."
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:07.520]   This time when Jobs was asked about the rumors of a Mac App Store,
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:10.520]   Job's answer was, "Nope."
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:13.520]   (laughing)
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:15.520]   - He's gotta be having fun with it at this point.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:16.520]   - I think he's...
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.520]   Yeah, at this point, absolutely.
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.520]   He knows what's going on, right?
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.520]   He knows it's gonna come out.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:22.520]   - And there's a wonderful style to his emails.
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:25.520]   I think it was on MetaFilter yesterday.
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:27.520]   If it wasn't MetaFilter, maybe it was Hacker News,
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:30.520]   but one of those sites where it sits, chocolate block with,
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:34.520]   you know, comments, talking about the Gizmodo story had a fake,
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:35.520]   you know, obviously fake.
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:39.520]   You know, the comment was a fake email from Steve Jobs on the situation.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.520]   You know, it was like, "Hey, Steve, I'm worried about Jason Chennett Gizmodo.
[01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:43.520]   Have you heard about this story?"
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:46.520]   And the answer was, "So he gets a lawyer.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:47.520]   No big deal."
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520]   - Yeah, no big deal.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.520]   That's the one.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.520]   No big deal.
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:51.520]   (laughing)
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:54.520]   - That was like the one where somebody had to change the name of the rap.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:55.520]   - Right.
[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:57.520]   - So you changed the name of your rap, no big deal.
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.520]   - No big deal.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.520]   - Hey.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.520]   - So you got a lawyer.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.520]   - No big deal.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.520]   - You're right.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   I mean, what's great is you hear Steve.
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:05.520]   I mean, you hear his voice.
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.520]   He's got a voice.
[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:07.520]   Steve, you should write.
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.520]   You've got a voice.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:13.520]   - I think he's auditioning for the role of the stage manager in our town.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:14.520]   - Yep.
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.520]   - 'Cause he's a lot of folks here.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.520]   - Yep.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.520]   - No well gosh.
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.520]   - Yep.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:22.520]   - I have a simple hand cup of tin of quarters.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:23.520]   - Yep.
[01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.520]   - Why?
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.520]   There's old Jezebel.
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:26.520]   (laughing)
[01:33:26.520 --> 01:33:30.280]   - Hackers are targeting Windows using iPad owners with a bogus update.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:34.720]   This is from Computer World.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:40.520]   If you go to your iTunes, it's a Romanian security company Bitdefender found this.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:43.760]   It's very important to keep the software in your iPad updated for best performance,
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.160]   newer features and security, the message reads, to get the latest version of iTunes software,
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:53.280]   please go to and a malicious website and install the application.
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.400]   And the fact that anybody falls for this just proves that Windows users are not so bright.
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:01.760]   - I've got a Nigerian oil millionaire is crust fun to stall you.
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:02.760]   - Okay.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:04.560]   Whatever you say.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:10.400]   - You get the backdoor Bifros AADY Trojan.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:14.040]   If you should install that.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:20.400]   I love this Bitdefender says, "When you have the iPad, you do expect to receive messages."
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:21.400]   (laughing)
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:27.480]   - Maybe not email, but messages of some sort from Apple that we have finished an update.
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:29.040]   You have to get this update.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:32.120]   They are clever to do it this way.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:36.480]   Mac users are not vulnerable to the attack, even if you go to the bogus iTunes site because,
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:39.760]   of course, the Trojan only runs on Windows.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.400]   Facebook, I think this is a victory for Apple.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:47.680]   Facebook has changed the way its video works on the site.
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:50.800]   It now has iPad and iPhone compatible because it no longer uses Flash.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:53.520]   They're doing an HTML5 playback.
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.520]   - Okay.
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:35:02.040]   See, this is why it's so frustrating to find out when is Apple being arrogant and stupid
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:06.200]   and self-delusional and when do they simply know how powerful they are?
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:10.120]   Because you start with the idea of, "Yes, we got supporting Flash.
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:11.440]   Of course, we don't need Flash."
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.360]   Yes, but every single site on the planet uses Flash to serve video.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.680]   Well, they'll change after we really start our vice-versa.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:18.680]   You're an idiot!
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:19.680]   Oh, you're not.
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:23.080]   YouTube change, Facebook change, everyone else is changing, CBS change.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:24.080]   Okay.
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:25.080]   We're sorry.
[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:26.080]   Hulu change.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.520]   Hulu is apparently going to do a $9 iPad, a month iPad, subscription app to let you watch
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.160]   Hulu content on the iPad.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:38.080]   See, I want to see where they put the border between pay and free content.
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:41.880]   What I've been reading says that if you want to see recent episodes that's still free,
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:45.920]   if you want to go deeper into the catalog, then that's what comes under the $9 a month
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:47.720]   of subscription fee.
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.640]   And I'm not sure if that...
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:53.160]   They have to have some sort of a happy medium between the two because I use Hulu just to
[01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.360]   catch up on something that I might have missed last week because I was traveling.
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:01.800]   I'm not sure that I want to see an episode of "House" from earlier in the season, from
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:03.880]   four or five months ago on my iPad.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:05.280]   Well, that might change, though.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:08.160]   I think there are a lot of people who are looking at replacing cable with some sort of
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.160]   allocart system.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:15.160]   And if more stuff you can get allocart for 10 bucks a month instead of 100 bucks a month.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:18.600]   But see, that's the more interesting point because a lot of people take a certain amount
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.880]   of pleasure from, "Oh, we're sticking it to the cable companies.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:24.800]   I'm not spending 60 bucks a month for their stupid package.
[01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:31.000]   I'm just going to spend $14 a month for Netflix and $10 a month for Hulu and $8 a month for..."
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.480]   And then you can get really $10 a month to death with all these different services that
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.000]   you're subscribing to.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.400]   And my usual default position is if you want more than $3 a month from you, I got to wait
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.720]   three months before I've proved to myself that your service is worth it.
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:47.720]   Let me clarify this.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:53.640]   The CNET article says the iPad was not banned at Cornell, George Washington, or Princeton
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.640]   University.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:37:02.080]   So, Princeton's chief information officer at the IT office saying there has not been
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.080]   a ban on the iPad.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.720]   There are several iPads on campus even as we speak.
[01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.400]   And the number continues to grow every day when the first iPads arrived.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:11.880]   We saw there were some problems with them on the campus network.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:17.640]   We talked about that last week, the DHCP lease flaw, which is an actual flaw in the way
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.600]   the DHCP is done on the iPad.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.040]   When our networking staff saw a problem, they put a temporary network block on the device,
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:27.840]   and on all iPads, just on that iPad, as they do with all devices that are not functioning
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:31.480]   correctly, as soon as a user has addressed the issue.
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:39.440]   Okay, this is a little bit, if you'll forgive me Denise, lawyerly, as soon as the user has
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:42.160]   addressed the issue, the device is immediate loud back on the network.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.160]   And that's what's happening with the iPad.
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:47.120]   Of course, how are you going to address the issue if you can't patch the iPad?
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.800]   The fix, the temporary workaround is to never let it sleep.
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:53.800]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:55.040]   Burn out, it's hard drive.
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:58.280]   We're not banning the iPad.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.200]   You just can't ever let it sleep.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.440]   The key feature of the iPad is ever made.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:04.440]   Yeah, it is.
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:06.120]   Don't get Freddy Krueger all over again.
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:08.280]   Yeah, it's the nightmare on Elton.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.720]   Don't go to sleep iPad.
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.880]   They'll ban you.
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:18.880]   Steve Jobs, according to Gala Valley, Wagg, there is a rumor that Steve Jobs has tentatively
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:22.960]   agreed to appear on stage at Wall Street Journal's D conference for June 1 through
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:25.440]   the 3rd.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:28.960]   Check your playing tickets there, Mr. Gruber.
[01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:30.200]   June 1 through the 3rd.
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:34.480]   It's in Rancho Palace, Verdes down in Southern California near Santa Barbara.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:37.000]   I saw Steve Jobs at the first D conference.
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.080]   Did any of you guys go to that?
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.480]   He wasn't either with Bill Gates.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.480]   He was.
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.480]   That was amazing.
[01:38:41.480 --> 01:38:43.800]   I didn't go to it, but I saw it on video.
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:44.800]   Amazing conversation.
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.640]   I've blogged it at the time.
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:52.120]   He said, "We'll never do a tablet."
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.120]   It's an iPad.
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120]   It's not a tablet.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.880]   People don't read anymore either.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:38:59.880]   Yeah, right.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.920]   People don't read their iBook store.
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:05.040]   They'll never watch video on a small screen.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.720]   We should make a collection of those.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:11.040]   Well, what's become apparent is that when Steve says, "Never," your ear should perk
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:15.400]   up, that probably means they're working on something, right?
[01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:22.200]   Never is an interesting word in his vocabulary.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:30.400]   You tweeted John at midnight this morning, Easter time, 9pm last night, that the WDBC
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.760]   announcement would be soon.
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.760]   We're just waiting.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.920]   That's not exactly what I said.
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:39.040]   Isn't it amazing the power of the tweet?
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.040]   It is.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:43.000]   It's actually very, it's surprising to me.
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:47.320]   Because it's so immediate, it's actually, I think there's still four more people who
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:51.480]   read my website than who follow me on Twitter, but the immediate reaction of putting something
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.720]   on Twitter is more palpable.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.600]   Did anybody read Dan Lyons?
[01:39:56.600 --> 01:40:02.280]   I know you don't read Dan Lyons, but anybody read Dan Lyons' Newsweek column, "Fortress
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.280]   Apple.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.360]   The company needs to open up."
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:18.320]   The old cells were blinded on the Mac world column that I published not two months ago.
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:24.000]   So it's basically in vain against the walled garden of the iPad.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:27.520]   It's starting to get really, really old.
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.280]   This isn't going to be the first time that their secrecy kind of bites them in the butt.
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:36.040]   I think that I hope that they're going to look to the iPhone thing and the fact that iPad
[01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:42.160]   apps aren't being released as quickly as would be good as an indication that maybe they
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:46.720]   need to revisit the idea of how closely they hold these secrets.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:53.920]   I'm kind of concerned about Apple squandering their time lead on the iPad because all these
[01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:57.240]   other companies are going to be coming up with their own slates that have USB ports, that
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:02.400]   have cameras that are going to cost $100 to $150 less, that Apple had about a three-month
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.520]   leap on all of these devices.
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:08.000]   And that's time that they need to make sure that that App Store is stocked with every
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.640]   single application that any potential iPad user and any potential user of any other slate
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:15.200]   is going to want to see.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.560]   And we're still not seeing it.
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:20.320]   There are whole categories of apps that are just there's one or two token little apps,
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:22.200]   neither of which are very, very impressive.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.680]   And we're still waiting for, I think, for the summer for the real volley of apps to come
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:26.680]   out.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.400]   And developers have their hands on actual hardware starting in April.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:33.440]   And they're probably going through a two, three, four-month development cycle before
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.200]   these really muscular apps start hitting the App Store.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:37.200]   So that's...
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.200]   Here's what...
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:39.880]   Here's what Lyons says, which does echo what you said.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:44.120]   And he says, "Apple is reinventing the personal computers, so planning the current way of doing
[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:49.640]   things with a business model in which Apple controls everything and everyone.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:54.440]   Customers, developers, advertisers, never in the history of computing has there been
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:58.080]   a device over which one company has exerted so much control."
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.800]   We've seen this movie before.
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:03.360]   A quarter century ago, Apple got a jump on everyone else when it introduced the Macintosh
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:06.560]   computer in 1984, another gorgeous product.
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:11.240]   Microsoft didn't have a credible alternative until 1990 when it introduced Windows 3 and
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:14.160]   it really caught up five years later with Windows 95.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.040]   By then, Apple was toast.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.200]   The reason?
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.840]   The guys at Apple were control freaks.
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:23.480]   The guys at Microsoft were more open and left more money on the table for others.
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:25.480]   I don't know if I agree with that.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:29.640]   I think that's a hugely oversimplified look at things.
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:30.640]   Go ahead.
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:31.640]   Let's start with...
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:35.120]   I think one of the things that they missed though is...
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:36.120]   You.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:37.120]   Sorry.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.120]   Is that...
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:40.880]   So one of the...
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:44.320]   One of the things I think that they missed though is Steve Jobs wasn't there and I do think
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.320]   that makes a difference.
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:48.280]   I think that's a liability for Apple in the long term.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:53.240]   But I think that when Apple lost a lot of its ground there, when it was ahead, Steve
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.840]   Jobs was there when he...
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.120]   And literally it just drifted.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:01.480]   I mean, I really feel like Apple drifted on momentum for 10 years and just almost stopped
[01:43:01.480 --> 01:43:02.480]   because of that.
[01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.560]   I don't think that they were particularly...
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:07.000]   They didn't do anything particularly new or...
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:11.400]   I mean, they had a lot of stuff that they put out, but it was so confusing by 1994 and
[01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:15.000]   1995, I couldn't figure out what Mac to buy because there were eight of them that did
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.280]   almost exactly the same thing.
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.200]   It's the same way that the camera market is now.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:23.760]   You go to a Sony, they've got six cameras that almost are identical to each other.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.280]   And so, the thing is, I think that Steve brought a lot of focus to the company.
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:34.720]   I think it's very hard to compete with Apple when they have a decisive leader who's doing
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.720]   something very...
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:37.360]   You know, moving down the path very quickly.
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.280]   I don't think that's what existed in the past.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:43.600]   So when people look at that past, I think that's a big piece that they have to keep
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:44.600]   in mind.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:45.600]   Apple stopped innovating.
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.520]   That's why Microsoft caught up.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:48.520]   Very simply.
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:50.480]   I also think that the...
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:55.360]   I think the analogies to the '80s and the Mac are so tortured that I really don't think
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:56.360]   that they're applicable.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:44:00.280]   I think that, like what Alex just said, the jobs wasn't there.
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.280]   Start with that.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:02.280]   That's a huge thing.
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:05.840]   But I think it's also important to remember that the audience is totally different.
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:09.040]   And the '80s computers were for geeks.
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.000]   I mean, that's just the way it is.
[01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.440]   And I wanted one.
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:17.080]   I mean, I was insane, obsessed with them.
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.520]   But normal people didn't really have them.
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:21.640]   My parents certainly saw no need to have a computer.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:23.120]   Now they couldn't live without it.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:28.180]   The difference was when computers became connected to the internet and they became
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:29.800]   communication devices.
[01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:31.640]   Communication is universal.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:37.120]   So pre-communication, pre-internet computers, the audience was just totally different.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:41.080]   And so it's way more of a consumer-type thing now.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:43.080]   And I think that works in Apple's favor.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:49.880]   I think Andy's argument is far more convincing about what is Apple too closed about.
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:58.560]   It's that their policies are scaring off developers from investing in pouring insane
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:03.200]   amounts of effort and time into creating iPhone OS apps, whether it's for the phone
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:09.200]   or for the iPad, because they don't want to bet their whole company on an app that
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:12.280]   could be rejected and not get a good answer for it.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:13.800]   Well, that's easily solved.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:18.240]   Just be more transparent in your process for Apple.
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.800]   I mean, that would solve that.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:25.160]   And certainly there's so much money to be made in this ecosystem that a lot of developers,
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.280]   Alex Lindsey is a good example, choose to take the chance anyway.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.800]   Oh, definitely.
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:33.040]   But I still think that there's an end-off.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.840]   Go ahead, Alex.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:40.200]   Sorry, we're doing this lag.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:44.320]   The issue is that there's a lot-- all the applications that we're working on.
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:47.960]   I mean, we're in the kind of the planning phases of a bunch of applications that are
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:48.960]   related to our industry.
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.800]   I don't have any question about whether they are going to be accepted.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:55.320]   I have a question about whether we can get them done to the level that we're trying to
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.200]   get them done at in time and before everybody else and everything else.
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:03.560]   But I'm not worried about-- I'm not here worrying about is Apple going to turn down
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:08.040]   my film-related applications?
[01:46:08.040 --> 01:46:10.080]   It doesn't make any sense for me to worry about that.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:16.680]   And I think that for 98, 99% of the apps that people think about, I just don't think that
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:20.000]   there's really a real worry for that or there shouldn't be.
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:23.560]   I think that when you start getting near the edge of things that you think are cool, yeah,
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:24.920]   that's going to be a dangerous place to go.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:27.200]   But there's an awful lot of land out there.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:28.200]   All right.
[01:46:28.200 --> 01:46:29.680]   We're going to take a break.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:31.440]   Come back with your picks of the week.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:34.120]   And John and Denise, you may participate as you choose.
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.960]   We like to pick a piece of hardware or software that we think is either overlooked or new.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:39.960]   People might be interested in them.
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:40.960]   We'll do that in a minute.
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:44.600]   But of course, we start our picks with Audible.com.
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:49.000]   Our book picks of the week, Audible, is that great online bookstore I've talked about so
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.920]   many times before.
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:51.920]   75,000.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:57.480]   That's the latest updated number of books in the Audible bookstore books.
[01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:58.480]   Performance is comedy.
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:46:59.480]   Old-time radio.
[01:46:59.480 --> 01:47:00.480]   There's a ton of stuff there.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:02.040]   I mean, if you like listening, we know you do.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.880]   You're listening to this show.
[01:47:03.880 --> 01:47:05.520]   We think you ought to try Audible.com.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:06.520]   Go take a look.

[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:28.360]   And I always like to give Andy a chance to recommend an Audible book to us.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.360]   And I'm not going to do anything differently today.
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.840]   Andy, what do you like?
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:33.360]   What do you listen to these days?
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:38.880]   Well, I'm I'm I'm queuing up books for next week's cruise.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.880]   And wait a minute.
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:42.120]   Where are you going next week?
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:45.280]   Are you doing that Bahamas or Bermuda cruise set next week?
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:48.840]   I have a work related trip.
[01:47:48.840 --> 01:47:51.040]   I'm giving a series of talks.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:56.120]   Yes, I suppose technically these these occur on a cruise ship that's going to the Bahamas.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:57.920]   Not your fault, man.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.920]   But you know what?
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:00.520]   I'm focused on the audience.
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:02.960]   I'm focusing on the presentation.
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:05.920]   You know, it could be in the middle of a war zone for all I know.
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:08.440]   Okay, I'm just there to talk about technology.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.080]   That's how much you care.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:14.080]   And if I'm going to be snorkeling for a day and spending two days on a beach, well, I
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:15.560]   don't see how that's relevant.
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.360]   And I'm kind of offended you even asked.
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:21.520]   Well, I'm going to you're going to Macmania 10 to Bermuda.
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:24.800]   I'm going on Macmania 11 in February to Patagonia.
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.800]   What exactly?
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:26.800]   What?
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:27.800]   What?
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:30.640]   I'm saying that, you know, I'm going to the Bahamas for a week.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:31.960]   You're going to Antarctica.
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.320]   Yeah, well, you could come.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:34.320]   You could come.
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.320]   Come on.
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:36.320]   Everybody's invited.
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:40.320]   I'm saying, you know, again, beach for I live in New England, man.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.320]   I'm used to Antarctica.
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:44.120]   Like most many weeks out of the year.
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:45.120]   Okay.
[01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:46.120]   Okay.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:47.120]   Okay.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.960]   Souths are going to be on there with us, by the way, which will be a lot of fun.
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.880]   Don McAllister.
[01:48:51.880 --> 01:48:58.760]   And then and then I have to point out that the Macmania 12 is already in the works.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:04.360]   And if you that's not till September of 2011.
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:08.960]   And that one is down the coast of California starts in Vancouver, goes to Victoria, goes
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:09.960]   down to San Diego.
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:10.960]   But it's like 10 days.
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:11.960]   I guess they're taking their time.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:12.960]   They're meandering.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:14.800]   And that's a celebrity cruise.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:16.600]   So there there's some good you missed.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:19.400]   I think it's too late for the Bermuda cruise.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.400]   I don't know.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:22.480]   I'm sure it sold out by now.
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.000]   So what are you going to take to read on the Bermuda cruise?
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.720]   I'm lining a couple of books, the one that really got my I had I saved up like two credits
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:32.000]   for for this trip.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.320]   One of them is Gene Wilder's autobiography is memoir that he published just a few years
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:37.320]   ago.
[01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:40.080]   It's called Kiss Me Like A Stranger, My Search for Love and Art.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:41.600]   And it has two things to recommend for it.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.880]   But when I'm choosing an audiobook of a book that I haven't actually read yet, obviously
[01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:46.880]   I look for reviews.
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:49.760]   This was really very nice to review by just about everybody.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:55.120]   The New York Times had Janet Maslin, the movie reviewer talk about it and communicate
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.120]   to each other.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:58.280]   He's a good author, has a really a lot of good stories to tell.
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:00.280]   But I also I just like his voice.
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:01.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:04.840]   I just like the idea that for six hours and 36 minutes, I'm going to be listening to Gene
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.920]   Wilder's speak to me and Gene Wilder's voice.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:13.920]   I'm embarrassed to say that I found this book because of that AT&T commercial that uses
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.200]   his his pure imagination from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:22.120]   And after not being able to find that track available for download on our iTunes, I was
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:25.040]   looking around for it said, Oh, Gene Wilder's saying, Okay, that's that's that's
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:26.040]   good enough.
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:27.040]   Okay.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:29.560]   I just want this nice voice to talk to me and tell me a story for six hours.
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.400]   Can I play a little bit of him just as people here?
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.400]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:35.240]   This is Kiss Me Like A Stranger, my search for love and art.
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:41.160]   All laughing their heads off at some Wisenheimer who was hypnotizing one of the girls.
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:46.000]   I thought he was pretty stupid, but I enjoyed watching the cocky little faker who thought
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:49.640]   he knew how to hypnotize people because he'd read his uncle's book on hypnosis.
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:50.640]   I like it.
[01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.400]   You don't hear Wisenheimer in much modern literature these days.
[01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.720]   So I think that's that's great.
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:57.880]   By itself is an exact to recommend itself.
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:01.440]   So some say they're not that doesn't work with all celebrity voices.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:06.200]   I mean, reader, Rudner, maybe not, you know, maybe, you know, but this works.
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:07.840]   I think it's going to work really, really great.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:08.840]   Good.
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:09.840]   All right.
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.400]   Kiss Me Like A Stranger, my search for love and art.
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:14.720]   Gene Wilder's latest, but that's just one of 75,000 titles.
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:20.120]   You get to browse and pick almost any book free some books because they're extra long
[01:51:20.120 --> 01:51:22.280]   or two credits, but most books are one credit.
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:24.720]   You get one credit if you sign up for the gold account.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:28.960]   And I think by the way, some of Gene Wilder's other stuff is on here as well.
[01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.240]   There's quite a bit of Gene Wilder on here.
[01:51:30.240 --> 01:51:33.000]   I didn't realize he'd written a number of books.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:35.000]   Fantastic.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.000]   Audible.com/Macbreak.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:37.560]   We love them.
[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:38.560]   We know you'll love them too.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:42.040]   Give them a try and we thank them so much for their support of Macbreak weekly.
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:43.040]   Let's go.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:48.320]   Let's go clockwise starting with Alex Lindsay and your pick of the week, sir.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:52.920]   So there's an update to one of my favorite applications and it just gives me an opportunity
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:55.160]   to tell people how much I love it, which is transmit.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.160]   So have you guys seen it?
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:58.240]   There's a new transmit for us.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.000]   I just love transmit.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:05.280]   I use it every day for something and just constantly up to them downloading.
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:10.720]   I just feel like they have the interface and the workflow and everything else, just really
[01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:11.720]   figured out.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:12.720]   They've got a new interface.
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:14.120]   They've improved it.
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:16.680]   And they also, now it's kind of a setup.
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:22.800]   I don't really use Amazon S3, but all this stuff is very much right on the top.
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:25.000]   There's little buttons that you can just kind of click.
[01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:28.640]   FDP, SFDP, S3, WebDev.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:33.040]   One of the cool things that you can do now that you couldn't do before is you can actually
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:42.880]   install what they call I think a fuse onto your laptop, onto your computer.
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:49.240]   And what I now have is I have my Dropbox, the Dropbox that I, not Dropbox, the application.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:51.080]   We did this a long time ago.
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:52.080]   So it's Dropbox.
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:54.520]   And it now looks like a hard drive.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:56.800]   It looks like a hard drive for my applications.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:59.640]   It looks like a hard drive on my desktop.
[01:52:59.640 --> 01:53:02.920]   And I can open it like a hard drive and I can save stuff to it and I can pull stuff
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:06.440]   out of it and what I'm accessing is actually my FDP.
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:12.400]   So I don't have, when I have that set up, once it's mounted, it's just there.
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:15.760]   And so a lot of times when I'm on, I want to log in or anything else, I don't need to
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:16.760]   log in at all.
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:20.400]   I can just simply drag stuff, you know, drag stuff into there and send it up like you would,
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:22.480]   I guess, an IDIS or whatever.
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:28.120]   But all of that stuff is now built into your FDP access and it can be set up for your FDP,
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:29.120]   SFDP, S3.
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:32.360]   So if you want to send files there, now they've done a bunch of other things that I haven't
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:37.520]   tested yet, which is to, you know, they've evidently sped up.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:38.920]   Lots and lots of files.
[01:53:38.920 --> 01:53:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:42.320]   I don't know how much it is now, but whatever it is, it's worth it.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:44.520]   It's like $20 or $30.
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:50.040]   And it is a, this is just an application that, if you do any kind of FDP stuff, this is the
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:51.720]   application that I own as far as I'm concerned.
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:54.120]   I just don't think that there's any close second.
[01:53:54.120 --> 01:54:00.840]   And so, and most importantly, the truck, the new truck is a really, it's a nice truck.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:01.840]   It's a good truck.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:06.520]   So anyway, John, you've been doing beta testing this, I know for a while I saw in your blog.
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:07.520]   It's really good.
[01:54:07.520 --> 01:54:11.240]   Well, and the other thing I would just point out is that the product page itself on the
[01:54:11.240 --> 01:54:15.000]   Panic website is itself a amazing work of art.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:16.920]   It's a fantastic product page.
[01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:19.160]   So you scroll down, you scroll past it.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:23.360]   There's a screenshot of the interface with these little red dots.
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:28.040]   You hover your mouse over the little red dots and they have red status.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:32.240]   Once you've hovered over them, they turn around so you know which ones you've already explored.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:35.320]   So it's like a visual indication of the new user interface.
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:37.080]   You hover your mouse over an element.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:38.080]   Hey, what's this?
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.080]   It tells you what it is.
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:40.160]   And then it marks it as red.
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:41.160]   It's a mate.
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:42.160]   They should sell that.
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:44.520]   They should sell that to other Mac developers.
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:46.040]   That's really sweet.
[01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:48.080]   These guys, Panic is an amazing company.
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:50.560]   They really are just doing great stuff.
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:52.600]   I think it's so great.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:55:00.800]   They focus on such, you know, what most of you just basic products, but then they bring
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:05.440]   so much creativity, something, you know, that is something that's just a basic use and they
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:07.240]   do it so well.
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:10.120]   Well, it's true because I, you know, I've been, I used for a long time.
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:11.120]   Fetch.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:15.920]   You know, we've all used, you know, crazy, simple Mac FTP programs.
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:20.560]   In fact, the Macintosh comes with a command line FTP program.
[01:55:20.560 --> 01:55:22.080]   And there's.
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.640]   And that's historically been the problem.
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:29.960]   I mean, all the FTP apps that was using before transmit is that someone took an open
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:37.200]   source or command line FTP put just slapped on the most simple bare bones, vaguely Mac-like
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:38.440]   interface onto it.
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:42.920]   This is the only FTP app I've used that really feels like was built like a Mac app from the
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:43.920]   ground up.
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:44.920]   Love it, love it, love it.
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:50.000]   Well, it's $19 to upgrade if you're a transmit three owner, which I am.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000]   I'm a bastard.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]   I take all that back.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000]   Twenty bucks for an upgrade.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000]   Twenty bucks.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000]   Why?
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000]   Why?
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000]   Why?
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000]   Why?
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:55:59.000]   Why?
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000]   Why?
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000]   Why?
[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:02.000]   Why?
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:03.000]   Why?
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:04.000]   Why?
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.000]   Because it's a command line for free.
[01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:06.000]   Oh, they're high.
[01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:07.000]   They're high.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.000]   They're high.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:09.920]   Well, what do you like today?
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:16.880]   I like today a simple app called iCloud from Plum Amazing.
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:22.120]   It's a type of app that you don't see much anymore where it just, it just, all these
[01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:28.880]   guys did was think what features are for calendaring and time are built into the Mac.
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:29.880]   That great.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:30.880]   Okay.
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:33.200]   So let's now add every other feature we can possibly add.
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:36.120]   So if it has to do with dates and times, this app will let you do it.
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:40.560]   If you want to an enhanced version of the clock in the menu bar, it'll give you that.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:44.240]   If you want to have multiple, it's reflect multiple time zones so that if you're doing
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:48.880]   business in like multiple cities and you need to know, okay, I've got three columns
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:53.240]   to one to an editor in London, one to an editor in Chicago and one to an editor in
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.600]   San Francisco.
[01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:57.040]   Which one is which one of them is going to call an annoy me first?
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:58.040]   Okay.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:01.240]   It's a lot better right than the London column first, you know, maintaining multiple time
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:05.240]   zones and stuff like that, maintaining multiple alarms for things.
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:09.840]   So you get reminded of a project that's going to be due in like in 28 days or 27 days or
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:15.400]   something you need to start preparing for a simple like floating palette view of your
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:19.280]   I-Cal so that you just need to get a quick eyeball on.
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:21.360]   Someone has asked me if I'm going to be available on the fourth.
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:22.760]   Can I quickly say yes or no?
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:25.200]   I need to know if I'm available that day or not.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:26.200]   It'll give you that.
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:28.080]   It'll give you to do so give you desktop clocks.
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:34.680]   It'll give you lists of uptime on various apps that you're using.
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:37.760]   I can spend the next 20 minutes just going over feature by feature.
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.240]   I do like elegance in an app.
[01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:43.120]   What I like about transmit is that it hides most of its features.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:47.920]   It hides most of its power from you in the in the idea of making sure that's just focused
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:51.200]   on the one task of moving a file for one place to another.
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:54.360]   What's good about I clock is kind of in the opposite.
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:56.800]   It just decides to see how many features can we add.
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:02.520]   It's not as complicated as I'm making it sound but they would never do the Apple sort of thing
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:09.200]   of saying, "Well, yes, it would be nice to have a quick click to get a 45 second timer
[01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:10.200]   on the screen.
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:12.280]   But how does that work into our idiom?"
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:16.840]   No, no, they say they're thinking is no, that would be very useful to simply pull down
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:21.160]   a menu and simply say, "Give me right now a five minute countdown clock so I know when
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.640]   I need to end this phone conversation."
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:23.640]   Well, that's a good feature.
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:24.840]   Let's add it and we'll do it that way.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:27.800]   It does look like it has everything that the kitchen sink in here.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:28.800]   Exactly.
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:31.560]   It's less complicated that I'm making it sound.
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:35.120]   It's probably even less complicated than the website might make it look.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:39.240]   If you can add, you can include the features that you want and leave behind the features
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:44.560]   that you don't want suffice to say that it's a 30, I believe it's a $30 download.
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.240]   You can try it for free.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:49.520]   But I think that most people will get their 30 bucks out of it by the time they've had
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.320]   it up and running for two or three weeks.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:52.320]   This is wild.
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:55.320]   You can see how long your applications have been running.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:58.160]   You can see the phases of the moon.
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:01.720]   You can see Apple's stock price.
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:02.720]   Exactly.
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:03.720]   Anything.
[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:05.800]   If you could put it in a menu, they've done.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:09.680]   It's 217 days till Christmas.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:11.920]   It's from PlumAmazing.com.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:12.920]   I-clock.
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:16.040]   Chris recently updated to 1.1 last month.
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:17.840]   They added some really nice little tricks to it.
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:19.200]   So, definitely worth a mention.
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.200]   Cool.
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:21.200]   Great choice.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:22.200]   What's your part take?
[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:23.200]   I do.
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:24.200]   Mine's free, actually.
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:25.200]   Love that.
[01:59:25.200 --> 01:59:28.280]   It's an app for the iPad.
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:29.280]   It's called Sky Grid.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.440]   Oh, I use it.
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:33.320]   I really think this is interesting.
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:34.320]   I do too.
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:39.920]   I like it a lot because it is a way of consuming news on the iPad.
[01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:44.000]   But it is focused on what people are talking about right now.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:47.360]   And it pulls in from all sorts of sources.
[01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:48.360]   You get tweets.
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:49.360]   Individual tweets.
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:51.160]   Sometimes you get mainstream.
[01:59:51.160 --> 01:59:52.400]   You get media.
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:54.200]   It's only on version 1.1.
[01:59:54.200 --> 02:00:00.680]   So, I excuse the fact that from time to time, I get sites that look like they may have been
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:06.360]   loosely translated from another language and have little to do with the topic that they're
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:07.640]   supposed to be on.
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.240]   That only happens occasionally.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:12.280]   Usually it's really, really good information.
[02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:14.120]   It's free and it's very current.
[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:17.280]   So, it's not exactly a news reader, but it's like a news reader.
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:20.160]   I don't know what the algorithm is for figuring out what the hot topics are.
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.080]   A little bit like tech meme.
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:28.080]   It's trying to surface a buzzworthy kind of story.
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:33.240]   Although as you say, I have no idea what the algorithm is that they're using.
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:36.320]   But I like the idea and I definitely use it all the time.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:37.320]   So, it's addicting.
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:38.680]   And some wild categories.
[02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:39.680]   Here's boxing.
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:42.000]   So, here's the hot stories in boxing.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.480]   I'm not sure why that's there.
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:47.800]   I confess I check celebrity a little more than I auto.
[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:52.800]   I find that it's just keeping me up on what Miley Cyrus is up to these days.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:53.800]   And I don't know.
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:55.800]   How's Jesse James doing?
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:57.920]   He's kind of had some hard times.
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:00.040]   Lindsay Lohan to get a visit from Child Protection.
[02:01:00.040 --> 02:01:01.040]   Oh my God.
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:05.240]   So, I could put down the iPad.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:06.240]   Okay, okay.
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:07.240]   I'm not going to.
[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:10.960]   There's a whole iPad category too if you just want to follow a thing like that.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:11.960]   Yeah.
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:12.960]   It's funny.
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:14.680]   I found the same thing.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:17.520]   I'm always looking for news applications.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:20.000]   But I just found this really kind of surprisingly compelling.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:24.480]   Yeah, I mean, you might want to complain that you can't put your own feeds into it.
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:27.400]   But I actually think that's more of a feature than a bug.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.400]   I agree.
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.840]   I like sort of having them surface what's topical at that time.
[02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:34.960]   And I have some good news readers.
[02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:36.760]   You know, I talked about News Rack last week.
[02:01:36.760 --> 02:01:38.680]   You know, I can always look at my own feeds.
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:43.040]   But it's kind of interesting to see what's going on, you know, according to others.
[02:01:43.040 --> 02:01:44.040]   Right.
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:45.040]   Skygrid.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.400]   Mr. Gruber, you have a pick for him?
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:55.120]   I am going to go with a pick that I am almost certainly going to guess has been picked before.
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:57.200]   But brand new iPad version.
[02:01:57.200 --> 02:01:59.000]   It's an app called SimpleNote.
[02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.480]   Oh, yes.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:04.120]   It has existed for the iPhone for a long time over a year.
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:06.520]   And I have long sung its praises.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:11.280]   And now just I think yesterday they came out within a free update.
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:12.920]   But the app itself is free.
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:15.480]   You can download the app for free in the app store.
[02:02:15.480 --> 02:02:17.000]   It's a universal app.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.280]   One app that runs natively on both the iPhone and the iPad.
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:21.280]   The iPad interface.
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:23.160]   This is a notes app.
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:24.560]   Here's the premise.
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:29.640]   Make a notes app that looks just like the nice simple mail client for the iPad that uses
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:31.160]   Helvetica everywhere.
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:32.200]   Just a white background.
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:37.040]   No nonsense about, you know, paper notepads or 3D effects.
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:40.400]   It's just a column of notes on the left.
[02:02:40.400 --> 02:02:42.400]   Main text notes on the right.
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:49.200]   And the killer feature is that it syncs to a web service that the guy the developers
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:52.440]   who made it wrote using Google App Engine.
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:57.400]   And so your notes sync between your iPhone, your iPad.
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:59.200]   And there are a couple of Mac clients.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:00.680]   They have an API.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:06.240]   They don't have a simple note app for the Mac, but there's apps like Notational Velocity,
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:10.360]   which is free that sync to the SimpleNote API.
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:15.520]   And there is a web app that works on any computer, Mac or Windows, whatever.
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.360]   So your little plain text notes, you jot something down on one machine, you go to another, you
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:22.040]   open it on your iPad and there it is.
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:26.800]   And the iPad app is just, it's exactly what you think it would be.
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:27.800]   It's great.
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:31.240]   You know, I think it wasn't really a pick.
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:34.200]   Merlin Mann talked about using it and Notational Velocity together.
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:35.200]   And I've had SimpleNote on here.
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:40.320]   It's just a great way to get text into my iPhone so I could type on my desktop and
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:41.840]   then get the text in.
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:42.840]   But now it's great.
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:44.760]   I mean, I do that all the time.
[02:03:44.760 --> 02:03:47.920]   If I have anything I want to quick, oh, I got to get to the airport.
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:51.520]   Here's my, just take it with me in case I need to re-print my boarding pass.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:53.400]   Here's my confirmation number.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:54.400]   Copy it from this.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.400]   Just go to Notational Velocity on my Mac.
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:57.400]   Paste it.
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:58.400]   Just go.
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:03:59.400]   Just leave.
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:00.400]   I don't have to connect.
[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:01.400]   I don't have to sync.
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:02.400]   No USB nonsense.
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:03.400]   Just go.
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:04.800]   And when I open my iPhone and open SimpleNote, there it is.
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:05.800]   There's the note.
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:06.800]   I just pasted it.
[02:04:06.800 --> 02:04:09.840]   It's never, it's really, it's super reliable.
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:11.480]   And it's free.
[02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:13.900]   I mean, I can't, I cannot recommend it, I land out.
[02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:16.780]   - $899 if you want to pay for the premium account
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.940]   that gets rid of ads and stuff on the website and so forth.
[02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:20.480]   But yeah, you can use it all, it's functionality.
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:21.480]   - Which is a bargain.
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:22.680]   - I pay for it.
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:25.680]   - And I would pay twice that, it's easy.
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:27.720]   - Easy, 'cause I use ever know,
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:29.320]   which does all these same things for free.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:30.340]   And I'm just curious, is it,
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:32.880]   'cause it's, "No, even though it's more complicated"
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:36.160]   or why you prefer this over ever know say?
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.340]   - I, you know, ever know is great.
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:39.420]   And I know people sing, you know, I know it's,
[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:43.100]   but I think it's just a very different approach to it.
[02:04:43.100 --> 02:04:44.940]   Simple note is super, super focused.
[02:04:44.940 --> 02:04:46.940]   Ever note has, you know, images
[02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:48.980]   and all sorts of other things to those here.
[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:52.860]   This is just one list, no folders, no hierarchy, no tagging,
[02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:55.420]   just a list of plain text notes.
[02:04:55.420 --> 02:04:56.860]   And it just couldn't be, you know,
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:01.180]   as a guy who carries a physical paper notebook everywhere,
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:02.340]   you know, just to have something.
[02:05:02.340 --> 02:05:04.140]   So if I want to jot something down, it's there.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:06.940]   It's, you know, it's the closest digital analog
[02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:10.980]   to just, you know, just super, super simple.
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:11.940]   You ever have to think.
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:13.940]   - And you'll want to get the desktop app as well
[02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:16.700]   so that you can sync up via wifi.
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:19.260]   Yeah, great way to get notes into and out of the iPad.
[02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:20.500]   I have an iPad pick as well.
[02:05:20.500 --> 02:05:21.540]   Thank you, John.
[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:23.060]   I have an iPad pick as well.
[02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:26.060]   This is, actually I have several.
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:28.300]   I've been having fun with music applications on the iPad.
[02:05:28.300 --> 02:05:30.580]   And actually, I know that this is kind of a little bit
[02:05:30.580 --> 02:05:34.020]   in your realm, Alex Lindsey, 'cause you're the ones
[02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:36.540]   that keep bringing in all those looping things.
[02:05:36.540 --> 02:05:41.540]   But I'm amazed at the variety and quality of apps
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:43.540]   for music on the iPad.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:46.940]   And this big interface really is great.
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:48.620]   Did I talk about that loop task last week?
[02:05:48.620 --> 02:05:50.220]   I can't remember.
[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:51.500]   I don't know if I did.
[02:05:51.500 --> 02:05:52.460]   - I think you might have mentioned it.
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:53.780]   I don't think we really got into it in a detail.
[02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:56.460]   - Really a great little program to make loops.
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:58.700]   I should turn it up if I'm going to do this.
[02:05:58.700 --> 02:06:00.580]   And mix them.
[02:06:00.580 --> 02:06:04.220]   It comes, you download a whole bunch of loops.
[02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:05.060]   You can make your own,
[02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:06.940]   record your own loops and insert them.
[02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:09.740]   It has some fun little toys like this flanger
[02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:13.140]   that allows you to kind of modify the sound on a thumb pad
[02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:15.020]   or a glitchy repeaters.
[02:06:15.020 --> 02:06:17.140]   You can give it that rap sound.
[02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:21.940]   It has loops in dub, in reggae, in hip hop,
[02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:24.340]   in trance, in electronica.
[02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:25.780]   And you can mix and match.
[02:06:25.780 --> 02:06:28.180]   You know, you could take an air horn from the reggae
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:29.980]   and put it into your trance loop
[02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:32.340]   for a really exciting effect.
[02:06:32.340 --> 02:06:34.260]   (laughing)
[02:06:34.260 --> 02:06:38.140]   Just watch those dancers jump every time that horn goes off.
[02:06:38.140 --> 02:06:39.820]   So that's looptastic HD.
[02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:40.700]   I really like it.
[02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:42.700]   I think it's $10.
[02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:44.460]   There are a number of other synth apps.
[02:06:44.460 --> 02:06:48.620]   If you're a synth fan, like this Corg iElectribe,
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:50.020]   if you've used a Corg synthesizer
[02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:52.100]   to look really familiar to you,
[02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:54.620]   I am not a synthesizer wizard, but I have to say--
[02:06:54.620 --> 02:06:55.780]   - It's so fun.
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:56.860]   - It's just fun.
[02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:58.180]   (laughing)
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:07:00.660]   And finally, here's one that I think,
[02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:02.660]   even if you're not a synthesizer lover,
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:05.580]   you really ought to have, it's called Cat Piano.
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:08.660]   (laughing)
[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:12.460]   You have a variety of different cat sounds,
[02:07:12.460 --> 02:07:17.020]   everything from angelic kitty to asthmatic kitty.
[02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:19.260]   - Thinking about all the apps that got rejected
[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:20.420]   by the app store.
[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:21.260]   - Come on, this is better than--
[02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:22.460]   - Oh my, it is gonna love that one.
[02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:23.940]   - This is better than farting.
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:26.580]   I wouldn't give it to your kid unless you really have a high.
[02:07:26.580 --> 02:07:29.100]   I actually drove my wife out of bed this morning.
[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:31.820]   (laughing)
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:33.980]   - I'm a furious cat, I love it.
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:36.820]   - And it got my dog really interested.
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:40.980]   Although I have to confess,
[02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:44.620]   unfortunately the cat just paid no attention to it.
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:47.820]   (laughing)
[02:07:47.820 --> 02:07:49.820]   So that's Cat Piano, that's absolutely free
[02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:52.540]   and it does have actually a grand piano
[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:54.940]   with some pretty good piano sounds in it.
[02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:55.900]   And you can share your--
[02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:56.980]   - And you can record your points.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:57.820]   - And you can record them.
[02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:59.460]   - You can record them and share your cat creation
[02:07:59.460 --> 02:08:01.500]   with others via email.
[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:03.380]   - And what's the social media app?
[02:08:03.380 --> 02:08:04.220]   - Actually, I don't think you can.
[02:08:04.220 --> 02:08:05.060]   You can just tell them about--
[02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:06.060]   - I can spell that venture capital mic.
[02:08:06.060 --> 02:08:07.460]   (laughing)
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:09.980]   - I don't think you can actually record it.
[02:08:09.980 --> 02:08:11.660]   It just plays it.
[02:08:11.660 --> 02:08:13.460]   And probably that's a good thing.
[02:08:13.460 --> 02:08:15.700]   (meowing)
[02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:22.380]   - Okay, so there you go, there's my latest creation.
[02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:23.780]   - I did want to screw it up,
[02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:25.980]   but is this the first Mac break weekly
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:29.100]   where nobody picked anything that was more than $35?
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:30.100]   (laughing)
[02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:32.780]   - There's like a single like $40,000 or something
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:34.380]   or $10,000 plug-in.
[02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:35.220]   - It's not too late.
[02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:36.140]   - Oh, please cow.
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:37.540]   - Actually, you know what my pick was going to be
[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:38.580]   and I probably should mention it.
[02:08:38.580 --> 02:08:41.580]   Rhapsody has been updated for the iPad
[02:08:41.580 --> 02:08:43.380]   and now allows you,
[02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:46.540]   I wasn't really listening to this song.
[02:08:46.540 --> 02:08:48.020]   I don't know why it's starting.
[02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:50.780]   (laughing)
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:53.860]   It now allows you to cash your songs on here.
[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:55.620]   It's $10 a month for unlimited.
[02:08:55.620 --> 02:08:57.380]   I mean, it brought subscription music
[02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:59.300]   to the iPhone some time ago.
[02:08:59.300 --> 02:09:02.020]   They've improved it, they've made it an iPad,
[02:09:02.020 --> 02:09:03.460]   actually this is not iPad specific,
[02:09:03.460 --> 02:09:05.380]   it's still an iPhone app,
[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:06.740]   but it works great on the iPad
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:10.740]   and you can't listen to music kind of unlimitedly on it.
[02:09:10.740 --> 02:09:12.620]   And I have to say, I like Rhapsody,
[02:09:12.620 --> 02:09:13.900]   so that's another choice for you
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:17.860]   if you can stand the fact that they used to be real networks.
[02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:21.300]   All right, we have gone long once again,
[02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:22.940]   but there was so much good stuff to talk about
[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:24.660]   and we had such a great panel.
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:25.980]   I think it was well worth it.
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:28.220]   Denise Howell, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:29.740]   - Thank you so much, it was great.
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:32.260]   - This week in law, Twill is heard on the Twit Network.
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:34.020]   You can find out more about it or download it
[02:09:34.020 --> 02:09:38.020]   at twit.tv/twill, but I think the best thing to do
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:41.460]   would be to watch Twill live.
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:43.020]   You do it Fridays, right?
[02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:44.260]   - Fridays 11 o'clock.
[02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:46.620]   - 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern,
[02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:49.420]   1800 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:51.820]   And I imagine that you've been talking a little bit
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:53.980]   about this phone thing.
[02:09:53.980 --> 02:09:54.900]   - Oh yes.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:59.180]   - And this Friday we're going to have our Washington Bureau
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:01.260]   come on the show too guys from public knowledge
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.180]   are going to join us.
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:05.140]   So we'll talk more about the fact that we don't have
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:08.220]   a federal shield law and other stuff.
[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:11.860]   I'm sure related to what we talked about earlier today.
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:12.700]   - Really a good show.
[02:10:12.700 --> 02:10:15.980]   This week in law, twit.tv/twill it's on iTunes,
[02:10:15.980 --> 02:10:17.740]   the Zoom store everywhere else too.
[02:10:17.740 --> 02:10:18.740]   Thank you Denise, I really appreciate it.
[02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:19.660]   - Thanks, Leah.
[02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:21.820]   - Getting some gravitas into this conversation.
[02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:24.420]   Speaking of gravitas, we're glad John Gruber was here
[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:25.860]   from DaringFireball.net.
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:27.220]   Always a pleasure.
[02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:28.220]   Always great to have you on.
[02:10:28.220 --> 02:10:32.500]   A must read blog for Apple interested parties.
[02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:34.180]   I won't say fanboys.
[02:10:34.180 --> 02:10:36.460]   For anybody who cares about Apple,
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.340]   DaringFireball.net.
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:39.860]   And of course our regular.
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:42.380]   Thank you for being here really, I really do appreciate it.
[02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:45.780]   Our regulars, Mr. Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times
[02:10:45.780 --> 02:10:49.980]   and the Celestial Waste of Band with cwob.com.
[02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:51.740]   Great to have you back Andy.
[02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:52.580]   - Always a slice.
[02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:53.740]   - And from Africa.
[02:10:53.740 --> 02:10:57.060]   He made his way from Zimbabwe from Harari, Africa.
[02:10:57.060 --> 02:10:59.780]   Mr. Alex Lindsey is at thepixelcorpixelcorp.com
[02:10:59.780 --> 02:11:02.820]   for that great multimedia guild of professionals
[02:11:02.820 --> 02:11:07.820]   making great content, pixelcorp.tv for the podcasts.
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:09.300]   So you can bring anything, you know,
[02:11:09.300 --> 02:11:11.380]   any content back from Africa or do anything while you're there?
[02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:15.780]   - Oh yeah, so I'm actually, I got my press pass.
[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:17.940]   See, that's what the press pass looks like here.
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:20.020]   They made it very clear not to lose the bracelet
[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:21.300]   'cause if I lose the bracelet amount.
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:22.980]   - Plus you get unlimited free rides
[02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:24.580]   on the carnival as well.
[02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:25.420]   - Exactly.
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:28.260]   - It's a huge, this is basically like South by Southwest
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:29.300]   except it's African.
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:31.700]   So it's just the bands and playing
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:33.060]   in a whole bunch of different areas.
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:34.900]   But it's all like in one little area
[02:11:34.900 --> 02:11:37.900]   and there's tons of theater and people
[02:11:37.900 --> 02:11:38.700]   from all over the world.
[02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:40.580]   It's actually a pretty amazing thing.
[02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:42.660]   So I'm gonna be shooting a bunch of video and stills.
[02:11:42.660 --> 02:11:44.660]   I'm gonna put up some of it while I'm doing it
[02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:49.660]   at my blog, Border Sack, which is bordersc.com.
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:52.460]   And you'll see a little travel log up there.
[02:11:52.460 --> 02:11:54.900]   And it's right now it's only just me getting there.
[02:11:54.900 --> 02:11:57.020]   But over the next couple of weeks,
[02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:01.460]   if you go, there's a little travel log at the top there.
[02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:06.060]   And the, anyway, so I'm gonna,
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:07.100]   that's what it looks like.
[02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:09.100]   That's from my hotel room.
[02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:09.940]   - Wow, you see that gorgeous.
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:10.780]   - Video there.
[02:12:10.780 --> 02:12:12.860]   And so it's a bunch of tents and a bunch of,
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:13.700]   and there's gonna be, you know,
[02:12:13.700 --> 02:12:15.820]   there's already thousands of people there.
[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:20.140]   And it's just a pretty amazing event.
[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:21.900]   So I'll be taking as much videos that'll let me
[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:23.220]   and a bunch of stills.
[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:24.460]   And so I'll bring some of that back.
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:27.220]   I'll be posting some of it to this blog as I'm doing it.
[02:12:27.220 --> 02:12:28.980]   I'm gonna be in Africa for the next month.
[02:12:28.980 --> 02:12:32.820]   So I'll be posting here and my boyfriend also
[02:12:32.820 --> 02:12:34.820]   and 10s at the end of the month.
[02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:37.460]   - And he's slowing down.
[02:12:37.460 --> 02:12:39.260]   - Did you do these panoramas on your iPhone?
[02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:40.580]   - I do want to meet them there.
[02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:41.420]   Hopefully.
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:44.260]   - Did you do these panoramas on your iPhone?
[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:45.100]   - I did.
[02:12:45.100 --> 02:12:45.900]   I did it on auto-stitch.
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:47.260]   I love auto-stitch.
[02:12:47.260 --> 02:12:48.860]   It's so cool.
[02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:50.540]   - Yeah, that's all auto-stitch.
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:54.540]   It's just, you know, I just thought of it as just the experience
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:55.380]   of different airports.
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:56.860]   And so I thought it was interesting to show, you know,
[02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:59.300]   'cause this one you have to take the bus to, you know,
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:01.900]   to get to the plane and the woman, you can see her twice.
[02:13:01.900 --> 02:13:04.060]   You see her to the side and then you see the back of her
[02:13:04.060 --> 02:13:04.900]   a little farther.
[02:13:04.900 --> 02:13:07.060]   So anyway, but yeah, have a non.
[02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:09.340]   - You actually see her three times.
[02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:10.180]   Four times.
[02:13:10.180 --> 02:13:11.020]   (laughing)
[02:13:11.020 --> 02:13:11.860]   Boom, boom.
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:12.700]   - I couldn't take that.
[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:14.020]   - Now this is what auto-stitch does.
[02:13:14.020 --> 02:13:15.020]   And that's the only thing with auto-stitch
[02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:17.500]   is you get these little gusties, but that's fine.
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:18.580]   That's cool.
[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:19.420]   - Yeah.
[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:20.260]   - Thank you, Alex.
[02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:21.700]   Enjoy your trip.
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:22.540]   We'll look for you.
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:23.380]   - Thank you.
[02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:24.820]   - Everybody should go to border sack.com
