[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.500]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we get the latest Apple news from the best Apple journalist in America.
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.500]   Rene Ritchie is not even in America, and he's still the best Apple journalist in America.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.500]   He's with iMoor.com all the way from Montreal. Hello, Rene.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.500]   We're having a storm here now. It's out in the rain and I came in and now I have cloud here.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   It's so humid right now. It feels like I'm swimming.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.500]   It's pretty. I like it. Your hair matches. It's perfect. It's perfect.
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.500]   Alex Lindsey, he actually has cloud hair too.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   I don't have any excuse.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   Fixacord.com. Rene Ritchie, Alex Lindsey. Let's see.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   Oh, must be Andy Inaco from the Chicago Sun Times. It's missing him.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   Hey, Andy.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   I have the best solution to cloud hair. I've got just hats.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   Andy's amazing because he can talk without moving his lips.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   I love how he does that.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500]   He's like a cool movie.
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   I have to apologize ahead of time because at about half an hour at 12 noon Pacific,
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   exactly, I'll be playing HQ trivia.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   But you guys can help me. This is a new game from the founder of Vine, Russ Yousapov.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   It's only been out for a few days. It's all the rage.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   I made it my pick for iOS today. But then I realized, but it only plays twice a day, 3pm and 9pm Eastern.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.500]   I don't understand what it's like.
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   It's live. You're playing against all the other people at the same time.
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   You're going to find out in half an hour because I have to play it because we have to record it so we can put it.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500]   Is it a game to get a bunch of what a register?
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.500]   I don't know because they're giving away money, but not a ton of money.
[00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   They're giving away, I think it's 250 bucks, but then they divide it among all the winners.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   If you have a startup in funding, you can probably do that for weeks.
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   You could do it for weeks, months, years.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   And you get users, Alex. That's the only thing that's a value in the startup word.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500]   That's what I'm trying to figure out.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   What do you do with those users once you get them?
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.500]   You sell them to a bigger company.
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   They'll find a way to monetize.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   Don't pivot.
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   This is Silicon Valley. Why are we talking about making money?
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.500]   Don't pivot to video, Andy.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.500]   Who's advice is that? Maybe some startup guys' advice is don't think about making money yet.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   Don't do it too.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.500]   Just get the users.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.500]   It's all about the users. Every user's dollar value.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.500]   That sounds like Jason Calicanis, I think.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.500]   All right. This is it. This is the week. This is it.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   Are we ready Friday? 1201 Pacific.
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   It's all ready.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   I am ready.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.500]   I've favorited my phone.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   Me too.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500]   It's not about all you can do.
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   Let me ask a question because there was some confusion.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.500]   Apple, well, a few things Apple's already said about this event.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   One is if you're on the upgrade plan, you know, where you get a new phone every year,
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   you're pre-registered.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.500]   But will you get it any faster?
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   You still have to go and complete the order at the same time as everybody else.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   You get this whole process you go through and you get pre-approved.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.500]   And then there's like one step at the bottom that is show up at midnight
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500]   Pacific time and complete your order.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.500]   Double thumbs up.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   It's very much like favorited-ing.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   I'm right there. I picked the phone, picked the color, picked the size.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.500]   And I just just continue.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   Yeah, you make sure you're here.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.500]   And then it says, and make sure you've got a credit card already set up.
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   And this is on the app, which I think is the best way to do it.
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   And that your credit's not frozen for any reason because you know,
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   there's been a bunch of stuff that's happened that's caused credit for users.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   Actually, it'd be probably prudent to buy a dongle the night before.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.500]   Yes.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   To make sure it's on your phone.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.500]   Do a test drive.
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   Apple's going to sell all these $10.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.500]   I do that.
[00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.500]   Once I went to buy it and it said my Apple Pay settings weren't right.
[00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   And I went in and there was no address.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   I had to pick, they had two addresses of the same address on file.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500]   And it cost me precious seconds.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   So I have no reason to send my watch to someone else.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   It scared me how fast I was able to buy the iPhone 8.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   I was getting off a plane and I remembered and I went, oh,
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   and like seconds later, I own it because it's just touch ID and boom.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.500]   Give us a favor.
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.500]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   It's cost me so many watch bands.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   Isn't that one of the basic principles of marketing that do not give the user enough time
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   to switch from an emotional decision to an intellectual decision?
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   Yes.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   If the money out of their hands, get the shiny thing in their hands instead.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.500]   That's the thing.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.500]   One thing.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   The reason I use Amazon, Amazon so much is because it's all,
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   it's like quick and fast and it's on my app and it's an impulse.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   If I go to someone as a website and I'm like, oh, now I got to fill all this out again.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.500]   I got to do this.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   And yeah.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   Impulse drive, like Star Trek.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:14.500]   So there are, according to rumors again and supply chain rumors,
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.500]   3 million total day of, say, less much better than the 65,000 we had heard before.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   It's 3 million might be enough.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   Depends on if they allocate regions and so forth.
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.500]   And then Apple has announced, and this is not a rumor.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   This is official, that the retail stores will have iPhone 10 in stock, but arrive early.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.500]   Which means we're out here.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   So we're like after years of discouraging the lineup.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   I mean, it's pretty much back now.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.500]   They're saying line up.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.500]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   Are there, I think there's people lining up the press right now.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.780]   So there's a battle within Apple every year because it's great marketing for them to have
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.780]   this lineup.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.940]   But it's a terrible customer experience.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.500]   And I think if Apple store and like Angela Aron's had her druthers, no one would ever
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.220]   have to line up, they would, the order process would be seamless.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.380]   It would just arrive.
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.180]   You would never have to do any of this.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.220]   But this is a product under severe constraint and they want to make sure the stores have
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.260]   some supply.
[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.660]   And so if you don't get the pre-order in, you're going to go to the, it feels like there's
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.700]   nothing they can do about it other than enjoy the glory of the Apple.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.700]   You have to think.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:20.260]   Yeah, this went away when Angela Aron's took the job as in charge of retail, leaving a
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.620]   Burberry to do that.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.580]   And you have to think that there are, there's the other faction that we like lines faction
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.580]   is just going.
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.580]   Yeah, we win.
[00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.820]   Because it's all over TV, right?
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.820]   It's all over TV.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.260]   It's all over the internet.
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.420]   So I'm going to do a little tour de force.
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.060]   I have not rehearsed this, but I'm going to tell you the countries that the iPhone 10
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.220]   will be available in on November 3rd in alphabetical order.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.540]   Are you ready?
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.060]   In one breath.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.220]   And or Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Croatia, Cyprus,
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.180]   Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Greenland, Guernsey,
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:01.620]   Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jersey, Kuwait, Latvia,
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.060]   Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.740]   Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Romania, or Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.620]   Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, UAE, UK, US, and US, Virgin Islands.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.820]   The Guernsey gets one, right?
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.820]   That's like one phone.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.980]   But boy, boy, that we have the one guy in Guernsey is really happy.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.460]   That's a lot of places for a highly.
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:31.300]   Usually when it's highly constrained.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.740]   Yeah, 55 countries, 3 million iPhones and the and endora.
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:37.740]   The Italian are here.
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:40.100]   Doesn't Namibia get one?
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.820]   Namibia gets one for us.
[00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.380]   I'm surprised Namibia doesn't get one.
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.380]   I just felt like the weirdest one.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.460]   The weirdest one in that whole section is endora.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.460]   Endora.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:49.460]   Endora.
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.180]   It's just a Spanish republic, near Spain.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.180]   Italy.
[00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.180]   Italy.
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.180]   It's just a macro year.
[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.260]   It's like where Apple executive senior, Apple executive have either relatives or vacation
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.060]   properties.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.060]   Monaco gets one that's right next to me.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.220]   At least the operations department.
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.340]   So they're probably bring a couple of boxes in and distribute them between Monaco and
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.340]   endora.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.420]   You put them in paper towels and throw them in people.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.580]   Anyway, we're excited, right?
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.580]   Totally.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:20.260]   Especially since the Pixel 2 XL's screen is crap.
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:26.620]   In fact, I have to think there are a lot of people who are saying, hmm, maybe I should
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.500]   cancel that Pixel 2 XL order because it's cool as just, you know, they're just starting
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.980]   to get those in the supply chain and get an iPhone 10.
[00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.980]   I've Apple did the right thing.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.980]   They bought their panels from Samsung.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:44.980]   Yes.
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.980]   Google bought them from LG.
[00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:51.980]   It's the same panel apparently as in the LG V30, which has similar problems, although no one's
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.980]   said anything about burn in on the LG.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:55.980]   So you have a very good theory, Renee Richie.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:10:00.980]   Why there seems to be, in fact, you said your boss has seen the burn in?
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:01.980]   No.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:02.980]   So Alex on Android Central.
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.980]   I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.980]   And I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.980]   I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.980]   I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.980]   I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.980]   I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.980]   I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.980]   I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.980]   I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.980]   I've seen a lot of people who are doing the same thing.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.980]   There's two different problems with OLEDs.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.980]   There's image retention, which is temporary, right?
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.980]   Yes.
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.980]   And burn in, which is probably permanent, or can it be fixed?
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.980]   Permanent or long duration?
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.980]   And there are techniques people try to use for.
[00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.980]   I mean, is there a wide range of issues with OLED?
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.980]   There's no technology that's perfect, but OLED is not very mature.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.980]   LCD is a super mature technology and people know how to use it.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.980]   OLED, it took Samsung years to get really good panels.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.980]   They went through a whole bunch of problems with theirs.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.980]   Now they probably have the best in the business.
[00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:07.180]   LG does great televisions, but that's a totally different technology that uses filters and
[00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.980]   things in a way that's not practical on phones.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.620]   And on their phone panels, they've been struggling with things like off-axis, color shift, and
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:18.980]   the graininess, and a variety of things, including what we're seeing on the Pixel XL.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.980]   So it does sound like, given that the V…
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:26.980]   Well, actually, I think people with the LG V20 were saying there was some issues, as I
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.980]   remember.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:33.180]   And that we haven't heard about burning with the V30, but we have with the same panel on
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:37.980]   the Google phone is maybe LG's doing something like that, image jitter.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.980]   Samsung moves this interface around one pixel at a time to avoid.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.980]   But if you go on Google and search for burn-in, you'll see like Pokeballs and things burned
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.980]   in all that displays.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.980]   And menu icon, anything that's persistent on the display for long periods of time can
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.980]   theoretically cause that.
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.980]   Here's Alex Doby's tweet.
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.980]   And you have to look at it closely, because unfortunately there's also reflection in there.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.980]   But you see them, it's the menu keys, right?
[00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.980]   Let me actually let me tell you straight it.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.980]   This is what the tellestrator is so good for here.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:10.980]   The quantum back, one down the bat.
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.980]   Actually, it's not, it's not tellestrating right now, somebody I think.
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.980]   And the issue is that this is like, again, this all happens, what we've talked about
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.980]   before with like lithium ion batteries there.
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.980]   They all have a failure rate, but after a week as a concern, it's not that it necessarily
[00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.980]   has burn-in, but it has burn-in after only being in the hands of these reviewers.
[00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:25.980]   That's terrible.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:31.980]   Yeah, you can see the back and the home and the recent buttons.
[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.980]   Those are the ones that never move.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.980]   And so that is really bad in the dock.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.980]   Wow.
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.980]   Yikes.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:42.980]   And this is on top of the previously reported stuff.
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:48.980]   Not, I mean, we should say not that Apple doesn't have issues from time to time, especially,
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.980]   you know, it's always risky to get the phone the minute it comes out the door.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.980]   And brand new phones.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.980]   You got to be committed if you're going to do it today.
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.980]   You know, you really want it, especially, yeah, first design, first time.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.980]   There was a great quote from Jeff Williams in one of the interviews.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.980]   I'm sure we'll get to later, but one of the quotes said, "Apple wants cutting edge technology
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.980]   at mature technologies volume."
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.980]   Oh, that's a good way to put it.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.980]   And that's always the challenge.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.980]   It is a huge challenge when you're making a new phone, and that's why there's three million,
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:16.980]   if there are even.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.980]   And they waited for like, to Apple's credit, like some people are worried now that iPhone
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.060]   10, because iPhone 10 also uses OLED display technology, will have similar issues.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.780]   But Apple's source from Samsung, which has a good history with OLED.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:32.100]   Like the Galaxy, the last few generations, Galaxy Note OLED has been much, much better.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:33.860]   And also Apple's doing all their own stuff with it.
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.580]   Like they're doing their own sub-pixel anti-aliasing, their own color management.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.980]   They're doing true tone.
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.180]   So there's a lot of things that Apple can do to make sure that it is a Pentile display.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.180]   I think that's a trademark.
[00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.180]   So I think they're going to call it diamond pattern.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.180]   But there's a lot of ways that you can mitigate against OLED.
[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:51.900]   And the biggest problem is like the lifespan of the blue pixel is not nowhere near as long
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.420]   as the lifespan of the green and red one.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.100]   So a lot of the OLED stuff is just working around that base issue.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.340]   I have to say I've had OLED phones for years from Samsung, and I've never had any problems
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.100]   with them with fading or with burn-in or even image retention.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.460]   I don't think I've had it in general with phones.
[00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.780]   You know, I haven't had a lot of burn-in with phones or iPads.
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.580]   I mean, they definitely have a lot of TVs.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.900]   I haven't had that problem either.
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.900]   I haven't OLED.
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.900]   But you keep them for like two years?
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.260]   Because that's usually like around the two-year mark you might see it on almost any OLED.
[00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.860]   I have an OLED thinkpad that's pretty new.
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.380]   But I'm still old-fashioned where I never want to see anything get left on.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:30.100]   Well, if you're a photographer as you are, or a video guy, you don't want that there.
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:31.100]   You don't know if it's real.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.100]   Right.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.100]   And some people are really sensitive.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.980]   Like I have an LG television and OLED television and I'm fine with it.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.340]   But a friend of mine, he sees it drop a few frames and it makes him sick.
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.380]   Like he actually makes him sick when it drops frames.
[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.220]   And some people have that problem with VR.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.460]   And again, like he can't hear audio distortion.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.460]   He's got very good hearing.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.860]   And if there's something wrong in like the quality of music, he has to turn it off.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.860]   And I'm fine.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.860]   I'm like, play that louder.
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:53.940]   It doesn't bother me at all.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:59.780]   Here's what, I mean, here's by the way an article from Android Authority that Samsung
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.620]   S8s have display burn-in as well.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.260]   I never noticed it.
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.260]   But you know what?
[00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:08.980]   This is my problem with some of this stuff.
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.540]   If you're picky and you notice it and then you tell everybody, everybody notices it.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.060]   But if you didn't ever mention it, nobody would notice it.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.060]   There's a certain pickiness.
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.860]   Now you're a picky person now.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.900]   So I expect you to know because you're a perfect, you know, you're, that's your job.
[00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.900]   You're visual.
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.340]   But I've never noticed any of these problems.
[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.860]   It's like the Apple thing with the modems like the Intel versus Qualcomm modems or the
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.940]   Taiwan semiconductor versus Samsung sets.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.940]   Right.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:33.940]   There's different.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.220]   But most people, but also multiple will never notice that.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.860]   And there's some people who will have no problem with the pixel to display.
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.260]   They'll be like, off-axis color.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.660]   I don't, I don't care at all.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:42.660]   Give me the phone.
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.940]   And other people will say, Oh, it looks blue.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.940]   I really don't like that.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.940]   I'm going to spend my money on another phone.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:48.940]   Stand up.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:49.940]   Expectations.
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:50.940]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.420]   I mean, expectations do go up the more you're charging for this for $1000.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:16:02.540]   The, the iPhone 10 has to be damn near perfect or there should be a, a statement in place.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:04.580]   It says, if there's something broken with it, don't worry.
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.860]   We will replace it or fix it because this thing has to be perfect.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:13.060]   And I guess I bought a $125 phone where God, if there was only yellow on the display,
[00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.540]   they'd be, okay, what would you want for five, twenty five inches display with a hundred
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.020]   twenty five bucks?
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.420]   That's fair.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:21.020]   All right.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:29.140]   Friday, we'll know among the five of us, four of us, somebody will have one, I hope.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:35.100]   One thing I do know, and I can't say how, but we will have a unit on the November 4th
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.340]   new screen savers and a review.
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.020]   Nice, but, but I can't tell you how.
[00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.740]   Because I don't know, but there's some magic being done.
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.140]   It has something to do with the pope.
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.340]   So I thought you were going to say, Johnny, I was.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.700]   I don't want to, I don't want to spoiler father, Robert has somehow gained access to
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.860]   one and we'll be doing the game.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.300]   The iPhone you will be doing a review.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.620]   The people iPhone November 4th we will have.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.700]   So when you, and when it rings, you'll pick it up and they'll be like, is this the pope?
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.700]   It's the pope.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.700]   This is not the pope.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.700]   He's pop.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.340]   So, yeah, so we will at least be able to show that a week from Saturday.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.980]   I don't know if this is a phone.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:15.300]   I wonder if the church is selling, remember the good old days where you could kill a guy,
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.060]   but then just sort of buy forgiveness for us.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.060]   Indulgence, yes.
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.060]   Indulgence is, yeah.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.060]   Exactly.
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.060]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.420]   iPhone, I'd rather have an iPhone 10 than an indulgence to be honest.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.180]   That's the relic I want.
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:27.660]   I'm building an Arela Quarry Royer.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.140]   What role do you favorite Leo?
[00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.180]   I favorited the silver.
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.900]   I think that's kind of pretty.
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.900]   Went for the black.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.140]   Yeah, I went for space grid.
[00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.660]   I love the look of the silver because to me it looks the most like the original iPhone
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.260]   of any iPhone apples made sense.
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.380]   But I just, there's something about the black that I really like and I thought, you know,
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.060]   cosmetically it would match my watch more, which is horrible, but I did.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.780]   I mentioned last time or a couple of times ago you could favorite it in the store and
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.540]   a number of people said, I can't favor it.
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.660]   Is there a reason?
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.820]   You need to be logged in.
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.460]   I did it on the Apple store on iOS.
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.100]   Some people said their carrier status was interfering with it.
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.700]   So again, I would make sure you've got everything nailed down like you're up like all of that
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.700]   stuff.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.060]   It should be in your see right here, favor Ritz.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.500]   It should be in there.
[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:18.500]   And so the next step from this point on is continue, right?
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.860]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.780]   It's blue.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:23.780]   What?
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:24.780]   What?
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:28.660]   For the upgrade program, that'll take you to the wait a minute.
[00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:30.220]   Oh, damn it.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.180]   So I got a little farther than I did with trying.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.260]   It was worth trying.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:39.420]   It was worth trying.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.420]   That's so funny.
[00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:42.380]   It was a little farther than I got last time.
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.700]   So you can favor it.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.340]   And by doing it, you're kind of bypassing the color choice, the carrier choice.
[00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:52.340]   See, I've already chosen T-Mobile silver 256 gigs.
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.940]   So that's, that's again, that's our recommendation.
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:56.460]   And hey, I was able to do it.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.260]   But until that select goes blue, I can't do anything more after that.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.180]   But just tap the heart, make it a favorite.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.820]   And yeah, I think I would, I think Renee and I will be ordering something a few hours
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.180]   before just to make sure our credit cards in there.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:12.180]   Yep.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:13.180]   I'm in there the same thing.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:14.180]   Yep.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.180]   I'm in with you.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.620]   It's, I don't, I don't know what I'm going to be able to get.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:21.220]   I know that if I don't get one in the first month, it could be quite a while.
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.140]   So I'm just going to, I can return it in two weeks.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.300]   I'll, yeah, I'll see if I can do.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.340]   But I do think, I think that everybody that gets one this year is probably going to order
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.740]   it in the first, what, 30 minutes?
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.740]   You think 30?
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.020]   You think that long?
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.460]   No, I'm being very conservative.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:37.020]   I think it might be the first five.
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.260]   I mean, if the end illusions don't take all of them.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.660]   Um, is that what endoins are called?
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.660]   And illusions.
[00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:45.660]   Oh, and, and Dorian stories.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:47.660]   Are you going to order two?
[00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.460]   Uh, God, don't order two.
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.900]   Yeah, you should always order two.
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.060]   Because you sell it on daily one line for the price that you pay for the first one.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.060]   So I'm going to order two if I can.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:59.340]   Actually, I'll need to because Lisa will want to.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.540]   I'm going to order two because then I'm going to try selling it online for twice.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.540]   Twice.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.540]   You pay for it.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.100]   That's your the problem.
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.100]   You're the problem.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.100]   It's your fault.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.100]   That's it.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.820]   You're, you're, you're, I can't get a super Nintendo classic.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.820]   I have four of them.
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.820]   I'm still.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:16.820]   You can.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.580]   Yeah, you see, I probably in the sand, he have Andy has none.
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.540]   No, I don't have one.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.700]   I, I missed the boat until it was.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.700]   No, I don't.
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.700]   You need two extra hands.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.700]   I remember.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:29.780]   You could like play playing a different game with each hand and still have like one on
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:30.780]   each foot.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.540]   No, I have to miss how many super Nintendo.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.020]   Very nice iPhone, but eBay is dumb.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:38.220]   I'm afraid that all I have is a, I have, I just have an Oculus system and that's it.
[00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.900]   When I get my new iPhone 10, I'm going to glue a tracker.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:42.900]   There you go.
[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.900]   Onto it.
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:44.900]   I'm going to make sure.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.900]   I'm going to make sure.
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.900]   I can't sell it on eBay.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:47.900]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.900]   This is mine.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:49.900]   Damn it.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.300]   I showed you they brought to you by tracker, the coin sized lightweight tracking device that
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.740]   makes sure you don't lose your stuff.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.900]   Notice I've got mine on my keys.
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.780]   I keep one in my wall and I keep one in my briefcase.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.500]   I put it in my luggage.
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.460]   You can attach up to 10 trackers to your phone and then a couple of great things.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:13.540]   You get the separation alerts, which I love because that means if I leave my phone behind,
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.700]   the tracker beeps at me.
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.380]   If I leave my keys behind, the phone beeps at me.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.980]   And if I need to find my keys, there's a little button right there on the phone that
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.940]   I can press and the keys go off and the LEDs on this, this is the tracker pixel.
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.780]   The LEDs light up.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:36.980]   That's really handy if you lose it in the covers or under a pillow or a sofa.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.540]   Really makes it easier to find.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.340]   And of course, if I can't find my phone, I press the tracker button.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.540]   This is the easiest way to find my phone.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.500]   And my phone, even if it's silenced, will make noise.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.660]   They're all going off now.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.340]   The best thing is, and see, there's a map of where my keys were last seen.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.860]   Now that's key because this is a Bluetooth device.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.340]   It's not a GPS in the tracker to be light and to get better battery life.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:09.300]   It's just Bluetooth but Bluetooth LE, by the way, so it really gets great battery life.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:14.500]   But that's the beauty of this because with Bluetooth LE, if anybody has the tracker
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:20.540]   app on their phone and walks by your tracker, no matter where it is in the world, they'll
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.540]   ping you.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.820]   You can turn on notifications and you'll automatically get pinged every time somebody
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.180]   sees your device anywhere in the world.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.820]   With 5 million trackers in the world, it means pretty much everywhere.
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.900]   There's people walking around with tracker on their phone.
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:37.980]   I love that.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.260]   It's the largest crowd locate network in the world.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.580]   30-day money back guarantees so you're never at risk.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.260]   The tracker is unique in one other way.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.180]   You can change the battery.
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.420]   After a year or so, when the tracker does lose its juice, no problem.
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.980]   It's easy to open it up and put it in one of those coin size batteries.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:59.180]   You get at the drugstore and get another year or so on your tracker.
[00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:04.060]   Go to the tracker.com/macbreak and you'll get 20% off your order right now.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.060]   What?
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.060]   What?
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.060]   That's a great deal.
[00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.580]   Even if you've already ordered some trackers, order some more.
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.900]   The tracker.com/macbreak, 20% off.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.260]   This is a great holiday gift, by the way.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.140]   The tracker.com/macbreak, stop losing your stuff.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.140]   Start using.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.700]   I like that it'll set off an alarm when you're walking away.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.540]   I think that separation alert has saved my bacon so many times.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.540]   I have a couple of these.
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.300]   I became a sponsor and I saw the discount.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.260]   I bought one and I got one hidden on my bike.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.260]   Yeah, that's smart.
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.820]   It's good for a bike, I think.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:38.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.820]   Spikes do tend to wander off, don't they?
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:47.820]   Well, you know, they go where roads tend to ramble and where people have old cutters.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.820]   Ramlin' boat cutters.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:58.020]   As long as we're talking about the iPhone X, some people are wondering, "Well, we've
[00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.340]   got a HomePod.
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:02.740]   We've got iMac Pro.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.740]   Maybe there'll be another event.
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.020]   Craig Federighi says, "No.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.820]   I think we're all keynoted out for the season."
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.660]   Well, it's official.
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.820]   I think we knew this.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:14.820]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:20.940]   I think that also indicates that all the stuff we saw at the Steve Jobs Theatre, that was
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.020]   just fake sprinklers and fake outlets just to get it past the fire code.
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.380]   Now, they've really, before they have another event, they really have to.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.460]   Now they've got to finish it, huh?
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.140]   So, they've spoken about the HomePod before.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.900]   You don't need to say anything more about it.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.740]   The iMac Pro, I think, is pretty clear.
[00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.260]   I was holding that hope, though.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.380]   They might announce a Mac Mini next year.
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.660]   Mac Pro, Mac Pro next year.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:56.300]   I think that if they release the Mac Pro as a rack-mountable modular system, the Mac
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:00.900]   Mini would probably be short-lived after that, because the main use, I mean, almost
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.780]   everybody I know, I'm sure that some people have been home, but I think almost everybody
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:04.780]   I know that has Mac Mini's.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.780]   The reason you have a Mac Mini is because you can easily rack-mount it.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.860]   You know, they also pitched it as an introduction to Macs for PC users.
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:34.380]   Home
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.380]   Mac's
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.380]   are not fulfilling.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.940]   Again, I'd be really concerned if Apple were to drop the Mac Mini in his car.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.580]   I mean, Tim Cook says it's an important product.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.380]   He says, "We're still here."
[00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:46.900]   Yeah, well, that's like saying that he's a important part of this presidential administration.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.900]   He has, I like it.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.340]   He has my full support.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:56.660]   I have to say that 2017 is a year in which I, you know, it's going to be a make-up right
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:57.660]   here.
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:58.660]   I think you're right.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:25:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.900]   Well, no, whenever Apple says, "We love this product.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.940]   It's an important part of the future."
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:07.500]   I'm like, "Okay, I thank you for making noises with your mouth."
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:12.260]   It took more effort than to not make noises with your mouth on this subject, but they've
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.220]   been ignoring the Mac for so long so consistently that I'm not listening until you actually
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:21.340]   put something in a box at the Apple Store that I can actually look at.
[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.500]   Well we know there will be an iMac Pro because according to 9-to-5 Mac, Apple suppliers are
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:32.380]   upping production of the Radeon Pro Vega GPUs that are included in the iMac.
[00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.380]   Apple announced it.
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:37.940]   Which I do find it kind of, you know, it's frustrating.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:42.860]   I mean, the, the Radeon boards from a professional perspective are not as good as the Nvidia
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:43.860]   boards.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.860]   No, we want it.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:45.860]   So yeah.
[00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.220]   But of course, what does it, what does it, Apple wants to control the drivers and Nvidia
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.460]   wants to control the drivers.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:52.460]   What is it?
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.460]   The CL.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.460]   The OpenCL.
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.460]   The OpenCL.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.460]   Is that a big problem to the middle?
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:03.100]   You know, there's a lot of things that the Nvidia boards do that, that from a heavy graphics
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.860]   perspective, professional graphics perspective works better.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.860]   The Radeon cards tend to break things up into much smaller little chunks that are harder
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.860]   to manage.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.860]   Right.
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:12.860]   So.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.260]   And my understanding is Nvidia won't let Apple write to the metal and Apple really wants
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.260]   to write to the metal.
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.260]   Oh.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.260]   That's an impasse.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.260]   They won't let Apple do what?
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.260]   They won't, they won't let Apple access the hardware directly.
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.420]   They want them to go through Nvidia and Apple wants to access the hardware directly.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:24.420]   You know what?
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.900]   Any of them do you let them do whatever they want because they're not in video?
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.900]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:30.900]   And I understand both sides, but I could see, I don't, if I were Apple, I would say no,
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.940]   we need to optimize performance.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.260]   But as a result, because they're getting a sub-optimal.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.380]   Well, they compete too because Apple has metal too and Nvidia has CUDA.
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:41.140]   And I'm sure a lot of Apple people want to access CUDA, but Apple probably wants metal
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:43.220]   to run directly on the hardware as well.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.220]   Right.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.220]   Oh, well.
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.820]   The operating system is very, very, very dependent.
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:54.020]   The Apple, the Mac operating system is very dependent on the graphics card, unlike other
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.020]   operating systems.
[00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:59.180]   And so it, like if something goes wrong or something gets late to be updated, becomes
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.180]   a really big deal.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.660]   It also points to the importance of this particular iMac.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.700]   It's like the Mac platform with the processors they're using with the integration they've
[00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:10.700]   got.
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:15.260]   It's so powerful now that if you're going to make a Mac Pro, you have to say, we really
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.820]   have to say that this is for graphics.
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.220]   It really has to be optimized for VR, really has to be optimized for video production because
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.980]   almost any other use is not graphics intensive.
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.980]   The iMac can really handle it just as well or the, or even a Mac book Pro can handle it
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.980]   just as well.
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.700]   So that's the point at which you got to shave, you got to keep shaving millimeters and grams,
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.060]   wherever you can, because that's the only thing that's going to get you to that destination.
[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.860]   Moving right along, no event.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:49.020]   Oh, Apple's on a, Apple's, uh, I rents in an interview with Buzzfeed news.
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:55.020]   And asked if she was the next going to be the next CEO, she's senior vice president of
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.020]   retail.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.020]   Angela Arance said it's fake news.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.180]   Oh, don't use that term.
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:02.180]   That's the term.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.620]   Don't don't use that term.
[00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.100]   Everybody.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:11.180]   Cook said we're preparing as many people as I can to be CEO.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.180]   What?
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.900]   You could be CEO.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.900]   You could be CEO.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.900]   What?
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.340]   Hey, whoever's doing the drone, the drone video is a new campus.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.140]   Is there a thunder dome anywhere on the campus?
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.140]   It's kind of weird.
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.140]   It's going to be.
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.140]   He says, I train.
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.620]   He says, my job is to prepare as many people as I can to be CEO.
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.620]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.460]   The board makes the decision.
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.460]   Uh, Angela, I'm going to say your fake news is fake news.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.060]   I think that that actually is probably fairly credible.
[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.060]   She's, she seems to be the most likely.
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:44.060]   She let was CEO at, uh, uh, the rain company Burberry.
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.060]   Burberry left.
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.940]   No, she still is wearing his Burberry when she was on stage.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:48.940]   So she's not.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.300]   She still has taste and she didn't leave that behind.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.700]   Uh, I think, you know, former CEO, they must have proffered her something pretty amazing
[00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.460]   to take a job as an SVP after being CEO.
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.780]   Being head of Apple, Apple store is almost like being president of a company.
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:03.780]   I agree.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.780]   It's such a big thing.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:05.780]   It's such a big thing.
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.860]   But I think it also wouldn't hurt if you said, and you'd be in the running, at least in the
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.820]   running for CEO.
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.900]   Her, Jeff Williams, there's a bunch of really good candidates there.
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.980]   How old is Tim Cook?
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:17.980]   Just asking Siri.
[00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.980]   His 56.
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:19.980]   56.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:24.180]   So he's not going to retire for five to 10 years.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:34.460]   But, you know, um, Senate is asking why Apple removed VPN apps from the China store, an open
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:41.580]   letter from Patrick Leahy and Ted Cruz, noting that China has an abysmal human rights record.
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:46.460]   And they are, quote, concerned that Apple may be enabling the Chinese government's censorship
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.140]   and surveillance of the internet.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:53.740]   I think I think the answer would be because it's the long in China.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.540]   They asked, what has Apple done to promote free speech in China?
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.620]   Is that really their job?
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:04.980]   And whether it's pushed for human rights and better treatment of oppressed groups in the
[00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:06.980]   country.
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:10.620]   Tim Cook, of course, in the earnings call a couple of weeks ago said, we'd rather not
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.220]   remove apps, but we do.
[00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.900]   But like we do in other countries, we follow the law where we do business.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.700]   Apple has not responded to the letter officially yet.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:20.700]   Yeah.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.420]   I don't, I have to question the motives of those two particular senators.
[00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.980]   But nonetheless, I'm glad to see that Apple and Google and Facebook are sort of having
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.020]   their feet.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.580]   People pointing out that maybe this isn't such a good thing when you cowed out even even
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.500]   when you're complying with the law.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.820]   Perhaps some laws are not there to be complied with.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.620]   That's where you say goodbye to the market.
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:46.140]   It's challenging because you, I mean, of course we expect international companies operating
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.020]   in the US to adhere to our laws.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.740]   We'd expect nothing less than that, right?
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.540]   And there's also like different opinions like some Apple has a long history of believing
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.220]   that it can affect change through engagement.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:58.180]   That's why like they haven't pulled out of areas where, you know, they're like, they try
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:02.420]   to make areas where they mine elements, for example, safer and they try to make all these
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.900]   things and they say that if we pull out, they'll just get worse and worse.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.980]   If we stay engaged, maybe we can change it and you can agree or disagree with it, but
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.140]   they've been remarkably consistent in applying that policy.
[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.140]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:15.820]   But that's, it's different when you have a company like Google or company like Facebook
[00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:21.580]   where they're providing communications infrastructure that connects a region to the entire world.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.620]   It is a complicated, it's a complicated issue.
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.260]   Sometimes there is a benefit to making sure you stay in there at least with the ability
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:33.340]   to influence and at least try to figure out a way around the law that while complying with
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:39.380]   the law that gives people in that region the resources that they need, but nonetheless,
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:44.380]   that it's yet another item on that long list of things that Apple needs to be vocal about
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:48.440]   saying that we get it, we don't, we're not just simply playing along with whatever
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.260]   a regime tells us to do.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.340]   We do have our eyes on this issue.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.060]   And also there are laws like companies, sorry, Alex.
[00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.900]   I was going to say is that, you know, Apple hasn't given up some way to break into the
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:32:59.900]   phone to China.
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.420]   They haven't, you know, there's a lot of things that.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.540]   In fact, you could still use a VPN.
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.300]   This just takes the apps out of the app store.
[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.940]   That wasn't the only way to use a VPN with an iPhone.
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.500]   You can enterprise, you can install it through enterprise or through test flight or through
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:13.500]   their mechanisms.
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.220]   But there is also, there are laws that say, for example, like, I don't know if they're
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.620]   still in, in force, but they were laws that saying you couldn't sell certain levels of
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:21.500]   encryption to other countries.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.260]   And these are lawmakers and they could say American companies can't provide X, Y, Z services
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.380]   to certain countries if they wanted to as well.
[00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.500]   So yeah, they can, they can yell to Apple all they want, but they also are in a position
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.660]   where they can affect change if they want it.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.980]   You know what I almost forgot with the iPhone 10 and the first thing I'm going to do next
[00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:43.100]   week when I get my new iPhone 10, because I'm going to an analogy.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.100]   Yes.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.580]   Except maybe we shouldn't call it an emoji.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:51.860]   Apple's being sued by the Japanese company that owns the trademark.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:52.860]   Well, that's the question.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.740]   Is the question whether they own it or not?
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:58.700]   I think that Apple is basically taking advantage of a technicality that it appears that they
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:03.580]   may have registered it to a non-existing company.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.220]   And so, you know, in some--
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.100]   There is an Animoji app on iOS.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.100]   I didn't realize this.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.620]   There was an iPhone, like, a license going Apple launched the iPhone, right?
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:16.220]   But the trademark that was, that was gotten may have not, may not be properly, completely
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:17.220]   proper.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:21.060]   And so I think that it's, I have a very, I have a feeling that Apple looked at this
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:25.380]   pretty carefully and felt like they had a pretty good chance of winning.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:30.460]   Well, remember that even when iPhone was not unencumbered, when they named it iPhone,
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.460]   they had to--
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.460]   They've done this.
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.460]   This has happened so many times.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.460]   Yeah, Cisco owned the--
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.660]   And when you're a company as big as Apple, you work it out somehow.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:43.900]   Apple actually had filed to, in September, to cancel Animoji's-- the E-Monster Animoji
[00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.260]   trademark.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.860]   And so the registration is under review.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:50.420]   Apparently, yeah, you read the stories.
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.420]   Obviously, Alex, because I'm just repeating what you've said.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.100]   So you know what'll happen.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.700]   You know exactly what'll happen.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.820]   E-Monster and Apple will sit down at a table and Apple will say, "How big of a check?"
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.540]   Well, it'll, I think they'll wait until they figure out whether they win or lose that.
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.900]   If they invalidate the trademark, then that doesn't even matter.
[00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:06.900]   But you know--
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:07.900]   And the lawyer gets cheaper to--
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.900]   It's cheaper to--
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.900]   How much money?
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.180]   Yeah, how much money does Apple have to give E-Monster?
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.180]   10 million dollars?
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.180]   Right.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:15.180]   It'll be easy.
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.180]   No, not even.
[00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:17.180]   Chicken feet.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.180]   Well, yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.180]   I mean, yeah.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.180]   So far, we're done out.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.180]   Yeah, how about that?
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.180]   $1.00 out.
[00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.220]   Let's just call it a day.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.820]   Apple versus Samsung, one more time.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.380]   Just one time.
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.860]   Just one more time.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.460]   So the Supreme Court sent it back to the lower courts.
[00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:40.460]   Judge Lucy Coe says, "We're going to do it a fourth time."
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.340]   This is the Apple versus Samsung trial over the--
[00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.740]   Is this the trade dress or the--
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:48.380]   I believe there's several.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.380]   There was a design patent.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.380]   Yeah, and there's a trade dress.
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:54.820]   One of my favorite Twitter accounts, Counter Notions, Contra on Twitter, keeps tweeting,
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:58.900]   like, "Judge Lucy Coe orders Eddie Q to take the field in Warriors game."
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:04.220]   Just because she comes up with really great-- really great things for Apple to do.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.580]   The long-running litigation-- I'm reading from ours technique as a story, Joe Mullen.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.540]   "The long-running litigation roller coaster has included so many turns.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.380]   It's hard to keep track.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:22.580]   The case was filed in 2011, six years ago, went to trial, a jury trial in 2012."
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:27.260]   That's when, remember, Apple won $1 billion.
[00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:32.380]   Then they had more trust trial hearings, and that was whittled down.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:37.260]   And then there was a 2013 retrial for damages in front of another jury.
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:42.420]   Then the appeals court kicked out trademark-related damages altogether, leaving only the trade
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.300]   dress issues.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.700]   Meanwhile, a second case moved forward in which Apple sued over a new generation of
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.340]   Samsung products.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.580]   That went to jury trial in 2014.
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.980]   That resulted in a $120 million damage verdict.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:03.540]   That verdict was thrown out on appeal, reinstated on subsequent appeal.
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.540]   Then the first-- yeah.
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:11.060]   Then the first case, Samsung said, "All right, we'll pay you $548 million."
[00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:16.700]   Then the US Supreme Court said, "No, the damage-- the damages was all wrong."
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:17.820]   But they didn't say how to do it right.
[00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.820]   They just sent it back.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:25.300]   The high court threw out the $399 million of the damages that Apple won.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:33.180]   Not yesterday, but I think on Sunday, Lucico published a 35-page order scheduling a hearing
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.540]   later this week in a whole new jury trial.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.060]   It is the case that never ends.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.060]   I think it's the Apple advantage for the state.
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.060]   I think it's the Apple advantage for the state.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.060]   It's one sauce for every American McDonald's customer.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.020]   Yes, set one for everyone.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.500]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:53.540]   No, I think that it is-- it's an Apple's advantage to keep it in court for as long as
[00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:58.380]   possible because it will affect thought processes on the other side because if you lose this
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.940]   for some reason, it could unravel to other things.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:05.620]   I think they want to just keep them thinking about it all the time.
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.420]   I don't know whether-- I think they've diverged enough at this point.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.860]   I don't know if it really matters, but I'm sure they'll keep on taking this one as far
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.860]   as it'll go.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:23.500]   Joe's article goes on and on, which I won't-- with details on what Co's document said
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:28.420]   in terms of how it would be determined, whether Samsung had infringed on Apple.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:33.500]   She did say Apple should bear the burden of proof in determining the "article of manufacturer,"
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.140]   which I think is a term of art for something.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.060]   I don't know what the hell it all means.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:41.700]   But good lord, fourth jury trial.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.100]   How much do you think these companies have spent on legal fees to this point?
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.100]   Not a billion.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.100]   More than the companies have.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.100]   A lot.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.660]   There's so many-- if it's getting B World War I where people forget about the both sides,
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.340]   they're just getting dug in deeper and deeper and deeper.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.660]   Both have good sides to keep on going.
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.980]   I think Samsung's reason is, hey, because yeah, they did do some things they shouldn't
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.700]   have done, but also-- and there's actually an illustration in that ours technical article
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:12.500]   that Apple is insisting that they own a black rectangle with rounded corners.
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.420]   And I like to say, no you don't.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:20.220]   I can just go into my closet right now and show you lots of products that predate the
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.060]   iPhone that are black rectangles with rounded corners.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.900]   Okay, Sue, don't do it, Andy.
[00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:29.100]   It's hard to pick a side to actually root for because you feel as though both sides
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:35.460]   are being jerks and that if this were a movie pitch, it would be that the lead lawyers on
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.220]   both sides are actually in love with each other.
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.300]   And this is how they keep the relationship going.
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.660]   I just want to keep seeing him.
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.980]   I just want to keep seeing her.
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:49.940]   What if we say that the damages should be appropriated based on the trademark appeal
[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:55.580]   in Canada as opposed to apply towards-- that'll give us an appeal, yes.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:03.580]   Do you care what was-- what the phone was is buying?
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:08.100]   Was says he's not getting an iPhone X and he's not apparently getting the iPhone 8 because
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:11.100]   it's the same as the iPhone 6.
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:14.140]   This is to CNBC.
[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.300]   He said this will be the first year he doesn't upgrade to a new iPhone.
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.300]   I'd rather wait--
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.860]   He says that every year, doesn't he?
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.860]   Does he?
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.180]   I don't think he's been courting about saying that.
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:29.140]   I'd like to point out that probably there's boxes of iPhones at Steve's house.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:34.940]   I am sure Apple sends him anything and everything.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:36.700]   He says he's using an iPhone 8.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.700]   Oh, OK.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.660]   But he does-- I'm happy with my iPhone 8, which is the same as the iPhone 7, which is
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.580]   the same as iPhone 6.
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:44.780]   So maybe he didn't buy it.
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:46.780]   Maybe that's I don't know.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:52.980]   So didn't he post a picture of like from a hotel room of like his essential-- this is
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.500]   the stuff that I travel with and there were like eight different kinds of phones like
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.500]   laid out in the bed.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:58.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.500]   So I wouldn't be--
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:07.340]   Anybody at his level, even if they didn't found Apple, every movie star gets a-- you
[00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:10.020]   know, they just send this out to all of those people, right?
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.020]   I mean, it's--
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:12.020]   Buzz marketing.
[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:16.060]   Also at that level, your phone is called Becca.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.660]   Listen, Becca, when's my next appointment?
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.660]   Becca.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.660]   Becca.
[00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:21.660]   He says, "Hi, Becca."
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:22.660]   Becca.
[00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.660]   He says, "Tashmaka."
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.660]   All right.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.660]   All right.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.420]   You guys, you can explain this better probably than I can.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.420]   iPhone calculator.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.420]   OK.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.420]   Let's--
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.420]   Yeah, I can explain this.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:33.740]   Yeah, I know what's going on, but let's just do it.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:34.740]   OK.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.260]   1 plus 2 plus 3 equals 3.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.260]   Wait a minute.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.260]   Let me clear that.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:45.380]   1 plus 2 plus 3 equals 51.
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:46.380]   No, wait a minute.
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.380]   Let's do that again.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:52.860]   1 plus 2 plus 3 equals 6.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.860]   Yes.
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.300]   I did it too fast.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.300]   Too slow.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.300]   What?
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:58.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.500]   So there's an animation issue, right?
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:05.020]   Yeah, the animation for the operators-- the animation for the numbers are fine, but the
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.140]   animation for the operators is slow enough and blocks input enough that it doesn't register
[00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.140]   the second plus sign.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:15.180]   So you end up getting 1 plus 2, 3 equals 24, which is, you know, horrible.
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:19.420]   Now somebody in the chatroom saying, scooter x, who I trust, says this happened in iOS
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.420]   9 and 10 as well.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:21.420]   I guess nobody noticed it.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.820]   We all thought it was an iOS 11 issue.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.820]   This is fixable.
[00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.500]   There is-- because it's a problem in general with animation.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.500]   It should not have shipped.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.500]   It should not have shipped.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.500]   It should not have shipped.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   It's fixable for it.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   I found the right note for it.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.500]   I put the number on Twitter yesterday.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.500]   Good man.
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.140]   You should-- what you should do is cancel an animation with another button presses sense.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.140]   Yes.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.140]   That's all--
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.140]   Make it interruptable.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.140]   It's easy.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.140]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.420]   The fact that nobody noticed this is bizarre, and the thing is it's serious only in the sense
[00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.100]   that, OK, once you know it, you're going to carefully type numbers.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.260]   The problem is if you're doing a lot of calculating, it'd be very easy to inadvertently once.
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.340]   Just do it a little too fast, and then your whole thing is screwed up.
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.340]   So if you just basically--
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.340]   And if you just basically and unusually, you'll see it.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:00.340]   Yeah, it's just not like plus over and over again.
[00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.340]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.840]   It's an unusable calculator.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.840]   It's unusable.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.840]   You shouldn't use it.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.060]   It's too risky to get it wrong.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.580]   Use peakalk.
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.140]   Peakalk is now that problem, right?
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.140]   No.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.140]   You're serious.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.140]   You're serious.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:14.140]   Siri doesn't get it wrong.
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.180]   But see, a lot of people use calculators like this for text times coming.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.420]   You might add up a column, a number.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:20.420]   No, that would get you in trouble.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.900]   And you would get it wrong.
[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:23.300]   My wife can do it very fast.
[00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.300]   So that would be--
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.300]   Mm.
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.300]   --disaster.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.300]   Mm.
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.300]   So what?
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.300]   What?
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.140]   Did they not try it?
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:37.100]   I mean, it's still on the-- like, I have the latest beta, and it's still a problem.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.100]   So--
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.100]   Well, it won't be next time.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.100]   --it's just one of those things that should never happen.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.100]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.340]   And the thing is that this is getting a lot of attention, so it'll get fixed.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.700]   But there's probably numerous things like this that haven't gotten the attention.
[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.580]   That's still need to be fixed.
[00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:50.460]   So there used to be a joke that people didn't carry the plus size versions enough.
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.460]   And that's why they dropped frames.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.820]   And if you forced them to carry the plus size versions, they'd see the frame drops.
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:56.180]   And they'd be so annoyed by it they'd get--
[00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:59.980]   This is an iPhone 8 with an A11 bionic.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.460]   The fastest chip ever put in a phone.
[00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:04.460]   Yep.
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.460]   Fast.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:13.260]   But it doesn't matter if it's fast, if the code says, and then wait till the screen fades
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:19.340]   in and fades out.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.900]   It's fast, but limitations to quality control is always faster.
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:23.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:24.900]   You have a Ferrari, but the door is locked.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:25.900]   Good luck.
[00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:26.900]   You do wonder.
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:32.740]   I mean, there's presumably somebody in charge of calculator, right?
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.740]   Maybe not.
[00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.740]   Yeah, I mean, I'm the guy.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:35.740]   What do you do?
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.740]   I work on calculator.
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:42.380]   I do-- well, remember that remote wasn't updated for like years because the one guy
[00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:44.820]   who wrote it got transferred.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.820]   So nobody was even looking at it.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.820]   Yeah, the project.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.020]   That might be what's going on with calculator, right?
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.580]   The calculator guy is now working at Google.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:58.260]   And maybe those animations are system-wide and he didn't check it because--
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:02.500]   Or it could also be that that's on a list of bugs that's like 37th in the list of things
[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:05.980]   that they consider to be far more critical and no one was complaining so they'll get
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.980]   to that eventually.
[00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:07.980]   Now it's getting a lot of attention.
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:08.980]   It'll be first.
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:12.020]   And there's something else sitting at spot 36 that won't get attention until they fix
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:14.380]   the crash bug here or the memory leak there.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.380]   So at this point though, my strong advice is do not use the Apple iPhone calculator,
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.380]   period.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.380]   It's-- you just can't guarantee it.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.380]   Unless you're going to go really, really slow.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.380]   Very--
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.380]   And they don't have--
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.380]   Slow.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.380]   Do they have a tape?
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.380]   Because if you had a tape, you could-- you know, some calculators have a tape.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.380]   Peacock has a tape.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.380]   They don't have a tape though.
[00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.300]   There's no way you can audit your results.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.300]   So you should--
[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.300]   Like, I told them that--
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.300]   I told them that--
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.300]   I don't think that--
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.300]   How do you change the paper?
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   --the spreadsheet on the tape.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.300]   Well, you'll get a red stripe when you're down to the end.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.300]   OK.
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.300]   All right.
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.900]   Did you see this number, global app revenues?
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.740]   Now, this is not just iOS.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.660]   This is Google 2.
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:46:00.380]   For one quarter, Q3, three months, revenues of $17 billion according to app Annie.
[00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:01.860]   Google Play is green.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:04.620]   iOS is blue.
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.300]   So you can see actually there's considerably more downloads for Google Play.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:12.820]   But the numbers are staggering.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.620]   The total app downloads $26 billion in three months.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:18.620]   People like apps.
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.460]   This is a category that didn't exist in 2007.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.460]   Yep.
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:26.500]   Well, it was-- like, I remember for my palm trio, I had to go to a variety of websites.
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:28.260]   I'd forget which store I bought what app on.
[00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.300]   It cost like 30 bucks for a yellow sticky notes app.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.780]   And it would crash my phone half the time.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.780]   And we've come--
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:34.780]   It's amazing.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.660]   --like it was centralized stores and easy purchases.
[00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.100]   I got that far away from some phone makers saying, we will give you this-- this phone cost us
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.700]   $180 to manufacture.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.820]   We will sell it to you for $25.
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:48.860]   But through the Google Play store, through the Apple store, there's an affiliate link
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:53.220]   so that basically we get affiliate money from all your app store purchases.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.980]   I think that if someone did that within a year, they'd say, guess what?
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:56.980]   It's a dollar now.
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:57.980]   Just send us a dollar.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:58.980]   We'll give you the phone.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.220]   We're sending our-- we're building our own spaceship campus with all the money we're
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.620]   making just from affiliate purchases off of apps.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.620]   I mean, the big problem there is that Google still doesn't offer affiliate revenue for
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:08.620]   Google Play.
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.980]   And Apple's done it since the beginning.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:14.300]   Google still doesn't do it, which-- you know, be nice.
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.900]   By the way, if you want to see the other graph, this is really-- this is the telling graph.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:27.180]   So the graph of worldwide app downloads by store Q3 2017.
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.740]   Green is a Google Play, you know, a lot bigger, right?
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.460]   But then look at revenue.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.460]   Whoops, flips completely.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.460]   Nesting the case.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.460]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.460]   Forever.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:45.340]   Gross consumers spend by store 90% greater for iPhone in Q3 2016, 95% greater for iPhone
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.340]   in Q3 2016.
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.020]   How much of that is Clash of Clans expansion pack?
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.340]   Well, or, you know, Simpsons donuts or--
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.340]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.340]   --gills on our points.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.340]   I don't know if it includes the--
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:56.340]   IAP economy.
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:57.340]   --in app purchases, it must, right?
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.460]   I think it has to because so much of the economy has moved to the in app purchases.
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:01.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:02.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:05.380]   All the top selling-- all the top revenue games, apps are games with in app purchases.
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.860]   So yeah, I mean, that's really become the model where you download almost everything
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:13.540]   now for free and then you upgrade it to whatever version I even was getting omni-graffle.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.460]   And then you download it for free and then it says, do you want to unlock the pro version
[00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.420]   or do you want to unlock the--
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.100]   Wasn't there a big article about the new upcoming Star Wars game where they had to
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.900]   completely redesign it because they didn't put in the way for you to give them micro-payments?
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:29.900]   It was like a single-player experience and people weren't going to spend money on it.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:32.900]   So they had to redesign the whole thing to have micro-payments.
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:34.420]   How about this one?
[00:48:34.420 --> 00:48:35.420]   This is depressing.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.500]   Worldwide, total time spent in apps.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.700]   Remember, this is for a three month period.
[00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.100]   325 billion hours.
[00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.100]   Wow.
[00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.460]   John, you and I, probably half of that playing field runners attack alone.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.460]   We could have--
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:49.460]   We could have killed this.
[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:50.460]   I don't want to attack.
[00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:52.740]   We're not going to use the phone for you guys.
[00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:57.380]   We blame Alex Lindsay because he said he told us with Phil where his attack came out.
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.420]   John immediately downloaded and started playing.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:01.860]   I did shortly thereafter and he won't play it.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:06.060]   It's because the only time I play field runners is when I'm taking off on a plane, which I
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.900]   do often play field runners.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.780]   That is really the bane of the app store.
[00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:13.700]   That in-app purchases one, you must be online as two.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:14.700]   Very frustrating.
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:17.100]   Yeah, and I'm still on level two.
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.620]   On maze two.
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:20.620]   Really?
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.340]   Well, no, I've got-- I beat them all.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:23.940]   I'm trying to get 2 million on each one.
[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:24.940]   Oh my god.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.940]   It's kind of slowly worked my way.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:29.500]   And I got to tell you, in level two, it's really hard because it's one of those ones
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:38.420]   that is a rush and getting over 1.7 is taking me four months.
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.500]   Now, Apple every day has an app of the day.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.780]   In fact, this was a new feature in the new app store.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:48.420]   They had an app of the week before that, but app of the day is new.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:49.420]   Is it free?
[00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:50.420]   No.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:51.420]   I mean, sometimes they're free apps.
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.420]   Sometimes they're paid apps.
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.900]   But it's not a guarantee that it'll be free.
[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.020]   Because that's what Amazon did with its app of the day.
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.500]   They kind of strong armed app developers to give it away.
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.500]   They just didn't tell them.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:00.500]   They just came.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:01.500]   They're here.
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:02.500]   It's free.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.500]   Good.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.220]   So this is just a feature.
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:15.220]   Being featured in the app store boosts downloads by 1,470-- a lot.
[00:50:15.220 --> 00:50:18.300]   1,747%.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:22.020]   Games a little less about half that.
[00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:24.620]   But it's a big deal.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.620]   Getting that--
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:26.860]   I was talking about the app of the day thing.
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:31.140]   I was talking to the developer, and I guess they got--
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:32.140]   App to the day?
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.140]   --app of the day.
[00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:36.620]   And it was a quarter of my dollars in the day of orders.
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.620]   Makes it jealous.
[00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:38.620]   It was just--
[00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:39.620]   Makes you a year.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.580]   Thank God they don't do that with podcasts.
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:43.580]   Because we--
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.140]   We just did my major life.
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.580]   --have been believed to have a photo tense.
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:51.300]   So the app of the day to day is Lego Life.
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:53.260]   The game of-- so they do an app in a game.
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:56.820]   And the game of the day, which is a fun one, which I've played, does not commute.
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.820]   So it's not always just new stuff.
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:50:59.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.820]   Drive safely.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:01.820]   They're doing a great job.
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.460]   The whole editorial team is ACEs there.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:12.540]   That's all really been-- be-- big-- bigly upgraded in the newest app store on iOS 11.
[00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:13.540]   I really like it.
[00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:14.540]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:15.540]   Behind the scenes.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:17.620]   Well, before, I mean, the biggest thing they did was like they would make the list
[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:18.900]   and maybe write a blurb.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.140]   And now they're essentially publishing a mini magazine every day.
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:23.020]   And oh, this is like flip board, right?
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:24.020]   Yeah.
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:25.020]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:26.020]   I love this.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.020]   --and tips and tricks.
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:28.020]   They're smart.
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:31.060]   Although they really are-- oops, I'm sorry.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:32.060]   It's so bright.
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.140]   Let me turn my brightness down just a little bit.
[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:38.180]   They really are giving somebody a big ass plug.
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.660]   I mean, that's amazing.
[00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.020]   And they're competing with websites.
[00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.540]   I mean, no hard feelings there.
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.540]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:48.140]   App of the day from yesterday was Hopster.
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.860]   Game of the day was Polybridge.
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.100]   So I notice I see this a lot.
[00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:55.940]   I mean, usually when I go to the app store, I'm going right to updates, right?
[00:51:55.940 --> 00:52:00.180]   But I notice I see this front page almost every day, probably.
[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:01.980]   And they're coming out.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:09.820]   They have a lot of-- on top of that, I'm glad to see another intrusion of the new--
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:14.540]   Apple made a simple tweak to iOS by simply saying, what if we have a heavy font that
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:19.220]   can actually represent stuff that gives certain parts of the experience a little bit more emphasis
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:20.220]   than the rest?
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.780]   And I think that's really transformed iOS.
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:25.060]   We're certainly seeing that in other parts of the mainstream iOS when you're seeing people
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.820]   here using the regular text renderer.
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:32.580]   So I hate to say that this is my big excitement about the new app store.
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:37.980]   But it's like, I'm glad to see apps that really have that extra level of polish that really
[00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:43.540]   see that Apple is trying to move iOS forward in the interface as opposed to saying, eh,
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:44.540]   we got it right three years ago.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.540]   It's good enough.
[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.540]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:50.540]   So the thing that I like to is that the app store was primarily becoming a sideways-- like
[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:54.420]   people would see a link on the web or from their friends or in social and just go to
[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.420]   an app and download it.
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:57.100]   And it wasn't really a destination.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:52:58.100]   And now they've made it.
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.220]   Like if you're bored and you just want to new app and you want to see something, they've
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.260]   made it a place to go every day again.
[00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.260]   All right.
[00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.180]   So today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.420]   Are you looking for work?
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:08.260]   Go to zipprecruiter.com to apply.

[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.660]   ZipRecruiter is amazing.

[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:32.540]   That means you're getting your job listing to the broadest possible audience.
[00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:36.340]   That means your chance of finding the perfect person is that much better.
[00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.300]   In fact, I think we can say you've got an opening.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.540]   There's probably a perfect person for that job just waiting, looking for work right now.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:45.060]   But you've got to get to them.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:50.540]   ZipRecruiter is great for filling a position in any industry anywhere in the country.
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.860]   Are you in need of great talent for your business?
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.340]   Especially if you're short on time, you're short-handed.
[00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.340]   I know you are.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:57.340]   You're hiring.
[00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.020]   You don't have to get lost in a huge stack of resumes to find your perfect hire.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.820]   You just need smarter tools.
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.700]   ZipRecruiter is as smart as it gets.
[00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:09.340]   You post your job to 100 job boards with one click, but-- and this is really important.
[00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.820]   You're not going to get a million applications into your inbox or a million phone calls at
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:13.820]   your desk.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:18.980]   All the applicants roll into the ZipRecruiter interface, which makes it so easy for you
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:21.500]   to screen, rate, and hire the right person fast.
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:26.100]   You can use screen questions to eliminate people that you just know you don't want.
[00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:32.260]   And ZipRecruiter puts a smart matching technology to work actively notifying qualified candidates.
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:36.860]   They have millions of resumes themselves about your job within minutes of posting.
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:39.020]   So you're going to get the best possible matches.

[00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.060]   That's why ZipRecruiter is different.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:52.260]   Unlike those other guys, ZipRecruiter doesn't depend on the right candidates finding you.
[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:55.420]   It finds them.

[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:22.340]   Apple is hiring a former Amazon studio.
[00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:26.180]   I hope it's not the guy I got fired for sexual harassment.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:28.260]   No, this is somebody else.
[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:35.580]   Morgan Waddell will take the role of lead international creative development for a worldwide
[00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:37.580]   video at Apple.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:42.660]   So he's reporting to the two Sony execs who now lead their programming efforts.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.660]   There's no question they're putting money into this.
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.620]   Do you remember that episode where West Wing went to Hollywood and they kept offering people
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:48.620]   deals for what?
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:49.620]   For development.
[00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:50.620]   What I do?
[00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:51.620]   You develop.
[00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:52.620]   Do I do anything?
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:53.620]   No, you develop.
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:54.620]   Shepherd projects for development.
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:55.620]   You develop.
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:56.620]   You're a developer.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:57.820]   He worked on Sneaky Pete.
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:03.100]   He's also worked on The Man in the High Castle, Goliath, Jack Ryan, the Marvelous, Mrs. Maisel.
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.740]   You know, I have to say one of the problems Amazon is having is they're having a hard
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:09.820]   time finding a successor to Transparent.
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:12.500]   A lot of these Amazon originals.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:15.500]   Not real inspiring, including Sneaky Pete.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:18.860]   From what I've heard it's getting harder and harder because a lot of the really.
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:19.860]   There's competition.
[00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:20.860]   There's competition.
[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:21.860]   There's competition.
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:22.860]   There's competition.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:26.040]   There's all getting snapped up on there and the money that they're making now is astronomical.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.580]   There's never been more competition.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.780]   I mean, we are definitely in the golden age of content.
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:31.780]   You know, from all of them.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:36.020]   I think all the Netflix Marvel stuff is that we didn't, the Joss Whedon team are all doing
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:41.340]   knows that the Steve McKnight's and we've got a lot of talent there.
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:42.340]   We didn't sell it.
[00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.340]   Also Bulletproof.
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:44.340]   How so?
[00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:49.740]   No, well, it's nice to be making a series where they know that they're going to you're
[00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.420]   going to get to make the 12 episodes you're contracted for.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:57.460]   And also, if everybody hates it, well, that's okay because you might still get signed for
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:59.460]   next season.
[00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:04.380]   How many shows, like even Marvel shows have we looked at that are like on streaming that
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:09.180]   really tanking and they still get renewed because it's all about it.
[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:13.060]   A, it's all about inventory and B, you're working for a company that is not posting a
[00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:14.060]   profit yet.
[00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:15.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.060 --> 00:57:16.060]   So.
[00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:17.060]   But you know who's really coming on strong?
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:21.460]   In fact, they just announced they're going to spend $8 billion this year's Netflix.
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:25.580]   And they also said half of our content is going to be original content.
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:27.540]   So there's they're the ones who have the.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:28.540]   It's good.
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:29.540]   Let me just wrap it up.
[00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:30.540]   People like this.
[00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:36.780]   They're coming and I think that they they are basically doing HBO but more aggressively
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:37.780]   than HBO.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.220]   You know, they they are.
[00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.820]   And their issue is is that they have to cater to everyone.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:45.980]   So if you look at the kind of content they're making, it's not just big films and it's not
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:47.220]   just House of Cards.
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:49.340]   It's the chef's table.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:50.940]   It's documentaries.
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:54.860]   It's you know, foreign films because they're looking at and and the thing is is that they
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:58:00.420]   are positioned and so on Amazon, some degree, but Netflix more than anyone else is positioned
[00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:04.740]   to know exactly what their audience wants because they have all of their viewing history.
[00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:09.380]   So they're able to say, this is the kind of show that if we that if we build that, you
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:12.380]   know, we know that there's a pretty good chance that they will come.
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.060]   Also, it's great to have this inventory based idea of production where it doesn't matter
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.580]   how this how this does in the first season.
[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:23.620]   So long as it's a nice addition to this big block of content we've got.
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:27.820]   I got to tell you, if nothing else, these streaming services are a real shot in the
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:32.860]   car for just the documentary format where there's it's it's not as though you're guaranteed
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:36.860]   if you make a good documentary, you can sell it to one of the streaming services, but there's
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.900]   a better chance before back when it's like, maybe we'll get into Sundance, maybe we'll
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:45.100]   get some limited distribution, maybe we will be able to sell it to PBS.
[00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:50.780]   It's now well, if we get will have its main life on Netflix or on Hulu, they will buy
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:54.380]   things like the Barkley Marathon's, which isn't which is a wonderful documentary, but
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.380]   it's not really mass appeal.
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:59.460]   It doesn't have that hook of a super size me or something like that.
[00:58:59.460 --> 00:59:02.740]   But again, it will be out there and it'll be out there for at least a couple of years.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:06.340]   So that's such a beautiful, beautiful thing that it's doing.
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:11.340]   Anybody got a firewire cable?
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:12.340]   Firewire?
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:15.020]   Because I have the birthday boy.
[00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.140]   Sixteen years ago yesterday, the iPod was introduced.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.460]   A thousand songs is pretty heavy, isn't it?
[00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:21.940]   A thousand songs in your pocket.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.020]   You have the mechanical.
[00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:24.020]   I missed the mechanical.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.380]   The mechanical click wheel.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:30.740]   It had a five gigabyte, five gigabytes.
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:32.540]   I have more ram than that.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:38.980]   Five gigabyte, one point in in charge drive, capable of holding a thousand songs.
[00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:40.820]   You want to see the first iPod commercial?
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.460]   I want to see it again.
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:44.620]   Let's relive this memory.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:51.620]   I don't know what that was.
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:57.660]   I missed the dancing out loans.
[00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.900]   They look so happy.
[00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:06.140]   Is this Jeff Goldlem or just a Jeff Goldlem look-a-like?
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:11.980]   Oh my God.
[01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:12.980]   Is that a...
[01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.140]   Oh, it's going to get up and walk away?
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:21.460]   Incredible and even sounds better, doesn't it?
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:26.140]   So, it is all music.
[01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:31.540]   So, those of you listening probably don't get this fabulous guy who was sitting in the
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:36.100]   music on his computer and has now put his iPod on, his headphones, his jacket, and he's
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.740]   moon walking out the door.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:45.300]   It's pretty fly for a Mac guy.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.300]   A thousand songs in your pocket.
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.300]   Wow.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.300]   Karaman.
[01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:50.300]   Remember Karaman?
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:51.300]   Not a long time.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.300]   That's a long time.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.300]   I didn't get to go to this event.
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:54.300]   I was working at this site, but Jim Lotta back with...
[01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:55.300]   I was doing a lot of great stuff lately.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.300]   I was remembering this wasn't too far after an incredibly stunning upgrade to the internet.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:05.300]   So, I didn't get to go to this event.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:11.300]   I was working at this site, but Jim Lotta back with it.
[01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:18.300]   I was remembering this wasn't too far after an incredibly stunning upgrade to the internet.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.300]   An incredibly stunning upgrade to Mac.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:25.100]   Oh, I was getting rave reviews for it from a lot of you folks in this room.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:28.300]   We updated our whole portable line last week, our power books and our iBooks.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.300]   A lot of things going on.
[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.300]   It's all subdued.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:36.300]   And we lured you here today with the promise of unveiling a breakthrough digital device
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.300]   that's not a Mac.
[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.300]   And that's exactly what we're going to do.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.300]   It's still a little company when they do this.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:44.300]   So, let's start with Digital Hub.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:49.300]   This is a strategy that we announced in January of this year, about nine months ago.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:52.300]   I remembered this was a couple months after an 11 months.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.300]   Is that common?
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.300]   Oh, that's probably...
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:55.300]   No, it's like tech.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:56.300]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:57.300]   That's our chalkboard.
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:58.300]   Yeah, that's why he's so subdued.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.300]   You're right.
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.300]   In other words, we're January...
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.300]   2000.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.300]   We're being surrounded by these amazing digital devices.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.300]   No, no, this was November 10, 2001.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.300]   Oh, okay.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:13.300]   And we think that with the appropriate application software, the Mac can add the new device.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:18.300]   The Mac can add tremendous value to these devices and become an essential part of your life where
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.300]   you can't get along without it.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:23.300]   And that's our digital hub strategy in a nutshell.
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:27.300]   Now, the most important of these devices are, of course, the digital camera, the digital
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.300]   camcorder...
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:30.300]   He's moving so much faster than he did later.
[01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:33.300]   He would take time to let you absorb what he said.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:34.300]   How have we done?
[01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.300]   When he stopped walking around in this...
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:36.300]   Well, we entered the year.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.300]   Also, remember, this is like 100 people, 150 people.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.300]   Right.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.300]   So, you have to be more intimate.
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.300]   But also, one thing that...
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:47.300]   Once you will do a lot of presentations, they learn not to wander around on stage.
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.300]   You walk in post.
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.300]   You walk somewhere and you stay, and it's just for the cameras.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:52.300]   It's just much easier to get close-ups.
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.300]   We are way ahead of everybody else on this, and Apple is now...
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:56.300]   And Apple is probably the best at it.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:00.300]   Video editing supplier in the world, both at the pro and the consumer level.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.300]   We then followed it up in January with...
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.300]   Yeah, I've been thinking about cameras because they didn't stream it.
[01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:07.300]   Incredible hip for them.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.300]   This is for the audience.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.300]   And it just happens.
[01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.300]   They recorded it.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.300]   It's a digital music jukebox player on any platform.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:18.300]   Next, we introduced our superdrive and some of our PowerMac configurations.
[01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:23.300]   And we rolled out I-DVD, and we have now announced I-DVD 2, which will be shipping...
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.300]   Whatever you have about I-DVD.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:26.300]   It's unbelievable.
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.300]   You can make your own DVDs that play...
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.300]   Turned out.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:31.300]   With DVDs.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.300]   DVD player.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.300]   There are now 20 million of in the United States alone.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:40.300]   And it's funny, 16 years ago, and yet this seems really dated.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:44.300]   And lastly, in photography, digital...
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.300]   Well, that is...
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:50.300]   You never want to do the math of when you were a kid, and a movie seemed like an old-timey movie.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:53.300]   Now do the math today.
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:56.300]   Like, "Oh my God, Star Wars Episode 1 was out."
[01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:58.300]   Watch this on the blackboard.
[01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.300]   But we...
[01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.300]   The Honeymooners was on TV.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.300]   All four of them.
[01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.300]   When I and DVD came out, I had a friend who...
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:09.300]   Basically, one of their little cash cows was clients having them print DVDs.
[01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.300]   He's like, "I-movie, I-DVD."
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.300]   I had him a job.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.300]   Yeah, I had him a job.
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.300]   And as you know, you hook your camcorder up to I-movie.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.300]   You import your clips.
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.300]   Where's the iPod coming in?
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:22.300]   Oh my God.
[01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:24.300]   We need a picture of that girl...
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.300]   That baby girl right now.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:27.300]   She's a teenager.
[01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.300]   Alright, let's get to...
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.300]   We're going to skip ahead to the iPod part.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:33.300]   That holds 150 songs.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.300]   You can get them to a dollar a song.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.300]   It's an iPod.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.300]   Or an iPod drive.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.300]   Well, it's really just an iPod.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:45.300]   It holds about a thousand songs and costs about 30 cents a song.
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.300]   So, we looked at this and studied all these.
[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:50.300]   And that's where we want to be.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.300]   That is where we...
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.300]   30 cents a song?
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:57.300]   And we are introducing a product today that takes us exactly there.
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:00.300]   And that product is called iPod.
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:04.300]   I-Mac, I-Book, iPod.
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.300]   What is iPod?
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.300]   Also, note that this is what happens when you're talking to just journalists.
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:10.300]   Yes, no applause.
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.300]   No applause.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:12.300]   No cheers now.
[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.300]   A CD quality music.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.300]   And it plays all of the popular open format.
[01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:17.300]   Yeah, it's chalkboard right?
[01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.300]   Andy, Andy knows his fonts.
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:20.300]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:22.300]   Bitrate, W-A-V and A-I-F.
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.300]   And he's using...
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:24.300]   This was before...
[01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:26.300]   Is it holds the crowd?
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.300]   You know, it came out.
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.300]   But he had a custom...
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.300]   Basically, Keanu was developed for him.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.300]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:33.300]   He didn't like PowerPoint.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:36.300]   So, it was a custom presentation manager which eventually became a product.
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:39.300]   How many times it'd go on the road with a CD player and said, "Oh God, the CD...
[01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.300]   I didn't bring the CD I wanted to listen to."
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:47.300]   To have your whole music library with you at all times is a quantum...
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:51.300]   Do you think the music industry was watching this and thinking, "Oh crap?"
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.300]   Or...
[01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:53.300]   The coolest thing about iPod.
[01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.300]   Not yet.
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.300]   Your entire music library.
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:59.300]   At that point, they'd already lost the idea of...
[01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:03.300]   We will control digital music because no one was buying it.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.300]   They didn't care.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.300]   No one was believing it.
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.300]   And there was no store behind it.
[01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.300]   So, people still had to buy...
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.300]   The IT store was still...
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.300]   But the IT store was there, right?
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.300]   The first one is...
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:15.300]   You're able to buy...
[01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.300]   I think you're able to buy some of that.
[01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.300]   So, we're gonna keep a thousand songs on the iPhone.
[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:18.300]   Anyone to buy some of this?
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:19.300]   I don't think so.
[01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.300]   And it fits in your pocket.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.300]   How do you...
[01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.300]   I think iTunes happened before the iPod.
[01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:23.300]   How do you...
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:24.300]   I'm a P3 player.
[01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:26.300]   So, huge win.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:27.300]   An hour.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.300]   Maybe the coolest thing...
[01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:30.300]   Wait a minute.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.300]   An hour of battery life?
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:36.300]   Not only songs you have with you, if your battery's dead, right?
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:40.300]   So, we have built in an extraordinary battery in the iPod.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.300]   Ten hours.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.300]   Ten hours.
[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.300]   Oh, ten hours.
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:45.300]   And that is ten hours of continuous music.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.300]   Ten hours!
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.300]   I love that ten hours is an interesting number, I think, because that's what they...
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.300]   Of course, that must be their benchmark.
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.300]   That's what the iPad does.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.300]   It's yours.
[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.300]   iTunes store opened in April 20th, 2003.
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:07:00.300]   So, the iPod was one of the things you could drag on to before the...
[01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.300]   That's why the music industry was not worried.
[01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:04.300]   You still had to buy the music from...
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.300]   Maybe the cool...
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:06.300]   Or just pull it after stuff.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.300]   But they were already negotiating, I'm sorry.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:11.300]   It carries all the data from the Mac to iPod.
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.300]   This is an nostalgic point.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:17.300]   I really miss those, like, high contrast, super twist LCD screens.
[01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.300]   I still think they're cool.
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.300]   I see the audience here.
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:22.300]   So, you recognize anybody on the audience?
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.300]   Hey, there's Tim Cook.
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.300]   There's Tim Cook in the front row.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.300]   Dark here.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.300]   No, you're kidding.
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.300]   Really?
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.300]   There he is.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.300]   Let's see.
[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.300]   Wow.
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.300]   There's Tim Cook, you're saying?
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:35.300]   Yep.
[01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.300]   Yep.
[01:07:36.300 --> 01:07:37.300]   Wow.
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.300]   Let's see.
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.300]   I want to see more front row.
[01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.300]   Who's on the very end?
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.300]   This one here?
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.300]   That looks familiar.
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.300]   I can't...
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.300]   See...
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.300]   Can't place him.
[01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:51.300]   Yeah, so these are all the hard things.
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.300]   They're all the executives in the front row.
[01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:55.300]   Well, anyway, that's 16...
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.300]   Jesus, 16...
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.300]   Shooting this with a camcorder.
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:07:59.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.300]   Front row, though.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.300]   Very, very front.
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:03.300]   16 years is not very long.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.300]   And it feels like the dark ages.
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.300]   It's old enough to drive now.
[01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:08.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.300]   The iPod.
[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.300]   Old enough to drive.
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.300]   It's old enough to drink illegally.
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.300]   It's old enough for a fake ID.
[01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.300]   In two years I can drink and give up.
[01:08:15.300 --> 01:08:16.300]   This is cruel.
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.300]   This is mean.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.300]   I don't know who bookmarked this.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.300]   Did you bookmark this, Carsten?
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:25.300]   Marco Arment's review of the iPod from 2006.
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:27.300]   This is the...
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:32.300]   He's not review, but his comments on the idea of a wide screen, full screen, touch screen,
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:35.300]   video iPod, which he poo-poo's completely.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.300]   Right?
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.300]   He got that one perfectly.
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:43.300]   Well, maybe he's being sarcastic.
[01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.300]   Maybe.
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:48.300]   He says at Marco.org we can make better rain than predictions anyone else.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:51.300]   Video isn't the next big thing.
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.300]   Portable video.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.300]   He's joking.
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:55.300]   Hardware can't do it well.
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:57.300]   Touching equals fingerprints.
[01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.300]   Apple isn't in the business of making half-assed products.
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.300]   They're not going to...
[01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:01.300]   It's mean.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.300]   Did you bookmark that?
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:04.300]   That's mean.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.300]   And it was mean to me to bring it up.
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.300]   Marco, there's plenty of things I said like that too.
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:12.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:16.300]   It's also one of the coolest things about Apple is that everything that you...
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:22.300]   When there's a rumor about like Apple's going to do a tablet, everything that you say...
[01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:28.300]   If you get in the business of trying to review something before Apple ships, it's true of all companies,
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:33.300]   but Apple in particular, everything you say will be absolutely true based on the device
[01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:35.300]   you think Apple is going to release.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:42.300]   But then when Apple releases the touchscreen video iPhone and it's actually a phone where a lot of the hardware,
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:48.300]   the point of the touchscreen is to get rid of the clicky buttons that are just taking up space on a palm trio,
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:53.300]   then you realize that, "Okay, if I had heard about this, then I would have agreed with it."
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:56.300]   Or an iPad where it's, "No, it's not going to be like a Windows tablet.
[01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:59.300]   It's not really going to be like a huge iPhone.
[01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.300]   It's going to be something kind of different because it's going to be a new interface to go with it."
[01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:09.300]   So no one should be ashamed about saying something 15 years ago that didn't turn out to be true.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:12.300]   I have powered up my iPod.
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.300]   - And it works? - I don't know.
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.300]   Should I play what's on the other side?
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.300]   What are the thousands on the O'liport's iPod?
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.300]   Is it playing?
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:24.300]   It's not playing.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.300]   Uh-oh.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.300]   It's baby, baby.
[01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:33.300]   Oh, baby, baby.
[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:35.300]   16 years later.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.300]   And that's a spinning drive.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.300]   That's a spinning drive.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.300]   16 kind of amazing.
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:46.300]   Hey, Rubenstein, do a business.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:53.300]   And you can actually, there are instructions online for upgrading it to like a comp, the drive to a compact flash.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:54.300]   It's...
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:58.300]   It sounds good, too.
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:00.300]   I have to say, it doesn't sound bad at all.
[01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:05.300]   That's a magical thing about devices that don't have to check in with the Internet before it does anything.
[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:13.300]   It's like, I bought this, like, NEC mobile Pro 790, like at the MIT flea market.
[01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.300]   Look at that.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:15.300]   That is awesome.
[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:20.300]   This is like years and years and years old, and like you just put a new battery in it and buy, like a...
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:25.300]   And because it's a standard, like, power adapter, you just buy a power adapter for it.
[01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.300]   And I'll be damned.
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:30.300]   I can run Microsoft Word on this tiny, tiny thing with this beautiful keyboard.
[01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.300]   That's kind of impressive.
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:37.300]   That's kind of impressive. Like years and years later, and because it also uses like a standard, like, PCMI,
[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.300]   I could put a compact flashcard in there and actually put that in the...
[01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:46.300]   See, it's like, this is like the post-apocalyptic, like technology we're going to be using.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:50.300]   All this stuff that doesn't mean that the cockroaches of technology.
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:56.300]   But doesn't it make you doubly annoyed that I just want to turn on this light bulb.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:12:01.300]   The fact that it can't connect with the central server means it's going to make me do that
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:04.300]   and register and revalidate before it lets me turn on this light bulb.
[01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.300]   Yep.
[01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:09.300]   All right. Hey, I'm pretty impressed this thing still works.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:12.300]   It's even in stereo.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.300]   High evired.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.300]   Not mono.
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:18.300]   Yeah, you hear that lovely game show host?
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.300]   Yeah, it's stereo.
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.300]   All right.
[01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:25.300]   ♪ Love and plastic ♪
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.300]   That's a good song. I forgot about that.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:31.300]   Listen, listen, I fired up my...
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:37.300]   My new message pad 100 still works and whenever I fire it up, it's like frozen and amber.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.300]   All my contacts, all my notes, all the ideas I've had.
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.300]   Wouldn't I have contacts on here?
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.300]   No, maybe not.
[01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:45.300]   Klondike 557.
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.300]   Yeah, Klondike.
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:49.300]   No, no, no. There's extras.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:51.300]   Oh, wait a minute. I do have contacts.
[01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.300]   Oh, look at this.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.300]   My contacts are on here as well.
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:56.300]   All those people that you...
[01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:59.300]   They're all tech TV producers and so forth.
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.300]   People I work with.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.300]   Finally get back to them.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.300]   Wow.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:05.300]   Apple PR Hotline. I haven't called that in a while.
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.300]   That's fun.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.300]   Email Guy Kawasaki at the evangelist.
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:16.300]   New York City is going to start using Apple Pay on the subway.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:17.300]   What?
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:18.300]   Goodness.
[01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:22.300]   Well, these Metro cards are going to be replaced with electronic card readers.
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:26.300]   Does that mean that I can use my Apple watch to get on the subway?
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:29.300]   People say it's fantastic in England with the Oyster cards.
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.300]   I like the Oyster cards a lot.
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:35.300]   In Boston we have the Charlie card, which is the same technology.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:38.300]   The ability to simply, it never fails.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:40.300]   You just tap it and go swiping.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.300]   So nice.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:44.300]   Is it Apple Pay to get the card or is it just your phone to get in?
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.300]   Well, they say they're going to replace it with NFC.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:48.300]   Contactless payments.
[01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:49.300]   Yeah.
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.300]   Yeah.
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.300]   So contactless credit and debit cards that have an embedded NFC chip.
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.300]   Oh man.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.300]   Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay will all work with a new system.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.300]   That is yay.
[01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.300]   So, yeah.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.300]   But I'm still going to...
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.300]   In New York City I'm still going to use the card for...
[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.300]   I want tokens.
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:10.300]   Well, no, because it's like, okay, well, here I am in a New York City subway at 1am.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.300]   I'm just going to take out my $1,000 iPhone.
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:13.300]   I'm going to fuck it.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:14.300]   I hold it like this.
[01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:15.300]   It's your watch.
[01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:16.300]   It's your watch.
[01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:17.300]   It's your watch.
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:18.300]   It's your watch.
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:23.580]   It's not as though I'm a milk toast who someone could take it from my hand and run away much
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.300]   faster than I could chase them.
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:26.300]   This is so fascinating.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:29.300]   This is great in the turning styles for people to pull out their phone.
[01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.300]   Say thank you.
[01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.300]   Thank you.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:33.300]   Thank you.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.300]   All right.
[01:14:34.300 --> 01:14:35.300]   Let's take a break.
[01:14:35.300 --> 01:14:36.300]   Get your picks ready, folks.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.300]   I got my pick.
[01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:39.300]   I haven't even used it yet.
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:41.300]   I'm going to open it for my pick.
[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:44.300]   Our show today brought to you by Eero.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.300]   Now, this is a pick.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.300]   I love our Eero system at home.
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.300]   Enterprise Grade Wi-Fi.
[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:56.020]   Upgrading your home no matter how big, no matter how poor your Wi-Fi has been, Eero is going
[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.020]   to turn it around.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:15:00.100]   You download the Eero app on your iOS or Android device.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.940]   Walk through the setup process.
[01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:05.380]   It's quick and easy, and these new Eros are amazing.
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:09.140]   This Eero started in early 2016.
[01:15:09.140 --> 01:15:15.500]   One of the things Eero has done is they have learned from the hundreds of thousands of
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:20.060]   users so they get smarter all the time.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.220]   Faster, more reliable.
[01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:26.380]   They learn what devices need, what kind of speed, what frequencies.
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:31.140]   This new second generation Eero, and I've installed, it's so fantastic.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:37.620]   You've got a new base station that is Tri-Band, and it's about twice as fast.
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:41.500]   The Eero beacon will allow a customer to build a Wi-Fi system that's more perfectly tailored
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:42.500]   to your home than ever before.
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:44.100]   You just plug it into an outlet.
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:47.620]   It also is a night light, so I put it in the halls and it's great.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:52.620]   More speed, more range, still the same high quality, elegant design.
[01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:59.620]   With the third 5 GHz radio, the second generation Eros Tri-Band, and twice as fast as its predecessor.
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:03.780]   Now, I know one thing people are thinking about when I talk Wi-Fi is crack.
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:08.100]   So crack Wi-Fi vulnerability, and this is why you want Eero.
[01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:13.900]   Within 24 hours of the reveal of the Wi-Fi vulnerability, Eero automatically pushed out
[01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:18.940]   a fix to all their customers within one day.
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:22.580]   You didn't have to do anything, unlike other Wi-Fi systems where you have to see if there's
[01:16:22.580 --> 01:16:27.740]   new firmware and download it and update, it happened instantly.
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:34.220]   An incredibly fast response time sets Eero apart from everybody else.
[01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:40.740]   I should mention crack doesn't affect base stations, but because Eero has these extra
[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:43.100]   beacons, they connect the base stations.
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:47.540]   So any mesh system that connects back to a base station is vulnerable to crack.
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:49.700]   That's why Eero pushed a fix so fast.
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.420]   Bravo Eero.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:54.500]   E-E-R-O dot com.
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.940]   By the way, they also have a new thread radio in there, which means they can connect low
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:03.500]   power devices for IoT, like locks and doorbells and sensors.
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:05.540]   And you can add as many Eero beacons as you need.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:10.420]   It's about 1500 square foot per Eero unit, so we have a 4000 square foot house.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.500]   Three of them is all we need, but as you get bigger or more complex or you have an upstairs
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.220]   downstairs, it's easy to extend it.
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:21.340]   Free overnight shipping to the US and Canada when you use our offer code MACBRAKE, just go
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:23.980]   to Eero, E-E-R-O dot com.
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:24.980]   Check the system you want.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:29.980]   I would just start with the base station plus two beacons.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.180]   That's enough for almost every home.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:37.500]   And then check out, select overnight shipping and use the promo code MACBRAKE and that'll
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.900]   remove the cost of overnight shipping.
[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:41.580]   Eero E-E-R-O dot com.
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:45.380]   I am so thrilled that we are partnered with Eero.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:50.860]   I use Eero at home and the knowledge that they patch that instantly within 24 hours
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.300]   just makes me feel really good.
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.300]   Eero dot com.
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:59.860]   Don't forget the MACBRAKE offer code to get free overnight shipping.
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.900]   That's why you want an Eero folks.
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.540]   Alex, we see you so rarely.
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:06.980]   I think I'm going to let you start off with your pick of the week because it's always
[01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.340]   something I want to spend money on and I don't want to spend all my money before I get to
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:11.340]   you.
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:12.340]   So I do a lot of diagrams.
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.940]   I have to make lots and lots of diagrams.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.740]   Wiring diagrams, flow diagrams.
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:20.380]   I've spent the last couple of days in the middle of it.
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:24.100]   I just downloaded the new Omni Grafel and it's just great.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:25.260]   So I'm recommending it.
[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:27.740]   Omni Grafel 7 or 7.5.
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.820]   We love these guys at the Omni Group.
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:33.420]   It's just really well done.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:36.340]   The 7 is a big jump from the last version I was using.
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:40.460]   I just wasn't paying much attention until it was crashing in High Sierra.
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:41.460]   So then I got 7.
[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.180]   This is High Sierra compatible.
[01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:44.180]   It's easy to order.
[01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:47.420]   I ordered, yeah, this one's High Sierra compatible.
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:48.420]   It was great.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.540]   It's an app store, downloaded it, upgraded it.
[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:52.140]   It even has the upgrade built into it.
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:55.300]   So I was able to upgrade it really easily in the app store.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:57.420]   And the whole probably get pro, right?
[01:18:57.420 --> 01:18:58.500]   I have pro, yeah.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.500]   That's one of the nine.
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:00.500]   And then standard is 100.
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:04.260]   Yeah, if you already have one in the upgrades, then the new tools, and I don't know when
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:08.420]   they add these, but they're new for me, is being able to really go in and edit all of
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:12.700]   the EPS files and be able to select a lot of those bits and pieces that you couldn't
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:13.700]   do before.
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.140]   It used to be just kind of dropping images in.
[01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:20.420]   And it's just a really smooth way to do this.
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:23.820]   And if you're building any kind of-- again, for me, it's mostly signal flow.
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:30.380]   So it's thousands of lines that are all saying where all the stuff's going to go.
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.980]   It's just so much easier.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.340]   I've tried a lot of other things.
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:40.020]   We tried to find a cross platform one because a lot of the folks in the company have PCs.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.420]   But I just couldn't do it.
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:45.740]   I was like, you know, I just couldn't find one that was as smooth as easy.
[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:48.340]   And I was like, my time is valuable to me.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.340]   You get used to this.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:52.740]   And it's really hard to go back also to just using key note to do these because when you
[01:19:52.740 --> 01:19:56.460]   connect all those little boxes, all that is magnet-- there's little magnets there.
[01:19:56.460 --> 01:19:59.340]   And so you can move-- you can keep on playing around with your graph.
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:03.500]   And you're not moving all your arrows again and putting them all together.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:08.900]   And it's just-- anyway, it's a great app that I spend, unfortunately, a lot.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:12.100]   Not unfortunately, but I-- but is it nice because you get these great--
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.300]   They don't take a photo shop and stuff like that, but no, I spent a lot of time in this.
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:18.100]   But the diagrams-- I wish I could show you them, but they're all NDA.
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:21.940]   But they're-- but they're-- but they're great.
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:23.500]   What are you building nuclear power plants?
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:24.500]   What are you building?
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:25.500]   Not nuclear power plants.
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.900]   No, it's just-- they're all for jobs.
[01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:30.060]   And you use the Mac version, not the iOS.
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:31.420]   Have you tried the iOS?
[01:20:31.420 --> 01:20:32.420]   I've had trouble.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.140]   I haven't used the iOS version recently.
[01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:37.700]   I had a lot of trouble with what I needed to do it.
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.620]   It's pretty precise.
[01:20:39.620 --> 01:20:41.180]   And I-- so you just have to connect--
[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:43.020]   Maybe better to do it on the desktop.
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.580]   I found it easier to do on the desktop.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:48.820]   But I think the iOS version-- I'll probably download it again and try it again.
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:53.820]   But I wasn't able to-- I wasn't as successful with their first couple versions.
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.820]   And so I stuck with the-- with the desktop version.
[01:20:56.820 --> 01:20:59.820]   Nice.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:03.580]   I haven't asked you if you upgraded to the new Lightroom.
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:04.580]   I have it.
[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:05.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:08.580]   So I haven't-- I haven't made the new kit.
[01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.340]   I have mixed feelings.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:13.700]   I'm not-- I mean, it's like a different program.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:16.140]   But-- and I have a classic.
[01:21:16.140 --> 01:21:18.500]   So I'm going to keep that line around.
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:23.860]   But I'm not convinced as I slowly discover-- for a while, I can-- I said, where's the histogram?
[01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:25.300]   But there is a-- it's hidden.
[01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:26.940]   And there's a way to make that come back.
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:29.420]   And it might be all right.
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.540]   I think in a lot of ways they're revving the code base.
[01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:32.780]   I mean, they need it too.
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:33.780]   You have to do it.
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.420]   From a performance perspective, it's just--
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:36.420]   Oh.
[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.260]   And the performance is much better now.
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.260]   Right.
[01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:40.260]   Even on classic, it's better.
[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.260]   So--
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:46.460]   But I have a feeling this is an opportunity, well, for companies like Mac Fun, I know they're
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:47.460]   doing a digital asset.
[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:48.460]   I was going to say again.
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:49.460]   Yeah.
[01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:51.780]   So is it the photo serif?
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.940]   Right.
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:56.580]   It seems as though Adobe was-- was looking at what was happening with a lot of these
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.500]   Mac fun apps and saying, man, that's an interesting way to the interface.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.300]   Maybe we should think about doing that.
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:03.580]   It's time-- and I got to say, I don't-- I don't like--
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:08.260]   I don't like it when I get an email from a company that makes a product, a piece of software
[01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:10.500]   that I rely on, says, good news.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.980]   We're revolutionarily changing this thing you rely on.
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:17.820]   On the other hand, but the only thing that's scarier than that is, don't worry.
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:20.100]   We haven't changed a thing for three or four years.
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:23.180]   Nothing has changed.
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:25.500]   We've do bug fixes about once every 18 months.
[01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.580]   But we're not doing anything with this app whatsoever.
[01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:29.580]   So that's like--
[01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:30.580]   And I think that--
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.580]   What's Chuck Retires that this product is history?
[01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:38.540]   I think that one of the things that they did write that I think Apple didn't do right
[01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:43.420]   was the Apple one, they released Final Cut 10.
[01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:46.900]   They took seven away, which is what made everybody so upset.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:49.060]   In this way, they said, well, we're going-- this is the future.
[01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:52.860]   You guys can look at it, but we're not taking away the thing you're using every day just
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:53.860]   yet.
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:56.660]   We're going to let you decide when you're going to go over.
[01:22:56.660 --> 01:23:00.660]   I'm going to be-- I've been waiting for this moment.
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:04.020]   You can buy Luminar, which is Mac Fun's kind of Lightroom.
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:05.020]   Right.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.060]   Equivalent for a lot less money.
[01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:08.660]   It's a standalone.
[01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:11.860]   You put it on there and you don't subscribe.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.180]   $69.
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:18.060]   And if they add digital asset management at a reasonable price, which I'm sure they will,
[01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:23.100]   this-- it's not that I don't like the new-- I'm not completely rejecting the new Lightroom,
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:26.220]   but it's just-- at this point--
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:29.460]   this is the inflection point where you might want to make the change.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.540]   Well, this-- which does affinity photos--
[01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:33.460]   That's a great native experience.
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:38.300]   Can I also say that this is a risk that any company takes when they do something this
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:39.540]   revolutionary?
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.740]   Because I think any consumer, once you've been told that we're making this-- we're making
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:47.740]   such a huge change to this piece of hardware or to this piece of software that you're going
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:50.740]   to have to relearn-- you're going to have to learn a lot of new stuff.
[01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:53.980]   That's a really great time for anyone to say, well, if I'm going to learn a lot of new stuff
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:24:00.060]   anyway, let me take a step back, look at all the alternatives because maybe I should be
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:03.740]   learning new skills with a different app that I haven't been aware of over the past three
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.980]   or four years is going to do a much better job for me.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:10.100]   On the other hand, the integration with the iPad with Lightroom on the iPad--
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.100]   Yeah, that's what's getting me.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:14.100]   That kind of sells it a little bit, right?
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:20.020]   I don't use the existing-- the previous Lightroom integrates with Lightroom Mobile very well,
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.340]   but I haven't really been using it because it feels like two separate experiences.
[01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:26.780]   I'm never really-- I'm not convinced I need it and I'm not really confident about how
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:28.380]   well it works together.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:32.540]   This one, part of the effect of how they're redesigning this is to say, no, no, no, it's
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:33.540]   all one app.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:34.540]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.020]   You're going to-- it's all going to be one experience.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:41.140]   And if you have an iPad Pro, you may as well be-- you may as well remain on your sofa and
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:45.140]   do your edits with the Apple Pencil, then get up and going to the office because we're
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:50.700]   not-- we're destroying the idea that this is a lesser version of the desktop experience.
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:51.700]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.700]   I'll give them some trust here.
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:58.740]   Did you download the update to Photoshop, Leo?
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:00.980]   Well, not yet why.
[01:25:00.980 --> 01:25:01.980]   Is that a big--
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.340]   So it has support for HE for HE for HE.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:05.740]   Oh, it does have support for HE for HE.
[01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:06.740]   And for depth maps.
[01:25:06.740 --> 01:25:10.820]   And you can even edit the depth map as a channel so you can go in and touch it up if
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:12.300]   you're not happy with it or change it.
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:14.220]   And then you still preserve all that depth data.
[01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:15.220]   Interesting.
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.220]   It's just kind of cool.
[01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:17.660]   Yeah, I mean, you're right, Andy.
[01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:23.700]   I mean, I'm looking at-- this is the iPad version of this now, which is exactly the
[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:26.180]   same interfaces on the desktop.
[01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:28.500]   And so you've got all the sliders.
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.620]   And it's round trippable.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:33.260]   So any changes I make here go to the desktop and vice versa.
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:38.420]   And even though iPads don't handle raw, somehow they're doing some sort of magic.
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:39.420]   They should be able to.
[01:25:39.420 --> 01:25:40.420]   No, they do.
[01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:41.420]   They do.
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   OK.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:43.420]   They do raw.
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:44.420]   So this is the raw version of the file, I wonder.
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:46.420]   It might be given you a few of you.
[01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:47.420]   That's not raw.
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:48.420]   It's a big thing.
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.740]   The iPhone version shoots raw, as a matter of fact.
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:55.700]   Yeah, but there was no-- so what the right room really is--
[01:25:55.700 --> 01:25:56.700]   But it's-- but it's--
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:57.700]   But it's because it's a Adobe camera.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:02.860]   --with a wrapper around it written in Lua to give it a database and some features.
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:06.140]   But it was ACR that really is what Lightroom is all about.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:07.380]   It doesn't use Apple Camera Raw.
[01:26:07.380 --> 01:26:08.380]   It uses Adobe--
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:11.700]   No, but it should give you the raw photo and then give you a JPEG preview and apply the
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:15.660]   Delta changes retroact like back and forth between your files, I think.
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:18.900]   Well, it can't use Adobe Camera Raw on the iPads.
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:19.900]   No.
[01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:20.900]   So it's probably keeps out on the server.
[01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:21.900]   My suspicion is--
[01:26:21.900 --> 01:26:22.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:27.780]   What's happening is rendering a JPEG on the server on the desktop and then you're getting
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:33.580]   a JPEG which you're modifying and it's saving edits as a separate EDL kind of file which
[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:37.460]   it then applies to the raw when you get back when you're around to your back.
[01:26:37.460 --> 01:26:39.060]   Something like that.
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:42.860]   But that's not a bad-- it means you can do a lot of the work you're right sitting down
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:43.860]   using your app.
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:44.860]   And it's probably much faster.
[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:45.860]   Oh, much.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:46.860]   On mobile.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:48.860]   Much.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.020]   I mean, I went out and bought a program just because I couldn't handle Ross fast enough
[01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:54.020]   on the PC or the Mac.
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:56.020]   So it's going to be interesting.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.020]   We'll watch and see.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:02.500]   It's definitely a new world we live in.
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:05.940]   Yeah, Pruitt is in our chat room and I'll have to ask him what he thinks he's been playing
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:06.940]   with it.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:09.300]   He was at Adobe Macs and he says, "Yeah, a lot faster."
[01:27:09.300 --> 01:27:12.060]   Andy Enoco, your pick of the week?
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:17.300]   My pick of the week is a really cool image processing filter or whatever piece of software
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.460]   called Primitive.
[01:27:18.460 --> 01:27:21.900]   It is-- it's also a really great song by the cramps.
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:25.340]   So if you want to look at that, that's also one of my favorite songs.
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:29.940]   But what it is is it will take your photo and it will use it will algorithmally try
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:35.020]   to recreate it using just graphic primitives, just graphics shapes.
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:37.580]   And the effects are really, really interesting.
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:40.260]   Ooh, look, here's a picture of somebody we know.
[01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.260]   There it goes.
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:43.140]   I was playing with it over and over again.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:46.860]   As soon as I found out about it, I was up for another like two hours playing with it.
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:50.980]   And you can choose-- it's great because it gives you all kinds of control over how it
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:52.260]   will process the image.
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:57.340]   So you can choose, like, just use ovals and just make build this out of-- stop after you've
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:27:58.940]   drawn 100 ovals.
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.940]   And it's not-- it's doing it intelligently.
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:03.580]   It's not just using here is an area of gray.
[01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:07.740]   I will sort of pixelate it and then sort of approximate it is if you choose ovals, it
[01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:12.900]   will look for things that are areas that are kind of oval-ish, like the brim of my hat.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:15.020]   It will try to fill that with an oval.
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:20.300]   And so if you have a picket fence, it will do not quite as good a job with that.
[01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:25.460]   But if you had chosen, give me rectangles or give me just polygons or give me bezier
[01:28:25.460 --> 01:28:27.500]   just regular freeform curves.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:31.700]   And so each one will give you a different sort of effect.
[01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:35.420]   And you can also tell it-- notice-- stop when it's-- you can tell it's all along.
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:37.340]   It's giving you-- when it's processing this.
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:41.540]   It will tell you, oh, we think we've got 50%-- we're 50% close to what the original photo
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.540]   was.
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:43.540]   Now it's 75%.
[01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.540]   So you can say--
[01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:45.540]   Wow.
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:48.700]   You can just say, keep it running until you're at 90% of what the original photo looks like.
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:55.260]   The other cool thing you can do is you can stop it in mid-- in sort of in mid-render
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:56.820]   and then switch graphics primitives.
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:03.820]   So first of all, in the demo picture that I posted, it's-- I had it start off with ovals
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:10.180]   to basically block in the areas of color and then switch to thick lines to get some of
[01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:11.180]   the details.
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:15.100]   And finally, switch to really thin lines to get sort of more of a crosshatching sort
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.820]   of thing where that works.
[01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:21.220]   So you wind up with this composite picture that no one will be able to figure out exactly
[01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:26.860]   what you did with it, but it looks like an interesting piece of vector artwork.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.460]   And it can export it as JPEG, PNG.
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:33.780]   It can also export it as an SFG file so that all of the graphic primitives, all the curves,
[01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:39.260]   it's just being saved as an object-oriented file even if they're 1500 objects with it.
[01:29:39.260 --> 01:29:42.980]   So then you can import it into Illustrator, you can import it into Photoshop.
[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:47.140]   So if you wanted to-- if you wanted to do a billboard, like on the side of a building
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:51.220]   that was 10 feet by 40 feet, you could basically take this picture and turn to something that
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:55.820]   will scale to-- international-- visible from the International Space Station size and it
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:58.580]   will be a really credible, really nice piece of art.
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:29:59.580]   I love it.
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.420]   It's 10 bucks, so it's not free.
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:06.340]   But definitely with 10 bucks because there's so many times when you're in a position where
[01:30:06.340 --> 01:30:10.660]   like imagine that you're doing a presentation and a lot of your stuff are pictures that
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:15.060]   you're just using to sort of-- here's a map of the target.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:17.740]   It's more like, oh, well, here's something to look at while I'm explaining this point
[01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:18.740]   of view.
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:21.100]   You want it to be something a little bit more interesting than a picture.
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:24.780]   This will then take that photo and turn to something more interesting than a photo.
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:29.980]   And right now, a lot of people, I'm sure, are thinking about their holiday pick-- their
[01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:32.660]   holiday photo cards that they're putting out.
[01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:36.420]   You can take a picture of something that is rather straightforward.
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:40.540]   And rather than it being, oh, here's a picture I took with my iPhone of Central Park, you
[01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:42.820]   can spend about 10 or 50 minutes with this.
[01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:45.860]   And it really looks like a piece of art that was custom made for this.
[01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:49.820]   And as you're seeing right now in the video, it's actually really interesting to see this
[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:54.020]   picture-- it's sort of like you're developing a photo and you're shaking like the tray of
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:58.060]   developer and you're seeing it become from just a series of blobs to something that is
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:31:01.620]   sort of intermediate to something that now they've got the eyelashes in, now they've
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:04.060]   got the curve of the lip in.
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:09.180]   And actually, the secret to getting really cool images from this is knowing when to stop,
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.860]   because at some point, it gets so much detail that kind of looks like a blurry image.
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:18.500]   But at some point, it's just ovals and curves and triangles and just a really fascinating
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:19.500]   thing.
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:26.380]   You'll be playing what I call the new chainsaw effect with it, which is you buy the chainsaw,
[01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.700]   you cut up the log that fell during the storm, and then you spend the rest of the day thinking,
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:33.540]   I wonder what else I can cut with this chainsaw.
[01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:38.660]   Alex Lindsay's already purchased it and is running it on an Angry Bird.
[01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:39.660]   That's good.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.660]   I like to have an Angry Bird in Berlin.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:44.140]   I guess there's a big Lego store there and there was a giant Angry Bird.
[01:31:44.140 --> 01:31:46.460]   And he's watching it evolve over time.
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:47.460]   It's really cool.
[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:48.660]   Really nice pick for $10.
[01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:49.660]   That's great.
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:50.660]   That is great.
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:55.980]   It's not prism because it's prism-like in some of its results, but it's a little more
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:57.380]   complicated and sophisticated.
[01:31:57.380 --> 01:31:58.380]   It's primitive.
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:00.860]   You can look at the code on GitHub.
[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:04.260]   It's your basic.
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:09.900]   I think the core of it, I found it after looking for something similar on GitHub and
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.940]   found, well, you can either compile this and use this code to build it yourself, or
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:15.700]   you can we made this into an actual app with an interface.
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.860]   I said, I want the app with the interface.
[01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:18.860]   Thank you.
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:20.420]   I don't want to have to build something.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:23.180]   My brain is not that good.
[01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:26.100]   We're an A-rich-y pick of the week.
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:27.100]   So I have two picks.
[01:32:27.100 --> 01:32:28.100]   I hastily added one.
[01:32:28.100 --> 01:32:31.900]   We started talking about Netflix original programming because so much of it is so good.
[01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:35.180]   And this weekend, I've been meaning to do this forever, but this weekend I finally broke
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:37.060]   down and binge watched Voltron.
[01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:41.340]   It's the new Voltron that Netflix has produced and it is terrific.
[01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:44.620]   Whenever a season ends, I just want the next season to begin immediately.
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:48.820]   It's really well written, really well directed.
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:49.820]   The characters are great.
[01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:53.140]   It's got some classic anime cheesiness, but it's got a very sophisticated, very cool
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:54.140]   and a very complicated storyline.
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.140]   It's got all the elements.
[01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:56.140]   So this is new.
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:57.140]   Yes.
[01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:58.140]   Wow.
[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:00.020]   A new version of an old favorite.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.020]   Wow.
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:04.060]   It very much has that, you know.
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.660]   Old school feel to it.
[01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:06.660]   That's very cool.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:08.300]   Yeah, it's classic, but it's modern.
[01:33:08.300 --> 01:33:10.220]   They did a really good job balancing the two.
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:14.100]   And they have all the old characters, but you meet them in new and very interesting
[01:33:14.100 --> 01:33:15.580]   and very modern ways.
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.580]   Wow.
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:17.580]   And I was really, really impressed by it.
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:19.940]   So each episode is only like 22 minutes long.
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:21.740]   Yes, but there's never been many seasons.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:22.740]   So prepare.
[01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:24.940]   But they're short, like one season, like six episodes.
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:25.940]   Oh, OK.
[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:26.940]   So so good.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:27.940]   Dreamworks, dude.
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:28.940]   Very interesting.
[01:33:28.940 --> 01:33:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:33:29.940 --> 01:33:33.300]   And I think I forget the team, but it's a really talented team behind it.
[01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:35.260]   You know, people really love the storylines they put together.
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:36.260]   That's like original.
[01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:37.260]   All right.
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:40.340]   If you're looking for something to binge, my second pick is something that I was, I
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.940]   certainly called while I picked one of these up and I liked it so much.
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.900]   I ran to the store and picked one up too.
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:47.940]   And it's the Mophie Power Station, USB C XXL.
[01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:51.540]   That probably means what 20 or 50 in iPhone parlance?
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:53.260]   Universal battery.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.420]   And what it's brilliant.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:55.420]   It's like the Mophie station.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:59.540]   I've been using a Mophie Power Station for a long time, but it had two USB-A ports on
[01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:00.540]   it.
[01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:02.780]   And it was really designed for a phone or a tablet.
[01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:05.740]   This one has a USB-C and a USB-A on it.
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:10.980]   So you can plug in your normal USB to lightning port if you want to or to micro USB, whatever,
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:16.100]   to charge your iPhone or your iPad or your AirPods, your phones, whatever you want.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:19.340]   But the USB-C, you can use to charge a MacBook Pro.
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:23.900]   And that's really great because it's one of the advantages of having USB-C on the MacBook
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:27.980]   Pro and on the MacBook is that you can carry around these portable batteries and use them.
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:32.100]   So I've had this in my bag for the last week and I've been using it probably just as much
[01:34:32.100 --> 01:34:37.740]   on my MacBook Pro as I have on my iPad because there's nothing worse than you being in the
[01:34:37.740 --> 01:34:41.660]   coffee shop and not having a plug with you and realizing you have to leave and go home,
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.100]   you know, not finish your work.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:47.620]   And now I just, I have one charger that does all the devices I have all the way from the
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:50.020]   AirPods up to the MacBook Pro.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:54.860]   I just plug it in and I go and it has plenty of power and it keeps, it's really smart about
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:58.460]   how it maintains its charge and I've been really happy with it.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:34:59.460]   It's pricey.
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.460]   It's like 150 bucks.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:01.780]   I don't know if that's a Canadian price or the US price.
[01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:02.780]   I think that's the US price.
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:03.780]   It's the same, yeah.
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:04.780]   150 bucks.
[01:35:04.780 --> 01:35:05.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.420]   And it's so it is 150 bucks but it is so much mobile power.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:11.180]   10th, I'm sorry, 19,500 milliamp.
[01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:13.180]   That's up to 30 watts.
[01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.180]   Oh yeah.
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.180]   And Mophie, some people like it.
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.180]   It's fabric covered.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:18.180]   I like that.
[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:19.180]   Yeah.
[01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:21.980]   But one thing you don't want with a battery is necessarily cheap.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:22.980]   You want a battery that's good.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.660]   If it is inexpensive, that's fine too.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:28.060]   But there's so many things that can go wrong with lithium ion that I try to buy something
[01:35:28.060 --> 01:35:29.060]   that's worth priced.
[01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.060]   Oh yeah.
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:31.060]   Mophie's safe.
[01:35:31.060 --> 01:35:32.060]   Mophie's safe.
[01:35:32.060 --> 01:35:33.060]   Yeah.
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.060]   Yeah.
[01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:38.100]   I underscore that having it having at like a 20,000 milliamp hour battery.
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:41.820]   This is like having the sort of justice and the shield of invulnerability in your bag
[01:35:41.820 --> 01:35:45.300]   because it's like for an entire, especially if you travel with like an iPad instead of
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:50.460]   a regular notebook, it means that it almost doesn't matter if I can't find a find a power
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:54.180]   outlet for 48 hours because this is, this can recharge everything.
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:59.260]   And if you have a, and if you have like a MacBook, nothing or a modern MacBook, which
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:04.380]   charges off of USB, the ability that for an entire, I can be just a jerk with this bad,
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:10.380]   with my, with my mobile usage for 18 hours because I have eight or nine hours internal
[01:36:10.380 --> 01:36:13.300]   and I've got at least another eight or nine hours in this battery.
[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:17.660]   So I don't, it's the ability to not even have to care about how you're spending your battery
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:20.980]   life is quite liberating.
[01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:24.660]   Should point out though that for 40 bucks, you can get an anchor 20,000 milliamp hour
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:26.860]   battery, but doesn't have type C.
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:28.940]   That's the, that's the one that I have products to.
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:33.340]   The thing, I don't know how fast the Mophie one charges.
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:38.140]   But I think about the anchor, I think I have the exact one or maybe the next one up from
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.460]   what you're showing on Amazon there.
[01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:43.460]   It actually has two micro USB charging ports.
[01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:47.700]   So you can actually plug it into two chargers simultaneously and it will, it will go from
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:50.380]   zero to 100% in about half, in half the time.
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:51.380]   Oh, that's.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:56.220]   And with a 20,000 milliamp hour battery, it really can take overnight to charge.
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:36:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:37:02.940]   Which is why I actually, I, when I travel on a really intensive schedule, I will actually
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:08.500]   have both my new one and the old one that I've replaced at the same time because the old
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:12.620]   one will be charging at the back of the hotel while I'm using the new one and I'll be swapping
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:16.100]   them day after day to make sure I always have my 20,000 milliamp hour battery.
[01:37:16.100 --> 01:37:19.060]   That's, this is the power core 26 800 that you have.
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:22.220]   It has two, I wish it were micro USB though.
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:23.220]   That's, yeah.
[01:37:23.220 --> 01:37:25.380]   I have many of those left anymore.
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:29.500]   I don't, well, I mean, I will always have a micro USB to USB A cable.
[01:37:29.500 --> 01:37:31.980]   So I'm not that that shamed about it.
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:36.340]   But yeah, there's, there's only the next two years we will just have, we will just have
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:38.660]   type C cables and it's all we'll need.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:40.420]   I love it that you could dual input though.
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.420]   That's really kind of cool.
[01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.420 --> 01:37:43.420]   That's really thinking.
[01:37:43.420 --> 01:37:45.420]   My pick just came so I don't have any review.
[01:37:45.420 --> 01:37:49.220]   But I thought I'd show it to you because we've been talking about it.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:51.260]   The new Sonos is here.
[01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:56.700]   The Sonos play one with built in Amazon echo capabilities.
[01:37:56.700 --> 01:38:01.180]   So I really have to say the echo integration on Sonos works great.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:07.900]   And I use it all the time now, I'll say things like echo, listen to ACDC in the bedroom Sonos.
[01:38:07.900 --> 01:38:12.380]   I named it, I had a, I didn't have to, but I decided to rename all my Sonos's with the
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:14.060]   word Sonos in the name.
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:17.620]   So it'd be explicit because otherwise it would just be bedroom and that was getting
[01:38:17.620 --> 01:38:18.820]   confusing.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:22.180]   So this is the new Sonos one which has it built in.
[01:38:22.180 --> 01:38:28.620]   And again, the idea is you could, you could Amazon, Ecify your whole ecosystem using this
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:29.620]   as well.
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:30.620]   I'm kind of amazing.
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:31.620]   I think we talked about this before.
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:34.940]   My kids are just like completely tied in like constantly talking to it.
[01:38:34.940 --> 01:38:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:36.940]   Constantly asking questions.
[01:38:36.940 --> 01:38:39.100]   Anything they're trying to figure out they just ask.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:40.100]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:41.820]   Well, I've just mentioned that I got it.
[01:38:41.820 --> 01:38:46.420]   I mean, I could take it out, but it looks just like a play one and I can't open the tape.
[01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:48.860]   But here comes the knife.
[01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:54.740]   But more to the point, we'll have a review of this probably by next week on the new
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:55.740]   screen savers.
[01:38:55.740 --> 01:38:57.740]   I might have, you know, I'll probably do it Saturday.
[01:38:57.740 --> 01:39:02.540]   I'll have time between now and Saturday to give it a thorough trial.
[01:39:02.540 --> 01:39:07.500]   The Sonos, this is the new Sonos one, which is like the play one.
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:08.500]   Right.
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:12.380]   It's a simple, is it single speaker and dual speaker?
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:14.220]   It's tiny solution.
[01:39:14.220 --> 01:39:18.060]   You know, if you're, it doesn't do all the things the echo does, which is part of the,
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:22.620]   I wish it did everything the echo did because then this would be, this is going to be a
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:28.460]   competition though for the home pod and for the Google Max and, you know, I mean, everybody's
[01:39:28.460 --> 01:39:29.460]   doing these.
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:32.180]   Yeah, because a couple of speakers, a big one and a little one, I can see them through
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:33.180]   the grill.
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:34.980]   We'll try it.
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.260]   We'll let you know.
[01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:39.820]   And it's out anyway.
[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:42.500]   It's shipping to people who were pre-ordered.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.900]   That's it for Mac break weekly.
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:44.900]   What a fun show.
[01:39:44.900 --> 01:39:52.420]   Thank you for playing trivia with me, even though I lost Andy and I, because it's Chicago
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:58.660]   Sun Times, he knows the difference between a literative verse and I am a pentameter.
[01:39:58.660 --> 01:39:59.660]   He's a writer.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:00.660]   Gosh darn it.
[01:40:00.660 --> 01:40:04.340]   Find his work at the Times and of course, C W O B dot com.
[01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:09.140]   That's where he makes his home on the web and follow him on the Twitter, I H N A T K O
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:17.700]   Andy, I on in on the flicker and it's a not go on Instagram and his pictures are great.
[01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:18.700]   Thanks.
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:19.700]   Thank you for being here.
[01:40:19.700 --> 01:40:20.700]   Thanks for an a Richie.
[01:40:20.700 --> 01:40:21.700]   I'm more.com.
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:22.700]   I'm more the new yellow.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:28.460]   I'm more is it better than ever a fabulous, fabulous place to go for information, not just
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:32.020]   about Apple, but really all your devices now.
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:33.020]   It's fantastic.
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:34.980]   Did you change your lighting, Renee?
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.420]   You changed his, I had to move.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:38.220]   Yeah, I had to move where the setup was.
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:39.220]   He's now.
[01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:40.220]   The lighting looks much better.
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:41.220]   Yeah, I kind of like it.
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:42.220]   It's a little more open.
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:44.660]   Yeah, it's softer, not as hard.
[01:40:44.660 --> 01:40:45.660]   Awesome.
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:49.060]   I also, I also like the 3D effect of having something that goes into perspective as opposed
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:53.580]   to having a flat background that's, that's perpendicular, that's a parallel to the plane
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:54.580]   of the camera.
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:41:00.380]   And your facial hair is looking particularly on point or as the, as the kids say on fleek.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:01.380]   Do they still say that?
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:04.220]   I think I learned this and now they don't say it anymore.
[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:05.220]   It's a problem.
[01:41:05.220 --> 01:41:06.380]   I'm trying to keep up with the kids.
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:07.380]   You're on fleek.
[01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:08.380]   Shui.

[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:33.740]   The problem is we look at like, oh, it's going to slow down in production.
[01:41:33.740 --> 01:41:34.740]   So we're going to be able to start training people.
[01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:35.740]   And then it gets like crazy.
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:37.740]   So we're like, okay, we're going to wait just a little longer.
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:39.380]   Carol's a success, my friend.
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:40.940]   We're close.

[01:41:52.660 --> 01:41:53.660]   We've moved iOS today to Tuesday.
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:56.620]   So we're going to have a massive Apple block.
