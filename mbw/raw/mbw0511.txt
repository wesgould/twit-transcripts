[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.880]   Siegel of Bearbone Software to talk about WWDC.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.720]   Man, Apple had a ton to talk about.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.360]   We're going to get to as much as we can, including the new Apple file system.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.960]   I think you'll be interested in that.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.560]   And what is this new privacy system?
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.640]   Differential privacy that Apple's talking about.
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.160]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160]   Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.720]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest Apple News and this
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.720]   week.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.720]   There's a lot of Apple News.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.360]   Andy and Aco and I and Megan Maroney got up early.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.920]   I wasn't allowed for you so early yesterday.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.760]   For you too.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.920]   And watch the keynote at WWDC.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.600]   Renee Richie is actually there.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   Was at the keynote.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   Hello Renee.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   Maria, how are you?
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.920]   Looks like you're at the W. I'm going to guess.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.440]   I close them at Marriott.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.280]   Marriott, up the street.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.960]   And also joining us from his evil genius space station, Rich Siegel of bare-bones software.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.200]   And he's joined today by a evolved dinosaur named.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   This is Bruno.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   Bruno.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200]   Hello Bruno.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200]   Hello Bruno.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.080]   Pretty, pretty bird.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.840]   There's more than one though because Bruno doesn't move his lips either that or Bruno's
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.840]   red toilet, his lips aren't moving, but I do hear song.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.520]   One of his little friends is about six feet away wondering where he is.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.320]   We like having Rich on as often as possible, but especially during a WWDC because as one
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.400]   of the longest standing Mac developers, one of the best Mac developers out there, he certainly
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.480]   has some standing to talk about any announcements at WWDC.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.760]   Boy, it was a jam-packed event, but Renee, you were absolutely right.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.520]   And I'm going to guess you got a late-night phone call last week from somebody in Cupertino
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.160]   saying, "Xne on the monitor with GPSA."
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.880]   No, I ask around.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.080]   Some of the stuff is just logical.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   There's certain things.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.600]   You hear a rumor like, "I'm a message for Android," and you figure, "Well, Apple's not
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.440]   historically great at cross-platform or services, and having to support an extra billion users
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.440]   on current iTunes.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.920]   I message infrastructure.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.400]   Does that sound more likely or less likely?"
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.880]   You start hearing early on what's happening, what's not happening, and then when you see
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.360]   these rumors and you know that there's nobody working on that stuff.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.840]   It seems fairly clear that there would be no hardware announcements.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   I mean, there could have been.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   They've done it in the past.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.760]   It's just this time those stars did not align.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.440]   I don't mean to impune anybody, but I just figured, "Well, Apple probably went out to
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.200]   a few blogs and said, 'Hey, just so you know,' because they wanted to lower expectations
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.840]   because they were afraid people would be disappointed who were reading these rumors
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.440]   about new MacBook Pros and so forth."
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   Or not.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.880]   It's sort of like this expectation debt where if you hear Apple's going to be doing all
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.520]   these wonderful things like GPU monitors and MacBooks with OLED, and I message for Android,
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   and then it doesn't happen.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.280]   Nobody blames the people who wrote the rumors.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   They blame Apple.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.280]   Right.
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.280]   They say it was more than Apple.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.280]   That says Apple.
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.600]   Or better yet, you defend yourself by starting a counter rumor that I've heard that the reason
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.560]   why the MacBook was ready to ship as of last week, they finally found a show stopping
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   rom problem.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.360]   That's why getting into the rumor game is a mug's game.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.120]   You're well away from it.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.640]   But I would like to ask, I don't know where these rumors came from, and it's fine that
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.440]   they announce it at WWDC, but I would like to see some refreshes on some of the Macintosh
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.440]   hardware I feel.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.440]   You absolutely will.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.440]   You just use a fixed event.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.760]   They schedule a year in advance, and they have to have things that are, especially if
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.280]   it's something new and cool, they want to demonstrate it, and it has to be far enough
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.920]   along that demonstration.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.000]   And it was an hour and 50 minutes without you back without the app or stuff without any
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.960]   dad jokes, like SNL skits, without any band at the end.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.560]   No news, no news store openings.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.200]   No, here's how well we're doing in China.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.200]   Here's how many watches.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   Wow, you're right.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.200]   They kicked right into it.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.920]   And there was no Phil Schiller.
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.480]   And no Schill filler.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   No Schill filler.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.480]   That's unkind.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   Apple knows what they're doing for huge amounts of time in advance.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:37.560]   It was a little bit surprising to see them not mention any new hardware, but clearly they're
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.600]   saving it up for some subsequent event.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   Maybe they'll announce something at the end of the summer or in July in time for back
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   to school buying.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.280]   Last year, I mean, last year they were going to have Apple TV, and that didn't work out.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.520]   So then we had Apple music taking up a lot longer than it might have originally been
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.680]   intended to.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.200]   So these things are sometimes moving target or the target is stationary and it's the arrow
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   that has to move.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   Right.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   And sometimes, like, for instance, a couple of years ago, they showed off the new Mac
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.840]   Pro without shipping it.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.040]   And that's because they had no, they were variables that prevented them from shipping
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.680]   in the summer, but they knew there were no variables on a later ship date, so they knew
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.840]   they could safely do it.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.040]   Now they really, it doesn't matter if they mis, they quote, miss a ship date, internal
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.200]   ship date by three weeks because there never was a ship date on a new back.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.200]   Agreed.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.520]   And it's an interesting footnote because the Mac Pro that they announced in June was supposed
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:35.200]   to ship was, they took orders for that at the end of that year, but it wasn't until,
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:43.120]   I think it was March of the following year that it actually rolled out of the warehouse.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.520]   That was a little bit strange, that whole thing with the new Mac Pro.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.080]   And I have never seen anything like it before, since.
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.880]   Remember Phil Schiller said, can't innovate my ass.
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.440]   And I think that there might have been some pressure to show that they had something.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.720]   I think you're right.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   I think they showed it early rather than shipped it late.
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.320]   It's true that his ass could not be innovated upon even more.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   It's an iterative asset.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.800]   It's an iterative asset.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.760]   This is the part where somebody could say Phil Schiller's ass is state of the art, but
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.760]   that's not going to be made.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.600]   You may not like his ass today, but we have to understand is that Apple is planning for
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.920]   the ass that we'll all be using in 2019.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.120]   This is rapidly devolving into Silicon Valley mode.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.600]   You're talking to three people who are deeply, simply deprived for very different reasons
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.200]   from WWDC.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.760]   This is just water, but it could be a tumbler of whiskey.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.760]   The event wasn't last night.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.400]   The beard bash wasn't last night, was it?
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.400]   Yes it was.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.120]   Oh my God.
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.760]   What are you doing here?
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   I was doing media hits since 5/30 this morning.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.760]   Oh, I'm fine.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.760]   Really?
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   Were you?
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   Wow.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   That's what dubbed of his like.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.440]   We did the keynote and then there was a short break and we did a podcast in the middle.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.160]   Then there was State of the Union, which is if people aren't familiar with that, that's
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.960]   the developer keynote keynote after the keynote.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.120]   And then the Apple design awards are right after that.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.520]   And then we rolled into the beer bash.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.520]   Holy cow.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.840]   How late were you up on the beer bash?
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.840]   We finished our midnight local.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.320]   Oh, that's not so bad.
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   Jim played.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.800]   There were two bands in the middle.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.680]   Jim got up and did some Guns N' Roses and some ACDC, which was really nice.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   Like a trip.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.200]   He is very talented.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.000]   He's played at Yosemite both years and it's like he's just he's the person who is sitting
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.680]   quietly in a chair but playing the most amazing riffs, which is more impressive than being
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.200]   the Pete Townsend, who is just like jumping up all on stage and windmilling.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.040]   It's like, oh goodness.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.600]   He's just like.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.200]   You can't read Jim's stuff and think that he's wasting his time in tech journalism, but
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.920]   then you hear him play as guitar.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.440]   I think he's wasting his time in tech journalism.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.240]   Is it fair to say he shreds?
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240]   Yes.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   Okay.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   Shreds.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.240]   He knots.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.240]   I think the beard actually picks up a couple extra non human boards.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.320]   I've always felt like maybe he had sort of a sort of a Turk sort thing going in where
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.600]   they had like that little chess player inside the machine.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.360]   I think he has like a little tiny like Eric Clapton clone inside his beard.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.840]   Well, congratulations on a successful beard bash.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.320]   You had about 700 people.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.520]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.520]   Wow.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.520]   Sell up.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.520]   Nice.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.520]   It was a lot of fun in the best way.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.520]   Sell up.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   Not the bad way.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.960]   No, and everyone needed it because it was just like it was a long and fun day and everyone
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.200]   got a chance to just relax and enjoy a high neck and you know party.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.320]   Well, before we dig into the details and there's a lot to talk about including a new
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.560]   file system, which I am very intrigued about.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.360]   My phone seems to start playing music for reasons.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   I don't.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   There we go.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   Stop it.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   Thank you.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.120]   But I'd like to get kind of your general overall sense of it.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.200]   Let's start with you, Renee, because you're actually there.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.680]   Good, bad and different.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.480]   No, I thought it was excellent.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   It was a very clean show.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.520]   I mean, again, there was no Saturday Night Live skits.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.520]   There were no bands.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.880]   There were no strange segments.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.120]   It was just they came out and reminded me a little bit about some of the early app store
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.720]   keynotes where it was just Bam Bam Bam, feature feature feature feature feature feature and
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.800]   they did a really good job, really good presenter job.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.160]   Some of the new presenters like St.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.360]   I'm not a Miss Prenlover first name.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   St. John.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.920]   Those was awesome.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.920]   Fantastic.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.920]   The features were clean.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.760]   The features were coherent and there were a couple of themes that I thought were super
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   interesting.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.720]   One was Apple is doubling down on privacy, but the other one is accessibility in so many
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   different ways.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.520]   Like Siri makes the Mac more accessible, but APIs into apps like Message and Siri make
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.040]   those accessible to developers and Swift Playgrounds makes programming more accessible.
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.960]   And they had like wheelchair actions for watch.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.000]   So just overall the Apple is returning to that purpose of making technology more addressable
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   to the mainstream.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.800]   That's always when sort of they are best is when they're guided by that philosophy.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.520]   Andy, your thoughts overall and then we'll get into the details.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.200]   I think basically there were very little big news, but very big little news over and
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   over and over again.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.160]   That sounds like a headline for a Chicago Sun Times piece.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.480]   That sounds like a tweet that you make to keep people quiet while you work in your Chicago
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.480]   Sun Times piece.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.480]   But that's really how I felt about it.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:13.080]   I thought that just the I liked the keynote because there were you like to see a consistent
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.480]   message that kind of makes you think that here is part of the larger plan that that
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480]   Apple is building.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.400]   And I think that consistently from start to finish, they're saying that we are aware
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:27.080]   that we now the world is now too big and we have too many users for Apple to deliver
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.720]   the awesome for everybody.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.200]   So now we are more open to the idea of making all of our technologies open so that all of
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.240]   you developers can bring most of the part or most of the awesome for us.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.080]   And that's not a dig very kind.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.800]   That's a welcome set of openness as opposed to having hi everybody who's working on a
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.280]   messaging app scooter.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.720]   You man, we have our own messages.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.720]   Bye bye.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.480]   Now they're saying we've got we've got messages and we're building our own enhancements to
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.480]   it.
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.800]   But we're going to let you if you if you have like a car a car hailing app, we're going
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.320]   to let you make your app integrate with our messaging app really, really well.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:06.280]   And that way both the consumers and the users and the developers all all get the optimum
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:13.640]   experience, particularly as Renee said, I think Apple thinks it's serving its users best
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.360]   by instead of creating an environment with 18 different messaging apps with varying levels
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.240]   of security with companies that don't know where their money is coming from.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.320]   They're going to basically turn messages into a secure communications platform where now
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.720]   this open up to third party app, so to speak, just like the iPad and just like the watch
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.400]   and just like Apple TV and just like the iPhone was eventually opened up to third party apps.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.000]   But now everything can happen within a very, very polite structured playground.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.280]   And that's start to finish the accessibility stuff again.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.560]   Wonderful, wonderful stuff.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.960]   I mean, just I've been talking for the past couple of years to people who are who work
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.840]   on accessibility for technology.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:59.320]   And the idea of making, basically adding to a fitness app, tracking for people who use
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.840]   wheelchairs is such a non-trivial thing because they only gave you a part of it during the
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:10.040]   keynote saying, well, not everybody, not everybody has the same stroke on the on the
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.040]   rooms of the wheels.
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.920]   We have to account for three different major kinds of stroke.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:19.480]   And then when you go into other things like partial amputees where not even every above
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.240]   the knee amp is completely the same.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.800]   So the fact that they're tech, they're taking on this job underscores the fact that health
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.840]   is one of the most one of the most beautiful and one of the best products that Apple creates.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:37.560]   The last thing I would say is that I'm sorry that I didn't see any real aha sort of move
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   forward.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:44.640]   A lot of it's it's clumsy to say that most of these announcements where you see this thing
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.680]   that Snapchat does, well, now we do it too.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   You see this thing that you've that you can do in Android Wear while we're doing it to
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   now.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.040]   It's not like that at all.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:59.440]   But it's the WWDC is a time to take take the wraps off of something that will really
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.680]   dazzle us.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.080]   And so it was a very, very good keynote.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.400]   The fact that they're making the lock screen almost now the central experience of the iPhone,
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.560]   that's a really big shift.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.200]   The fact that they came out with a brand they quietly debuted a brand new design language,
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.440]   which to me might be the most exciting news of the entire event is big news.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:24.320]   But I wish that there was like a Google home sort of advanced with the saying, here's
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.280]   something brand new that we're working on right now that isn't necessarily ready yet.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.920]   But here is where we're looking for the past next couple of years.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:36.080]   Rich Segal, of course, is the developer among us from Bear Bones Software.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.600]   And I'm sure you it is a developer conference.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.160]   And you probably look on the keynote with different eyes than the rest of us.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.040]   Dude, is anything you noted or have seen in subsequent materials?
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.080]   Well, it is a developer conference.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.200]   And I do suffer somewhat from not being there.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.640]   But why aren't you there?
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   I bad timing.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.880]   Well, it's good timing for us.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.200]   Let me just say that.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.560]   And for me for being here, yeah.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.080]   Yeah, we're thrilled.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:08.280]   The past few years, and I'm not going to use that infamous four-letter phrase, forward
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:15.600]   phrase, the past few years, the WCDC notes have really changed into much more of a user
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.920]   focused event.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.760]   The, honestly, the public keynote is oppressive.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.760]   Right.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.080]   And the idea is that, and I don't know why my camera is shaking so much.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   Sorry, there's no wind.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.760]   No, it looks good.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   There's no earthquake either.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:39.240]   You are in Boston, so that's good news.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.960]   They're making announcements that are there to catch the attention of the press and the
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   public.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.760]   And so, yeah, exactly.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.080]   So there won't be much deep dive technical.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.160]   Here's this hot new stuff that we're working on behind the scenes.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:00.480]   And they're not going to talk about things like, okay, well, we've made huge performance
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:05.960]   advancements in this subsystem, and we're making a bunch of bug fixes in this subsystem.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.480]   It's going to be the shiny stuff that they could show off.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.600]   And some of its things that people have asked for, like Siri on the desktop.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.480]   And there's stuff that looks like it's fun, like the stickers and visual effects and
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:23.480]   messages.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.080]   You know, and I'm sort of disappointed that I wasn't able to catch the state of the Union
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   Streams yesterday, because I think that's where the real meat of it is.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.000]   Of course, that's also the parts that you can't talk about.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.720]   Is that still the case?
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.760]   No, you can talk about it this year.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.480]   You can't show photographs with the other slides.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.000]   They seem to have loosened up a lot.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.400]   They used to be to do the keynote, kick the press out, and then everything else was NDA'd.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.960]   Yeah, that's how it used to be done.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.640]   They've now loosened up not only that on the betas as well.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.680]   It used to be, if you knew it, you couldn't say it.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.920]   Much easier on the press.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:04.640]   It shows some confidence, too, and maybe a little less fetishistic secrecy.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.280]   The public beta coming this summer is going to be an interesting inflection point.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:14.600]   I years ago adopted the rule of never install the WWDC build of anything on live hardware.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.240]   Probably why.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:23.440]   And I'd even caution against using the public betas of anything unless you have just really
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:30.320]   a driving overriding need to make sure that you're compatible or make sure that it's deployable
[00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:36.640]   in your organization installing a beta just to kick the tires.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.640]   It's a full model.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.240]   People have a strong full model drive.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.240]   Yeah, that's good advice because I think our audience especially is very likely to at
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.120]   least, and I did it once.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.360]   I did it last night and it's painful.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.560]   A couple of OS 10s ago I did it and I really regretted it and actually rebuilt the whole
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:55.480]   system to go back to the normal distribution.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.840]   I think you really make an excellent point, Rich, because they spent so much time on messaging,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.280]   which is not something I mean, I guess developers can participate, but it's really more really
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.280]   aimed at consumers.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.960]   They look how cool the next iOS is going to be.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:15.960]   And at the same time mentioned not at all a significant change to all of their operating
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.400]   systems, a new file system.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.960]   And I want to talk about the new Apple file system in just a second.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.640]   And a lot more of the nitty gritty.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.160]   We've got a great panel to do it.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   Rich Siegel from bare bones.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.160]   Software is here.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.680]   Andy and I go from the Chicago Sun times from I'm more.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.840]   We've got Renee Richie.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:39.920]   And it's funny because at one point about eight o'clock last night we had nobody because
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.240]   Renee said I can't do it.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.400]   Andy, we had you and me Andy.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   Which is not bad.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.560]   Andy and Leo's show is not awful.
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.040]   But I said I would like to get a developer at least on.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:53.680]   And then we invited a number of people, all of whom said yes, and we had about 20 people
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.800]   on the panel.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:01.120]   So we went from nothing to riches, but we've got I think a great panel here for our discussion.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.920]   We'll have more in just a bit.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.520]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Trunk Club every day.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.000]   Yesterday I wear my Trunk Club jacket.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.920]   A jacket that was just so nice that I probably would have not bought myself because you know
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.280]   like many guys I don't like to shop.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.400]   Last thing I want to do is go to a store.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.200]   Trunk Club really solves that.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   Summer times here.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.840]   You got to put the winter clothes away, spruce up your wardrobe with some maybe a short sleeve
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.880]   button downs or a lightweight blazer.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:32.800]   Oh gosh, I need one of those for sure.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.360]   Shopping for new clothes and stores takes forever is humiliating.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.400]   I think that's the main reason I don't like it.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.560]   It's humiliating.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.920]   And that goes back to when I was a kid and they said, yeah, you go to the Husky section
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.080]   over there.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.720]   And it's like it ever ever since I haven't wanted to go into a store.
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.000]   But Trunk Club got me covered because here's what happens.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.160]   And by the way, men and women now and that's a that's wonderful.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.680]   That I think I think my wife got them to do it because she was so mad that I got all
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:57.840]   this great stuff in my Trunk Club.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.960]   She said, I want you to do this for women.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.120]   And they said, I will let you try it out for anybody else.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.720]   And now they have it for everybody.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.720]   So what happens is you contact Trunk Club.com and they hook you up with your own personal
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.720]   stylist.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.560]   And this is free, by the way, this is free at this point.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:20.360]   You give them your measurements, you share your likes and just your dislikes.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.040]   The stylist who's a pro, super pro, will help you.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.760]   I talked to my stylist, she was very understanding when I said, I'm a Husky.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.200]   She said, we don't call it Husky.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.360]   It's okay.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.160]   And she found some really great stuff.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.440]   Then she puts it up on the on the website.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   You go through it.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.440]   You say, let me try this, try this, try this.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.800]   80 top brands too.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:44.040]   We're not just talking like the Trunk Club brand.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.600]   Trunk clubs from Nordstrom, they have everything.
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.120]   They have everything.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.360]   So then once you pick it, they put it in a trunk and your trunk comes to your door.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.720]   Some clothes, expert advice, no work, your own personal stylist.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.280]   You try the clothes on, you see how it looks.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.480]   You do a fashion show for your loved ones, whatever, whatever rocks your boat.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.800]   You post it on Instagram and then you pick what you want and send the rest back.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.320]   And then and only then do you pay for the stuff you keep.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   That's it.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.560]   Everything else goes back.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.560]   No cost to you.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:16.560]   And it's not a subscription.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.360]   So you're not going to get another trunk in a month.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.700]   You get it only when you want it.
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.700]   You can even, they now have stores.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.800]   So if you live in Dallas, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago or DC, go buy the Trunk Club house
[00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.520]   and you can meet your stylist, minds in LA.
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.100]   Actually, we should, when we go down there next week, we should stop by.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.100]   She's so great.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.040]   You have 10, I kind of have a crush on her now because she really gets me.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.540]   She gets me, man.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.420]   You have 10 days to try on the clothes.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.420]   Keep what you like.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.820]   Send back what you don't.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.620]   Shipping is always free.
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.420]   It's such a great deal.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.780]   I love this.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.140]   So the next time you want to look sharp, date night's coming up, you're going to go to an
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.140]   event.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.180]   Maybe you've got an important, like a wedding wedding, wedding month.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.780]   Make a big statement at the next big event in your calendar with a look that's hand picked
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.940]   for you and your style by somebody who does this for a living.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.940]   Trunk Club.com/Macbreak.
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:07.620]   You don't want to look like your mommy dressed you.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.420]   Worse, you don't want to look like you dressed you.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.620]   Trunk Club.com/Macbreak.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.060]   And we thank them so much for their support.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.300]   This is a great solution for the geeks among us.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.540]   We just want to look sharp for those special occasions.
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.540]   But just don't know where to start.
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.500]   No shopping involved.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.660]   I really want to talk about APFS.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:32.060]   This is the new file system.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.540]   Now I know it's very early days.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:38.220]   In fact, none of you were able to go to the session, which is I think right now, or like
[00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.900]   this morning, it was a 10 this morning.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:48.620]   So you're all working basically off of a very kind of incomplete developer document.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.740]   The head of CoreOS went over it for a little bit during the State of the Union yesterday.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.740]   Oh, good.
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.260]   All right.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.220]   They did not -- not one word about this at the keynote, which tells you really the keynote
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.940]   is not for developers.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.580]   Tell us about APFS.
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:10.620]   This HFS and HFS+ have been with Apple since OS 10 or even before.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.220]   Is that 18 years or something?
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.100]   Totally, come only.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.260]   And there are better file systems out there.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:21.340]   Remember the rumor that Apple a couple of generations ago was going to start shipping
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:28.460]   ZFS, which was created at Sun and is now owned by Oracle, is widely used.
[00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:31.500]   BSD -- and this is why it would have been easy for Apple to do it.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:37.540]   It is very commonly used with free, open, and net BSD, the BSD distributions.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.100]   It is now available on Linux, although that's been in struggle mostly because of licensing
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.100]   not for technical reads.
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   Yes.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.340]   But you can now add it to some Linux distributions.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.300]   And it looks like some of the features that Apple was hoping to get with ZFS are available
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.780]   in APFS.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:57.180]   I'll let you start, Renee, because you're champing at the bit here.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:01.180]   Well, and also the presentation was very concise because, again, it's meant to give developers
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.860]   a highlight, an overview, and it doesn't delve as deeply as the documents do.
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:08.900]   But the high-level bits for this were that it's super fast, it's super efficient, it's
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.060]   for files and directories.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.100]   You only play for storage when it's modified.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.860]   So if you make copies of documents, you're not storing multiple copies of them.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:19.980]   You only start to eat into your storage when you start making versions of those files.
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.340]   It does snapshots full volume.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.340]   They're mountable.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.580]   They support reverting.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.020]   It scales from Apple Watch to Mac Pro, so it's going to be the file system that runs on
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.820]   every one of Apple's devices.
[00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.220]   It's designed for a world of modern flash for SSD.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:35.460]   It supports trim automatically for both Apple and not Apple SSDs.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:40.060]   And important for Apple, the encryption is actually unified now between iOS and OS X.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.300]   So it's built-in system-level encryption.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.220]   And from a consumer point of view, that's maybe the most interesting takeaway, which
[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.900]   is Apple's going all in on encryption.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.980]   This is better than file vault.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.700]   Much better.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.100]   It's great because it'll encourage more consumers to encrypt files.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.100]   Oh, goodness.
[00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.100]   Sorry.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.180]   I'm going to speak my camera settings, and I've been failing desperately.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.500]   Your beard's turning red, which I don't think it is.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.420]   So before it was gray, it was reddish.
[00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:10.500]   I will throw it away.
[00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.260]   That's the web setting that says turn back the clock.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.260]   Don't we don't want to use that one?
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.260]   Oh, no.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.660]   If you look at-- I've been doing archiving of old pictures with me.
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.060]   You see how if there's a little bit of red left here?
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:24.060]   When I go through Google Photos and it goes back--
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:25.060]   It's the eyedroppers.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.660]   It's like the progress bar of my old age.
[00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:31.660]   The white is like the progress bar of my old age loading in.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.660]   It's like over here.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.660]   Oh, dear.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.660]   But came back to ZFS.
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.660]   This is a problem by the rich does not have at this point.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:41.460]   I'm very, very noisy what you people are talking about.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.820]   He's kind of anti-Andy, whereas Andy seems to be sprouting hair
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:46.620]   from a variety of appendages.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:48.340]   Rich seems to have lost all of his.
[00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:49.980]   I'm very pro-Andy.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.900]   I think I'm more the un-Andy.
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.900]   An eye.
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.900]   Un-Andy.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.900]   The bizarro is you get older.
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.660]   The hair will leave your face and your head and start growing out of your ears and your
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.660]   nose.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:02.060]   We switch off quarter by quarter.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.460]   This quarter, Rich is the bizarro Andy.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.660]   Next quarter, I start being bizarro Rich.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:12.260]   But what's going to say is that most people don't use encryption because it's a pain
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.260]   in the butt.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:17.020]   You have to either encrypt the entire volume, which costs you a little bit of performance
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:23.540]   and also puts, if you lose that password, you lose that entire volume is unrecoverable.
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.620]   Also it makes the volume really, really hard to repair.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:32.820]   If something goes per fluid, an existing desktop recovery tool might not be able to handle it.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.500]   Even services might not be able to handle it.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.100]   It's just a pain in the butt.
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.460]   With the new file system, it supports encryption on pretty much every level so that you can
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.340]   actually just simply say, "Here is one folder that I want to be secure because this is what
[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.020]   has my financial information on it."
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:53.420]   Or if you're planning a surprise birthday party for your long-time companion, then
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.620]   you can just have, "Here is the one document that I want to be encrypted and everything
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.980]   else is the Wild Wild West."
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:03.580]   So the idea of having point and shoot encryption doesn't just make it easier, but it makes
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.900]   it something that people are more willing to do if it's really no more difficult than
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.140]   clicking a checkbox when they save a new file.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.540]   I have to think Apple is going to start shipping as they do with the iPhone with decryption
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.380]   on by default.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:22.940]   Because the new file system is so fast, things like write coalescing, which really speed up
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.460]   with small files, they could probably afford to put encryption on by default.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:27.460]   I think I believe it will be.
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.780]   I don't know that for sure, but I believe it is going to be just encrypted.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.780]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.420]   Rich, you were pointing out, though, that this is not Mac OS Sierra.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.820]   This is a later time frame.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:47.860]   That appears to be the case that APFS will roll out in 2017.
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:55.540]   It seems to me in reading what I've been able to find about the new file system, they really
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.660]   have two fundamental design goals here.
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.580]   Well, maybe three.
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:09.780]   First is they are recognizing that storage container sizes, like the size of a hard drive,
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:17.260]   has grown beyond all of the bounds even conceived by old file system designs.
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:23.260]   They need to take that into account both in terms of the quantity of storage available,
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:29.140]   but also the quantity of discrete items that you're going to be putting on these drives.
[00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.060]   That's the big data giant hard drive model.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:38.820]   On the other hand, the computers that they're shipping all have SSDs in them, which are still
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:45.460]   comparatively small by the standards of what you can buy a spinning hard drive to hold
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.420]   or build in a rate of hold.
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:56.500]   It seems to me that they're serving this dual goal of efficiently using giant drives,
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.300]   but also efficiently using very small drives.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:11.460]   They'll be able to ship Macs that have 128 or 256 gig drives in them, SSDs in them, and
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.020]   keep their costs down because that's important.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:17.620]   They still make a lot of margin on hardware.
[00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:22.980]   Really not just Macs, but handheld devices to iPads and so forth.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:30.980]   They can make more efficient use of this space than they could previously with HFS or any
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.140]   of the current alternatives.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.180]   I want to back up a little bit to ZFS.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:41.420]   ZFS was interesting, but I think ultimately it wasn't going to work.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:48.780]   It did a lot of things that everybody wanted at a technical level, but Apple, the guys
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:54.900]   who are working on ZFS with an Apple actually left and tried to build a company to sell
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.740]   it and were unable to.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:02.980]   I mean sell it as a purchasable product.
[00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:09.300]   If you'd buy a ZFS license and it would have a nice user interface for setting up ZFS
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:15.900]   containers and so forth, and they just couldn't make a go of it.
[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:22.140]   Encryption, yeah, another interesting design goal I think at an end-user level though.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:28.180]   Most people don't care about how the nuts and bolts work.
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.340]   They might not even know if encryption is available to them.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:39.140]   I could see Apple shipping encrypted APFS as the default on new hardware so that if
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:45.260]   your device gets stolen or lost, you don't have to worry about your data.
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.220]   I totally see that.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:52.620]   I agree with you that people but maybe don't want to deal with the nitty gritty, but they're
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:56.980]   very aware of encryption thanks to the San Bernardino case.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.220]   I think that if you asked, if you asked people, would you prefer to have your data encrypted?
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.740]   Almost universally they'd say yes.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:07.380]   Encryption on by default is a very smart move.
[00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.740]   The hardware supports it, right?
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:22.420]   I file-volted my 2013 MacBook Pro and I file-volted my Mac Pro and honestly there's no discernible
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.620]   difference between file-volting and free-reward.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:30.020]   This should be even better.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.260]   There is some question about how the scheme would work so many in the chatroom saying,
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:37.060]   would the keys be in the key chain?
[00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.540]   I don't think so because it sounds like it's full disk encryption.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.420]   At least in my experience with full disk encryption, for instance in Linux, you can't even use
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.940]   the hard drive until you've unlocked it.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.420]   You can't even see the key chain until you've unlocked it.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.300]   I would imagine there'd be some other scheme for this.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.740]   They also, somebody was asking about journaling.
[00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:01.500]   Of course, HFS+ supports journaling as an option and usually it's on.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.460]   Yes, journaling, better journaling.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:08.500]   They have a copy on right metadata scheme Apple's calling it crash protection.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:13.280]   This is from ours Technica's analysis of it which aims to ensure that file system commits
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.220]   and writes to the file system journal stay in sync even if something happens during the
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:23.380]   right including if the system loses power which means a much more robust system.
[00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.860]   The thing that people, I know the high level feature that everybody loved about ZFS was
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.460]   snapshots and it looks like they will support that as well.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:38.140]   Yes, that's another big deal when you make it something that a developer can simply do
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.740]   without having to build their own system for snapshotting a document.
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.820]   For instance, when it becomes just simply a system resource where they can just simply
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:50.620]   call an API to offer the user a previous edition of a document or another different state of
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.740]   a piece of data, that's a pretty big deal.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.820]   Time machine gives you kind of a pseudo snapshot but it's done in an ugly and angry.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.820]   It's a glorious hack.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:05.180]   This would really give you versioning in a beautiful way and also a way to recover.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:10.860]   People who use ZFS frequently will say, "I don't care if I update my system and it breaks
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:11.860]   everything.
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.860]   I'll just roll it back.
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.860]   I've got a snapshot."
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.860]   It's automatic, right?
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.860]   It's not just that.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:18.860]   It's not just that.
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:24.700]   I sort of hasten to add here that this stuff is all really good.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.540]   That's a great and crash defense is great.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:35.820]   But none of this removes the need for a reliable backup scheme.
[00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:36.820]   Of course.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:43.500]   If you use Superduper today and you should or some other backup program, you should keep
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:50.700]   using it and you should plan on using it once a PFS becomes the default because you're still
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:52.300]   going to want backups.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:56.780]   Apparently, there's also an addition to snapshot and cloning.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.540]   What's the difference, Renee?
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.740]   What cloning is is that file level thing that I spoke about because they said that there
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.940]   oftentimes what they find on people's systems is that copies end up happening of documents.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:09.060]   For one reason or another, you have multiple copies of a document and all of those take
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.620]   up the same amount of space as the original document.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.420]   With cloning, you get a copy of that document but as long as there's no changes to it,
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:19.260]   it basically references the original and doesn't take up any extra space.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.660]   As you start making changes, those are sort of the differential.
[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:26.100]   You always get the most efficient storage possible.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.500]   According to ours, you're also going to get something called space sharing.
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:34.940]   Multiple volumes can be created at the same chunk of physical space which sounds weird.
[00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:39.220]   Apparently, enterprises use this something called thin provisioning which would, for instance,
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:44.540]   let you create four terabyte volumes on a single terabyte disk.
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:47.420]   This is very next generation is what it is, I guess.
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:52.540]   It's like buying in the stock market buying an option or a future on storage that you
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:57.660]   promise to buy later if it actually needs physically more than the amount of data that's
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.660]   available.
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:01.180]   >> Useful for containerizing and things like that.
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.180]   >> Right.
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:07.460]   So, for instance, if you're trying to, in enterprise, if you need to image a standard,
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:12.460]   let's say 500 gigabyte or one terabyte system image for people but you need to have eight
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.220]   different versions of this.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:19.020]   You can possibly have each one of those images on the same volume because you know that not
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.540]   everyone of them is going to be taking up the full one terabyte that you're going to
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.780]   be flashing onto the volume.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.260]   But as with so much of the stuff that's in this document and from the people I've been
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:32.740]   talking to, a lot of it is the key is going to be in the implementation.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.900]   It's not a consumer facing feature.
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:41.100]   It is a feature that administrators and developers can then use to deploy features that will
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.980]   be visible to consumers.
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:47.220]   So a lot of the stuff that you might hear, I'll only speak for myself, you might hear
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.820]   me saying about it, is speculative based on here is one, here's one implication of this
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.820]   feature and here's one application of this feature.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:58.820]   >> Yeah, I mean even most developers won't be dealing at that level.
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:03.420]   But the upshot of is one hopes is a more reliable, faster computer.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.260]   >> And also one that's just easier, like last year was on-demand resources and the idea
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.860]   was that if you're using an Apple TV and your kid goes to download a game, they should
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.220]   never have to see, oh you're out of space, please go delete some things and then try
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:16.780]   and download your game again.
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.620]   It should just download that game and the system should just handle it.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.660]   And with the Apple file system, I think that same feeling is there, is that you shouldn't
[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.740]   have to worry about encryption or space management or storage management or backup.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.900]   The same way a time machine was supposed to be almost set in, forget it.
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.220]   This should provide all the basic functionality with you without you having to be a systems
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.220]   administrator.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:40.020]   >> Yeah, I think one of the central things of the, I think everyone who writes about or
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:44.660]   is an analyst about Apple is writing a brand new version of the Apple Playbook.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.500]   And one of the big chapters in my version of it is that almost everything they ever
[00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:54.740]   do is focused on either selling hardware or creating a better experience for the consumer.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:59.340]   So if you look at this new file system, if Microsoft were doing it or another company
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:05.380]   were doing it, you would think about they want to, they want to make their computers
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:09.700]   easier to administer and easier to deploy services.
[00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.420]   Apple is very, very happy to make its consultants and make its admins happy.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:19.460]   But in the end, I think that their focus is on how can we make a better computing experience
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:20.740]   for our actual users?
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:25.900]   And in this case, it's how do we let them make their data more secure, for instance,
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:31.860]   for being able to always have a safe copy of their data, make sure their data is secure.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.500]   As Renee said, it's not about admins creating disk images.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:39.020]   It's about how do we make sure that users will never see a, I'm sorry, you're out of
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.740]   space until you're actually out of space.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.860]   Is there a way that we can actually manage this problem well so that users will never
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.420]   see a disappointment gram on their screen?
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:53.460]   Yeah, I think this is Apple at its best where it does really deep smart stuff that it knows
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.860]   will benefit consumers and doesn't need to really talk about it.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.940]   I bet you in the rollout of Sierra, they won't mention it.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:02.580]   It rolls out in January, they won't mention it.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:08.100]   Well, they need to make the front facing stuff about the storage efficiency in OS 10 now.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.340]   Mac OS where they showed how you could reclaim massive amounts of space by doing some intelligent
[00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:13.340]   storage.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.780]   And that's part of the part and parcel with this is once the file system is efficient
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:19.700]   and you give people, they're not doing a lot of automatically, but you give people the
[00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.340]   tools that automatically flush their web cache and their mail.
[00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:28.180]   So when they talked about saving space in Mac OS Sierra, that was in part powered by
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.180]   this new APF.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:31.100]   No, so this is the, so this is the, the AFS is the back end.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.180]   The front end thing is doing things like just cleaning up garbage that you don't need anymore.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.180]   Right.
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.180]   Right.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.980]   So Apple has this whole near line strategy where they try to keep things that are recent
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:44.580]   and frequently accessed on the local drive for high performance access, but things that
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:49.060]   are infrequently used or old up on the cloud so that it doesn't take up what they consider
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.780]   precious local storage.
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.300]   And that's sort of the front facing part of this.
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.100]   And you put those together and you have a much more efficient automatic file system.
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.500]   And you give people tools that do things like clear the web cache, get rid of the mail,
[00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.380]   you know, the mail cache that's built up, move files off that they don't need anymore.
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:07.260]   You empty the trash if you haven't done that in years, and then you get the space savings
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.540]   and the space reclamation.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:13.340]   And suddenly, even though you have those smaller SSD drives, you still get the maximum performance
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.180]   and the maximum of storage out of them.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.180]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:20.020]   Also, I haven't, I've been asking around over the past day and I haven't got any actual
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:25.500]   answers to this question, but I strongly suspect that when that tool is released and we get
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:30.160]   to see how it actually works, we're going to see that that cache data isn't just being
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:37.080]   deleted, it's going to be secure deleted because one vector of access to your data are all
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.520]   these quote worthless cache files.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.320]   But just because you have any, you've deleted an email off the server, it could be somewhere
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.240]   in and on disk buffer.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.760]   And that's the cache files are a very, very valuable piece of property to take a look
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.320]   at if you want to sniff out personal data on people.
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:56.240]   So I'd be surprised if they, I wouldn't, I don't think that this is the purpose of
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.240]   that tool by any means.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.560]   But I think that once they've got that on the, on the whiteboard, once it, once they wrote
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.360]   down and we will delete files, they will say, well, of course, we're going to secure
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   delete them.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.360]   Why would we not?
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.360]   Because I think that's really part of the new philosophy of Apple.
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:12.120]   Rich, do you think as a user, as a developer of user land application software, this is
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.920]   going to be something you pay it's that you can take advantage of or give you new features
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   or not?
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:21.520]   Well, I think one of the sort of nice things about this is that it's going to be largely
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:26.800]   invisible at the application level.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:31.920]   In really much the same way that whole disk encryption is today, applications have no
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.760]   idea what's going on below the file system layer.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.720]   The APIs work the way they do.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.320]   APFS preserves the API semantics.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:47.920]   So you don't really have to worry about those details unless you really are playing around
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.320]   at the kernel level and application developers don't.
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.480]   Somebody like a shirt pocket software that a super dooper might be paying closer attention
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.960]   to this kind of opportunity.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:04.160]   I think these lower level changes are strongly relevant to their interests and the same with
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.720]   Alsoft, the folks who make disk warrior.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:11.880]   There's still going to be a need for file system recovery no matter what the file system
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.480]   is.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.680]   And there's still going to be a need for backups no matter what the medium is.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.200]   And to echo your warning, do not install this today.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.160]   Focal of God knows.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.520]   These all sorts of issues are points out the fact that it's a case sensitive file system
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.000]   which could break some things in OS 10 as it stands today.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.520]   You probably wouldn't even want to do it when Mac OS Sierra comes out.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.520]   Just wait.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:40.360]   There's a particularly in research and academia.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:45.920]   I was working with a friend who is I won't go into which the project they're working
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.920]   on.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:54.040]   But part of the administrative help that I was giving this person was that they needed
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.360]   to put this data on a different drive.
[00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.920]   But the way that this software works and against not is for researchers.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.040]   It's not for the general public.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.840]   So it's OK if it's it kind of stinks on some levels.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.440]   All of the file paths are hard coded.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.200]   So so if he or she were to move it on to a different drive and anything about that
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:15.320]   path were to change, it would not be possible to access a year's worth of data.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:21.600]   So I've we were talking a couple of weeks ago about anticipating betas and how how impressed
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.720]   I am that Renee will actually put beta software on his actual working iPhone.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.840]   Whereas I always I always have a second iMac.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:32.920]   I always have a second iPhone that has all the betas on when it comes to a change in
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:36.440]   the file system, I will have a third Mac.
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.440]   Right.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.120]   Because I'm not not only am I would it be expecting this to break things.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.080]   I would expect my data to not be there in a week from now because anything this brand
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:51.760]   it's it's it's like saying it's imagine that we have the ability to tweak the balance between
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.280]   the gases that are in atmosphere.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.920]   It's like there is there is no going once you if you screw it up, there is no going back.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.720]   You just have to start a little again with a new planet.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:04.600]   Should also point out that this is very ambitious and I've seen companies and Microsoft comes
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.600]   to mind.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:12.120]   Microsoft had in mind with Longhorn a complete recreation of the file system which they
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.920]   abandoned like a year in.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.920]   The centric wasn't that.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.320]   And they just decided you know this is a bad idea and I don't know how many millions
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.400]   or hundreds of millions of dollars they put into it but they certainly promoted it and
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.600]   put a lot of time into it and abandoned it.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.040]   So it is a non trivial thing to do.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.280]   You're changing some fundamental plumbing and so it is completely possible.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.920]   This may never even emerge.
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   But it is it is important.
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.440]   I don't think we can over stress how important it is to have a modern modern.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:40.440]   It's a modernization.
[00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:45.640]   Because realize that the Mac file system, the Windows file system, all these other file
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:51.160]   systems, they a lot of their have their origins from like 1980 something.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.320]   If I'm not mistaken, some of these operating systems actually still have working code that
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:57.520]   is 20 years old in them.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:01.800]   And none of these things foresaw the idea of having something something like this, a
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:07.400]   volume that's this big that can be mounted and unmounted in a second that has 64 gigabytes
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.200]   per the storage in it.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:15.160]   And also they didn't anticipate technology that's not like a spinning magnetic disk with
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.480]   the latency and the safety problems that you have with a spinning disk.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.760]   What happens when you try to put that same file system on electrons, excuse me, on silicon,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:26.440]   it's not the same thing the way that these things are designed to hold files.
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:30.960]   The things that are safe for a spinning disk are not safe for moving electrons around.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.080]   So you really it is the sort of thing where you do have to nuke the planet and start all
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.080]   over again. This he really only the only way to have a truly modern system.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:42.000]   So there's going to be a lot of bumps for the first year or so, but that's how you get
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.600]   to an operating system that's still viable in 2020.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:49.640]   It's kind of like having a house on wooden pier and posts foundation and taking out the
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.800]   foundation putting in a concrete foundation.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.360]   And they're doing a step by step like it's modular like we got swift one year then they
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.920]   gave us a year to sort of let that settle in and they read it launched and they you know
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:03.120]   they tried to redo discovery but I think they're doing they're doing these modular changes
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:07.600]   to components instead of instead of buying next and getting a whole new operating system
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:11.080]   it's sort of piece by piece they're placing the substructures of all these items.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:16.360]   Speaking of Swift I'm very I'm super gratified by the progress Swift has made.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:21.440]   Swift 3.0 the Swift has been open sourced and now the Swift playgrounds is a way to
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:27.160]   get people kids particularly using iPads into the Swift arena in a in a way that is I think
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:32.480]   a little less patronizing than a lot of the here's how you code software I've seen in
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:39.600]   the past rich are what I presume you're still writing an objective see or you're not writing
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.240]   a Pascal are you?
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.880]   No.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.400]   Not for fan.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:48.760]   I was the first BB edit in Pascal.
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:56.840]   The well yes the the very very first version was in was in object Pascal that was a long
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:02.160]   time ago.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:07.520]   The developments in Swift I've sort of been watching them and peeking in just occasionally
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.240]   I haven't done any work with Swift with Swift I've never written a single line of Swift
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:18.400]   code but that's that's about need and opportunity I think Swift looks like a great language it
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:25.240]   solves a lot of problems that the C family languages have sort of accepted as the price
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:33.920]   of doing business and so I think going forward for writing something new Swift would be a
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:42.480]   really good choice for my specific use case and granted I'm an outlier you know I have
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:49.960]   code that dates back in some cases 30 years and you can't really just sit down and rewrite
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.920]   everything in Swift you wouldn't want to.
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:59.560]   So I have a lot of C I have a lot of objective C I have a lot of C++ and it all plays nicely
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:08.440]   together I have a working system going forward if you know once once the once Swift stops
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:11.840]   changing quite so rapidly.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:15.880]   Yeah the change to three is a significant such a significant change that probably you'll
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.680]   have to re would have to refactor everything I would guess there would be some refactoring
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:28.320]   and retesting and some overhauling and so Swift as great as it is I think today still
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:35.000]   represents very much a moving target and if you're ready to deal with that I say go for
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:44.140]   it if you're if you're sort of up to your eyeballs and the work involved in following
[00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:49.880]   that target is more than you can factor into your scheduling then you know stick with what
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:55.160]   you have objectives he is great it's not going anywhere the compilers keep getting better
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:01.720]   the API's keep getting better and it's a it's a very sound solution.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:07.920]   So if you were starting a project from scratch you'd consider Swift.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:14.360]   Yeah if if I had no baggage if I were starting a project from scratch or I were new to the
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.040]   platform I think Swift is a great place to start.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:21.040]   Would you recommend it for somebody starting out we have a couple of high school actually
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.640]   one high school one college kid who were Apple scholars in the audience today there
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:31.160]   are a lot of kids there including a nine year old at the WWDC which is awesome who have
[00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:32.920]   apps in the app store.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.200]   Would you start in Swift would that be a good place to begin?
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:43.040]   Yes Swift is a Swift is a good way to start the the playgrounds are very interesting that
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:47.840]   the new playground app is very interesting for people who are getting used to the idea
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:57.760]   of just programming anything the notions of control flow and logic and and so forth.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:04.360]   The great thing about Swift as a language is that like many other new or modern language
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:11.200]   it abstracts away or or isolates you from a certain set of mistakes that you tend to
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:17.760]   make when you're learning how to program it's type safe is it not.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:23.360]   To me the biggest feature of Swift is that it doesn't have pointers as a data type that's
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:27.520]   that's not not fully type safe if that but it's something that makes people make a lot
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.520]   of mistakes.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:34.800]   Well you're right it's it's more about it's more about runtime safety you don't have to
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:40.920]   worry about whether something exists or whether something used to exist and now doesn't you
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:47.800]   you express your code you express your idea and if it doesn't work it's because your idea
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:53.720]   or your expression had an error and not because you misplaced a piece of punctuation.
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:50:01.640]   You kind of want the compiler to find buffer overflows and reused of trashed pointers never
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:06.200]   used variables all those things at compile time but you don't want it to have happen
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:11.240]   is that happen at runtime and what you really don't want it to have happen is never which
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:17.960]   allows you know most of the exploits including the very first exploit the Mars worm are related
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:23.600]   buffer overflows writing to an area of memory and then jumping to that area of memory even
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:28.840]   though it's not yours and so I believe in that's type safe language is eliminate that
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:31.840]   I believe Swift is type safe to that extent yeah.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:38.160]   Right exploitable exploitable buffer overflows tend tend to go away yeah entire classes of
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:43.960]   bugs relating right to to the use of pointers go away is it garbage collected or yes no is
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:48.760]   not it's referenced the reference it's it's it's reference counted it garbage collection
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:55.560]   was an idea on the Mac whose time came and when yeah Java is garbage collected Java is
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:01.600]   garbage collected as a as an old friend of mine once said an old friend and one time Java
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:07.240]   programmer he said Java is garbage collected and Java programmers too often take this as
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:11.400]   a license to generate unlimited amounts of garbage right.
[00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:14.560]   Not a good thing.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:21.800]   The other thing is that because Swift is structured in a particular way the compiler and it is
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:31.480]   a compiled language it's based on the LLVM architecture the same the same that the current
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:36.160]   Xcode compiler stack is based on.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:44.000]   The compiler can can make a great many optimizations that were either unsafe or impossible before
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.040]   with C type languages.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:52.480]   So the notion of pointer aliasing where you might have conceivably two pointers looking
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:57.040]   at the same area of memory that goes away.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:03.240]   There's a value model for data so that things come back as values and not pointers to values
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:08.320]   and to make a very long story short it's kind of the compiler writers dream because you can
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:16.000]   just do these crazy things to the generated code and you end up with runtime behavior
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:23.920]   which is just ridiculously fast and you end up with applications that are smaller and faster
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.440]   and at no risk for certain classes of bugs and at low risk for other certain classes of
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:35.520]   bugs and that really kind of makes it a win for for writing shippable products.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:39.600]   You know when apple open source to I thought well first of all that's great but I wondered
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.480]   how many people on other platforms would would look to Swift as a language for them and there
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:51.160]   are a lot of competitors out there clean Google's go.
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:56.320]   Do you think Swift is a language that we're going to see widespread adoption beyond apple?
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:01.200]   Well it's a good question there are two parts to the equation here there's the language and
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:07.440]   then there are the APIs that it talks to right objective C is an open source language clang
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:15.360]   the compiler stack for C languages that came out of LLVM and with heavy contributions from
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:22.680]   apple that's open source to what really makes Mac products Mac products and iOS products
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:28.240]   and watch products are the APIs that they have on the installed OS that the that make
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:31.480]   all of these things possible.
[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:37.600]   And in fact becoming a Mac programmer is the process of learning the APIs as much as
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:39.080]   anything else.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:47.880]   I remember that I had the big I still do the six foot shelf right the wall of paper that
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:55.840]   teaches you how to use the the platform APIs and those things will only be on apples platforms
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:01.720]   right so that that drives adoption that drives developer lock in right.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:08.880]   So yeah Swift is an open source language I can I can totally see that I can see deployments
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:16.840]   on other platforms probably Linux although I think there's a port of LLVM or clang for
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.040]   Windows I'd have to look I don't know.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:27.160]   And so I could see the Swift compiler turning up on different platforms when I don't see
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:33.920]   is the Swift playground experience the the repolup right sure you could do that in a
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:38.840]   terminal but the APIs not being available anywhere but apples platforms.
[00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:44.760]   And I think even not just the API but the library of library routines that that becomes
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:50.200]   something programmers really look for and unless a language is widely adopted you just
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.920]   don't see the libraries and you know right now if you're using Java or Python you've
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:55:01.440]   got you programming is almost just a process of sticking things together so much stuff
[00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.440]   has been written.
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:05.160]   C pan on Pearl.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.520]   One thing that was super interesting yesterday too is they announced a lot of stuff for
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:11.840]   Xcode they do every year but like for example interface builder now has voice over for accessibility
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:16.640]   that's memory book that's terrific and it also can be automated now so you know sound
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:21.080]   even busy there the memory there's a memory debugger which got huge applause from the
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:25.520]   crowd and it even automatically finds leaks which everyone seemed to love a new provisioning
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:29.360]   system so they don't have to do signing actions anymore they you can just configure an issue
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.960]   details no more need to revoke so just a lot of big pain points got pulled away and
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.520]   as much as the language is great the compiler like you said and the developing environment
[00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:39.520]   are also key.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:43.200]   That's an yeah and that's another issue and it's a tough one to know what to do on the
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:49.040]   one hand if a company like Apple provides you free this incredible ID and environment
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:53.160]   there's a lot to be said for that promoting development on that platform but it also completely
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:57.960]   kills the third party ecosystem so you don't see the kind of innovation that you see maybe
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:01.000]   on Java where there's a lot of different ways to do it and people could clean with a
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   chip.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.840]   Well Eclipse was replaced Eclipse to fuel by IntelliJ and Android studio and and so I
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.040]   think that it's it's a tough one because it's great I think it's great I've always celebrated
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:16.080]   the fact that Apple from day one gave you a development environment so Microsoft is here
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.840]   Microsoft is huge I mean they sponsor they've sponsored our party but they also had their
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:24.240]   own huge party and they're trying to get people to use it developers studio to do a lot of
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.240]   work in.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.600]   Yeah sure so they're there.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:31.640]   Microsoft has really started to look across the aisle at Apple and other companies and
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.240]   say well you know we could really develop for them.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.080]   They got Linux on Azure for crying out.
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.680]   I think they're busy with other stuff.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.720]   Alright let's see okay enough of this heavy duty stuff we were really getting under the
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:47.240]   hood there but you know that's if we don't do it I mean this is important I think to
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   our audience and I didn't want to spend an hour talking about all the new features and
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.680]   messages.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.520]   What did I did?
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:57:02.440]   I did kind of hope and I know it was a fool's hope that there would be some cross platform
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:08.480]   support on messages because as it stands right now Apple's solution as good as it is is
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:14.240]   Apple only and if you're using Android you get a very poor experience and most of the
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:22.440]   time I look at my son my son's cohort he's 21 he's in a frat they all have iPhones because
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:26.640]   and if you're on an Android I said is anybody using he says there's one kid and this poor
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:29.800]   kid is left out he's a green bubble.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:34.960]   He doesn't get the bad he doesn't get to play with the other kids and I was really you
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:38.440]   know and Google by the way goes the other way hangouts I'm sure Alo all the stuff that
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:43.800]   they do and what's app is cross platform Facebook is cross platform not Apple but for
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   iOS at least.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:48.560]   Well Windows phone come on you know if you if you're using Windows phone and frat you're
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:51.800]   more than left out I think you probably get beat up a lot of the point I'm trying to make
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.600]   is that Google is really good about supporting things that in hand like any company they
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.840]   really do have to just as Apple yes just as Apple did in the early days they had to make
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.400]   sure they worked with everybody else.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:03.040]   It's not out of the bed like they're not trying to be like this great gifting company that
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:06.200]   says we've got to really support everybody it's like a smart decision for them and they
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:11.080]   want those eyeballs green bubbles you can you could say the other way around that it's
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.560]   smart for Apple to say nope we're not going to let this be multi platform if your friends
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.760]   want to do it you're going to talk well and so it's good business like BBM until it's
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:24.020]   not like because if you're blackberry keeping BBM to yourself is fantastic until you take
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:26.680]   it too long and then what's at beats your lunch did you.
[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:30.360]   Yeah that's exactly that's exactly the problem I think that Apple is facing because if you
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:35.040]   write buses if you write subways if you walk along the streets you see that again Apple
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:41.360]   the iPhone is really just one platform among many and so that I think that a lot of people
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.600]   in the lower schools are not saying oh well I'm going to make sure that I get this phone
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:49.000]   that works with iMessage is going to be I'm going to move on to WhatsApp I'm going to
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.680]   move on to Snapchat I'm going to move to a really cool application that does really
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.760]   wonderful things and because these new messaging apps have to be multi platform it becomes
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.320]   irrelevant what Harper you have I think that's what the thing that really was most of my
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:07.000]   notes as I was writing about the new version of messages was that they really they learned
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.880]   a lesson when they saw how popular the feature where you automatically give yourself big
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:18.560]   eyes and you're vomiting rainbows Apple I think that learned that that taught Apple
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:23.160]   something about maybe if we're trying to convince people we're the more secure messaging platform
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:28.520]   that might not be the feature that's reaching people so it's it's Apple I really I think
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:34.320]   that this is one of those things that five years from now might be a bad choice for Apple
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:39.320]   I'm starting to become more aware of how detached people are getting from the actual
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:45.000]   hardware and how attached they're getting to third party services so I I wish for messages
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.160]   to become a third party service pursuing walk in is is a double edged sword and there's
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:54.480]   two there's two legal table one Apple had their own custom Snapchat filter WDC so I mean they're
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.760]   getting used to put stuff anywhere but you know like they started putting things in tumblr
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.800]   and started putting things into I forget the name of that Apple you swipe different
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:06.880]   they're putting their stuff where their users are now and they they put a WDC filter in
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.480]   Snapchat but also I mean like people companies in general they want to protect what makes
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.920]   the money and they want to fragment what makes their competitors money and for now I message
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:20.240]   as a chair is an incredible value add for iPhone it might not always be that way and at
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.720]   that point they're gonna have to make a hard decision about whether they want to transition
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:30.600]   to being a platform or a services play and not a value add to iPhone but at the same time
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.960]   the value that they do provide is is real and as long as it's your core technology as
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.960]   long as you own an iPhone it's the same as if you own a box if you are input zero you're
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:45.080]   always only one announcement away from reclaiming a massive amount of your users if your service
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.840]   sucks and people go in the install a third party app or they install a competitive service
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.280]   and then you have like a WDC and you make something so phenomenal they're gonna come
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.600]   back because it'll be the default option in the next version they install so Apple's
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.680]   working from is working from the high ground for now but it is that point in time when
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.040]   that blackberry that blackberry messenger moment when at what point in time could you
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:07.080]   have to let go because you no longer have sufficient control over that ecosystem.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:12.040]   It also increases the degree of difficulty for Apple and that means that messages has
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:19.600]   to work there is no excuse for it not working especially because they have made it in in
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:26.280]   extra inextricable from MMS messaging this morning for instance I overslept I did not
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.800]   make it to breakfast as planned with a friend of mine and so I'm reaching over to my nightstand
[01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:36.080]   that has an iPad on it I could have sent a message using messages and I thought no I
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.720]   don't think that's the most reliable tool if I use any other tool but messages I am sure
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.920]   that they will get it if I send it using messages there's a possibility that messages will say
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:52.360]   oh as has happened one time last year oh let's see the last the last place where this user
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:56.640]   use messages was in his office so instead of routing it to his iPhone I'm gonna send
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:02.920]   this to his desktop and so as I've seen that exact phenomenon myself in in different situations
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:08.560]   and it has sort of driven me to to use Google Hangouts because most of the people I know
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:14.040]   have Google accounts and the ones that don't don't use anything and I have to use SMS with
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:21.960]   them but I have seen similar rely I have similar beef with messages I find that just supremely
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:27.840]   annoying how when when something comes in over over I message I hear about on all four
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:34.560]   devices that are within arms reach it's like how is it interesting to find me on the device
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:40.240]   that I'm currently using their model in some ways the iOS is very security first and in
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.320]   some ways it's sort of letting the engineers run the place which is very different from
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:47.400]   what Apple's usual philosophy is but for example there's no sync it's not like an iMap thing
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.640]   where it just all your devices have access to this pool of your iMessage is on a server
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:55.200]   each iMessage gets generated and sent and then it's almost like a unique iMessage for
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.160]   every device and it tries to deliver those for several days I think it's 8 to 10 and
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.760]   if it can't those messages are obliterated they're not stored anywhere so you can't just
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:07.000]   go in a year later suddenly reclaim all your iMessage but because of that you get issues
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.800]   like some devices get it first because it's a unique message and it just happens to get
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:16.080]   their first or conversations splinter apart because Andy messaged iMessage me from his
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.600]   iPad but now he's on his Android phone and because it does end to end encryption it can't
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:24.280]   tell till the last second then he's no longer sure that it's Andy so we'll put that in an
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:28.040]   encrypted group chat and ask to like make out a new thing to put it in so we pay the
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:32.200]   price sort of for for some of the security stuff they built into it you didn't you you
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.680]   knew Renee that there was no way they were going to do an Android version yes you were
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:40.120]   trying to talk us out of it but the rumor mill said there might do you think that there
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:44.960]   might be one and then and Apple itself is going through this debate Apple is a company
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.920]   that you know anytime a blogger or journalist or an analyst or anybody speculates about
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.480]   this stuff Apple has billions and billions of dollars and is generally smart enough to
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.360]   have prototyped it and or explore the idea of it we're not the only ones who could think
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.680]   of it I guess no and again like if if you and Andy and Rich and I had billions of dollars
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.560]   and we were saying hey you know a toaster fridge maybe that would be great I have a
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.320]   billion dollars Bob can you make me a toaster fridge during the commercial break and we'll
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.400]   see yeah you know so I have no doubt they made they made beats and beats they announced
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:19.400]   again yesterday the new the new music app is shipping for iPhone iPad windows and Android
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:24.280]   so our iTunes on Windows at least an Android so in that case the service is more important
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.000]   to Apple than the device log ins lock in so they're they are absolutely making that for
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.840]   Android and so and they did a pretty good job at it so they know how to make Android apps
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.520]   now but Apple again like they're not famous for us to be a services company they're not
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.420]   famous for a cross-platform and also they would have to support potentially a billion
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:45.720]   Android users hitting that that might be the larger reason that you just don't want to
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:50.440]   get down for weeks when it went cross-platform and other services that immense problems scaling
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:54.760]   some of them like what's up is phenomenal now but if you the way Apple architect that
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.960]   it just adding a billion users is a non-trivial they may see the strategic point of having
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.000]   an Android version and they made to have a technical issue with doing it that's a very
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.960]   good point member BBM it was built in a in a time and place where they thought they would
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.560]   never be people with more than one device they would just it never occurred to them so
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.320]   you had a unique pin and they had to end up using exchange as a layer their arch enemy
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:20.400]   had to be a layer on top to sort of try to figure out multiple device universes so what's
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.920]   up still has that problem it's not your phone number which is a I think a real limitation
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.920]   I think the real risk to Apple is Facebook Messenger at this point and I think more and
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:34.480]   more Apple was playing catch up of course with Facebook Messenger features and Snapchat
[01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:39.880]   features but more and more that's the one that that runs the risk of being totally cross-platform
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:44.240]   and totally dominating you have to have a when also you only have to Facebook count anymore
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.360]   because they made it so you can have Facebook Messenger without even which was the big barrier
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.040]   of entry to some people right they wanted nothing to do with Facebook right on the other
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.920]   you go ahead Facebook is just such a huge problem because it really is it's it's such
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:06:02.840]   a fundamental resource resource for normal humans because it really it got unfortunately
[01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:08.680]   Facebook had to get got me finally last year because I was I was in the bunker I was surrounded
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:14.480]   by ammo my clips were run and dry I tried to defend my bunker against Facebook and finally
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:20.160]   it came to here is here is the bullet that I used to take my own life or here is the white
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:27.360]   flag I raise to say that okay I want to know what's going I want my my family members particularly
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:32.560]   to have contact in my life and for me to see these little moments of my nieces and my nephews
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:36.560]   lives that I'm missing out on because they will not print these out into postcards and
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:41.600]   send them to me using an anonymous Dropbox that I rent in Santa Fe, New Mexico and so
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.640]   but it really is for everybody so it's it really is the thing where if people are going to
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.280]   start using Facebook messenger they don't care that it's not terribly secure they don't care
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.640]   that Facebook is looking at their data all they want to do is be able to talk to their
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.680]   friends and their family members so apple really has another thing I was thinking when
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:04.800]   they're going through this demo was that part of apples job is not just to implement
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.920]   really great security features and make that as part of their way of life but also to explain
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.360]   to people why this is such a valuable thing for them to do you can't just simply say hey
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.760]   we've made this messaging app secure you're welcome I'm now going to stand here and let
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.240]   you throw flowers at me you really have to say here is why we think this is so important
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:30.240]   and we're going to try to lure you into messages by making it into as fun and as as
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.000]   current and experience as you may be getting on non-secure platforms well I do we're going
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.360]   to take a break I do want to talk about differential privacy because this is how apple is answering
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:46.640]   the really interesting question how do you make a platform a number of platforms that are private
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:52.240]   that are secure but still offer the kinds of features that Facebook and Google are willing to offer
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:56.560]   by collating information about you and apple says the solution is differential privacy and
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:02.000]   I'm curious whether you guys think this is enough whether it'll work we'll talk about that and music
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:09.200]   too didn't see in a new iTunes anywhere out there music app though but even the new music app wasn't
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.520]   greatly changed but they had some changes that might make a big difference again brand new design
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:18.720]   language yeah we saw three different instances of this brand new design language a lot of mention
[01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:22.400]   of hey we have a brand new design line and they may have simply fixed something that was causing a
[01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:27.840]   lot of pain the the issue of not confusing streamed versus downloaded yeah music we'll talk about that
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:33.200]   in just a second our show today by the way great to have you rich seagull bear bones software if
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:39.360]   you're not using BB editor text wrangler you ought to be um for a long time use your jimbo
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:45.200]   I for a long time use your mail program what else what else are you doing is it is it all are you
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:52.880]   all in on the BB edit is that it at the moment yes I mean we don't really talk about things that
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:57.440]   we're working on and not shipping will you sound like apple or something car you're gonna carly
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:02.560]   oh yeah use the phrase use the phrase use the phrase match the mazing shareholder value
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:09.920]   no way mumble mumbles something leveraging synergies but you're really ought to be using BB edit
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.680]   and if you want to just try the free version of it i'm really glad you went back to using
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:19.360]   to offering a free text wrangler it's just it's just such a great program and I understand your
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.440]   conundrum because it's so good I think a lot of people say well what do I need BB edit for you
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:28.720]   you need BB edit you need as just for the it's my single favorite feature BB edit
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.920]   I wish every operating system had something like this you got to do a Linux version rich
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:42.160]   the the worksheets I mean yes the shell worksheets are so awesome yeah can I just can I just say that
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:48.640]   not only is BB edit a better product BB edit is that product where you will like text edit so
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:52.880]   much you will think I really want rich and the rest of the BB edit team to have some money
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.240]   yes even if you want to just buy BB edit and never use it just knowing that you've bought a
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.720]   bunch of copies for some very talented and hardworking developers that's worth the price of vision
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.040]   so no Linux version in the end you know I get to have meat that week yeah
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:14.000]   yeah it's hard rich but yeah also if rich feeds the birds again these these teacup dinosaurs
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:18.960]   there's less chance that they will go hungry and start to go after him and a family yeah they
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:25.840]   they are amazing predators I didn't want to bring it up but yeah I'm glad I'm glad you know what
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:31.440]   BB edit has been around forever it is the text editor for the Macintosh if you're not if you're
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.760]   not using it get it you can try it and without I appreciate that without giving too much away
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:42.320]   we're working on an update and there are no secrets here it's it's been in public beta on the BB edit
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:49.040]   talk google group for a while and we've made a change to the demo model and so you have a chance
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:55.600]   to try it out nice before we release it nice that's all I'm gonna say also well also I'm a journalist
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.000]   so my friendship with rich means that I have to be honest I have to point something out to my
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.880]   readers my listeners he didn't know he was going to be podcasting today he kind of rushed it so I
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:09.200]   think you can actually see some samples of the BB edit watch on the background of his from his
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:16.000]   feet there oh you forgot to put the curtain over it all the new BB edit watch oh
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:25.120]   hide the backdrop seriously Linux version rich what do you think any any chance a shot when
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:30.800]   Linux becomes a platform where people can make a living I am all over god i'd love to have it i
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:34.320]   heard i heard that this is the year of Linux on the desktop it actually may
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:41.200]   be i feel like we've really made some some progress and and the and the only reason is there's you
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.840]   know there are a lot of editors there's Adam from github there's sublime which has always been great
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:52.800]   but they're all wonky could be at it you are still the gold standard damn it
[01:11:52.800 --> 01:12:01.040]   that's okay you know what with with the new file system some of the changes apples making to
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:07.200]   Mac OS looks pretty good it looks pretty good i'm glad to see my real fear the reason one of the
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:12.720]   reasons i started going looking more seriously at desktop Linux is i was afraid apple was kind of
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:18.800]   losing interest in OS 10 and it doesn't look that way now i really feels like Mac OS is
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.920]   is a happen and thing i was very grateful to apple for doing that making that
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:28.880]   our show today brought to you by the folks that host my website it's web hosting
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.320]   and web soft uh where that gives you the best possible experience i'm talking about square
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.800]   space if you go to leola port.com you'll see my square space site it started you know they got me
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.880]   in there you know with it with the cover page feature i thought well that's easy i can just make
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.720]   a cover page tells people where to find my instagram and facebook and twitter and i can put some
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:52.320]   slash slideshow up there oh this is fun oh and you start doing that that was so easy and now well
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.600]   maybe i want to put a blog in there in a calendar and a photo portfolio and it's all there and i love
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:04.960]   it square space it's so easy the best hosting it never ever goes down they are so committed to
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:10.480]   your uptime by the way my site is not an example of how beautiful square space could be but maybe
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:14.720]   your site will be because they give you these incredible templates and what's great about the
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:20.640]   square space templates is not only their their the top designers making these but the engineering
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:27.520]   underneath is state of the art and with the web as i have learned at great expense keeping up
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:33.200]   with the state of the art is not easy it is not inexpensive let them do the work let them hire
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.880]   the designers the engineers let them give you that mobile responsive design that means one website
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:45.120]   serves any size screen and looks great on every single size let them do the e-commerce so you
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.600]   don't have to if you want to sell every square space template as commerce built in whether you're
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.640]   a designer a photographer a filmmaker and i have to say people who are artists are particularly in
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.440]   love with square space because it aesthetically it feeds you it gives you a page that looks like
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:07.520]   your aesthetic musicians love it but also bloggers love it square space is a design for you and if
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:13.280]   you're doing a newsletter or a magazine they have these new five new magazine style templates
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.800]   that are i mean again this is great i mean this is the current state of the art in web design the
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:24.880]   grid style landing page the infinite scroll the related posts at the bottom all of that and you
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:31.280]   don't have to hire a designer they did the work to make it look incredible you also get author profiles
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.720]   and a search field in the header let's the readers get to where you this is great why why i'm created
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.600]   content management system with square space has done it all for you and by the way they do sell
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:48.480]   domains now so if you have an idea but you really are aren't ready to create the website they have
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:54.000]   200 different top level domains dot just dot com dot net but everything you can buy it from
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.240]   square space domains and you get a gorgeous clean spam free parking page so that you don't have to
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:03.840]   do anything you're you've got the page and then when you're ready to start building you just get
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:10.080]   right down to it uh they if you are a square space regular and i know many of us are if you've
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:14.720]   created a three or more active square space websites you can access the new square space circle this
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:19.760]   is kind of cool it's kind of a frequent flyer club for square space members it includes advanced
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:25.600]   guys optimized support six month trial periods for new projects and more uh lots of lots of pros
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:32.320]   have built businesses using square space uh as they're hosting and as they're as they're commerce

[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:15.520]   differential privacy okay so i love the idea here's apples conundrum we want to give you all of the
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:21.120]   great features that google now provides we would love to scan your email and give you you know
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:28.480]   automatically put your boarding passes in your flight itinerary and into your an app but we don't
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:35.280]   we our selling point is security and privacy and and it's really how we sell against android and
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:41.440]   facebook and other things but we would like to do this and in fact we've they showed they said you
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.280]   know it was kind of a me too moment yes we've got our machine learning what do they call it deep
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:52.960]   learning same thing yep yes we've got that but we've figured out a way based on research from
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:59.600]   professor at university of pennsylvania they quoted him to do uh to aggregate information
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:06.000]   about our users without invading their personality they call it differential privacy Renee what that
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.520]   is that it's super interesting so apple of course apple's been doing machine learning and
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.880]   artificial intelligence for years if you look at the way they do traffic modeling if you look at
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:18.000]   the way they've done serie all of that requires a huge amount of data that then improves uh the
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.160]   quality of those services uh but the problem is that no one could really scale this you had to
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:26.560]   make very individual silos you couldn't sort of look for any patterns well news is an example because
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:32.240]   when they released news they said yes and we will adjust news based on your preferences if you
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:36.080]   say if you show by clicking on these articles that you like this kind of stuff will give you more of
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.800]   it well how you going to do that and if you don't share the data with the cloud how you going to do
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:45.360]   it on my ipad am i phone that's the challenge share yeah and they didn't share between their own
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:50.400]   services either i mean they had that whole thing on there so uh differential privacy has been
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.760]   something that is it's been the academic community for a while and you can go find the papers of the
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.000]   doctor that they they mentioned is it's really high level brilliant book as they said
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:05.920]   absolutely and it's way beyond my math about what's interesting is is uh he's not just asserting
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:11.040]   that there so it's anonymizing data yeah and so what it does is it gets really really good example
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.960]   so let's say we have rich and we have andy and one of them believes in using spaces and one of
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:20.000]   them believes in using tabs in their code and this is a vicious argument this is a vicious
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:28.480]   by the way rich spaces are tabs tabs oh god all right so this is the actual
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:33.840]   data that's okay but your wife thought she was saying apple said that they wanted to find out
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:37.440]   what their developers did so they were gonna find they were gonna actually analyze this data but
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:41.760]   they didn't want anyone to know who answered what because wars would start friendships would be
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.320]   destroyed marriages would end so they needed to do it in a way that was anonymous so what happens is
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:53.200]   they take the data and they add noise to it and then that data gets uploaded to apple and
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:57.200]   there's then there's enough noise that they can't really tell who you are but when they step back
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:01.440]   and they get enough quantity samples they could a pattern still emerges and they figured out that
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:06.240]   I think it was 60% of people use spaces or or some number like that yeah that by itself is not
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.560]   useful what you really want to know is what is rich's preference so we can put that across the
[01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:15.520]   board and they can even do that without yes de-anonymizing rich which I find it's sort of fascinating
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:18.880]   it's a really bad example but if you ever look at those paintings that look like just a bunch
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.320]   of dots but then you get to the perfect distance and suddenly it's a horse yeah but then you
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:30.400]   okay they did give the professor does give an example yeah frequently in uh in a job application
[01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:36.320]   you're asked uh have you ever been arrested for a crime and what you'd like to do is answer that
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:42.560]   without answering that in other words so uh what they do is they give you two this is this is a
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:46.320]   very rudimentary example they give you two questions the first question is flip a coin
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:52.400]   if it's had had's lie in the next question if it's tales tell the truth in the next question
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:55.920]   yes and then the next question is have you ever been arrested for committing a crime
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:03.120]   they can't so now they've got a lot of data but it's fuzzed because we don't know if if
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:08.960]   Renee answered truthfully or or lied but we can statistically look at that data eliminate
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:15.600]   the coin results and know furthermore apparently there's some way to know without identifying
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.520]   whether you as an individual did or didn't it's bizarre it's a massive benefit but in the final
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:26.560]   point I want to make is it's he says and this is the important thing because you can make a lot
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:32.800]   of claims we've heard claims that oh yeah we remember Netflix anonymized the data about what
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.360]   movies you watched and then some bright reporter put it together with IMDB and said well that's
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.480]   clearly yours and so that metadata was sufficient that you could identify somebody they say this is
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:47.520]   mathematically provable to be unidentifiable and the super interesting thing is that if you're
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:50.880]   in a high-density city like San Francisco they don't have to add as much noise because there's
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.880]   so many people around you that the data set is is complicated enough but if you're in a rural
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:59.120]   community and there's very few people doing what you're doing they add a much more noise
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.600]   because it is much easier to figure out the individuals there but it's also rate-controlled so if you're
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:07.520]   hitting that system over and over and over again it becomes easier to identify you so they stop
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.680]   taking data at a certain point to make sure that they can't identify you just based on frequency of
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:15.840]   use of a similar service at a similar time so they're doing several vectors there to make sure
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:20.640]   that that data is as anonymous as possible and the result is you get a huge sampling set and the
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:24.800]   ability to do that statistical analysis without that being back you can't go back the other way
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.720]   it's like a one-way mirror you can see through it but you can't go back to it and find out the
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:34.800]   individual people or what their individual preferences are. Again super fascinating stuff
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.840]   and they do it at scale it's baked into the system which is also interesting it's not just a one-off
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:45.920]   for that certain app. Right I got the most frustrating response to a tech email which is that actually
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:51.200]   this is someone I know who would know what they're talking about they are in research they know
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.600]   of this so that's really really exciting I can tell you all about it but I'm actually on vacation
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:01.120]   up so I can talk we can talk next week and I'm like okay. Apple has been a little bit
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:06.720]   you know they have been not completely forthright about how they're implying this they use the
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.360]   phrase differential privacy and hashing and they refer to the professor but that was that.
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:17.760]   There's a lot of question marks still in this and one of the biggest ones still is how is this
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:24.800]   automatically better than whatever Google is doing right now because I think that
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:29.200]   Google has demonstrated that at least for the data you give them it doesn't leave Google in any
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:35.040]   meaningful way they will sell access to you from the outside but they will not sell the information
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:40.160]   they use to give an outside person access to you and we have millions and billions of people that
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:44.560]   are perfectly fine with that that relationship with Google and Facebook so that's part of the issue
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:50.400]   too is that Facebook that messenger issue which is a lot of people don't care yeah and also
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:56.640]   two other things from this is that Apple has to this is the first time that Apple has really
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:01.600]   talked about artificial intelligence and the words they use to get around use so they wouldn't be
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:07.440]   using deep learning whereas Google has used this as a tent pole feature of here is what you get when
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:12.720]   you use Google products and services so that's not this so the fact that your data is being
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:16.720]   hashed and anonymized is not the thing that people are going to be really really interested in
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:22.240]   seeing they're going to be hey I have my husband my wife has an android phone and they swipe left
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:27.280]   to the Google now page and it has everything that is important to them at that moment almost as though
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:31.920]   this device is psychic Apple what products and services are going to give me to make my phone
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:37.680]   as useful as that so it's but the on the other side of that is that Apple got a lot of flak
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:42.960]   a few weeks ago after the Google I/O keynote about how Apple is losing the AI war they're using
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:48.080]   the intelligence war we just don't Apple does not work the way that Google works they're
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:52.720]   their artificial intelligence and their ability to analyze data and make good use of it on behalf
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:57.040]   of the users could be at least as good as Google's but you would never know about it because they're
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:02.080]   not making that a promotable thing so we're gonna have to see exactly how things work a lot of
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:07.040]   when they talked about photos for instance they introduced a lot of features that seem
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:11.920]   awfully similar to anybody who's been using Google photos for the past year but we're going to have
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.120]   to see how well they implement that I really do think that if people
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:23.040]   if people realize that I can do a search on Google photos for a picture of my aunt
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:29.520]   aunt Ophelia in front of some sort of old building holding a dog and get a search result
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:37.760]   and with Google you can say with the Apple you can only say lady animal color and get 20 responses
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:42.640]   of which three are correct they're not going to care so much about about hash I'm more interested in
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:48.640]   this as sort of like a when you see the lock sign on the top of a web page and you are assured by
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.760]   that that okay whatever I'm doing on this web page if I'm logging in and typing in secure
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:01.200]   financial data that green lock informs me that it's being done in a secure fashion if this were an
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:06.400]   open standard that Google will say okay fine we can do that too we can also do everything we
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.200]   need to do with our business with that thank you apple for letting people for developing this and
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:16.800]   promoting this because we just simply added the added the the mow lock that also says that your
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:22.160]   data is being anonymized and hash so it's just like the new file system this is interesting stuff
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.720]   we're going to have to sit on this and look at it for another year to find out whether it's actually
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:31.920]   important to users the way it's implemented yeah just like that we have options I mean I think
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.320]   it's really important for consumers and like when the Edward Snowden thing broke I didn't really
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.440]   know the extent of surveillance and it's one point like well they're just doing surveillance
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.720]   but then he's like well a couple my friends are checking out their ex-girlfriends you know and
[01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:46.880]   that's the kind of relevant revelations you get and I you know I trust Google I use Google
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:52.080]   services all the time but you're only ever one you know one smoking wheels whistleblower away from
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:56.160]   like yeah all my friends at Google are scanning through all the bikini pictures and doing yada yada
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.160]   yada and then suddenly these things really matter to you and if you had no alternative it was all
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:04.240]   Facebook and Google and you know some other micros maybe a LinkedIn based service that would be it
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:09.040]   it would just be the reality in which we live but even if this provides part partial service not
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:14.320]   as much as Google as a consumer I might be paranoid I might be incredibly paranoid unreasonably paranoid
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:20.000]   but at least I have an option to assuage my paranoia I'm thrilled to have the choice however I want
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.080]   to make sure that Apple's not just doing hand waving and marketing speak that there's some
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:30.400]   actually they're actually doing this for instance uh Craig Federighi said uh in this photos thing
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:36.800]   it's all done on device yes that doesn't I'm I don't think that makes any sense yes the power
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.000]   processors powerful enough you might argue that there's not enough ram on the device
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:46.560]   certainly not as much as you could get on the cloud but more importantly all your pictures
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:51.280]   you may have many pictures in the cloud that are not on your device yeah but the thing can't it
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:57.200]   really be on device they start on the device is not the same as saying it's all on the device
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:02.080]   well they remember that the full-sized versions of these photos are not on your device but usable
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:08.400]   thumbnails and loot usable screen level versions of them are on the device of all my photos of anything
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.760]   that's going to be accessible by this I realize that to any conversation we're having today we're
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:19.440]   talking about like 24 hours after getting stationed I have I have spoken to what might be termed a
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:24.640]   source very close to this project and the way that this person explained it to me I'm looking for
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.480]   the email right now so I can surf out anything that I could be I might be able to say well you're
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.800]   asking the right question though that you're asking the same question I am is yeah basically
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:38.880]   basically and I do not mean I mean this as a as a flat comment sometimes at this level I have to
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:43.840]   ask dumb questions about the new file system I have to ask dumb questions about this anonymization
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:48.560]   I have to ask dumb questions about how this all works on device because it is such a big concept
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:54.000]   that if it comes contrary to what we understand about how things work so suffice to say that they
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:28:00.880]   believe that it will work fine on device and that when you if there that there will not be a need
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:05.680]   to go off device for that and they can do that without compromising the amount of stores is
[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:09.120]   available on your device so it's not so they're going to have to have a corpus of data that should
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:13.600]   be living off someplace else and they have to make sure that lives on your device itself the question
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:19.200]   that I need to refine I'm just being open here is the the airplane question which is what if you
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:23.600]   are on the airplane all your radios are turned off what will this be able to do with search of the
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:28.080]   data that's on my device and what and what can it because it's not just the data that's on your
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:32.720]   device it's the history of everything that you have put into this device in this service over the
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:37.760]   past couple of years so a lot a lot questions remain unanswered but I did get I did get an answer to
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:42.320]   the question that this should work all on device it's not as though you will have a you have reached
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.800]   the end of the internet please turn back when you try to use it's not some special meaning of
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   on device so special apple meaning of on device I don't know they bought a comfort out
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:55.760]   I don't believe so they bought a company I think it was from France a couple a little while ago
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:00.160]   that specialized on doing on device object recognition and landscape recognition and it was it was
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.960]   fairly good and they have the benefit of having custom silicon that that in many ways is optimized
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:09.760]   for things that just off the shelf silicon isn't so they they're they're spending currency that they
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:14.560]   get based on their hard work I certainly do not gain say the fact that this is super fast
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:22.880]   processor in there but I question I mean I for instance is there hinting done I mean is your phone
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:27.520]   in the background always working on these photos it would make much more sense it'd be much more
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:34.160]   efficient for this to be done server side well it can it can remember that part of this technology
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:40.160]   is that it can ask questions of a server and get a response back without compromising the security
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:46.480]   of the data or of the user so it really will be a question of what happens when I go board the
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:53.520]   plane I turn things off I've got a thousand photos accessible in my on photo on device library and I
[01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:59.680]   want to find on to sell in front of an alpaca outside during sunlight can it be able to surface
[01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:05.760]   that for me automatically will still be able to if I've taken a a cajillion photos during my
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:09.600]   vacation remember the one of the coolest features they demonstrated is we're going to try to figure
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:13.840]   out what these moments are like and what these experiences were like and collate them together
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:20.880]   will I be able to go play replay my my my weekend Branson Missouri without having to wait for
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:25.280]   something to cash back from a server we just don't know the sort of stuff but I've been it's been
[01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:30.720]   explained at the at the first grade level that to me that I believe that it will work I just don't
[01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:36.560]   know the details yeah I don't doubt that the processor is fast enough but that that's not the
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:41.680]   only constrained resource on a phone and battery life is a significant they constrained resource you
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:47.360]   don't want the phone churning on stuff in the background yeah but I just I have a feeling that
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:50.480]   we got to keep looking at this because I have a feeling what's going to come out is as well
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:55.280]   it's mostly on device I don't I don't think they do it that way but but I will say that we've
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:31:00.720]   been talked about this really for the past two generations of iPads and iPhones that the CPUs seem
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:06.640]   suspiciously overpowered for what they seem to be doing today so I believe there's still
[01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:11.440]   enough overhead left for them to do that kind of crunching on device and it was not a CPUs either
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:21.760]   say again it's not just CPUs either current handheld devices iPhones and iPads in context
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:28.560]   have tremendous amounts of of hardware on them there is a CPU whose capabilities should not be
[01:31:28.560 --> 01:31:36.320]   underestimated there are GPUs which keep getting faster and faster and able to do more and more
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:42.000]   per clock cycle the cameras the pipelines between the camera and the rest of the machine
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:50.480]   is pretty big so I can and I say this without any direct knowledge but I can imagine a situation
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:57.760]   in which camera data is analyzed as it flows out of the camera into the rest of the machine and
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:03.760]   you can do that pretty efficiently with a with the sort of vector unit that you'll find in
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:12.480]   in GPUs these days in the GPUs on on the device so that same hardware that for example makes
[01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:20.880]   gameplay really amazing on these devices can be used for other purposes yeah but it doesn't
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:26.400]   fit for mass parallel data certainly certainly I'll give you an example though I take photos
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:32.960]   with a variety of cameras all of them get uploaded to Google photos where it in server side does all
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:39.760]   of this deep artificial intelligence analysis and finds all the gorillas in the mist and
[01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:47.280]   and that works quite well apple won't be able to do that or will they I think I don't care to
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:53.600]   get all your phone your cameras yeah well but they but photo I photo does does it not so
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:58.560]   yeah so the interesting so it's a company called Persepio that they bought and they
[01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:02.960]   specialized in deep learning that didn't require linking to external databases in order to identify
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:07.760]   the contents of a scene so it wasn't that it wasn't online it didn't have to go and co-mingle your
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:13.760]   data that's the kind of fudge words that I'm thinking of like well we're not co-mingling data but
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:21.200]   it's so it's but it's I mean all right I just I I'm skeptical and I think it's great to say well
[01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:26.320]   there's all sorts of magic in the phone it's completely possible I'd like to see evidence and I'm just
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.560]   looking at your point Leo like if you have if you have photos on your iPad and on your iPhone does
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:34.640]   it have to identify them on each separate device right you have a method of identifying them
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:38.480]   placing that data in there sinking its iCloud photo library and when it comes back down to your
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:42.320]   iPad it already has a date or does it have to go back and re-crunch everything on every device
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:46.240]   that you put every photo on because it really wants to be a local and local only and those are sort of
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:50.800]   though that's a use case it's probably not ideal for people one thing we had heard there was a
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:57.200]   rumor that the iCloud would become a trust no one system are they did they say I can't remember if
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:02.400]   they said that only you will have the key to your iCloud data or does Apple still have the
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:09.200]   opposite they created a sharing I forget what's called C casees share share or CK share where you
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:12.880]   can now find great control permissions of who gets access to what part of your iCloud
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.960]   interesting so you can you can make sure you could choose it to be that private yeah some things you
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:20.480]   could share with friends that's a good way to do it because then you can say look I'm privacy
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:26.560]   focused and I'm willing to give up functionality for full privacy and make that choice on the phone
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:31.120]   believe me look I mean I use Google and I share everything and I don't really care and I'm not
[01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:35.200]   I'm not that privacy focused but what I don't want to do is just let Apple off the hook and
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:41.040]   asserting that it protects privacy I want to see the details it's you know there's you know there's
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:44.960]   a difference in marketing speak and actually doing the iOS 10 security white paper is going to be a
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:51.920]   really good read exactly yeah it's it's typical WWWDC stuff where we hear the announcement and then
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:55.840]   we wait for the rest of the week for the sessions and then a week later we actually have
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:00.240]   the opportunity for analysis right so really really interesting demo also it's also by the way
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:07.120]   interesting in what it can make the make Apple products more saleable through enterprise and
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:11.200]   particularly through government ours tatnica had a really interesting article I think it was just
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:18.320]   posted today speculating that Obama has switched from his blackberry to to a Samsung Galaxy 4
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:24.160]   s4 because he was on the he was on the Jimmy Fallon show and Jimmy Fallon made a joke but
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.600]   he still used the blackberry loser and he said no I've switched to a smartphone now I've
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:35.920]   not using the blackberry anymore and because only the only smartphone that has been approved by the
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:42.160]   defense department agency that can that provides communications equipment to the White House
[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:48.880]   is the s4 partly because of how strong a lot of the encryption a lot of the privacy and security is
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:54.480]   plus of course the ability for the dod to actually add and modify stuff to it because I think you need
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:36:00.320]   something better than what people use to protect their their their their newty picks on their device
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.880]   it be it's this could be an investment in the future for Apple to be able to say that look
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:10.080]   whatever whatever rule you have to come up with to be able to use our devices in a hospital to be
[01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:16.880]   able to use our devices in a government facility to use the devices when you are dealing when you're
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:22.000]   an analyst who is being entrusted with really really secure world-changing market-changing data
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.160]   we are able to meet every single one of those things we are the most secure private device
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:32.160]   on the planet because of a bcde it's kind of sad that the president has to use it as a
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:37.360]   certification is like remember they have to get me to say it takes years i mean that's a three-year
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:41.680]   old phone and i stand and then they also there's all sorts of stuff that has to go on i understand
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.280]   they used to have i think something as a cure phone it was windows mobile even i know the first
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:51.360]   phone he got eight years ago was a windows mobile phone yeah i think something else that's going on
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.040]   behind the scenes and this was actually in the news not long ago is apple hired
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:57.920]   um this individual named john callis
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:11.680]   and his remit is unclear but he is a long time uh deeply competent expert in things security and
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:17.840]   cryptographic he's from silent circle which is he's from silent circle he's from pgp yeah i mean
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:20.800]   he's it and what's interesting his experience is an open source
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:27.200]   encrypt crypto which and the best crypto out there right now yeah and not but not just that you know
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.800]   user experiences and and sort of this intersection between crypto and and user experience which has
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:37.840]   always been a difficult one yeah um you know he started his career in the 80s at digital equipment
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:45.680]   and he he knows of what he speaks and he knows of what he does and he is going to be working with
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:51.680]   a bunch of other really deeply competent people and i think that says a lot about how
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:38:00.160]   invested apple is in this uh in in these issues in the issues of data privacy and data security
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:07.120]   um not just in the wake of the the san burnadino phone thing but i think generally as it relates
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:14.240]   to their customers yeah it's clearly it's important to them they they might consider user data to be
[01:38:14.240 --> 01:38:20.480]   an asset from which revenue can be derived that's what google does but i think the fashion
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:26.560]   in which they go about deriving revenue from from customer data is going to be very different
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:35.440]   they they seem to be interested in uh driving hardware sales they want to use their customer data to
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:42.000]   to create software experiences which in turn drive hardware sales it's it's a tough calendar for
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:49.600]   apple because of course uh the most useful uh insights into customers would require
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:56.160]   you know in vaying in their privacy um and uh and and google's and facebook have shown a complete
[01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:01.760]   willingness to do that and they'd like to not do that but still provide some utility i forgot to
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:06.000]   mention such as open source apple open source their new compression technology yesterday i
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:10.720]   really wanted simple fibble something something simple fibble it's a bad time
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.520]   yeah i know it was a very compression of russian russian name somewhere the funniest one is
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:21.360]   broccoli which is google's google's new compression format which sounds like broccoli but is not
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:28.880]   yeah it's twice as tasty um are those those xip files i don't what is this new format this new
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:37.120]   it was a one-lane file zip zip full some simple lemple lemple ziv is the current uh lz uh system
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:42.320]   this is a update to that yeah uh i'm totally blank on the name because it's a bunch of gobbledygook
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:47.360]   initials it sounds like mistleplik to me every time i hear it but yeah so but it was announced
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:56.960]   oh llz lz fse that yes lemple ziv finite state entropy that yes oh here we go an xip file is a
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:06.560]   digitally signed archive ah there's a there's a huge i think area that that would be you know
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:11.360]   very valuable i mean we've got you know it's all goes hand-in-hand there's security there's privacy
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:16.640]   and there's authentication and uh strong authentication is something i would love to see these companies
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:23.920]   work harder on it's it is the source of a reference yeah yeah it's a huge i i'm well for instance we've
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:29.440]   been talking about should apple have a thumbprint reader on its new macbooks it may or may not but
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:34.800]   they're allowing you to do continuity i love that right so the big problem with pewds trusted
[01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:38.800]   devices like they've had them for years is that if andy had one i could just take it off put it on
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.880]   my shirt and go and unlock his computer because the device had no idea of identity but your apple
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:48.000]   watch has right yeah your apple watch has bluetooth can be a bluetooth smart device and they're doing
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.800]   very very very close so it can't be 30 feet away or 100 feet away you have to be really proximal
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:56.720]   but it's on your wrist it knows your pulse and that means that it's sure you're still using it and
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:01.200]   then it will just unlock your mac for you or you can do touch ID on your phone and it will hand
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.080]   off that to your mac so it's it's it's bringing both the biometrics and the the bluetooth trusted
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:11.840]   object it's something you have and something you are added to the equation yeah it's a really good
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:15.680]   apple type solution where they're willing to give you a partial solution but the parts that they
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:21.680]   give you are absolutely spot on rather than it's great if you have an apple watch or an apple
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:26.480]   iPhone we will let you use it if you have an amazon echo to make sure you don't have to sign in when
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:30.480]   you're at home but we are no we're not going to let you do that we're just only do the things we're
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:36.080]   absolutely sure about so the charams saying that they're delivering the new x code in xip format is
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:42.720]   that true what is this xip why do we do we have to get a new do we have to do get it well so an xip
[01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:50.240]   an xip is at the risk of oversimplifying slightly an xip is a digitally signed zip file
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:57.120]   which is a great thing yeah it says it i haven't looked at the internals yet but from what i can
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:01.920]   tell so far it's a zip file with with an embedded digital signature so for instance right now if
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:09.520]   you download software and operating system say microsoft's new windows 10 you download a hash
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:14.480]   that's associated with the file and then you have to run it through something like pgp
[01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:19.280]   to verify the signature but there's three different steps it would be great if we're all
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:26.000]   included in one thing you could unzip it and verify the uh not only the origin of the file but
[01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:32.160]   it's integrity that's correct so does so does uh and uh clearly apple builds that into the o s so
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:35.520]   you don't have to get any additional software it's built in the o s it looks like it's been there
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:43.200]   since 10.9 huh and how do we pronounce it zip yeah that's a good question because it's like a zip
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:51.200]   file will it replace zip files can't tell you i i so far it hasn't right it's been there since
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:58.160]   10.9 and zip and zip files are still um it's a great idea then it it looks as though i i have to
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:04.640]   do some experimentation here because it looks as though uh this is intended to distribute software
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:10.240]   because you yeah provide the same sort of code signing identity that you would as though you were
[01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:15.040]   building an application perfect because that's exactly the issue you know there's so much trust
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.160]   involved in starting installing software anyway but if i get rich's new program i would love to make
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:24.960]   sure that there's no been no man in the middle somebody hasn't injected code into a modified
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:28.800]   it's a big problem in open source software this happened to the linux mint because the software
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:35.280]   is open source you can download the mint code add your own little thing recompile it as a blob
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:40.160]   and then as they did redirect everybody from the mint site to your turkish site with an app
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:44.960]   a dollar a while ago to did it yeah one of the one of the i forget i don't want to say the wrong
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:49.840]   one no it's linux mint yeah and they were and you were you'd go you downloaded the iso but it
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:55.360]   turned out was getting from a turkish site and it had modified code and uh and of course it was caught
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:02.080]   pretty quickly because of the signing thing but it'd be really good if the isos were now in zips
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:08.400]   zips and you could validate it that it was not just from the right source but not modified
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:13.360]   it would be great and i could see why apple would that be great apple could take the lead and
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:19.200]   something like that let's talk about apple music redesigned that new design language that
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:25.120]   andy was talking about which looks a little like material design big texts no more drop shadows
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.320]   no more rounded corners no i wouldn't say it looks like materials so much so it seems a lot more
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:36.320]   purposeful than stock ios where you see that my my difficulty with the with ios on the phone has
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:41.680]   always been it doesn't have it doesn't do anything in a dramatic fashion to say here is the important
[01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:45.520]   thing on this screen here is what we think you're going to want to look at or here's the button that
[01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:49.600]   we think that you're going to want to push to do the thing that we think that you want to use this for
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:55.520]   uh but you see the same design language in the new music app in the new news app and in the new home
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:02.160]   app where there is not just bold but like black letterface uh to give you to take you two different
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:09.360]   sections of the thing st. bo's by the way who was so good she has quadrupled her zip her twitter
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:15.280]   followers by the way since we talked about her i was using her 4,460 something yeah she's over
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:21.600]   almost 12,000 now there you go uh monetize it uh so so it really does seem like a
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:26.560]   unlock your phone wake it up see the thing you want to do push the button uh there's a lot more
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:31.280]   color in it i've been looking at the screenshots i don't have uh i don't have the developers stuff
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.920]   yet so i haven't actually looked at any of these apps but it really does seem like more of a less
[01:45:35.920 --> 01:45:45.920]   of us less of a 1978 east german bleak west german bleak film sort of thing that i see uh o s the
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:50.960]   regular o s has uh so it's uh i i'm hoping this is something they're experimenting with and we might
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:46:00.320]   see this is vernar hetzog designed it's very you know win-swimmed plane with with with
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.800]   someone who's wearing a colorful gray sweater but still with a dower expression he is holding one
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:09.920]   stick that's been painted black in his open hand because it actually represents the bird that he
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:14.080]   crushed accidentally as a child so he carries this stick that's the impression i get when i
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:20.800]   actually look at ios on a phone there's no joy in it but it's super functional okay basically
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:25.920]   it's always railway functional it's it's like it's like the difference between the presenter we had
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:30.640]   on music versus the presenter that we most for apple presenters we have it's like oh i'm paying
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:34.480]   attention i'm engaged i'm listening this person seems to be excited about this thing that they want
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:43.360]   to talk about as opposed to in 1975 two students at the event of sissy firewood had a no-data collection
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:51.600]   stuns it's uh oh incentive it's like by the way uh her uh twitter handle bozama st john is uh
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:58.560]   st be oz and uh we'd love to get her over 12 000 she is what's great is her title is head diva of
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:05.520]   consumer global consumer marketing so she's uh and she was awesome she was terrific man i just
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:09.200]   may i think that they she should just do all apple kinos from now on that's the
[01:47:09.200 --> 01:47:16.480]   around the self-care about that uh man well i guess i guess i think she's i think she's booked on
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:21.120]   elin tomorrow i don't think she is i don't think the twitter podcast yeah i don't think twitter really
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:28.720]   uh she had him clapping and uh dancing so uh the new apple music also distinguishes very clearly
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.600]   between the songs that you're streaming from apple's site and songs your dad that are on your phone
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:41.600]   uh which would i think help people like jim dalrymple uh with confusion over is this my music or is this
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:47.120]   music from the apple library what is this what is a source of this music um she's showing here how
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:52.240]   you can see the the lyrics to rappers delight as you're listening i like that feature a lot of
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:55.840]   players only rappers delight though i think yeah only rappers that's all you that's all you
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:03.200]   that is all you need and you don't stop if you don't get him started Andy did the whole thing he did
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:07.840]   the whole sign i am very proud during the live favor i was like with a pong's flight i was
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.480]   rapping before she pulled up the lyrics you knew after she said wait a minute why is nobody
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:18.640]   rapping along i said i'm rapping along look i'm cool or actually i was a super importer and the
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:25.920]   entire tom larry catalog there you go i take both you know um so uh that was that's an improvement
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:31.280]   but you know we were expecting like this you know they were hinting at this massive uh redesign they
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:36.080]   didn't add new channels it still beats one is the radio channel they didn't um i don't well i
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.080]   i think it's a functional redesign that listen to the presentation and compare to how they presented
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:45.520]   last year where they really present last year's presentation really seemed like hey we've created
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:50.000]   this entire planet that we're moving you on to and now you're all going to be citizens of planet
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:56.720]   apple music land you're welcome this one seemed focused on you have interest in your music and
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:02.240]   you know what you want to listen to at any one time they only talked about beats one near the end
[01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:06.000]   and of course saying that the they think it's the most popular radio station on the planet right now
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.760]   okay that's as maybe but really the focus was on to make it sound more like a stock music player
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:17.680]   than as a revolution that we are shang-hying you into uh and so it really did make it really
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:22.160]   did fill you with optimism that if i were to switch back to apple music i would have the
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:27.440]   andi and out go focus music player that i've been wanting on the iphone all along we've also i do
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:33.040]   think i do think it's a big change we've also i've been waiting for a more curation a more curated
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.400]   playlist this is something jimmy iovine said would be very important to the beats platforms
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:42.800]   transformation apple music and they seemed like they were it's a war of escalation like a friend
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:47.280]   uh one of my colleagues uh daniel bedder was saying that it felt like when this came out
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.080]   as plotifies like oh you want to see curation here's our version of creation and apple music's like
[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:58.240]   really we'll create we'll curate your monday right you get like indivisible daily it's monday
[01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:02.000]   yeah and that's great for us because the war the harder they work at this they're they're literally
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:09.600]   competing to make us happier and that is the best situation we could be in yeah yeah hop hop to the
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:14.080]   hippity hop you don't stop a rock into the band band boogie see up jump the boogie to the rim
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.440]   the boogie beat up here is not a test i'm wrapping to the beat me the groove and my friends are going
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:24.560]   to try to move your feet etc he just has to do it didn't show he always wanted i'm like cartman
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:27.920]   with with with good with cum sale away it's like now that i've started rappers to like i have to
[01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:34.160]   go to the commercial i have to play to the end for i to move forward uh no i toons uh announcement i
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.880]   kind of thought they might announce an updated i toons they should typically in the fall i toons
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:46.480]   get slated in oh man and our long national nightmare continues well so like i again like i had this
[01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:51.520]   conversation before but we were talking about it this week everyone says fix itunes but if we said
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:56.080]   okay rich seagull now you've got to fix itunes and now please remember that andi's knees bought
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:01.600]   her ipod uh nano and she's thinking it over a cable to windows leo works for virgin records and he
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:05.760]   has to upload every single one of their catalogs every tuesday make sure all the data is in there
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:09.840]   and that everybody can buy those things rich good billion dollars of transactions going through
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:15.040]   there every month and we can't lose a penny okay now please please fix itunes let's uh let's all
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:21.280]   feel sorry for apple that only has 240 billion dollars in cash to throw at anyone problem that
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:28.400]   has ten has a million people music is hard no one is saying no one's saying that this is an easy
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:32.880]   problem to solve but we would like to see that and instead of seeing oh here's an itunes update
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:36.480]   and it is exactly the same as the itunes we've had for several years now that we've hated and we
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.640]   haven't been using for a while we'd like to see at least here's a letter there's a big change
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:45.440]   but we're putting the sidebar back after we took it out so i i acknowledge that itunes is apple's
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:51.040]   xp but i do not want apples vista so like i i just want i want something to happen where almost like
[01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:54.640]   apple.com where there was this horrible web object space that i think the store down do all these
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:58.800]   horrible things we all hated it and when do we woke up and there was this beautiful new version
[01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.840]   of apple.com's store and when you have this giant bridge that's collapsing you can't just take it
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:08.000]   down because then no one can cross the island you build a second bridge and that sometimes takes
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.840]   a while and then i'm hopefully one day they'll come in and go hi i'm medic you and here's new
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:16.560]   itunes and boom and then we just go through that demo and that and they have to move a lot of
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:20.800]   things like maybe we need itunes for i cloud and app store for i cloud and be able to move all
[01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:27.520]   that infrastructure to the web before we can decouple it from windows and decouple it from a monolithic
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:31.840]   app and we're seeing those pieces like the more they move apple music online the less dependent
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:35.760]   they are on local clients and it seems like i think he was really sincere when he was on
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:39.360]   the talk show last year with john groover saying that it is an it is an incredibly
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:43.520]   difficult thing to do and they're doing it in a step-by-step manner because that's unusual for
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:47.920]   apple usually they're like oh i work for mac throw it away final cup pro throw it away i movie a
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:51.600]   traditional apple approach would be burn itunes down and just here's a new version and it's missing
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:56.240]   all the features and three years from now you'll stop yelling at us uh itunes is one of those few
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:00.400]   things where there's so many dependencies i think we'll we'll see a gradual roll up
[01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:06.160]   so we have a zak is in the audience for big nerd ranches they're one of their ios guys teaches
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:10.000]   teaches ios programming and he's got a wire coming out of his watch of that what do you do it is
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.080]   your watch did he said no no i'm installing the new watch o s and i you know it has to be connected
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:21.520]   to power so i think that's awesome install on my friend install on it's uh no those millenies
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:26.960]   loop expands beautifully just it says if it was intended to do that made to do that
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:33.520]   um so rene let's talk about i know rene is a big watch fan yes and finally more than just new
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:38.880]   bands for you watch o s three looks pretty good i have to say some nice new features i like
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:44.720]   breeze i'll be using that a lot yeah whenever you talk about it i mean that's the first lesson
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:48.320]   whenever georgia gets started with your psychology stuff is a breathing things but for me it's like
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:53.200]   the features are great uh like i love it i love the uh instead of time to stand time to ride for
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:56.720]   people in wheelchairs isn't that nice you know i hadn't really thought about that and just shows
[01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:01.920]   how kind of unthoughtful we are what if you're in a wheelchair and you got every every hour you
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:06.880]   got this reminder time is stand up like we just make me cry you're locked up it yeah the thing that
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:12.240]   was so cool is that beyond the features it was this re this this coherence mode for the apple
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:16.640]   watch they rethought it it sort of what should an app be do we need glances and apps and now sort of
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:21.040]   an app is a glance and if you put it in your dock it prioritizes it and makes sure that it stays
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:25.280]   in memory so it launches instantly it gives it background access so the data is refreshed when
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:29.520]   it does launch and it's the thing i love it's like apple even with the iphone it's not we're gonna
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:34.080]   just turn on eunuch style multitasking and how bye bye battery life is what can we do to make
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.640]   sure you have what you want when you need it with conserving as many resources as possible
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:44.160]   and we hope that instant launch really really works i i hope that that's real is it going to
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:48.400]   pre-cache apps is running it now and it seems to work and i'm on the first beta and it seems
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:53.120]   you're on it well yeah so it does it prioritize it like the the things you have in your dock are
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:57.760]   updated in real time so you can see them like glances but instead of having glances and apps
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:01.920]   they sort of serve the same purpose and it does it caches that data and gets those apps ready to
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:06.160]   launch immediately but also gives them those background refresh api so that they can pull down
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:10.640]   data and make sure it's ready for you when you want them rich do you wear an apple watch are you
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:18.080]   an apple watch guy oh there is sport band yeah this is sport band that came with it i have a
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:24.560]   other band and i have a what do they call it the millenies loop oh and also yeah man this will
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:32.400]   bring back memories for you leo ooh that's the one that cat that twist of flex it catches your hair
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:37.760]   yeah they make it twist of flex for the apple watch i'll buy it no there's a
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:43.360]   resilient party um we hold this up it does give you a resilient rest it tears the hair
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:52.800]   a third party um lugs oh that you put on an existing um and they've let you adapt any watch band to
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:59.920]   use on the apple watch and so yes i have a have a twist of flex uh so um like takes you back
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:08.560]   yeah i can't believe i remember the brand name and the and the chinkle and then i did i did like
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:12.640]   the announcement that the doc is pretty much like with most important things that they could have
[01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:16.160]   done with it and i don't think they could have done it with the initial release because they had a
[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:20.320]   problem with preloading stuff and making sure you can get things that the doc imagine how
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:25.360]   frustrated you get when you launch an app and you see the weight cursor imagine swiping to swap to
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:29.760]   move to the next app and seeing the weight cursor so obviously they have a lot of faith in how well
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:34.880]   uh the how fast they can do switching uh it's a it's also it's a nicely done a nicely implemented
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:39.600]   version of it where uh it will work like the regular phone doc where it will keep your most
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:46.000]   recently used apps in the carousel in order but you can also go into the phone app and pins basically
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.920]   declare that he's here are apps that you should always have in the doc at all times so you can
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:54.800]   declare that like your strava app or declare that your flight app will always be in the doc and thus
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:57:00.160]   we'll always get access to background stuff it'll always be refreshed in the background uh i still
[01:57:00.160 --> 01:57:05.440]   think it doesn't go far enough to give the watch a sense of purpose but they've definitely taken
[01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:12.160]   the pain in the butt thrown in a drawer in anger uh level of the apple watch down from maybe a 7 to
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:19.840]   maybe a 5 or 4 we said when the apple watch came out that apple would learn a lot and could only
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:26.080]   learn that by watching people use it and it feels like now with watchOS 3 these are for instance
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:31.200]   they know now oh you only really use five apps so we can pre-cache those apps you can swipe between
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:35.680]   faces and those faces have complications and they can do things like activities like right on the
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.480]   watch face yeah we we see what people are doing with it and now we understand better what it is
[01:57:40.480 --> 01:57:45.120]   when you introduce a new category you really don't know what it is uh you have to give it to users and
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:49.360]   see what they do with it at the sessions they haven't talked about third-party watch faces
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:56.400]   no okay there's a gallery on it in the watch app that lets you so it's on the new watch app in
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:00.960]   iOS 10 there's a gallery and it's actually sorted by app and like this and i forget what the demo
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:07.200]   screen they put up was but it was uh maybe lift or something and you you can sort of see they're not
[01:58:07.200 --> 01:58:12.640]   customized faces but they show everything that that app can do to that watch face and then you
[01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:17.520]   can pick from the alternative so like you can have a very lift heavy app watch face for example
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:22.080]   or a very activity heavy watch face rich what do you what do you every will something that
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:25.280]   go ahead any and then i'll talk just i'll say quickly i know we're going i know we're running
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:30.320]   way but i i still think that the watch is not going to be 80 complete until third-party watch
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:34.400]   faces come in i still i still think that that's they're talking about personalizing the watch
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:38.880]   bands we see how important that is to make that watch yours when you only give me three or four
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:45.120]   really boring watch faces and you talk the Swiss realy you got mini mouse what do you want
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:51.120]   with dresses and she'll talk to you now i i'll talk if you if you hold down on it and her micky
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:56.560]   will tell you the time they go i thought i was next by the way i'm very excited for next year's
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:02.480]   wwdc where we're going to see pluto and goofy donald yeah you know angry donald is that with
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:04.880]   mikki's on the watch actually donald would be awesome
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:13.440]   okay pantsless pantsless watch faces coming in in 2017 they're still working on the lysing
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:17.520]   but i won't i won't i won't even make jokes about the mini mouse watch face that's that's
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:22.880]   it's like making the fitness apps uh compatible with people who use wheelchairs just a simple idea
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:27.120]   that we there is there is a there is a female figure you can put in there are you saying this is
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:34.080]   diversity i i'm saying that it's good you know i'm saying until we have a brown watch face i'm
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:39.440]   not gonna say there's diversity uh i can say i'm not i'm not gonna joke you should be able to choose
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:44.400]   the shade of micky and mini i think i think it's impressive how apple that they wanted to make
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:50.240]   sure that that many shoes would match the watch band so apple so here's a yellow watch band like
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:54.640]   so apple geez the wii progress is our most important product
[01:59:54.640 --> 02:00:02.240]   they did just open disneyland shang hi i think we could have a chinese mini i thought though that
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:07.440]   was very clear that there was a uh in in a lot of ways a tip of the hat to the chinese market
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:11.600]   a market is really important to apple including the new uh where you could draw the chinese
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:17.600]   ideograms on the uh on the wall and yeah yeah oh that was the keyboard too you just draw and it's
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:21.520]   like there's recognition and it's not like graffiti where you have to change the way you write to
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:31.280]   fit the system you just write and it it looks really good yeah um oh and 9-1-1 i or sos which i think
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:36.320]   is really great except i fear i hope it's hard to trigger well how do you trigger it because i
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:41.520]   i had this on my sam's phone and and i mentioned this yesterday literally lisa kept getting
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:46.400]   emergency messages from each other you have to hold it down for extended period of time okay
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:51.520]   but boy that's i mean i've fallen and i can't get up that's great uh this is
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:55.920]   yeah i'm in a bad situation as somebody who is on the verge of a heart attack all the time i think
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:01:01.040]   this is good i am real yeah it's good i feel where real reason to wear this particularly because it
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:06.160]   works over wifi it works over wifi not just uh so it means that if you're at home you
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:10.880]   may not you may have your iPhone upstairs in a charging dock but you are now in trouble and you
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:15.200]   have 12 seconds of use i'm not joking my have 12 seconds of useful consciousness right and you
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:21.280]   can use that to say okay i'm gonna say is help help help right out on out and you're out awesome rich
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:24.560]   what i've done are things i've noticed that people who use the apple watch i continue to use it
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:30.400]   have all found one thing that that is the kind of the killer app what how do it what is it that you
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:39.120]   use your apple watch for for me it's notifications yeah um i generally have my phone close at hand
[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:42.960]   but i don't always it might i might be in a different room from the phone i might be on a
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:52.480]   different floor from the phone i might be driving um and it's much less obtrusive if i get a notification
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:02:00.400]   i just you know glance at my watch and it it seldom distracts me from what i'm doing so
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:07.440]   seeing a text come in seeing or an instant message uh getting a notification from ring that there's
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:16.320]   somebody at the front door um uh like i just did um just motion at the front i know i love my
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:22.560]   and it's a really good use for the doorbell um we're at the two-hour mark i haven't even got to
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:28.960]   Siri i haven't got to apple tv uh home kit there's so much more but i'll tell you here's what we're
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:34.640]   gonna do uh i presume that some are all of you i know Renee's already doing it i know Zach's already
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:40.960]   doing it we'll download the betas i am not going to i'm gonna heed rich's advice and stick with the
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:45.680]   release versions uh but those of you who are developers and maybe next week we can talk because i think
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:50.800]   it would be useful especially with Siri to better understand what our new capabilities are by using
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:57.440]   it so let's defer that and i really want to talk about apple tv and home kit because you know apple
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:04.320]   paid off on that one it we all we all suspected it was kind of this the home kit hub apple was mom
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:08.560]   but they did announce that uh yesterday and i think that's very exciting as well
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:13.680]   i'm paying off some of the there's a reason why you spent an extra fifty dollars for the new apple tv
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:19.600]   as opposed to updated hardware and this is part of a right on day on day one you got the existing apple
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:23.600]   tv with a couple little benefits but now we're seeing here is why you paid the extra fifty bucks
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:27.760]   and you know let's try to get serenity on next week because i know she has already used uh home
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:33.840]   kit pretty extensively right Renee absolutely yeah she might have some uh some uh some uh thoughts
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:39.680]   about that so let's take a break when we come back picks of the week and we'll wrap this thing up
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:44.240]   security now it's about 15 minutes away you're watching mac break weekly rich seagull is here
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:50.960]   everybody's favorite developer at bare bones software the creator of bb edit does apple still
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:58.960]   use bb edit to edit the uh home page i don't know exactly what they're using it for these days i
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:03.520]   have a few friends that work there and and they use it for crunching data i actually got an
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:11.680]   a message from somebody there today um we i know they're using it i i don't know exactly
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:17.200]   what capacity they're using it or if they're still using it i to to specifically work on the home
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:23.120]   page i think it is used on the website sometimes though i you know let's we know they're using it but
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:30.160]   not exactly what for yeah i think the safe thing to say is if you have a macintosh you should have bb
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:36.640]   edit just buy it i would i would like that that would be great just buy it yeah everybody we want

[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:29.680]   researching realized that oh wish i could have added that oh i could have added that oh that would
[02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:35.040]   have been nice to know four hours ago but yeah it was it's a broad spectrum piece that i posted
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:41.280]   last night uh let us talk a little bit about gazelle now's the time of course to start thinking about

[02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:26.720]   30 days now that's great because that means you have 30 days to decide they're locked in but you're

[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:11.600]   what's your favorite african parrot no i don't pick favorites
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:16.000]   hear me that one that one they're closed up to hear you
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:24.800]   so so i mentioned the ring um which is a smart doorbell and i don't know if you guys have talked
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:30.160]   about it before we should mention disclaimer upfront their sponsor continue on oh anything you say
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:35.920]   will be more than welcome well well they didn't they're not a sponsor in this particular episode
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.480]   so it's okay we we got one without specific expectations but it looked interesting it's like
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:46.400]   hey this is kind of neat if you push the button and ring the bell we can get a picture and and
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:53.040]   it it turns out to have been quite useful yeah um you know somebody comes to the door and walks
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:57.520]   away and doesn't ring the bell or pulls into the driveway we can say oh well let's see what happened
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:03.520]   here so that's been very handy and as i said do you have teenagers yes so that's
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:08.720]   with a tone of voice that can only be used by asking adult if they have teenagers
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:14.480]   one of the great things is to be able to say no honey you came home at 3 a.m and that kiss was
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:22.800]   more than 20 seconds i have video incredibly valuable i'm gonna stop right there um there's
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:28.480]   there's a non-technical hardware device that i'm eagerly anticipating i have it on order
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:36.080]   it's called a jack point what's that it it's a it's a pair of jack stands for your car
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:44.320]   you know this is fine you can talk about anything you want and i'm thrilled this is good the you
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:51.200]   know i you know in season i i do autocross and high performance driving school and i want to
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:56.160]   know that and so once a month typically i i swap my wheels between something that's
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:11:02.080]   good for the street and something that's good for the track and uh yeah there you go jackpoint
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:08.720]   jack stands.com and the engineering is really clever they're very wide so they're super stable
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:16.320]   but you slide the jack under it and and slide the stand under the car you jack the car up using the
[02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:21.600]   the plate there is that safer than just having it on the on the jackpoint that's built into the car
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:27.040]   yeah you you never want to work on a car that's up on a jack i guess you're right that's scary
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:31.600]   always put it on jack stands and these are just so much easier to work with
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:36.880]   than than a standard jack stands. Jay Leno uses them they must be good
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:45.920]   he knows he knows his cars he knows his cars yeah it's for sure cool jack stands
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:53.760]   see i just want to reassure you rich the best things on the picks on this show are the things
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:57.840]   that you're the most passionate about i bought the one two three blocks that Andy recommended and
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:04.240]   i'm just loving them so this is completely appropriate jack stands jackpoint jack stands.com
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:10.720]   Renee Richie are in the dark at the Marriott sorry i apologize that's ready for nap time
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:16.800]   i hope you get a little rest a little reprieve a to a lot of developers keep saying no sleep till
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:23.040]   dubbed up but i feel like if it's actually no sleep act dubbed it's probably the the word germane
[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:28.480]   of those things well i hope you get some rest but i but i think it's fun what you're doing right
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:32.960]   oh no it is it is absolutely the best time of the year it's just there's so many people there's
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:37.600]   no mackerels anymore so Jason Snell did a wonderful article for i'm on this i think a year ago where he
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:44.000]   said wwc's become in many ways the new center of apple community and apple this year to their credit
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:47.760]   i mean in previous years they tried to block things like alkomf and this year it's on the apple
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:53.120]   developer page along with they had our party the talk show alkomf layers which is a designer
[02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:58.400]   workshop by jesse char that's happening at the same time as wwdc and apples not only not interfering
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:02.400]   with them but promoting them so it really is there's just people here who don't have tickets or just
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:07.120]   here to you know to be to go to the bars or go to the restaurants or just network and there's people
[02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:13.680]   at the alternate like alkom it's phenomenal what do you got for us anything to pick so i stole
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:19.040]   this from and he's an incredible gentleman for letting me do it but there's these wonderful
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:23.440]   group of developers called the icon factory krek hockenberry giddy and mejia and team and their
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.880]   famous of course for twitterific i believe they just did the emoji for messenger i mean they've
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:34.720]   done icons for windows there they are one day when when emoji actually becomes the language again
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:38.560]   when it replaces we go back to pictographs or when star fleet happens and they have star
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:43.040]   fleet emoji i'm guessing it's going to be based on icon factory work they're just phenomenal and
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:48.000]   they've made a new app just for fun it's called bit cam i'm going to flip it around to the selfie
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:56.000]   cam just so that uh you guys can see it uh forward facing so here is bit cam what it does is it makes
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:02.080]   sort of i forget the right word for it but it's a dithered image and it just it creates this old
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:06.720]   effect and they have a delightful sort of a mechanism in here you have super resolution
[02:14:06.720 --> 02:14:10.960]   you have standard resolution i'll turn it to fat bits for a second so you can see
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:15.600]   this is awesome what it sort of looks like this is a blast from the past and you there's an
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:20.320]   in-app purchase to install the color graphics card otherwise you start off the clock in light
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:25.040]   and for a couple bucks you get to install the color graphics option uh which is and they'll
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:30.800]   also the insta photo size and they have a beautiful website uh that's set up that looks like a retro
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.840]   website complete with little construction uh dude at the bottom and everything is laid out and it
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:41.200]   just there's Craig Hawkenberry himself um the whole layout and everything is so whimsical it
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:45.280]   feels like a palate cleanser app from them that they sort of they wanted to do this just for them
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.840]   and just for fun uh and i got to talk to Craig about it a little bit last night as he was towering
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:54.480]   over the rest of us at the party and it just his eyes just light up when he talks about it and i
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:58.320]   know get is over the moon get even made here one of the other founders is just over the moon with
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:02.400]   it but it's it is so much fun and they just really you could do this really wrong and end up with
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:07.360]   complete garbage for images and they did it really really right and you see if i've seen some of
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.680]   Andes i've seen that some of my friends they just they they create a really really great look so
[02:15:11.680 --> 02:15:15.840]   if you're bored with the normal online picture if your instagrams are sort of insta knots and you
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.400]   want to get them back to insta hots if you want to just have careful photos to share with people
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:25.040]   uh it's it's worth it it's just it's a moment of delight it is something that makes you feel so
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:29.200]   good that you have the app installed and that to me is we're in the era of pop apps it's really
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.600]   really hard to to to get an app out there there's they announced that one of the two
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:38.400]   million apps yesterday and standing out is hard and if you can just give somebody that really
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:42.720]   great connection and great feeling that it's it's really worthwhile and they nailed it there's
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:50.960]   Jason Snell and i got a one bit dither image one bit smell i think most of us learn about this
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:55.840]   because on instagram suddenly like all of our friends start posting these weird looking pictures
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:16:00.800]   then so starting with the people who are in on the beta and then when it got released it was
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:05.520]   like a spreading infection there's also a side benefit if you if you go to the website for
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:12.560]   icon factory icon factory dot com slash bc that html you can if you never got the animated
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:18.400]   gif made with macotage you can download it steal it from the page uh because that that every every
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:21.680]   everybody should have that on their website and if you miss having a little like little
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:25.120]   animated construction worker you can grab him a little guy yeah for your geo-stating
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:31.360]   reduction yeah yeah i just want to find out how to join that cool web ring thing they said oh
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:42.080]   they got a web ring man memories i love that they're having fun doing this is that's just everything
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:47.680]   yeah uh good pick thank you you know it's the icon factory and there's such great people i just
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:52.240]   you know every chance i get i want to throw some bucks their way and it never feels like it's
[02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:58.640]   enough they if i if you don't mind me piling on uh rene there's they make an app called ex scope ex
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:05.520]   scope cope and if you're a developer and you're doing any kind of user interface layout work
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:13.200]   um it's i forget it's twenty four twenty five dollars on the mac app store and there you go
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:18.720]   oh fifty fifty dollars now it doesn't matter how much it is it's still worth it i used to use it
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:22.320]   for web dev all the time it's saved it's saving me fifty dollars a day easily in the
[02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:28.080]   bloodless observation and time and of course i've i've had this app for a few years and it um
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:34.400]   it's paid for itself i don't know how many times over so many times over and of course they make the
[02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:40.720]   famous highly recommended twitterific yes exactly as well yeah good good choices there
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:45.920]   andy you you got all your picks stolen from you but i know you you came up with something else
[02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:50.400]   i i'll see there was this was my plan i knew that somebody was going to be cool enough to pick that
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:56.640]   app and i had i had that in my list so that on the in case somebody didn't i would take it but making
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:02.720]   it clear that please don't not pick it because i figured that my pick was chosen as a companion to
[02:18:02.720 --> 02:18:07.760]   whatever whatever person picked uh uh that other app it's by jixi picked software it's called
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:13.440]   dramatic black and white and it is an app specifically for it's for ios it's also for the desktop
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:18.960]   uh it's also for android it's for everybody and for windows it is for converting picks photos
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:23.760]   into black and white it doesn't even take pictures it only converts things into black and white and
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:30.320]   it's um it's so much fun to play with even if you are you know a jerk like me who's like i'm trying
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:35.040]   to create photographic alls i don't care that's with my phone but there there's certain like uh
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:39.840]   ansel adams effects you don't feel like you get from photoshop or you can't get the look from
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:44.960]   classical photos that dramatic boom there are blacks boom there are whites there
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:52.160]   some she was detail and gray and mood uh and i just spent like i i i bought it while waiting for a train
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:56.960]   i spent like an hour and fifteen minutes doing nothing but processing photos that were already
[02:18:56.960 --> 02:19:01.600]   on my phone uh and taking pictures of like architects like they're you know that's in one of the
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:06.720]   harvard libraries uh and it's an it's an okay picture in color but in black and white you look
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:14.000]   like a photographer and it makes anything look sort of important or historical yes there's a uh i
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.880]   added a spotlight for the for the house and a spotlight for it for the actual text and now it
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:23.600]   looks like something that could be on a u.s postage stamp instead of just a fun tourist poster picture
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:28.400]   that i took but more than anything else it really not only can it make really beautiful pictures but
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:32.400]   it's just fun to work with to see what what can i make from this photo that i already have
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:37.920]   and it it underscores how important a phone photography is because each one of these little
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:43.680]   apps is kind of like buying a specialty lens or specialty kind of film for your camera you can
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:47.840]   get a kind of shot and get a kind of image that you couldn't imagine before and it makes you it
[02:19:47.840 --> 02:19:53.280]   gives you the fun of making art and figuring out how the best way to communicate your picture is
[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:57.600]   just fun fun fun two damn dollars give them the money two damn dollars well but you may end up
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:20:01.360]   more because i'm looking at all the apps they make and there's a ton of different filter
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:05.680]   they make i i wound up buying a whole bunch of them i think i i bought uh i think i bought
[02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:13.360]   impresso as well uh i can i think it's i can give you a link to my instagram but it's a really good
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:19.760]   like real art like oil painting uh filter and they all use yeah they they all and they all use the
[02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:27.600]   same really nifty interface uh both actually both on ios and on uh and on android that's really clear
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:32.640]   and real efficient it doesn't try to be please stop using every other social media app and camera
[02:20:32.640 --> 02:20:36.720]   capture app and every editing app because we're trying to replace every decision you've ever made
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:41.200]   it really is we are giving you an app that lets you convert things to black and white or give you
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:46.160]   this cartoon effect we will make it as powerful and easy to use as possible but we are okay with
[02:20:46.160 --> 02:20:51.040]   integrating it to whatever else you're doing it really shows you that uh computational
[02:20:51.040 --> 02:20:57.760]   photography yeah is just uh massive i mean this is and it's why you want to start look at this you
[02:20:57.760 --> 02:21:05.280]   can put turn your photo into a photo piece of paper it's hysterical um which is why uh you know i
[02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:11.600]   think the the future of photography is on devices like the iphone it's on computational devices it's
[02:21:11.600 --> 02:21:20.640]   really amazing yeah thank you Andy thank you rene thank you uh mr bird and uh and whoever that
