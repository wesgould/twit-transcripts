[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Andy Renee and Alex are all here. The whole team is in.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.400]   We're going to talk, of course, about Apple's stunning quarter.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.640]   Quarterly results are in. And some things that Tim Cook said that I thought were kind of interesting.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:19.680]   We will talk about something Tim Cook did not say to Elon Musk and some rumors.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.600]   New Macs to come. All coming up next. I'm Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.200]   news from Apple and the news boys are here. Mr. Renee Richie from youtube.com/Renee.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.400]   Richie, hello Renee. Hello Leo. It's good to be back with you and everybody today.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.280]   Yes. Nice to have you back. Andy and not coke. WG. B.H. Boston. Good to see you.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.640]   Good to see you too. And of course Alex Lindsey, Office Hours and 090.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.840]   Media Office Hours.Global. If you want to know more about the 24/7 festival that Office Hours is
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.760]   all about media production. It's funny because yesterday,
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.200]   Google did a very unapply thing. I thought it would be interesting to see if maybe we could
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.120]   encourage Apple to do the same thing. They invited handpicked crew of journalists in,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.760]   which is not actually is very apply, but they are at Ghost or Lo, who runs Google's hardware
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.520]   division, invited them in to take a look at, to play with and to talk about the next Google
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.880]   Pixel phone, which won't be out till October. There's no keynote. They just brought some
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.160]   folks in to show a tone. And they didn't show, you know, they say they can't take pictures.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.480]   They're still there and stuff now. Yeah. So basically, I think it's kind of, it is pre-emptory
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.480]   leaking, but preemptive leaking. But I also think, well, Prosser leaked it. So I think they just did
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.920]   this like last year, did this in response. They did it last year as well. They could control the
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.640]   story. But I also think, and maybe it is something to take. Look, everybody knows, you know, that the
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.880]   new iPhone will be the, you know, a certain step up in processor power, biggest, slightly bigger,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.120]   you know, we kind of know the outlines of it, not from rumors, just because that's what they do
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.400]   every year. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea for Apple a couple of months early to bring in some
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.320]   people and say, here's some things we're looking at for the next generation of iPhone and some
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.600]   reasons you might want to pay attention when we do finally announce it. That's essentially what
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.000]   Google did. Yeah. And they got a lot of free publicity. You know, I mean, it was pretty much puffy. You
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.360]   can't do anything to double down on because you can't test it. You can't try it. Well, they didn't
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.440]   really say like the Wired article was really good. Like it was really in depth, but Rick
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.960]   Ostero managed to say nothing. Like it was an entire article about the custom silicon that
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.200]   was coming to Google with zero information is going to be better. Where you've written. Well,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.000]   I'm wary of Rick Ostero because many, many times he has said things like this is a completely
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.640]   Google designed phone and it turns out HTC did most of the industrial design for it. Or he said,
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.400]   like the new pixels coming and turns out the battery is terrible. So when he says it's a completely
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.040]   Google design, I would love that I would love more custom silicon. But it may turn out that this
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.200]   is Samsung design processor with a Google tensor core, like a neural engine attached to it. And
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.080]   we just don't know yet. All we see is like massive. Actually, I think it's very likely that's exactly
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.760]   what it is. Well, I'm pretty sure that's not what he said. Yeah. Yeah. I agree with you. But you can
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.800]   also say that, well, no, this isn't Apple design silicon because they licensed this technology from
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.480]   ARM. They licensed it. They don't know. They license zero percent of it from ARM now.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.760]   Oh, I'm sorry. But again, the foundation is ARM. They have people working on the team that they
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.600]   hired or bought or acquired. But I do agree with you. This is this was an interest. I agree with Leo
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.800]   too that I think that this is the more adult way of going through this instead of saying,
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.400]   I roll my eyes a little bit when Apple says, Oh, I bet we like to have like the theater, the
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.480]   theatrical, the surprise like, okay, no, this is we aren't children. This isn't Christmas. We are
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.120]   people who have an old phone. We have we have a thousand dollars that we have budgeted to buy
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.240]   new one. We're going to see a really cool phone introduced by Samsung in August. We might see another
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.880]   one. We know that another cool phone is going to be introduced by another company in October. We're
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.480]   trying to make a decision on where our attention should be. Do you think it's a better strategy to
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.840]   kind of as Google did and pre announce and get people kind of excited? I mean, obviously,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.080]   that excitement is not going to last through October, but just kind of raise the buzz about it.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.840]   And then announce it with more concrete stuff in October. Or is it better to do what Apple did,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.120]   does, which is say, absolutely nothing. It's safer because they're not selling a lot of phones.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.000]   And Apple is Apple would kill iPhone 12 sales if they did this almost immediately and Google,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.280]   I don't think they care. So there's the risk is Osborneing as they used to call it Osborneing,
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.360]   your existing products, the pre announcing new products when your existing products are still
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.960]   for sale. And also, you don't control them. You know, you don't have nearly the same control
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.600]   over the narrative, you know, if you do it this way. So it's it is a from a corporate perspective.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.200]   I think Google had to do it in some ways because they're not ready to release the phone or show
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.880]   the phone. It feels like Apple has less control over the narrative because any you can speculate
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.840]   anything at this point, right? We do. They have less control now, but when they release the film,
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.520]   when they release the phone or they release the products and they choose to do a keynote,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.720]   they are playing to the press, but they're also heavily playing towards the public.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.080]   You know, they're having, you know, there are tens of millions of people that are going to
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.360]   get Apple's version of exactly what this what this is about. And they're able to weave a
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.280]   a story line around what they're, you know, what that means, you know, and why it's important,
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.800]   why these products and that can get lost. You know, a lot of the, you know, some press are going
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.560]   to catch up on it. But, you know, like someone who is really understands it is going to understand,
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.240]   oh, this is why this is important and this is what what's there. But but Apple wants to make sure
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.320]   that you're clear that they just spent, you know, a billion dollars on some on some feature.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.440]   It'd be really good if you make sure you understand why it's important. And so,
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.960]   and so a lot of times press may jump over some of those things. You'll have a Renee Richard,
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:41.920]   a Renee Richard, a Renee Richie or a Andy Anaco or, or, you know, other folks that really understand
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.840]   the technology really understand what it is. But you have a lot of press that won't. And I think
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.240]   that Apple wants to make sure that, I mean, I don't know, but I think that that makes you sure that
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.080]   they tell the story the way they want to tell it and then let the press chew it up and talk
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.040]   about it however they want. But they have their version of it out there. I think that.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.400]   Well, that's why the pre-announcement is to kind of wet people's appetite and start the steering
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.320]   because right now Apple has zero control over what people are saying about their new phone and
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.200]   all sorts of kookoo stuff might come out. We thought, but I think they can do anything with the like
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.880]   the demos that they're showing, they weren't allowed to video it separately. They weren't allowed to
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.320]   shoot any photos. Oh, yes, useless information. You can show them that their video was bad. But they
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.400]   did a demo where they showed that their video is better than an iPhone and they're all
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.760]   caviating saying, we just saw this and we think it looks way better. We can't prove it.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.800]   Exactly. Google's playing a little game. I think you have a point, Renee, which is interesting. In
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.600]   fact, Apple has pre-announced products where there is no predecessor product whose market you
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.720]   would kill. But I also think that they don't care like the Mac Pro or they don't care. But I also,
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.640]   so Apple has done this a little bit in the past. I think that was kind of a big change when they
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:53.120]   did that with the Mac Pro. But the other thing is that Google, maybe the chilling effect is not on
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:59.600]   Google's current phone, but on other companies. Maybe if Google can give, make a case that you
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.960]   shouldn't be looking at a Samsung, next generation Samsung phone because, wait till you see what we've
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.000]   got. So maybe it's also a little defensive move. Apple doesn't have to worry about that.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.440]   I think Google has sales are way down like they're half what they were last year already,
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.640]   which is not good for them. But I think that also Google has an issue where
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:23.600]   if you put out a product in August over the summer, both in the United States and Europe,
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.000]   your impact is much less. Oh, yeah. I understand why Google's waiting till after the iPhone got to
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.240]   announce their phone. They always do that. Well, they're waiting because Apple comes right out of
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.040]   the gate that first week and you're in their wake for the next 90 days. So the thing is,
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.280]   is that you're, so the thing, or at least the next 30 days, right before Apple's announcement,
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.400]   would that be better? Well, I know the problem is that's Labor Day weekend.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   Like literally, Apple comes out, but has has really routinely staked.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:54.000]   Put a flag in the ground for where the best possible place to announce the phone is.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.520]   Yeah, it is literally for the Christmas season. Yeah, they own it.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.280]   And Apple does the week of September 10th, plus or minus is the best week in the year to release
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.520]   a product. And Apple has made it clear that if you really is a product there, no one's going to
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:12.400]   hear you because it's because everyone is talking about their product and they built that up over
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.600]   time. But I think that that is literally the best week. And for the, if you're doing a consumer
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.720]   product, it's the best week of the year is the week after the Labor Day week going into the
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   Christmas. That is the perfect week to release a product except for the fact that you can't
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.360]   lose anything near Apple. It might be earlier this year, but Samsung has a foldable event this week.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.200]   Next week is not as effective. So they can do it. But it's also for foldables, which aren't really,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.640]   which are really in a class of their own, you know, if you're in that market.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.280]   But it's usually the note, like it's usually the note slot, the foldable.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.920]   Yeah, I don't think there's going to be a note. That's why. Yeah.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:51.520]   But the reason I like I buy a pixel every year. I bought the Nexus every year and I buy a pixel
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.920]   every year. And just the one thing that gets me is that every year, it's still a repudiation
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.640]   of the year that came before. Like the pixel five is nothing like the pixel four is nothing like.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.320]   And the things that they said that they deliberately did to not be a certain way,
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.840]   they do exactly that for the next one. Like, we don't need this. We're doing this. This is
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.960]   mandatory. No, it turns out we didn't need that. We're going high end. We're going low end.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.200]   That's just so Google. That's just so Google. Oh, now we're doing our full
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.400]   silicon. We don't need a second camera. We don't need. They don't have a coherent strategy on anything.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.720]   I really like the pixel. If there was any phone I couldn't get beside it, like if I could never
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.200]   get an iPhone, I would get a pixel phone. But it would behoove me as a customer if they stuck with a
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.440]   platform for several years so they could really mature it rather than redoing everything from
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.600]   scratch every year just because their CFO is still fighting with their product lead is still fighting
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.560]   with their feature their engineering lead. I want one pixel for four years. I just want to
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.000]   predict that. That is exactly that. The pixel one led naturally in the pixel two,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.920]   which led naturally in the pixel three. The pixel four was an aberration mostly because of
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:58.000]   solely, which was a very googly thing to do, which was a very extremely exciting technology
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.480]   that they decided they're going to sort of leave behind and not do things about. But you have to
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.320]   realize that between the three, there's an inflection point around the point of the three and four.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.840]   This is when they acquired the mobile division of HTC. And so essentially they're integrating
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:19.680]   this whole team. The pixel four was I think a very, very awkward marriage of teams. There's
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:26.720]   that very, very famous and very, very baffling all hands meeting that Austro-low had a month before
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.280]   pixel four was coming out to say that we I don't understand this product at all. We made so many
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.840]   of these mistakes. This is why I was one. Good marketing, Rick. Good job. Exactly.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.320]   Well, I mean, that's the press doing their job. But this is why the pixel six, I think,
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.000]   has been I've been anticipating it for a couple of years. Like here is what's going to be the
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.840]   first phone that comes out that is naturally and integrally a unified Google product with all these
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.200]   teams. Again, there are all kinds of acquisitions coming yet at all times. I think that the addition
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:02.240]   and I think that the this strategy of not only having these half dozen people come in for a little
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:07.360]   extremely, extremely restricted hands on, but also they put it up a blog post. They also put up
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.000]   other things for the public to see. But this was a very, so I think this was a very, very important
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.120]   thing for them to do this time because it's one thing to say, hey, it's a we have, we added
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.520]   something cool as our old phone. It's this radar sensor that will do things like gestures. Okay,
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.480]   that's fine. But here they're talking about a lot of things, a lot of fundamental technologies that
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:34.400]   make this point by point by point a much, much more of a more of a high end, high tier phone
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   experience, which is not something that you've really associated with the pixels, the process
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.120]   that they're putting together themselves, being able to integrate all of that with the battery life,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:50.320]   being able to integrate that in Bayo, Apple's biggest Apple's thermal exhaust port to torpedo
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:56.320]   down the thermal exhaust port has been what if Google is able to do all of their AI, which is
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.880]   amongst the best in the world, but figure out a way to do it almost entirely on device so that
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.200]   there aren't any privacy concerns, except for the fact that there's a Google label on this phone.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.960]   So there's a lot of stuff they had to break. I thought was a good idea if they're having their
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:15.840]   event in October, as usual, that's enough time for that C to be put in people's heads. And
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.160]   remember, there's a lot, it's a much bigger problem of getting of Android users switching to iPhone.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.440]   There are a lot more people doing that than from the other way around. So it's important for them
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.280]   to get the word out that look, if you've been, if you've been, if you haven't found this two or
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.880]   three or four years old and you're itching for something new, here's why you should at least wait
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.520]   to see what we've got coming because it's possible that the things that have frustrated you, I'll
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.160]   have to say they frustrated me too, about the pixel experience, you might find that what we've
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.760]   got coming in October will solve those problems. And you know what, Apple's going to be making
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.520]   plenty of iPhones, they will still be plenty in stock if you decide to wait a month. So that
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.040]   thing was a very smart thing for them to do. I mean, I think they have to think outside the box
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.800]   because the market share is starting to slide. And so I think that they have to think about how
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.360]   they're going to get the word out there. I mean, the craziest thing is, is you look at things like
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:07.040]   LiDAR. I mean, everything I got excited about and everything I learned about AR related to a phone
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:14.160]   was using Tango, doing R&D with phones that we had. Google technology. This is Google technology
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:21.120]   circa 2014, 2015, 2016. We were doing R&D, heavy R&D with those phones and we had to
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.600]   direct ship them from China to be able to use them. And the fact that they let it go. And we can
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.720]   see the difference between the two companies in a lot of ways when we look at that because they
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.920]   just put something out there like, we're just going to throw it against the wall and then they
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:39.840]   didn't go anywhere. And what we're watching is Apple just rolling a very slow giant boulder down
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.880]   that path of just slowly incorporating it in. And that's the difference. I think that's, it shows
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.680]   the difference between how the two companies approach product development.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:54.320]   So, okay. So that's the question. It really isn't about the new phone. We're going to talk a
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.240]   lot about that tonight and all about Android. That'll be obviously the biggest topic of discussion
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:05.200]   tonight. But I just thought it'd be interesting to talk about Apple's strategy and why they
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.160]   don't do something like this. I still think I'd like them to do a little preview.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.960]   I think they'll do it with any product that's not selling well. Like the iPhone is their best
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.640]   selling product. They won't call it a matter. It doesn't matter. Like the Mac Pro, like the time,
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:20.960]   by the time the 2019 Mac Pro came out, very few people were buying that trash can. So these
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.480]   are the ones born all over it. Yeah. Speaking of the Mac Pro, they have actually done an upgrade for
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:33.600]   the Intel Mac Pro. They've added some new graphics capabilities. Yeah. The Intel part wasn't ready.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:40.560]   So they went with the empty parts. Yeah. What do you think? Is this a signal that the Intel Mac Pro
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:44.960]   has still has years to go? Is it to reissue or people? If they're doing a final update.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.200]   Yeah. They did a final update on every Intel box for the people who just wanted the Intel
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.760]   version to tie them over. Like especially people like Alex, who are going to trust brand new software
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.840]   on their studio 90 person seat thing and they want to buy one that's going to last
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.760]   three, four years until all the the worn edges or take the rough edges are taken off.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.520]   I have to. And this was supposed to happen earlier. It's supposed to happen with with new
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.080]   Xeon processors. But those processes weren't any faster. And now the new the new new Xeon
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.840]   processors weren't ready yet. So now and they would delay it. I believe they delayed the big
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.080]   Navi roll out because these are our DNA to graphics cards. And then finally, I think shipped it
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.240]   without Intel, which to me is like the cherry on top of the why we're doing this transitioning Sunday.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:27.280]   These are not inexpensive upgrades. Incidentally, if you if you're in the market, the late,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:34.640]   these expensive, the Radeon Pro W6800X with 32 gigs of GDR 6 GDD R6 memories,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:40.320]   2400 bucks. But some of the other. I mean, this is this is kind of a the fatal flaw of the Mac
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.400]   Pro is that they're not using Nvidia because most of those that are doing graphics aren't really,
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.800]   we don't really consider these valid cards. And so the fact that you're putting in $5,000
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.880]   cards that we don't want, you know, is kind of hard. I mean, I think for researchers who are doing
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:58.080]   slightly different, you know, calculations that made the fragmenting may be fine for them.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:05.440]   The way that the AMD cards approach graphics is not conducive to most of what we do. So for
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:09.920]   graphics, folks, that these cards, you know, why am I gonna spend $5,000 on that? I'm just gonna buy a
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.760]   PC. They check it literally. This is where we start moving like I have a PC so that I can use
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:21.760]   Nvidia cards. They talk about 23% faster performance and DaVinci resolve and 84% faster and Octane X.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:27.520]   Are those programs that we even faster with Nvidia? It's not so much those might be a little
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:33.200]   bit. I mean, I don't know those aren't that's fine. But the Nvidia stuff is when we're actually
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:39.280]   working. That's what matters. So it's a niche market that they're aiming at. What is the deal?
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   And they're not by the way, this is not necessarily going to be solved with an M1 or whatever
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.360]   at Apple Silicon based in town. I mean, we're doing a lot of resolve work in, you know,
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.960]   in the M1 right now. And you can have a Mac Pro do a lot of those things. But the Mac Pro is not a
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:58.000]   server like rendering time is less important because it's not a server based. It's not a computer
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.640]   you get and you put it into a, you put a hundred or a thousand or two thousand of them in there and
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.160]   let them process. This is a an artist is actually using it. So what matters is, is not the rendering
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.360]   time. It is what is the artist doing and how responsive is it when the artist on the person
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:17.280]   that I'm paying a hundred two hundred three hundred dollars an hour. You know, when someone says
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.960]   down at a resolve station, I'm I'm paying them three hundred twenty five dollars an hour. Like,
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.440]   that's the that's the number. Right. So I want whatever they're doing to work really well.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:32.800]   And so and so and so what I care about is not the render time. What I care about because they can
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.440]   walk away and have lunch and hopefully not charge before it. What I care about is when they're
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.480]   rendering. I don't know, Alex. I'm rendering. I think that's work.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:47.520]   But it's but it's it's when it's playing. And when I open up a 60 million polygon
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:53.280]   project in Maya or I open up, you know, something else or I'm I'm I'm building something in
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:58.320]   Cinema 4D and I and I and I have lighting effects and I have all the stuff and I need to look at a
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:03.360]   preview or if I do those are the things that matter to me is is what is what does a heavy model in
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:11.600]   Cinema 4D do affects me? How long it takes for Cinema 4D to create the frames for me overnight.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.480]   I don't really care. And so so the thing is is that it's so that the they they keep on going back
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.080]   to rendering times what they're not talking about is responsive times. And that's what we,
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:25.440]   you know, and it's harder. It's harder to calculate to. I mean, and the Cinebench is,
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.160]   you know, good at some of those things as far as you know, I'd rather see Cinebench stuff than
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.520]   than necessarily rendering times. But that's of course, they're using rendering times because
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:44.320]   I'm sure the numbers were better. So, but it's not that the like the 6900 XT is a terrible GPU.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.440]   No, it's not terrible. It's just that it's just that if you're going to spend that kind of money
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.920]   for folks who are spending that kind of money, they're going to spend that kind of Nvidia GPU is
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:59.200]   pretty good. Is it faster or just easier to work with? Well, from a developer's perspective,
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.440]   at least when we've developed stuff for it, it's much the Nvidia is much easier to work with.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:09.840]   So it's easier to develop for. And so as a result, a lot of developers prefer to go down that path.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:16.000]   And so there's more support for it and deeper support. And so so the so the Nvidia tends to have,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.080]   you know, just in general more support except for everywhere except for the Mac. And so
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:27.040]   but on the PC side, you know, and what's crazy is that you want the AMD thread ripper as the CPU,
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.640]   but then you end up getting the Nvidia as the right as the GPU, right?
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.200]   Yeah, and Apple and Nvidia don't play well together because they both are powerful enough
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.800]   to want their way like Apple wants everything to be an endpoint for metal. They just want to
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.200]   write straight to the hardware. They don't want any of your custom stuff on top of it. And in video,
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.880]   they just basically want cards to be commodities and Nvidia wants the computers to be commodities
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.520]   and every way to write to CUDA cores. And because they're both successful, they have no desire
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.280]   to to meet in the middle and they don't like each other on top of it. So it's just the
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.360]   so you said something interesting. So you
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:03.440]   they were supposed to put ice like in. Do you think this means that they're not going to do
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.960]   any more Intel and easy on and upgrades for the Mac Pro? I think yeah, because it sounds like the
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:13.920]   Mac, the Apple Silicon Mac Pro is not going to come until late next year. So I've late next year
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.200]   going to be shipped. Yeah, last Mark Gurman's last last newsletter said late 2020. He's starting
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.920]   his stopwatch at November of last year when they announced it. I started mine at WWDC 2020
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.280]   when they when they said they're doing Apple Silicon. So we're on different clocks, but a year for me
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.920]   would be January would be June and a year for him is November. So he's he's thinking November.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.400]   Yeah, Apple said the transition would take two. Apple said the transition would take two years.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.120]   So he's saying two years from November, basically. Yeah, and they've been a hard two years, like with
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.440]   a lot of the components and a lot of the things that they've wanted to do. It's taking longer than
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.040]   I don't I'd be blown away. If I'm going to lose another. Good.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.680]   Yeah, well, I think I think I'll get the ice lake. They'll get the ice lake out early next year.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   If you can tell because it seems like Intel's going to take forever to get up the part Apple
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   needs, but it's I think like early next year, if they do an ice lake bump. And notice in this
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.080]   was not announced by Apple. Apple said nothing about this AMD announced this AMD put up a web
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:13.200]   page about this. You cannot find that very much information on Apple. It is a completely AMD led
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:18.400]   press initiative on this. So I don't think Intel's going to do any press for Apple anytime soon,
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.240]   but it wouldn't be surprised if Apple if the Apple store just quietly included the latest ice
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.440]   lakes, you know, at some point, just and Alex, you disagree? You think they're not going to put
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.360]   any more energy into this? They might put another chip in. I mean, they might upgrade the chip,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.600]   but they're not going to do any major major updates. I think that and I think Apple is also the reason
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.120]   they're not going to spend a lot of time talking about AMD is that they are they're looking at a
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.840]   future that doesn't use any of anybody else's gene. Anybody's. Yeah. So I don't think that they
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:49.360]   why would you spend a lot of any any energy on talking about GPUs when in in 18 months, you're
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.920]   never going to talk about anybody's GPU again. It's the dream. They're living the dream.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.960]   Let's take a little break with it. We did get quarterly results from Apple. I have all of Jason
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:06.480]   Snell's color graphs and we'll work our way through those all six colors. We'll work our way through
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:12.080]   those in just a little bit. I guess in a way, I buried the lead. Although I think quarterly
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.960]   results aren't exactly news that newsworthy, but maybe we can lots of people far wealthier than you
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:22.320]   are going to have a very good Christmas. Yeah, exactly. In a nutshell, that's it.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.040]   But I guess there might be some nuggets we can glean from it about Apple's future and so forth.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.920]   So we'll do that just a little bit. Renee Richie, Andy and Ico Alex Lindsey, the Mac Break Weekly
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.440]   team is in the house. Our show today brought to you by and I really want to thank Kevin Rose for
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:43.840]   this. He is so great. Kevin, as you know, the dark tipper from the screen savers way back when he's
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:49.760]   been a longtime partner of mine and worked on early Twitch shows with us and so forth and
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:55.200]   actually he's on Twitter whenever we can get him has a new podcast of his own. And I really want
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.480]   to give him a big plug because I've listened to it and it's great. It's called Modern Finance
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:08.640]   or as the kids call it mofi mofi. And I can't think of a better person to help you navigate this
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:15.360]   the crazy world in finance around us than Kevin Rose. But you know, I mean, he is an expert in all
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:22.320]   of this Bitcoin NFTs, you know, the new robo investors. Everybody's talking about it,
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:26.320]   but how do you know what it means and whether it's something you need to pay attention to?
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:33.120]   And it's a great list and Modern Finance helps to demystify crypto decentralized finance. Kevin
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.960]   is of I don't need to sell Kevin. He's but I will he's the top 25 angel investor, Gordon Bloomberg,
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.560]   one of the top 25 most influential people on the web in Time Magazine. But he's also a brilliant
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.080]   guy. He's this has become his area of expertise. He's fascinated by it. And he's done a great job
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:56.640]   of demystifying it with modern finance. It's a show crypto show for the novice and expert alike.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:02.400]   They don't dumb it down. You know, that's Kevin. He's a partner of true ventures. So he really has
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:08.000]   a lot of insight into what's going on in finance. Then he brings in top tech experts and entrepreneurs,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.680]   talks about modern finance tools, helping others understand cryptos and FTS, even traditional
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:19.120]   finance hacks. I didn't understand NFTs at all until I listened to his actually was his debut issue
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.880]   episode of modern finance, modern finance one. And I was I was like, thank you, Kevin. Thank you,
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:31.280]   Kevin. They do two shows on one feed. Once a week, they do a consensus episode that explores weekly
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:37.360]   news and distills it into digestible information. And then the second show of the week has
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:41.760]   deeper interviews with the people like individual crypto founders and NFT artists.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:48.800]   Look, it's not just that you need to next time you go to a cocktail party, be able to say what an
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:54.880]   NFT is. It's really, I think important to understand this landscape and what opportunities it presents
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:26:00.000]   to you in terms of your investments. You want to stay informed. And there's no easier, more
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.520]   enjoyable way to do that than modern finance. I listened to Mo Fyce and stay one Kevin Rose.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:12.080]   He's great. I think he's the guy to talk about this to be your guide in this. And I think the
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   modern fight, I'm so glad he's doing this. I'm really happy to give him a big fat plug. The
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.040]   financial landscape is harder than ever to navigate, but you don't have to do it alone.

[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.240]   Thanks. Every time I tell Jason, I thank you for doing this. He says, well, it's really just a
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:28.480]   script. I think that he needs to expand everything. I would love to have his graphs about every day.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.960]   He should just put out something. It doesn't have to be about Apple. It could be about
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:37.360]   anything. His charts are just amazing. And I get so much out of looking at them all.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.320]   That's the thing. I understand the data. I think you can look at the numbers. At least for me,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.040]   it doesn't speak to me nearly as much. For instance, this pie chart, which is Apple's quarterly
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.800]   revenue by category, immediately stands out that the iPhone is no longer the completely dominant
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:59.200]   revenue driver, that it's only 49%. And what's that big purple wedge on the left? Services. Now,
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:05.520]   driving 21% of quarterly revenue. Not profit necessarily, but I think that tells you a lot
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.160]   about how Apple has changed in the last few years. Yeah, you can make a lot of money off of
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.640]   just pushing electrons. And I think if there's one thing that's going to help them out,
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.400]   if and when the world changes again, and people are sick and tired of carrying
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:24.240]   phones in their pocket, they got the next thing on the runway ready to go. In addition to the
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:28.960]   stuff they haven't announced yet. Yeah, 36% year over year revenue change. It's, I think,
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:36.080]   again, another record quarter in the third quarter for Apple. I don't see a bigger Q3
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:40.080]   anywhere. Of course, Q3 is not traditionally its biggest quarter. Q1 is that's when the new
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.400]   iPhones come out. So you'll see those peaks in revenue. Good and in profit too. Good profit
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:53.840]   quarter, $21 billion in three months, $7 billion a month. I mean, you know,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:59.600]   we thought a pet business to be in. Revenue is up, as I said, 36%.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:05.120]   I thought the revenue was interesting that if you kind of draw a line across what you had just
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.040]   before this, if you draw a line up that and you just kind of extend that line on that initial cliff
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.440]   or the initial little hill, it just would, it would almost meet the ones that are on the far end.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.360]   And it was like, we were, we had it figured out and then we had a rough patch. And then we're back
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:26.160]   to where we were. Yeah, the rough patch is from 19, 2019 through 2021,
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:34.880]   there was a very steady growth in 2017, 2018, then up to 2019. And then it just tanked. What happened?
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:41.680]   This is, this, by the way, is a, is a, is a vector. This is a, it's year over year
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:49.840]   revenue growth. So it's kind of a, it's not exactly a direct match to revenue and totally or profit
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:54.640]   even. But the year over year revenue change was down, it was actually negative in a few of those
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:01.120]   years. Yeah, they had a problem for a quarter. What was it? There was a huge China problem for China
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.720]   when the team could put the letter out about that they weren't going to meet. So that's,
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:10.560]   that's, and then something happened in China in 2021. Is that, is that kind of, because the other
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.080]   growth is really nice. Yeah, they had a bunch of bad factors hit them all at once for,
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.520]   I think a couple, a couple after big quarter, like after holiday quarters for two years, but
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.440]   like Alex said, they, those were anomalies. It turned out those weren't directions.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:29.840]   Yeah. Yeah. Good. Good news with services. 21% of overall revenue, but really also,
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.520]   and as a Mac guy, I'm happy to see this. Good news in the Mac. Yeah. Great Mac revenue. M one.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:42.240]   M one baby. Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot of restored faith in the, in the Mac end of things.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:48.960]   A couple of years ago, you could have, if, if an analyst had said that they're worried that Apple,
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.640]   if they see signs that Apple is going to be ramping down the Mac in favor of either a new platform
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.880]   or a new iOS or a new focus on other things, it would have been an outlier, but you would have
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:02.480]   had people saying that kind of makes sense. I'm not going to dismiss that out of hand.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.000]   But now the Mac seems to have a very, very bright and glorious feature.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.440]   This is, I think that also they're slowly figuring a couple of things out because they,
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.880]   you know, I don't think that Apple really was making the best computer they could from 2016
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:19.280]   until about 2020. I mean, they had key, they had bad keyboards. They took away our Macs.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.160]   Say much of things that made a bunch of us not buy Mac. So like I was like holding on
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.920]   a 2015. Yeah. Just a lot of design problems that I felt like were kind of unforced errors,
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.640]   like things that kind of worked. And then they took them away to make them look like yours.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.640]   Absolutely true. When the M1 came out, I was like, the Mac is back, you know? Yeah. Yeah.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:42.320]   Wow. This is it. This is, this is the Mac we loved and innovation that we expected.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.680]   I can put away all those Lenovo bookmarks that I've done.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.320]   But the bookmarks, exactly. I mean, it's amazing. I have, I have
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:59.680]   five of the M1 Mac minis base unit eight gigs, each pushing four 1080p streams out of wow.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:05.200]   You know, it's just amazing. Yeah. These little, these little looks $699 machines just do it.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.000]   I just want to buy, I just want to buy one because you're so cute.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:14.720]   They're so cool. I mean, actually what I am doing, I kind of slapped myself in the head.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.000]   I think I mentioned this because I was about to buy a Mac mini for my desktop.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.280]   And then I thought, oh, just all I need really is a dock for my M1 MacBook because it's the same
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:27.920]   thing, right? So it's just a different form factor. But I do like that Mac mini form factor.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.960]   I have to say. Yeah. You can even get a keyboard port in LEO.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.120]   Oh, yeah. They've released the, with the fingerprint reader even. Yep.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:43.840]   Doesn't it, doesn't it look like that the swing across the industry is moving away from
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.480]   facial recognition and back to fingerprint recognition because there's so much in place
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:52.960]   of the early enthusiasm. Yeah. I mean, I have, I have, I'm I, one of the few things that I,
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:33:00.000]   I really wish that I had fingerprint recognition on my M1 iPad because all I, as I'm picking it up,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.160]   you know, you eat, you quickly get into the habit, like with my phone, whatever, as you're picking it
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.560]   up, you touch the, you touch the pad and it's awake for it. I'm locked with the iPad. There's
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.360]   always that half second where I have to make sure I'm facing. Yeah, it's not as bad as that, but
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.280]   it's always bad. Oh, it is bad. It's like, okay, because I have to, to me, maybe because I'm doing
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:23.440]   it in bed when I'm lying sideways sometimes. True. You have, I actually have to lift up and pose so
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.320]   that I can unlock it. The phone or the iPad, it's really annoying. Just bring back the fingerprint.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.240]   Yeah. I would love to have a, if I had a fingerprint reader on the keyboard, I would,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.600]   I would not even care about no facial recognition on a desktop at all.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.720]   I also think there were, at some point we're going to get either or, you know, you could do
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.200]   either or both, you know, I think that we are somewhere, if someone really wants to lock down
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.680]   their phone, I think there's some future where they say, I want facial recognition and my thumbprint
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.720]   and my voice print. And all three have to be enacted or something. And a code, you know, like,
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.120]   like, like, that's actually a great idea. And I think that when they put, I think you'll end up
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.800]   with all of them, you know, it won't be one of the, you can pick one, like, oh, I just want to go
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:07.280]   here with this and I just want to use my thumb or I, you know, whatever. But I think that you can,
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.720]   what's going to be really interesting is the ability to use all of them together if you,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.600]   if you want to. So we'll get back to the results in a second. But since you,
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:20.240]   since you mentioned it, here's the magic keyboard. Now available for sale, both with 10 key and 10
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.960]   key less. And they're up in the upper right hand corner is a little fingerprint reader. Now you
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:29.440]   have to have an M1 Mac to use that, of course. Why is that Renee? Is that it'll, it'll pair with
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.280]   any Mac, like you can use as a Bluetooth keyboard for any Mac, but they're using an authentic,
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.200]   like, because you need to secure the keyboard as well. You don't want anyone to just, you know,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   use any keyboard. So they have an actual authentication. They're not calling it a chip. They're calling
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.040]   it a block. And I'm not sure what they mean by that. They couldn't do that with the T2 in an
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.280]   Intel Mac. It seems like the T2 could do that. I mean, they could do anything, but they always,
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.560]   like, how much is it worth us putting the time in engineering resources into doing it for an
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.920]   older system when we don't have it? And then people complain, like they changed their minds about
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:02.000]   the live text on, on Intel Macs last week. And maybe they'll change their minds about this at some
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.640]   point. But right now the engineering resource is pairing between the M1, which is a much newer
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.520]   secure enclave than the old A10 one in the T2. Do we know if the
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.360]   call reader on the keyboard? I'm sorry. Good. Do we know if it works on the iPad as well?
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:20.800]   No, it does. The iPad doesn't have any right now. The Mac keyboards have total understanding of
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:25.040]   the iPad, which is why you can use universal control to control any Mac or iPad with the
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.440]   iPhone keyboard, the Apple keyboard, but doesn't go the other way around yet. So they haven't built
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.080]   anything that lets them the iPad understand the Mac keyboards yet. But I'm hoping that's
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:38.160]   coming because it's such a no brainer. Every nice thing I had the M1 iPad probe, it really
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:41.920]   nice if you could use this keyboard with it to be really great. The one thing that I heard too is
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.280]   that the face ID is coming is just a couple years out still because there's a lot of security stuff
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   they have to do to lock that down the way that Apple is doing it. But like to Alex's point, for
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.600]   the opposite of Alex, for like all of us normal people, we don't want five different locks on our
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.840]   on our device, we just want all those locks to come to us. So I don't, I should never have to
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:02.000]   fingerprint it. I should never have to face ID it. It should just anytime I touch the screen,
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   take a snippet of my fingerprint. Anytime I look at it, take a glimpse of my face,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.400]   hear my voice, judge my gate and just say, oh, the trust threshold is met. I know it's Renee.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.440]   I'm never, I'm not going to be locked. I'm not going to force him to unlock me like an animal.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.240]   I'll just be open until that trust threshold is low. And then I'll force him to do like an active
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:23.280]   unlock if authorization if he needs to. And then Alex can put all five on if he wants to.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.000]   Yeah, you love that. And maybe have a adjustable trust threshold.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Yeah, and say, well, I'm a, you know, I'm a candidate for Congress. So I'd like to turn it all the way up.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.040]   Or even lock casters. So I just want to turn it all the way down.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.920]   Or even location based. I'm at one at home. I want it to be really, I still want the some
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:45.200]   some should unlock a ton. Yeah. If I walk, if I leave this radius or if I don't, if I go to
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:48.720]   somewhere unusual, I want you to take it, lock that all the way down. Love that idea.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:53.760]   Nine to five Mac assumes. And I think they're probably accurate that this was not available,
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.960]   this keyboard earlier, because they want to make sure they had enough for the new iMacs.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:04.000]   And no colors. No colors. That's disappointing. Yeah. I know.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.920]   No too many skews. All right, back to the graphs. Those common colors.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:16.880]   This is interesting category wearable home accessories used to be the other category.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:24.640]   But this is the Apple Watch, the iPod, the HomePod, what other accessories, AirPods,
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.680]   that kind of thing. And don't look at the bars because there's those traditional
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.120]   apples made them famous spikes on the first quarter of every year.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:40.880]   But look at the black line, which is four quarter average. And man, is that a very nice upward
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:47.360]   curve, very steady real growth there in that category. Yeah. The question is always going
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:52.720]   to be how much of it is due to more people getting into this product line versus how much of this
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.120]   is based on extension of the product line. We do have the, they do, they did have. Well, that's why
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:01.680]   I like it. It's smooth because there's not like bumps when the new product came out. It really feels
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:06.240]   like it's just a continuous growth with that. Any real bumps in there, which I think is good.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:10.560]   Yeah. And the size of the AirPod business. Well, yeah. I was going to say when you think,
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:17.040]   this category is so much AirPods and it just goes to show you more than watches. I think,
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:23.040]   I think the thing is a watches, they've been, they've done a great job making them affordable
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.160]   and accessible. But the AirPods swallow your watch, I guess. I mean, everybody,
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:35.040]   there are people who don't really so much care about their fitness, but they do care about listening
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.840]   to Motorhead or whatever. So I think, and also the group of people, actually, are fairly lucky.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.880]   Like, they get their exercise like mostly a neck, you know, stuff like that.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:52.880]   But I think, I think it's, I think it does indicate that I, there are times where I wish that Apple
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:58.880]   would get a little bit into consumer electronics because boy, if they, if they could make a, if they
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:04.480]   made those, those AirBuds multi platform or ease, sorry, easily multi platform as opposed to,
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:10.160]   eh, okay, I guess if you have an Android phone, we won't, we won't, we won't, we won't, we won't
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:14.960]   intentionally screw the Bluetooth protocols so that you can't use it with them. But if they make
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:21.600]   things that can be multi platform, multi platform, boy, Apple styling, Apple design, Apple reliability,
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:26.480]   Apple service, those are huge wins for any consumer. And I wish that they would do more of it.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:32.240]   And I guess, on the other side of that, I just, I still think that like even just Apple TV on the,
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:37.600]   on the TVs is, is kneecap their ability. I mean, kneecap a lot of us on our ability to
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:43.680]   serve up content because the TVs are so painfully underpowered. Yeah. And so the thing is, is that
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:49.120]   you end up with, when you do external, when you make it available to external folks, you have to
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.200]   deal with them under powering everything, right? You know, and, and so they, so then that's an
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:59.440]   whole nother. You have your brand, you have your brand out there in something that we now have to,
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:05.440]   you know, we can't deliver what we want to deliver that we can easily, on my end, we're delivering
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:10.160]   really high quality video and on all the Apple made products made in the last two years,
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.800]   that's nothing like it's nothing for us to do. And for everything else, including the TVs with
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:20.400]   Apple TV, it's a thing. That's a really good perspective. You kind of lose control over the
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.960]   experience. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a, and it hurts you as an end user or producer of content.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:33.200]   It's a very interesting point. Here's the services revenue, also a very nice steady growth in the
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   black line services revenue now 17.5 billion dollars. App Store mostly.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:47.760]   It's still probably a huge, it ain't Apple TV plus I can tell you that. I mean, the
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   count app store subscriptions is Apple subscriptions. That gives you an idea of the scale of the store.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:58.880]   Yeah. Yeah. Year over year services revenue change 33% growth year over year.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:06.880]   iPad also very, very nice. You could see the iPad pretty flat right up to the second quarter of
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:13.280]   2020 with the release of the new iPad Pros and then just a very nice steady growth right there
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:20.000]   over a period of four or five quarters. So that's good. That's good news. Yeah. I like the iPad. I'm
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:26.880]   glad that they are doing it. I just saw an article from a non Apple trade magazine saying there really
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:32.240]   is only one tablet. It's not even worth considering anything else. It's like the iPod market. Yeah.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:37.040]   They just don't know. I don't. Yeah. I can't use it for everything but the M1 iPad is the best
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.120]   computing device I've ever owned. It's amazing. It's just, it's just the most pleasurable. There's
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.920]   just so many things I can do with it. You know, I have LiDAR and I have, and I can draw on it and I
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:52.160]   can do a lot of things. It's just amazing. Yeah. It's not, it's not literally true only because
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:42:00.880]   there are Samsung does make if you must, if you're so, if for whatever reason, including you just
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.000]   don't want to write, don't want to use the useful thing that everyone else is using.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.080]   Samsung's Galaxy tablets are nice if you want to, if you want a productive productivity based tablet
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.880]   but there really is nothing that functions like an iPad. There are lots, there are lots of tablets
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:20.000]   that are good for reading, lots of tablets like the Amazon has, I think they do require,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.760]   they do deserve a lot of props for making fire tablets for here's a less than $100 color tablet
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:31.040]   for the backseat of the car that you're not, you're still going to teach your kids to treat things
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:36.080]   well and not break them. But if they break this tablet, you will be pretty cool with it and wait
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:40.720]   a month before buying another one. But yeah, that's, that's, it's not a technically true statement
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:44.240]   but in practice. Yeah, absolutely true. And that's what an amazing accomplishment.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:50.000]   Any other takeaways from the quarterly results? I mean, the one I, I think of is
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.160]   Tim Cook admitting in the analyst call that they are going to be hurt by chip shortages,
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:01.840]   not shortages of their flagship chips, the A16 or whatever in the M1s, but, but of these,
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:07.200]   what he calls legacy chips. I think of the most, the most interesting word used in the entire
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:13.280]   event was the word legacy. I think that tells us that within the next two to three years,
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.920]   Apple will not have any external chips. Yeah. Like the fact that they use the word legacy,
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:22.000]   I don't think is by accident and I don't think it came off the cuff. I think it's saying that
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.120]   these are the old, this is the old way. And I think that we're going to probably see them
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:31.280]   transition slowly away from all the external chips because it, again, they're also empowering all
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.040]   these other companies to keep up with them. When they take all that away, it means that all those
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:41.600]   foundries don't have the same volume, that they're not moving as fast. It's a huge impact for Apple
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   to say that we're going to get rid of basically every other piece of silicon other than what we have.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:51.200]   Legacy nodes. Yeah, that does imply that the... It's a bit of an industry for anything like
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.000]   90 nanometers and over and Apple's at five nanometers and TSMC's announced two nanometers,
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.040]   which to me starts to belie the world, like the laws of quantum physics.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.600]   Yeah. Well, that's why we're calling it. We're, Intel no longer calls it two nanometers.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.040]   They call it 20 angstroms.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:10.960]   Which stand out of his mouth? I'm measuring differently to begin with.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:18.400]   Mankstroms are what you measure the frequency of light waves with. I mean, this is such an amazing
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:24.720]   thing. Red, red, red. And if you want proportion, the color red is 6,000 angstroms, not like 6,600,000.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.360]   Yeah. Yeah. So we're talking 20 angstroms.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:32.960]   They don't want... These are either atom distances now we're talking about.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.000]   Right. They're so small.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.800]   Previously, Intel's 10 nanometer was roughly equivalent to TSMC's 7 nanometer and they don't
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.640]   want us... It's like when you have different model numbers so you can't compare cross-border
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:46.080]   shopping, they kind of do that to us so we can never see whose process is ahead or not.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:53.040]   But like it's long story short, Intel is a little bit behind. They're very confident they're
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:59.040]   going to catch up, but it sounds like a TSMC or... They're optimistic. Very optimistic that someday
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.440]   we should figure out how to make a 20 angstroms. Like Qualcomm's like, "We're going to catch up to
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   Apple really fast, but they're never going to catch us in modems." And it's like, "Well, which one is it?"
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.400]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.600]   It's big one.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.480]   The one thing that I was keeping an eye out for that I thought was interesting was that I don't
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:21.840]   believe in either the call or the Q&A. They mentioned anything about how they feel regulatory
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.840]   pressures in the future is going to affect anything coming up in the near future.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:32.000]   Interesting. Which is fine. I think that means that they're unlike Amazon,
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.240]   unlike Google, they have no fraction of a billion dollar fines that have been applied
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:41.040]   in the past two or three months. But it also means that they don't feel like there's enough
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:44.800]   pressure that they be forced to say, "Here is what we're going to have to change. We're going to
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:51.200]   be impacted by what we expect to be a sea change in the way the FTC regulates technology and what
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.640]   Congress has planned for the next year or two." Yeah. That's an interesting omission. Yeah.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:00.000]   Back to the supply constraints. He said, "The majority of constraints we're seeing are of the
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.200]   variety that I think others are seeing that I would classify as an industry-wide shortage."
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:11.200]   He says, "We also see some shortages where the demand has been so great beyond our expectations.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.600]   It's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times. What would that be? The
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.520]   iPad, the Mac?" That's every year, though. Yeah.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:23.920]   Well, you wanted to buy a lot of these. They almost never have enough chips. They're bleeding
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:27.200]   as chips. They almost never have enough supply. It takes a while to get those. Sometimes the new
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:31.440]   screen technology is like mini LED has been constrained. So constrained that apparently we
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.200]   were supposed to get those new MacBook Pros back at WWE. I think that's the real constraint.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.040]   Yeah. Yeah. So we have to wait now till September. They said the shortage is
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:45.120]   effect iPad and Mac, but not, of course, the iPhone. He did say a couple of months ago,
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:52.320]   the supply constraints could be a $3 to $4 billion drag on sales. But he said this time that Apple
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.040]   was able to navigate and reduce the impact so it wasn't as bad as they thought. We're at
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:03.200]   Told CNBC. We're actually able to mitigate some of that. We came in at the lower than the low end.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.560]   Part of the lower than the low end part of that range.
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:13.120]   The iPhone is really mature right now. Whenever they introduce a big new technology
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.520]   iPhone, it has the same problem. But like last year, they couldn't do 120
[00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.720]   Hertz because Samsung just could not make the panels. So instead of it being constrained,
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:23.200]   they just didn't do it. And this year, that sounds like I'm going to make a ton of those
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.840]   panels. So there's not going to be as much of a constraint. Any other, any other
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:34.960]   takeaways from the results last week, anything else to say? Zero pot shots at Tesla.
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:40.560]   I'm like Tesla. Two. No one. Zero pot shots at Apple.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:45.680]   Yeah. Well, that shows you when you're the big guy, you don't have to shoot down. It's only the
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:52.080]   little guy's shooting up. That's also also that if the if the producers of Ted Lasso had any
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.960]   reservations about sticking to Apple for contract negotiations, it's like the fact that this is
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:02.880]   yet another time where Tim Cook called out not called out this one show as a point of pride,
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:09.040]   almost as though it was an iPhone, almost as if it was the M1 chip. Yeah, they know what they got
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:13.760]   there. I haven't watched the new season. Is it is it keeping up their quality? It's so good. Yeah.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:17.760]   It's so good. It's like I got like hit by lightning lee. And that's how it feels like.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:24.640]   How do they so when they started Apple TV, plus they would release three episodes and then one by
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:30.080]   one week by week, how are they doing the second season of Ted Lasso week by week or week by week?
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:35.120]   Week by week. Oh, so they're okay. So yeah, I a lot of times I just wait until the whole
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:40.400]   thing's out and binge it. You know, good, good reference. I got that shortbread,
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.120]   the shortbread reference. Yes. Yeah.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:50.640]   Okay. Did they did they break out anything like Apple today? Did they break it? Apple TV plus
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:56.880]   or anything like that? No Apple TV. Do you say anything about a hobby? Anything like that? No,
[00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:02.480]   there are no hobbies. There were no there were no there's no decoupage, no spafflking. No.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.640]   I think it would be safe to say the Apple TV is still a hobby though. Yes.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:15.360]   Pretty good hobby. I think I think it is I'm not even going to try to make an analogy here. I
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.720]   think it's something that helps Apple TV plus look better. And it's something and if people are
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.960]   going to be coming into the Apple store to buy something, it gives them something to buy rather
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:32.560]   than buying a Roku stick or a firebox or a or a Google box that costs about a quarter as much and
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.960]   does three quarters as much as the Apple TV. I think it's useful. It wouldn't be on the on the list if
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:42.480]   it wasn't pulling its weight. I think that it for the folks who use it like me, I mean, it is my
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:47.280]   interface to media on my in my entertainment system. So it's it's I don't have anything. I mean,
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:52.080]   I have other things that I test on in you know, to look at, but what my family and what I use
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:56.640]   every single day all day is if it doesn't exist on the Apple TV, I don't know that it exists.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.800]   Other than what I'm doing it tests, you know, like if it's not like for the for my home
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.400]   entertainment. So I and I'm not like when I talk to people, there's a lot of people like that like
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.880]   it's easy. It's simple. They don't have to think about it. They don't you know, it just works.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:16.560]   It's secure. It's private. I have all the streamers and I it just it's the default. So yeah. Yeah.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:21.760]   Yeah. It's not the best hardware. I got to say I have to reset mine frequently. I think the thermals
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:27.040]   are a problem with it. Yeah. You a new one? Yeah, I don't have several of them. And yes,
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.920]   they all have the same problem. They get I haven't they get wanky and janky resetting it fixes it.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.960]   I think it's maybe I probably reset it two or three times a year. Like there's usually something
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.920]   you're right that there's something that gets locked up in it. But I have never I mean, it's
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.760]   very rare. It's like I think it's an app. You see, it's an app.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.320]   App stops navigating and then I have to reset it. Yeah, where do I where do I have the problem the
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:53.920]   most? It's a YouTube app for the Amazon app. It might be the Amazon app.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.920]   Yeah, the apps crash. I mean, there's definitely things where poorly written apps like yeah,
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:06.560]   like Universal's app for a while was just horrible. You know, like it just it was so bad. And it was
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.680]   I'm sure that it had something to do with it was just the way it was doing long tops or whatever.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.720]   It was just handing you footage that it wouldn't play back. So is there a way
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:18.800]   force close an app and restart it? Yes. Oh, there is double click the home button and then you
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:22.880]   flip it up like you're getting like you're throwing away the card. Oh, so it's just like on an
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.280]   iPad. So double clicking the home button brings up a list of all the apps are running and you
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.720]   can start the house. The TV button one has a little TV about TV button. Actually,
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:36.320]   so I will do that because I've been restarting thinking it's thermals, but now I will just
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:40.480]   force close the app and restart the app. That might solve the problem. The last night we're watching
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:47.280]   must have been peacock because you're watching Yellowstone and the show starts and you know how
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:53.920]   it has a little loading thing. It just stays there. It does. There's a red yellow circle on the screen.
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:59.280]   And so I go the network apps aren't Apple TV apps. They're just called open GL apps. So they bring
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:03.280]   over from their smart TVs and then those so I should start blaming the apps, not the Apple TV.
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.560]   And also the if the whole thing is is blame the Apple TV. Yeah. Yeah. If it does that and you go to
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.360]   another app and it works perfectly, then it's the app. So it's you know, I understand. So that
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:19.520]   but if it gets hung up on that, it's not it's not the Apple TV though. It's the it is, you know,
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:24.240]   but I close like well maybe because I close the app, I get out of it and the audio is still playing.
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:30.480]   The other thing I know is the Apple TV is every once in a while, it'll start glitching
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.840]   where the whole interface goes to snow and then it starts playing and then it goes to snow again,
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:41.280]   it starts playing. Maybe I have a several bad units. I think that's a heat problem myself, but I don't
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:48.320]   know. Sometimes a hard is it wedged between stuff? No, it's out in the open air. It's in a cabinet,
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:52.960]   but the cabinet door is open and it's got six inches above it and left and right, a couple of
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.360]   three inches. So it's a little disappointing to know how many how many weird hardware problems
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:03.120]   are solved when you just go to eBay, order like a simple like fan heat sink. Yeah. And just and
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:07.840]   whatever whatever feels hot on the bottom of this thing that keeps restarting itself,
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.080]   you just put a heat sink on the bottom of it and oh dear, that's all that was maybe that's what
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.680]   I move into. But that's a flaw in Apple's design. See the PlayStation upgrade, Leo?
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.360]   You can finally get the new storage for your PlayStation. We got to buy your on heat sink.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:25.120]   Of course. Hey, if you're buying it, why not? Why wouldn't you do that?
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:28.560]   Microsoft is just you slipped in the new storage. PlayStation is like here, this is a drive you
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.320]   need to buy. It has to be one of these drives and you can find a heat sink for it.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:39.200]   She's go out. Find a heat sink. Jeez. That's our famous Sony fit and finish. We all know and love.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.640]   And also we're also we're out of paper towels. So if you could buy some of your
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:49.040]   out and send them to us, it would really help us out a lot. Because apparently you are our
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.800]   delivery system for for component design. And you know, you can reboot by just holding down the
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.840]   two buttons, right? You're not getting up. Yeah, that's how I reboot. Yeah. Sometimes though,
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.800]   I have to actually go and unplug it. And I think that because of thermals is it's cooling down
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:07.680]   enough to. Yeah. But yeah, usually I just hold on two buttons, but I like this whole down the TV.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:13.200]   Then you could swipe it off. That may have been all I needed to do last night when I was having
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:22.080]   the circles stay there on Peacock. How's Peacock? I haven't used it. The only reason I have it and
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.920]   pay for it is because of a couple of shows that we like to watch that are on it.
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.640]   Yellowstone's a great show. If you haven't seen Yellowstone yet, highly recommend it.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:34.400]   Can we get that on crave? I got it. I have to admit, I went to I was like, Oh, the Olympics,
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:38.880]   I'll sign up for Peacock. Oh, no, no, no. I asked for my email. I there's one solution.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:43.760]   I don't like no. The mess of the Olympics, which is horrific. And everybody's complaining as they
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:49.440]   do every four years or five in this case. The big solution to me is use YouTube TV.
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.200]   And then there's a button that says record everything. That's what I did.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:55:01.040]   And by the way, I hate I hate myself for doing it, but I paid the 20 bucks a month for 4k.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:07.200]   But now I have 4k HDR and I can watch any event because it's on YouTube TV. It's figured out all
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:12.000]   the different ways to get it. That's that's not by far the easiest way to do it. I think it's the
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.920]   now I can't remember. I think it's channel seven in Australia. If you if you're able to VPN in
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:21.680]   and get it, it's all the feeds. It's all the Olympic feeds. Well, they're in the same time.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:27.680]   Like 40 some like 40 some feeds or whatever that are all available if you can find your way.
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.040]   Still, if your bits can come from Australia, we'll just say, yeah,
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:36.720]   my message, unfortunately, does not eliminate the foolishness that NBC does to all of this,
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.920]   but at least every recording. I was about to say that one of the big changes in watching events
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:46.960]   like this has been realizing and is how much good how much better almost every other country's
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:52.480]   coverage of a sports event is because we watch the BBC. It's like they understand the idea that,
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:58.320]   wow, there's something happening that requires no beheaded beheaded commentary. We can just
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:02.720]   actually let this beautiful thing happen. And as a moment, as opposed to say, and now
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:08.320]   it's eat long foot of it is picking up for the pick up the shot, please.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:12.160]   Cut to an interview with the line that we did four months ago. Wait, wait, wait, wait,
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:18.240]   San Diego. That sounds like a foreign name. Is the foreign name? I'm sorry. Let's go. Let's go.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:22.160]   Let's cut away to this American Olympian. How to proceed in drinking water.
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:29.200]   Yeah, there you go. But you know what this complaint is every four years. It's just a regular thing.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.400]   So stop making me try to feel about things just general stuff. I'll feel they don't trust. They
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.800]   don't try. This is historically the problem within Network Teleports in the United States.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:43.680]   They don't trust the audience. Maybe they're right. They may know. It's old media. It's old media.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:46.640]   I mean, it's old media. There's a there's a calculation. Okay, now we do this thing,
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:49.840]   and now we do this thing, and there's a little model and how do we put this little box in the
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.200]   how do we put this in the box? And there's boxes and you have to fill the boxes with the things.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.680]   And they they have a formula that they've decided works and whether it does or not is,
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.200]   you know, they made money as much money as they needed to on the last one. The problem they have
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:06.400]   this one is that they're just bleeding capital now. I mean, it's pretty ugly. Oh, it's just, you know,
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:09.520]   we're watching the demise of the old media. That's fine. I don't mind.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:12.560]   As an old media guy, I'll just retire when it's all over.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:17.920]   Seven plus, by the way, that's the channel that I think does. Seven plus now.
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:22.800]   An Australian. I could VPN there. I wonder if I could somehow get BBC VPN.
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.960]   I wonder how that can always VPN.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.040]   I flower. They're always trying to shut down the.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:33.920]   They're very cagey. They're also getting better and better about fighting. Hi,
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:38.480]   you know, you're the subreddit that keeps posting posting recordings of all of our stuff like the
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.560]   day after a post. We'd like you to stop doing that. Please listen to our lawyers.
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:51.920]   Annie and I co w g b h Boston in a co calm Renee Richie YouTube.com slash Renee Richie.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:57.600]   Alex Lindsey, the author of the new book, This Land is my land. No, no, I'm sorry. I had the wrong
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:04.160]   script. I kind of order it right now. Oh, nine oh dot media office hours dot global.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.480]   Is Elon Musk gonna be the next CEO?
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:15.840]   This is embarrassing. I think you want to be CEO of Tesla. Yeah. So this is a book
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:22.320]   which is written by Tim Higgins is a respected Wall Street Journal reporter. It comes out next
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:27.920]   month. It's called power play. Tesla Elon Musk in the bed of the century. And I'm sure it's well
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:35.680]   reported, but somehow, somehow they got Tim got you say that Leo, but somehow he got a story that
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:44.320]   there was a conversation when apparently, Elon and Tim Cook met to talk about Apple buying Tesla.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:51.840]   There was a conversation in which Elon Musk said, okay, but I have to be the CEO of Apple.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.440]   And in which Tim Cook said, F you and hung up on him. Now, none of this is credible at all.
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:59:03.360]   Both parties have denied it. In fact, both Tim and Elon said, you know what? We've never even
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:09.040]   talked to each other. We've never even met. Yeah. Before, before, Elon wouldn't hesitate. Yeah.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:13.280]   But before this book came out, that was like what they were saying on both side. I think
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:20.720]   Elon in his oddly out of character for him, him being such a reticent fellow, did mention that
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:25.280]   boasted that, oh, well, Apple had a reached out to Apple years ago, they could have bought my
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:30.400]   entire company for pennies, but he wouldn't even return my phone call. Yeah. It is. I mean,
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:36.640]   would kind of make sense if Apple wants to do an Apple car that they kind of need a car manufacturer.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:40.720]   I don't think they want to get in that business. Maybe they think they do. I don't know.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:46.160]   They just want it to be someone in Germany, not. Yeah. I think it would be a mistake to pick
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:50.480]   to get in bed with Elon. Just saying that conversation. Everybody else.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:57.600]   One tweet, one tweet in your entire retirement fund is like, okay, I guess I'm working till
[00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:05.360]   74 now. Thank you very much, Elon. I just think that the idea that that conversation happened
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:11.840]   is so incredible. It's so incredible. It's just not not even possible. I mean, the idea that Tim
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:17.520]   Cook would say that to another CEO of any kind, it just Steve Jobs might have said, like if they
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:20.400]   said that Steve Jobs said that, I would be like, oh, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. But Tim Cook,
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   you know, that's Tuesday for Steve Jobs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And did Elon want Apple to buy Tesla
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:31.280]   with Dogecoin? Because that would have been real. Like maybe then I would believe.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:37.360]   Mac report says, and it is a rumor that Apple is expanding its California self-driving test fleet
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:44.480]   to 62 cars and 90, 69 cars and 92 drivers. Maybe they're looking at,
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:51.760]   maybe they're looking at actual filings. So maybe it isn't quite a rumor. That is down though,
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:59.680]   from October 2020, when Apple, they reported that Apple had 154 driver permits. So it is not an
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:09.600]   increase. Yeah. Do you know that Apple's actually filed the government agency has a voluntary
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:14.960]   program for companies that are developing self-driving cars to say a file report that explains what
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.520]   your testing procedure is, what technologies you're using, to certification plan. Tesla has not
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.880]   filed such a report, but Apple has. Yeah, good for Apple. I found very interesting.
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.000]   This from the California Department of Motor Vehicles collisions, Apple has had three.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.080]   Of course, Waymo's had 111. That's Waymo. That's Google's their self-driving. But they can afford a
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:41.280]   veritasium video, so they're fine. Yeah. You know, and also is related to how many miles driven and
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.240]   so forth. But I think it's interesting. I mean, there's no question because of these filings
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:51.920]   that Apple is absolutely, you know, working on self-driving vehicles and they have increased
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.760]   the number of cars, decreased the number of drivers, but increased the number of cars.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.880]   Yeah. I think someone also-
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.840]   The whole thing is like centered on going to, sorry, Andy.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:05.200]   I'll just just quickly there. And it is actively evolving. It's not as though they are building a
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.200]   platform and just for testing software and the software is the only thing they're trying to do.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.880]   There was an up to someone. There's on one of the autonomous vehicle blogs had updated photos of
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:21.200]   a Apple car sighting just a few weeks ago, which they compared to a previous sighting of about a
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.720]   few months earlier, noting that there are new sensors on the side of the car that weren't there
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.440]   before. And they changed some of the sensors that are on the top. So it is a hardware project as
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.040]   much as a software project, which I would not have that money on it.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:38.320]   I think also you're kind of waiting for the market to get to a certain point when it comes to
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.800]   self-driving, when it comes to- Apple has time. They don't need to make the money. They're not
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:48.320]   a car manufacturer. So they can work out a lot of the details and be figuring those things out.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.680]   I mean, I think that as a user, when I saw Google put up a car with no driver seat,
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:57.920]   just like you're just going to get in and drive you around, I thought that was Kookoo. Now,
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.360]   I wouldn't buy a self-driving car that actually had makes me- I just want to get in a box that
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.640]   takes me to the place that I want to go. Well, that's the ideal. But there's a- I think it's bad
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:17.280]   that for the entire platform, for the entire industry, that Tesla is the name that's most
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.360]   closely associated with autonomous vehicles because they're the one- they're the one company that is
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.640]   absolutely not doing that. They're also the company that is doing the most squirrely things
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.360]   to get these cars on the road. You have Intel, you have Apple, you have Google, all of whom are doing
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.560]   real-in-depth for real investigations going very, very cautiously and making sure that they're
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.920]   always doing things that are fully in line with federal and state guidelines. But then you have
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:47.280]   Tesla, which are actively saying one thing when they're speaking to California transportation
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.680]   regulators, but saying another thing, okay, Elon, but still, when they're talking to the public,
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:00.400]   they keep talking to us. There's a transcript of the conversations with California state
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.360]   regulators saying that, no, no, no, this is level two driving only. Believe me, if we ever do level
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.520]   three or above, we will not do that until we talk to you guys and get the proper permissions
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:15.760]   and certifications. But meanwhile, here is, they have beta people driving beta software
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:23.120]   that is doing self-driving on like city, regular like residential roads, not just lane assist on
[01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:29.200]   highways. And that's that sort of playing cute with the rules is A, I think reckless and B,
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.360]   it just makes me not respect how they're approaching the enormity of this problem.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:39.920]   Do you find it's really fun in our, sorry, no, please, I was going to say self-driving is a lot
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.360]   of fun when you're sitting in a headquarters watching your car move three inches in the
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:47.520]   Arizona desert. It's very different when you live where Andy and I live and snow is indistinguishable
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:52.880]   from walls. Like you very seldom see people doing all these demos in the middle of a Boston or
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:56.560]   Montreal winter. So there's there's a long way to go and Apple has quite a bit of runway to get there.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:04.720]   How do we feel about spatial audio now? It's been out for a while. I've pros and cons from people.
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:10.480]   And you know, part of it is that producers are starting to learn how to do it better.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:16.640]   Do we like it still? Are we still excited? I know you were pretty excited about it, Alex. You still
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:25.360]   are? Yeah. Yeah. You know, I can tell the difference. I hear the difference. I don't know if I need it.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.680]   I still think stereo sounds pretty good. But I guess if I had the choice, I'd choose spatial
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:34.560]   audio. I think that I think that what I'm hearing and the hard part right now is that is that the
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:41.440]   the issue is Apple's making everything sound better. So they're doing some kind of processing
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:46.720]   to all the songs that make them all sound a little bit better than what they did in old stereo.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.400]   And they're doing something that dimensionalizes them. I don't know what it is, but I can hear it
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:56.160]   even in songs that aren't necessarily some automated way. So but the ones that are designed, what
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.960]   you're hearing is hit and miss. So right now we're kind of in that. There's some and a lot of
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:05.280]   this comes down. I think we talked about this before. The difference between I think that music.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:12.640]   So the folks who have done tons and tons of surround movies really understand how to do this.
[01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:18.640]   And the folks doing music, some of them do, but a lot of them don't seem to. So the issue is,
[01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.040]   is that and this is the primary issue that I'm hearing constantly, is that they're choosing to,
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:31.440]   one set of engineers is mixing the vocals down the center channel. And one set is mixing down
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:36.240]   right and left. Right and left is a music engineer doing what they would do. Going down the center
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.400]   is a movie engineer doing what they do. And most of the movie engineers have done this for a lot
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:49.520]   longer. The effect on me is that I hear this kind of echoey reverb thing between the two ears that
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:55.840]   isn't perfect or it feels phased or something. Yes, I've heard that as well. So that's because
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:01.920]   someone mixed the vocal down the two right and left instead of down the center track. And so
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.040]   the center track is where you want to put the vocals, I have my opinion. I mean, everybody has
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:10.560]   different, like if you listen, a perfect example is, and I talked about this before, Russia's Tom Sawyer
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:18.080]   is fills the feel, the music field, more than almost any other song that I've heard in Apple Music,
[01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.840]   except for Getty Lee's, his voice is coming down right and left and has this weird kind of
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:27.680]   facey sound to me, you know, facey thing to me. And so, so that's the, I mean, that's my,
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:37.040]   both, and you hear it more in a stereo, like I have 7.2 at my, or, yeah, anyway, so,
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:45.200]   7.1 in my house. And the problem you get into is that I hear it a lot more in my stereo than I do
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:50.240]   in the headphones. So, so anyway, so I think that it's, I still feel like it's the future. I think
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:57.440]   that, but I hear us wandering, like there's song, I think we're seeing that a lot of engineers are
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:01.120]   doing it. And a lot of what we need to do is have a big conference between
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.760]   surround engineers to talk to each other, trade notes, figure out what's better,
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:10.240]   break things down. We're going to, I'm going to get a, one of the surround engineers that I know to
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:13.600]   probably do something in office hours. And we're going to, you know, where we just literally break
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.000]   down some songs. Let's talk about the songs. Listeners sent me a great podcast, darn it,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.280]   I can't remember what it was. I'll have to look at my, but where they did get a guy who is doing a
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:29.760]   lot of spatial, who actually built a studio so that he could do it. He's a remix engineer and talks
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:34.480]   a lot about the issues involved. It was a very good podcast. If I could find it, I will, I will
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:38.560]   tell you. It's complicated. I, I, and I want to say that while I'm complaining about some of the
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.640]   mixes, learning how to do it is a thing. You know, I'm figuring out how to do it right now,
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:48.240]   myself as a, as an exercise. And I'm taking something very simple. I'm literally taking the,
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.680]   the sound that your iPhone makes when it rings. I found the, I found the MIDI for that. Well,
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:57.600]   I didn't find the MIDI. I found the XML for that. So I have it in Logic and I'm like playing with
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.720]   all the stuff and I'm kind of moving it around. I'm just going to use that one piece of music
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:07.040]   to do it. The, the, you know, that, that in beer thing to, to kind of think through it. And,
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:12.080]   and as soon as I got into it, I'm like, this is really hard, like it's hard to think about. And so,
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:17.520]   so anyway, so I have a lot of respect for the, the engineers that are doing it. I think that that's,
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.000]   you know, a lot of them, some of the best ones are really subtle. And I love listening to it.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.120]   The problem I'm having right now is that I'm so distracted when I listen to them.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.400]   I can't do it. I can't play music and listen to it because when I hear it, I go,
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.240]   oh, I really like what they just do. Like, you know, like, this is, this is so nice.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:37.920]   It's so like it's, it's not just music anymore. It's like, it's like, oh, they put that there. I,
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.360]   I don't know if I agree with that. You know, like, and you're, you're thinking about the music in a
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.560]   different way because it's so much richer. I mean, you can hear what I will say about spatial is the
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:53.600]   spatial songs more than it being more than stereo. You can, the detail on every instrument is way
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.800]   more, you know, you can hear more in the instruments and their, their actual nature,
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.000]   then you could hear when they were all mushed together in stereo, you know. And I think that
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.560]   that's the thing that, that I'm noticing is there's more, more detail in the music.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:13.200]   Great interview in the Rolling Stone with Giles Martin, who is, of course, the son of the Beatles
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:19.520]   very famous producer. I won't say Don Martin, but he was in that magazine. What's his name? Anyway.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:27.200]   But in this case, Giles, who has, who already was working with spatial sound because he remixed,
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:32.720]   remember the Beatles love was a remix for the Gerserk De Soleil show in a spatial theater.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:39.280]   And he talks, he's actually said, I'm unhappy with the Sergeant Pepper mix I did. He says,
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:43.120]   I'm going to change it. It doesn't sound quite right to me. It's out of novel music right now,
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.760]   but I'm going to replace it. It's good, but it's not right. Sergeant Pepper was the first album
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:54.400]   ever mixed in Dolby Atmos. And we did it as a theatrical presentation. And he said, because it
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:59.920]   was mixed for the theatrical mix, it isn't quite right. He's going to make it into what he's, what's
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:07.200]   called near field, Dolby Atmos as opposed to the cinema, Dolby Atmos. He said, you lose some bass
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:13.280]   and so forth. Abbey Road, he says, is better. He says a better functioning at most mix,
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.600]   because it's much closer to the stereo mix, sonically. And one of the things he did, I think,
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:22.400]   is fascinating. He said, we can do this because we are, you know, Abbey Road, we're the Beatles.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:29.200]   He talks about John Lennon's vocal on Day in the Life. He says, with the Beatles mixes,
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.280]   because we have, I suppose, the money to do it in the luxury of time, what I and engineers
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:39.920]   Sam O'Kell tend to do as opposed to using digital effects, we place the speakers back in Studio 2,
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:46.800]   which is where the Beatles recorded at Abbey Road. And we will re-record John's voice in Studio 2.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:53.840]   So what you're hearing is the reflections of the room he's singing in. So it's more accurate,
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.640]   you know, might must be nice. Yeah.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.600]   That's awesome.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.480]   Must be nice.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.920]   They thought of doing that. Like they're out drinking, you know, like, you probably some,
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.880]   you know, and maybe drinking. Anyway, so, but they're like, why don't we just put a speaker in there?
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.440]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.960]   We can just do it for three or four months of them trying to figure out how to record that
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.120]   speaker perfectly, you know. And it's actually a really good article if you're interested in
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:18.400]   spatial audio and the challenges. I mean, nobody knows better, probably than Charles Martin.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.760]   Nobody's had more experience with it. That's such an interesting...
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.320]   George, by the way, was his father. Thank you.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:25.040]   Right, exactly.
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.880]   But that's such an interesting philosophical question because this is maybe an ideal situation
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:38.800]   for the remix because Paul McCartney is still alive. There is at least the DNA of what the
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:45.120]   original producer intended or thinks is right or wrong because the original remixes were done with
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:52.320]   George had input as they were doing it. But what happens when it's like 20 or 30 years from now
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.840]   and someone else, they're not even trying to make a... They're not even trying to change it into
[01:12:57.840 --> 01:13:01.360]   something that it isn't. But they just said, you know, with this new technology, we can really
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.000]   bring that baseline up and now make it more noticeable. Like maybe they decided not to make
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.560]   the bass very noticeable. There's also... Part of this conversation would be that there's
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:17.200]   a really nice documentary series on Hulu, these Paul McCartney 3-2-1, where he and a producer,
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:22.640]   I can't remember his name, but he's legendary, are at the mixing board with the mixing tapes for
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:28.000]   so much of his hits from the Beatles on forward. And so much of it is talking about the construction
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.200]   of these songs, like then bringing up the baseline and noticing that Paul on this one song was
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:37.360]   almost doing like an entirely different melody, which is not something that you notice at all
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:42.960]   in this Beatles song, but maybe you notice that he was playing a complementary melody instead of
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.120]   just an accompaniment. It would be a totally different song. So as these technologies come
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:53.920]   forward, as we have the ability to add like 3D to 2D television and do it through artificial
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:00.640]   intelligence and machine learning, as opposed to reprocessing it with thoughtful human intervention
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:05.440]   by the director, are we creating things that never existed and that the original creators never
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:12.880]   intended, all in the interest of creating topsy-turvy, tinsel and gloss that this thing never actually
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:17.040]   needed in the first place, just to make it more commercial. That's the thing about Beatles stuff.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:22.560]   You do that at your own peril because Beatles fans are very clear and very outspoken. He says,
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.520]   "We don't fix errors." He says, "Sometimes when you do these remixes, you can hear,
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:31.360]   because you're listening to the vocal track alone, you can hear the vocalist be pitchy or
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.440]   something." He said, "But that's what made the record good in the first place." He says,
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.160]   "This is a highly recommended article." He says, "We start off with the stereo. I feel immersive
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:46.400]   audio should be an expansion of the stereo field in a way. I like the idea of a vinyl record melting
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:50.880]   and you're falling into it. That's the analogy I like to use." The other thing he says is,
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:59.040]   he says, "Be careful about using the surround." He says, "We are by nature forward-facing individuals
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:05.200]   who don't like too many things creeping up behind us. Sometimes I will with Dolby mixes and movies.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.440]   I remember the first time I had a surround sound system, watched a ball game, and the beer guy was
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:14.640]   coming from behind me. He freaked me out." He says, "If you have a lot of sound coming from
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:19.280]   behind you, you want to turn your head. I get criticized sometimes for not being expansive
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.760]   enough with these mixes, but it's what I believe. I like the idea of falling into the record as
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:32.080]   opposed to being circled around." I think we're in that place, though. When logic and when people get
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:38.240]   better at using resolve and in fair light and in resolve and as well as logic really becomes
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:44.800]   when it supports it natively, which is supposed to be this fall, when those things happen, I think
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:49.920]   you're going to see the same thing that happened with a special, as you saw with Photoshop,
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:54.160]   is that there's a lot of things that people thought were useful and advertising and layout and everything
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.520]   else. It was all very stodgy. This is the way it was because you had all these Citex operators
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.680]   that went to school and learned all these things. You had designed people who went to school and
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:08.080]   they went to CalArts. There was a way to do it and everything else. Then all these Photoshop users,
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:16.000]   those were me. We got it in 1991, 1992, and we went crazy and we made tons and tons of mistakes.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:21.600]   I once printed an ad in New Mexico that was fully black because I didn't understand it.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:27.360]   It was just a black square. When they said, "You proof," when they do a print ad,
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.040]   they sent me proof back. I just hit it. I was like, "I don't think anyone wants to see this."
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:38.960]   We just spent $2,000 on a black square. A lot of us got to play and you had Ray Gun,
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:45.200]   which was completely unreadable. You had all these things that exploded out of it. Then what we've
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.160]   settled into over time was something that is much more interesting and much more aggressive.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:57.120]   What our print looked like in the late '80s and then looked at what it looked like in the late '90s,
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.920]   it had just moved a century. I think that what we're going to see with spatial audio is we're
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.120]   going to see this explosion as the tools get easier. Every artist is going to design for it
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.400]   because it's going to be—you have a better chance of being featured on Apple Music.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.920]   They're going to design for it. They're going to think about it. Some of it's going to be horrible.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.680]   Some of it's going to be amazing. We'll find the language for doing this because right now,
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:25.280]   there's a handful of people that are doing it. In a year, there'll be hundreds and more. In two
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:30.000]   years, there'll be thousands more. In three years, there'll be every artist will be thinking about it.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:36.720]   They'll be thinking about it. It will take four to five years before we get to a point where we
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:41.760]   really have a language that makes sense. You're absolutely right. It's like 3D
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:46.000]   in the early days where it's all about, "Hey, look, here's a new camera."
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:54.960]   But then you wind up with people like Martin Spurssezi in Hugo. You wind up even with Hitchcock
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:01.920]   in Dial M4 Murder, where it is a natural and part of the storytelling. I'd be excited for when that
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:08.640]   actually really happens. Speaking of music, here's some good news, some new guitar,
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:17.760]   I'm sorry, GarageBand tracks, sound packs from Duolipa, Lady Gaga, and other well-known music
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:25.920]   producers. You can go in and do a remix session for yourself. These are really cool. I think these
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.120]   are so much fun. Was it Nine Inch Nails that did it first? It was really cool.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.560]   Well, this is, Nine Inch Nails is releasing the tracks. I wasn't clear looking at that release,
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:34.400]   whether they're actually letting you walk away with the time.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.920]   Or you just get some loops and beats.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:41.440]   I think they let you play with it in the store. I don't know if they're letting you actually
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.160]   take the tracks with you. Maybe they... Yeah.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:46.720]   Well, yeah, it's a GarageBand class.
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:51.520]   So, yeah, I got to talk to them about this. It's really interesting. This was based on a class
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:55.840]   from the Apple stores. It was like a 90-minute class. People wanted to take it with them. They
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.320]   kept saying, "We take this, can we take this?" So Apple's building it in. For those two artists,
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:05.120]   they gave Apple the master tracks for that. They basically disassembled them or put all the parts
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:09.200]   in there so you can go in and turn on or turn off different parts of the performance.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.960]   And it's done almost like a spreadsheet, which is great for people like me with absolutely zero
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.640]   musical ability. You just hit things and turn them on and you can bring in your own loops.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:21.200]   And they have producers like Ashfelder, who's just phenomenal at doing this kind of stuff,
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.280]   who does all this stuff natively in logic anyway.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.040]   Does stuff you can download or you can actually get it at home?
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:30.480]   Yeah, you can get their packs. Yeah, you can download their packs. I don't know if you can take
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.080]   them out of this interface though.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.920]   Yeah, they don't want you remixing the songs and releasing them probably.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:42.080]   Well, I think their rights are going to be different, but all the Apple stuff is completely
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:44.560]   like you can do anything you want with all the Apple loops that are included in there,
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:49.360]   including commercial work. And now they have these producer back packs that have royalty-free
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:54.320]   loop speeds instruments, drum kits, synth patches. Yeah, hold on instruments. Yeah,
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:59.280]   really, really interesting. And they've done Lady Gaga did one. She didn't, or no, it wasn't.
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.440]   There's a Gaga track on this. Yes. But there were other...
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.520]   Yeah, there was another one where they released it in logic, and I just can't think of the name
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:11.280]   of the song right now. Oh, I see. That's what I really... Then you can really do it, right?
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:15.120]   And it's like a master's course. Like when you see someone bounce all the tracks into logic and
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:19.600]   you just make it all down, that's when you really understand, like, number one is how complex these
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:25.120]   songs get. But also, you really see this incredible, like, how they built the song up and how they
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.600]   arrange it and how they... Yeah, you don't see that in any of this, which is too bad,
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:30.080]   because so it's not a listening experience, more like a toy.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:35.200]   Well, this is also the iOS versions. Like, this isn't the Mac version yet. It's only the
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:38.880]   iPhone and the iPad version, so it's further and there. But back before the world ended,
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.960]   when they were still doing this live, we got to sit in with Ashfelder and he went over how...
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.640]   I forget the artist. It was like Ariana Grande or somebody just... Oh, Oakfelder.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:53.680]   Oakfelder, sorry. I apologize. Different tree. Yeah, Oakfelder. They would just sing a few
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:58.960]   bars into a voice memos and send it to him and he'd be in the back of a car and he would put it down
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:03.280]   and then he would hum something and use logic to turn the humming into a chorus and he would just
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.400]   keep adding layer and he'd go to his mom's house and keep adding more and more layers to it.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.520]   It's a whole way to collaborate. And then send it back and forth to her and she would tweak it,
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:14.560]   send it back and he would do the entire song on his MacBook Pro at his mom's house. Like,
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:19.760]   just like 50 layers of tracks. It's unbelievable. It's changed the creative process.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:24.560]   Like, right in front of us. Yeah. It's really changed the creative process. I remember Steve Martin's
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:30.000]   album he did with Edie Brekell. She would send him lyrics. He'd record it on the banjo. He'd record
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.440]   it on his iPhone's center, the recording. And then she would... So they were going exactly the same
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:38.960]   thing. It changes the collaborative process. In this case, I think they went into a studio at the
[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:42.800]   end, but that was the process of writing the song. It was very interesting. And I think for the artist,
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.120]   there's a great way to make money. Let's have Apple just give you a lot of money to release some tracks
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:55.760]   and I think that they're... I think I'm hoping that Apple will, when they release Logic,
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:00.240]   they'll release a bunch of songs that are mixed for Atmos when they release the new Atmos.
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:02.960]   Whenever they've talked about the fact they're going to release it. They need to,
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:07.600]   because they need to show best practices for this, right? And I think that that would be the
[01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:13.440]   best way to do it is to have songs that are really interesting, that are pre-done, that can be,
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.800]   that you can break down and understand how they did it. Yeah, really interesting.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:21.920]   China's complicated.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:32.560]   In many, many ways. But so as we talked about last week, prototypes of the new iPhone have leaked out
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:38.800]   to a lot of sources. We talked about Marquez Brownlee's robot arm taking beautiful video of the
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.920]   iPhone prototype. Apple's lawyers in China have now sent a cease and desist letter
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:52.320]   to a Chinese citizen who advertised these stolen prototypes on social media. This comes from Mother
[01:22:52.320 --> 01:23:00.000]   Board. So this actually goes back to the iPhone X, but I imagine something similar is happening
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:09.200]   today with these prototypes. And then in a way, they threatened them. Now, of course, again,
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:18.560]   as Chinese lawyers working for Apple, but in a way, they threatened them with retaliation for
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:26.080]   the Chinese government. So yeah, I mean, they're doing something, excuse me, the people who are
[01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:31.840]   selling these prototypes are doing something that's wrong. There's some headlines about this last
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:37.600]   week about Apple crushes unauthorized, whatever, whatever. Well, which would be terrible if they
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.360]   were trying to shut up people who were trying to report on news, which is something that came
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:46.400]   up in the headlines last month. But this is, no, someone is stealing something that is property and
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:50.960]   trying to sell that property that can be implemented. But then they then ask these guys for a list of
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:57.520]   anyone who gave you the leaked devices, they're trying to trace it back. Yeah, but that's legit
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:03.200]   too. I guess if you're saying if you want if you want us to hit you in the head with a softer hammer,
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:08.960]   let us tell us tell us who you're working with. And there's a lot of there's a lot of
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:14.720]   folklore about how, oh, well, it's China. No one cares about copyright violations. No one cares
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:20.160]   about intellectual property. And it is a very, very looser situation that we have in the United
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.560]   States. However, no, there's this is something that they will get lots and lots of help with.
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:28.800]   There are a lot of factories that are doing counterfeit, whatever that gets that get to operate
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:34.480]   for a while, get to really hone their craft, but then they get swarmed and shut down. So it's not a
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.680]   huge problem. It's still very much worth their while to try to produce knockoffs and do stuff like
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:46.160]   steal these these physical samples and sell them on. But it's not as though there's no recourse for
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:50.880]   this to happen. So Apple is, Apple is, Apple is cashing in on some of the goodwill that they've
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:55.200]   been building up with the Chinese government over the past several years as soon as they sell their,
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:00.160]   their people inside the government that this is super bumming us out, do something about this,
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.880]   there's going to be a big bag of her cropped on this entire industry.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:08.080]   And then sometimes companies leak the their own stuff and Intel is executive.
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:17.600]   Mistakenly, I think, published a photo on Twitter that showed Thunderbolt 5.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:26.160]   And some of the specs, including 50 gig, I'm sorry, 80 gigabits per second, which makes sense
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:34.880]   that doubling Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3. He posted a picture with a poster on the wall showing
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.880]   showing, you know, so it's like he wasn't doing it on purpose showing the latest technology,
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:53.680]   an 80 gigabit physical layer, and apparently PAM 3 modulation technology, they of course
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:26:00.160]   immediately took it down. But here's the picture from a non tech and of course somebody with,
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:05.680]   this was the original picture, somebody with sharp eyes zoomed in on it, a non tech has put its
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.720]   zoom enhanced and non tech is not in the original picture that is that is so let everybody know
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:15.520]   that they got the scoop on this. So yeah, you got to be careful what you're posting. This was
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.800]   Intel's executive vice president and GM of the client computing group Gregory Bryant.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.080]   Careful what you post. You're not going to get away with it because the people who the people
[01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:32.800]   who specialize in news, they are the people who they don't even like make it a regular habit of
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:37.200]   checking out your Twitter feed. They actually have scripts that will download every single tweet
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:42.800]   that you make and keep it safe. So just a second. If you post it, you're not going to be able to
[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:48.880]   take that down and take that back. And before we wrap up a sad farewell to the cult of Mac
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:54.720]   magazine, Lander Connie posting his farewell. I wasn't clear from this
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:02.240]   whether they don't want me to have an ad blocker on here. I'm sorry. I'll continue with that
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:09.120]   supporting just for the moment. I wasn't clear. Is this the paper magazine? Is this the website?
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:13.120]   Is it what is it that they're going to just continue? I should probably call
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.400]   Leander. He's been on our shows of course. I don't know. I don't know. I think I seem to
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:22.480]   remember it was digital, but I could be wrong. Yeah, I don't. It was designed for newsstand.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:30.560]   So they published it as a standalone app. Leander writes, "We've seen readership slowly decline,
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:35.760]   especially with apps like News Plus and Flipboard. And of course, there's Facebook and Twitter.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.800]   Ironically, is readership of the magazine declined. We saw readership in the news plus app pick up.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:48.640]   But the digital magazine, the standalone app, the cult of Mac magazine will discontinue
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:55.120]   after 411 weekly issues." That was a good run. And just like we said before about Apple,
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.600]   it's great to be in the electron business because electrons are free. You can just scoop them up
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:04.080]   by the handful whenever you need some more. Whereas producing and shipping and marketing a physical
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:08.240]   product, boy, you need so much infrastructure these days that I'm amazed that anybody gets into
[01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:14.560]   that business at all. Yeah. And of course, Leander published a book that called the Mac
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:19.280]   famously with the head-shaped with an apple on the back of it. And so forth.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:24.560]   He's one of the old guards. He's one of the old work horses of Mac and Apple journalism.
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:32.640]   So just a little note noting the passing of the digital cult of Mac magazine.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:39.600]   Let's take a break. And when we come back, would you like to do your picks of the week, boys?
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:45.120]   Yes, love to. I see you've filled them all in. You've done your jobs.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:50.480]   Let's start the picks of the week with Andy and not go. Andy, go right ahead.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:57.200]   First one is a follow-up. Last week, a pick of the week was that Best Buy was like fire-sailing
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.960]   the previous generation magic keyboard for the iPad Pro, the 12.9-ish one. Normally, 350 bucks
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:09.600]   down to 199. I said that the day before I'd ordered one, the course arrived in a timely fashion.
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:16.320]   I put my iPad Pro 12.9-ish in it. And even though it was the 2021 model and the keyboard was the 2020
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:21.600]   model, I was expecting, okay, it doesn't fit quite as well, but it certainly is.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:30.080]   Exactly. If someone on eBay had bought these for $200 and sold it to me as a current generation
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:35.600]   one for 320, I was like, "Oh my God, I just saved $30 on this. This is great." So it's just a quick
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:41.520]   note that they're still available for sale at 199. And don't let anything stop you from thinking
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:47.120]   if you have a 2021 M1 iPad Pro 12.9-inch. Don't let anything stop you from thinking that, "Oh,
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.680]   it's not going to fit quite well." Yeah, you may remember it fits perfectly.
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:54.640]   I bought the Logitech Combo Touch because I thought it wasn't going to fit my new iPad.
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:58.480]   And I used it for a while. And then I thought, "I should try. I still have my magic keyboard."
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:01.920]   And it fits so well. And it really is the best because of the floating and all that stuff.
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:05.840]   It really is. The only thing I wish it did was I wish you could fold it,
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:11.040]   I wish it had a 360-degree hinge so that I could use it in handheld tablet mode. But the thing is,
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:16.320]   because it attaches via magnet, I can simply pop it off. But then you have this husk of a
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:26.880]   keyboard lying around. Yeah, but husks are part of life. But yeah, it really does. I've used the
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:32.640]   magic keyboard before, obviously not as an owner. But I do fully appreciate after having it for a
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:37.440]   week. This is why it costs $350. I don't think it's overpriced at all. It is such a beautiful,
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:42.640]   perfectly made. The keyboard is super comfortable. It doesn't feel at all like a mobile keyboard.
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:47.520]   It's just $350 for me. It was going to be way too much. I could justify spending for a keyboard
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:52.480]   case. So that's just an update. So once again, if you thought that A is not going to fit or B,
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:56.080]   you thought you missed your shot last week, still available, only available in black,
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:00.160]   because that's what was available in. But you got that. But the other thing that's kind of cool is
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:05.520]   that one of the great features of Monterey coming up that I'm really looking forward to,
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:12.480]   we've talked about a little bit, is object capture, which is an API based system for taking photos of
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:17.280]   a 3D object and turning it into a digital 3D object, and it's being handled by the operating
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.600]   system. Obviously, as soon as Monterey ships, we're going to see a million of these apps. Some
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:24.640]   of them are going to be good. Some of these are going to be bad. However, someone has actually
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.480]   created one that will work with a beta and it's available in the app store. It's called Photo
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:34.160]   Catch. You can go to photo catch dot app to find the download link for it. Works with your iPhone,
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:40.080]   works with any other pictures, and it's not terribly sophisticated. Maybe these apps are not going to
[01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:45.920]   be sophisticated because they don't have to be, but they seem to work very, very well. I don't have
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:52.400]   Monterey running on anything yet because I don't trust it on my real max yet. But I've seen so many
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:56.640]   people using this and I've seen the models they've created with it, and oh my god, I can't wait to
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.840]   get my... It almost made me upgrade to Monterey immediately just so I could start playing with this.
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:07.280]   So this seems like it's going to be a fun thing to do. I thought Alex Lindsey got one of his picks
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:12.000]   mixed up with yours at first. I haven't seen it coming. I knew that it was coming. I mean,
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:15.760]   not this app, but I knew that we'd eventually start to see some tough apps that came out.
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:20.080]   Yeah. Because what's so exciting is that what I... And we talked about this before, that Apple didn't
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:24.640]   take the step of creating the app for you. It made it hard enough that someone else can build
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:27.920]   something and get some exposure and everything else. And people are going to be able to build
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:32.720]   apps and make money with them. But they built all the hard... They did all the hard work. Like getting
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:37.840]   all the photogrammetry to figure its way out is the stuff that's really, really difficult.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:42.720]   And Apple has really done a good job. And this is going to get more complicated because eventually
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:46.560]   what you want is an iPhone. Right now, just like just take a bunch of photos and throw them in.
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:52.640]   Whereas eventually the iPhone app or people will build apps that guide you through this process.
[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:56.560]   Like yes, I have all the data. They'll start processing it in real time. They'll start doing
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:02.240]   a bunch of other things. Like this is baby steps in very, very basic. But I would,
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:05.120]   to Andy's point, if you have Monterey or if you're willing to put it on a computer,
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:10.080]   I'm literally in the last 10 minutes, I'm like, I'm buying an M1 Mac just to do this.
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:15.280]   I mean, I'm literally going to buy an M1 just to run Monterey. Just to run Monterey, just to run
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:20.480]   this app. You know, like it was just because I... And finally, I made Alex buy something that was
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:25.680]   expensive. Oh yeah, you're very... It's interesting. I don't know if this is a lower quality, but you
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:30.720]   can actually do it from a video. So they show actually on the webpage how you can shoot a video
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:34.880]   and then send it to your Mac. You get higher quality with more resolution, with more... All
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:39.840]   those things are going to give you... If you have more resolution, what's available, I don't know if
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:45.360]   they're using it, is the LIDAR data helps. Being able to control the phone and how it shoots is
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:50.720]   going to help. So there are things that will make it better, but you can definitely do lots of things.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:57.040]   But the other thing that's exciting is that what I'm doing with it is I'm building a new shelf.
[01:33:57.040 --> 01:34:00.640]   I'm going to replace this gray background with a shelf, but I want it to be like these classic
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:06.400]   media devices that I have laying around. And so I'm planning to digitize them all, take pictures
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.440]   of them all, turn them all into something so I can visualize myself before I start cutting wood.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.440]   And so the whole idea of the whole shelf will look a certain way. I'll even key myself in front of it,
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:21.200]   but to make sure like this is... Why even bother? Why not just have a completely digital shelf?
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:25.920]   Because I wanted a multi-camera. Because I want new multi-camera with close up
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:30.320]   your mini cameras and everything else. It becomes like a... You don't want to have them by a special
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:37.040]   head for your cameras and motion graphics capture video cars. I think it will look nice too. I think
[01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:42.480]   that this is good because I don't have anything else to put behind me, but once a... You could have
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:49.120]   pre-vis a shelf is what you're saying using 3D capture. And remember that all of this, these models
[01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:54.640]   can all be imported into motion. So Apple's motion, the $50 app, you can just drop these models in,
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:35:00.400]   you can from motion, you can also take those into Final Cut. So you can literally take pictures of
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:05.520]   these objects, have them, export them as USDZ, and have them in your Final Cut edit. You know,
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:14.000]   like that's doable today. These are wild. This is amazing. Again, I'm so close to it. It might be
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:18.640]   even the next beta. I'll wait for one more stable release to come out. Let's get one more stable-ish
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:26.080]   beta that looks good to come out. But to Alex's point, I'm so glad that this is an API that's
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:30.720]   built into macOS and not just simply here is a way that we're going to sell more iPhones because
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:38.000]   LiDAR is a nice enhancement for this process, but it's going to be the real win about this is
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.480]   going to be able to acquire your images however you want, wherever you want, with whatever tool you
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:50.880]   want, including your really wonderful brand new micro four thirds camera that you're still obsessed
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.520]   with, even though you've had it for two or three weeks now. And then just simply drag it. I'm still
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:00.400]   Oh my god. Who is this? I would imagine somebody named Andy and not go maybe. Oh god. It's like,
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:06.560]   I will only say that I've got the 600 millimeter. You get the Olympus. What did you get? I got the
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:10.960]   I got the Mark three, the recently updated. I was going to say the last year's update. They had a
[01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:15.520]   you were you were in Hawaii when I made this my pick of the week actually. Oh, it actually arrived
[01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:20.560]   during the show is right. I'll leave for my chair. And I will without I won't take up another
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:24.240]   another 10 minutes talking about it because I could take up another hour talking about it. But
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:31.280]   yeah, it's it is you know that you made the right decision. If I if like I after the show,
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:37.360]   I'm going to go next door and pick up my usual Tuesday night Italian sub. And I'm going to be
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:43.600]   taking my three pictures of your six hundred and my six hundred big six hundred millimeter lens.
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:47.120]   I'm going to go for a walk around just in case there's something cool to take pictures of because
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:52.240]   I cannot stop taking pictures of this camera. It is so cool. I haven't even started using it.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:57.440]   I want a 3d capture of the sub. That's what I want. How many how many images does it take to
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:02.880]   to do a good job with this? Alex, how many as many as you can? I mean, I've seen some of these
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:07.680]   people do 240. Yeah, there's some there's some objects that you could probably capture in
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.720]   10 or 15. You know, it doesn't you can definitely get it with a handful of just depends with
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:17.600]   details. I guess. Well, there's a couple things that you're looking for. Number one is the level
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:21.840]   of detail that you want. How much of the little areas that you want. And the big thing is occlusion.
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.680]   So what is when you're shooting from certain angles, you have to get every angle. You know,
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:30.000]   if it can't see it, it can't model it. So so you have to like for instance, for some objects,
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:34.240]   what you really want is a turntable that's really they have these are large. What you want is something
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:39.120]   really small because you want your camera to get down below it and then be able to go around it
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:44.640]   from the bottom so that you can get all the all the geometry from from below. And so and this is
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.200]   also where the LiDAR information becomes super useful because when you're looking up, you might
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:54.160]   be seeing the ceiling, but the LiDAR can tell the app theoretically if it depending on the apps
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:58.080]   looking for it. But this is in the API. Oh, don't don't pay attention that stuff out there because
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:02.320]   I know that that's further away. And so that's going to make it you know, it can do some pretty
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:07.120]   slick things. Yeah, it's good. It's exciting. Let's hear. So that by the way,
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:13.280]   is photo catch for object capture. You do have to have a Monterey beta and it's free, I think,
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:19.360]   right, Andy? I think so. Yeah. Keeps pretty new. Yeah. He keeps making new versions for different
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:24.320]   betas. Even if you have the first beta, he has a legacy version of it still up. So pretty stuff.
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.200]   Photo catch.app. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Lindsay's pick of the week.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:38.720]   So we had these folks on yesterday, on office hours. And it's a it is a program called Hedge.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:46.560]   And they have actually been around for quite some time. And so what they do is if you are a
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:51.040]   if you're a video, one of the big problems you get into is your on site. And we
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.960]   Paul was on yesterday and he was talking about how it got made was basically with AppleScript
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:03.120]   at first. It's now all written, or some swift or whatever. But the it started 10 years ago,
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:08.800]   they had a show where they had 15 cameras and 12 hours of content for reality show. And they
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:14.240]   had to deliver all of this footage by the next day to an avid editor who had to cut it together
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:18.720]   and had to have all the time code and had all be synced and lined up. And so they started working
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.280]   on it. It was a lot of work. And they started building all these Apple scripts. And before they
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:24.720]   knew it, they had a they had something that they figured, well, maybe should turn this into an app.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:30.080]   And so they turned it into an app. And what it does, and it's been around for a while,
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:34.080]   but what it does is you can take your memory card, like you're shooting and you're doing your memory
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:40.480]   card or your drive or whatever. And you can copy it to multiple locations at one time or to multiple,
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:43.680]   you can have multiple cards going to multiple locations, or you can have multiple cards going
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:48.480]   to one location. But the point is, is that for ingest, for reliable ingest that's managed
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:55.440]   through the system, what it does is it seamlessly allows you to on macro windows, but it allows you
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:40:00.400]   to ingest all of that footage. And for a lot of us that are on site, ingesting is the scariest
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.400]   thing you do, because you shoot all this footage. And now this is the show. This is what you spent
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:09.520]   all that money on, you know, to do. And now you got to reliably get it to backup. And you might
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.280]   want to send it to primary. You might want to send it, you might like, for instance, you might have
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:18.400]   your primary, your backup and the client output. And you could, this will do all of those things.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:21.840]   And instead of doing it one at a time, it might be a little slower, but it's like, I can throw
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:25.200]   all this stuff at it, come back in the morning and all the stuff's been archived, where it needs to
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:29.920]   go. And then it keeps track of it all. So, so that's what, you know, that's what Hedge does in
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:36.560]   its, in what it's doing. This is a little bit of a, you know, production, vertical, but they just
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:41.040]   took out took on some investment. So they've also bought divergent media, which makes edit ready and
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:48.160]   scope box. And so they're really building around this pipeline of us as video production
[01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:53.280]   folks. And it's not just Final Cut, but it definitely works with Final Cut. And but how do we manage
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:40:57.760]   all of that content? How do we pull it all off when we're on site? How do we manage it once we
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:04.240]   have it? You know, how we prep it for transcode, those types of things. And so a little heady. But
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:08.480]   for anybody who's listening, who's done a lot of shooting and has a lot of footage from the field,
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:15.520]   it's worth checking out. Hedge. It's cool. Hedge. Multiple backups of your media fast and easy.
[01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:20.320]   Like we asked them what, like, so what's the name hedge? This was again, he's, if you want to hedge
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:23.840]   your bets, you can watch an hour of it. No, no, it's not. That's what we thought it was. He said,
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:29.200]   in Denmark, they said, when you throw something over the hedge, it's like not my problem. You know,
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:32.160]   like it's like, I'm going to throw it over the hedge to somebody else. Oh, it's not my problem.
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:35.520]   And instead of throwing it to a, usually that means I'm going to throw it to a person and they're
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:38.880]   going to have to deal with it. In this case, he said, we want the computer to do that. Like,
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:43.440]   it's not your problem. The computer will, you know, do all the things you need to make that work. So
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:50.880]   and if that's a good name, no, I like it. Thank you, Alex. And now Renee Richie with his pick of the
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:57.280]   week, you know, just quickly to Alex's point, I record on dual SF express, CF express cards
[01:41:57.280 --> 01:42:01.040]   just for redundancy. But then I plug them into my Mac and sometimes it doesn't recognize the
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:04.960]   adapter. And I got to unplug it, plug it back in again. Sometimes there's transfer. I use it for
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.200]   ridiculous transfer speeds, but sometimes it goes slower than USB one. So I've got a reboot Leo's
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:14.720]   Apple TV to get it to go back to the normal speeds. And this kind of stuff is just like,
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:17.280]   and you have your entire show on that thing. So you really are all stressed.
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.720]   Yeah. So my pick of the week is is one of the things I love about the time that we're living
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.960]   in is that a lot of this production equipment keeps getting less and less expensive and more and more
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:31.760]   available. And every company is really like we talked a few weeks ago about aperture making
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:36.800]   much more affordable lighting. And Sony has been doing these much more affordable cameras. They did
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.600]   a sort of a vlogger camera where you couldn't change the lens, but it had things like showcase
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:45.760]   mode. And it was yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Now they just put out a
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:51.840]   interchangeable basically a mirrorless camera with interchangeable lenses, but it's $700
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:57.520]   rather than $1,000. You can put it's APC lenses, but you can put any lens you want. It's compatible
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:01.760]   with all the vlogging stuff they made for the previous cameras. So it's got like that Bluetooth
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:07.280]   stick that you can hold onto it. It's got all the different Sony audio heads that you can put on
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:10.880]   it's like the different microphones that you can put on it. And of course, you know, like Justine
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:16.240]   and Jenna and everybody iPhone though, they all had their their tests on it full first day that
[01:43:16.240 --> 01:43:20.960]   it was available. But for somebody who's just getting into this and they need more than just
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:25.840]   a static camera, like whether they're streaming or they're doing video work and whether that
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:30.960]   video work is reaction videos or like tech videos, it just it takes a lot of the complex.
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:36.640]   It's not as flexible as if you get a cinecom, like if you get a Canon, you know, or you get a Sony
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:42.720]   cinecom, of course, but it does so much so so it's still a lot of money to some people, but
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:48.480]   it's so much less money than any of the traditional cameras. And I it just feels like we're opening
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:53.760]   up this whole thing even even more people like the hardware is becoming as accessible as YouTube
[01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.000]   and TikTok and Instagram and all the platforms have been for a while. Yeah, this is really the
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:05.520]   trend. 700 bucks. I'm so tempting to buy this except I'm not a vlogger. So I really have no
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:13.120]   excuse, but I really if you were if I were, I would buy it the ZV-E 10. Yeah, the names are so weird. Yeah,
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:19.200]   I'm sure stories come up with product name. It does USB out right? It does a USB video out.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:25.520]   And it'll show up as a clean age. Yeah, I think you can get clean out. You can capture card
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:30.480]   it as well, but it does a lot of the cameras do USB out. Yes, it says easy live streaming with
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:35.920]   single USB cable and no extra hardware or software. So it is also a streaming cam.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:41.840]   So you can use it for your zoom calls as well. Yeah, I wonder how long you can run with that
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:46.560]   on 4k without overheating. I didn't I didn't know that was still a thing, but I was I saw the
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:51.760]   latest burn up banner video yesterday. And she said, okay, I'm back. I have to take my camera
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:57.120]   overheated again. So I have to start. I had to take a break. I believe it has no 29 minutes.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:02.560]   It does not have a continuous recording limit for movie shooting. So they really are treating it
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:06.320]   but that doesn't mean it doesn't overheat. But I have to think it might mean that they.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:11.120]   Sony's have been really good. Canon's like the R5. I have an R5 and it will overheat like if I'm
[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:16.560]   doing a K like I will just absolutely overheat. But the Sony's have been really good with that.
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:21.920]   Yeah, 8k you can understand 4k you're you'd hope that at this point you're not stuck to like a
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:28.000]   five minute runtime. It's like the R100 I think was for like a couple of different editions of that.
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.520]   It was like, yeah, we're going to shut this down before it explodes in your hand. So Canon does
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:38.000]   this thing where no one camera is allowed to have every feature that makes sense for that camera
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:42.880]   because then you would just need one camera. So like like one of them has mini HDMI and when
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:48.800]   I was full HDMI, one of them has a full sensor one has a crop sensor. And so my R5 will overheat
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:53.280]   on 8k. But also if you do the full quality 4k and they had the artificial limit, but then they
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.720]   removed it like it's just it's it's so frustrating. But it just the color is just so good. This is
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:03.280]   very tempting for me because of course I'm I'm a Sony shooter. So I have a lot of Sony lenses. I
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:09.120]   have the digital shotgun mic. I have a lot of the equipment. But does it support? Is it a separate
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:14.800]   lens mount? I wish I could figure that out. I best I must support my thing is just Sony APC
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:20.240]   lenses. Yeah, maybe it's only APC because I have all full frame lenses. Oh well.
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:25.200]   I just went all in on RF lenses and they're amazing problem. Yeah, you're really stuck when you
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.760]   when you start buying lenses that's so much more expensive than the camera. Well, for video,
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:32.880]   you need them to be quiet too. Like it's really hard to figure video when you hear the lens wing
[01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:37.920]   as it tries to focus. So and the new ones are so much faster and so much quieter and so much
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:42.480]   steady. They all have built in they have stabilization in the body and in the lens. And it just it gets
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:47.360]   compelling at a certain point. Nice. And it does have it does have a micro HDMI as well. So you could
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:52.640]   do you could theoretically co-out of it as well as like a little as a really nice webcam for your
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:47:02.720]   810 mini. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm trying really hard not to buy it but it's pretty cool.
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:10.240]   What do you shoot with now? The A7R4. So it but as a full frame. I mean I wouldn't mind if it
[01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:13.920]   cropped the full frame. That's not an issue. So you could just get an A7S3 Leo. That would
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:19.680]   be only actually that'd really really be the way to do it. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I could
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:25.600]   shoot in V log and you could shoot. You could shoot a lot of you in the desert. Yes. You could
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.560]   do anything with that camera. And look at what Philip Bloom does with that thing is unbelievable.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.960]   Yeah. It's a really amazing camera. I've kind of again holding off.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:40.160]   Renee Richie's doing his best to get me to spend money. So is Alex Lindsey. So is
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:43.200]   so is Andy and I cove. That's their job. I know is I got Alex.
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:52.240]   It's like a hard one to get. Yeah. Now you're a sponsor. I think for the rest of the year. Yeah.
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:58.480]   Andy and I cove, when are you going to be on GBH next? I'm going to be on 1 p.m. on Thursday. Go
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:03.440]   to WGBH news.org and stream it either live or later. I know I said last week that I was going
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.880]   to be the boss of public library back in the studio. It turns out that's been posted
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:12.800]   for again. So yeah. But so look for masks as well in the yesterday. Yeah. But like I said,
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:16.960]   you can stream it live or you can stream it later. Just search for my name and it'll come up in the
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:26.240]   right show. Thank you, Andrew. Alex Lindsey 090.media is your day job. And then your 24 hours a day job
[01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:35.120]   is office hours dot global. It's a it's a it's a group project. Yeah, we focus on hedge. Yeah. And
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:42.400]   it's a yeah, we had a release from Sound devices there and we've got a lot of anyway, it's it.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:47.120]   We're having a lot of fun. The the two hours is great. You know, we're we're covering a lot of
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:50.960]   ground. It's just an incredible group of panelists that that are really in the second hours are
[01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:58.320]   obviously getting really good. The the 23 hour outside of it has gotten kind of interesting,
[01:48:58.320 --> 01:49:02.720]   you know, in the sense that we, you know, that there are 23 hours of what we call after hours.
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:07.840]   So there's office hours and there's after hours and the after hours. And it is the after hours is
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:13.440]   just as interesting. You go on. There's 50. There's typically about 50 people floating around on
[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:19.520]   between 30 and 50 people 24/7. And so we got on this morning. I got on this morning. The guys were
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:23.600]   like talking about modular sense. So I started asking some questions and we started breaking
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.360]   like how modular sense work and how the oscillator works and how the how it's connected to the
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:31.040]   LFO and how we, you know, like it's like this long drawn out and we decided, well, we're gonna
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:35.440]   have to make this a second hour or something. But we spent like an hour talking about it
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:40.400]   randomly and and they realized they said, oh, we had done something at four o'clock like at four
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.880]   o'clock in the morning before I got up, they had already done a whole thing about modular synth,
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:49.200]   you know, and so it's becoming like, you know, and but it but what's interesting is is that in the
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:53.200]   evening, what's happening is the guys were talking about it's like an open again, it's like the open
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:57.120]   office that you always wanted, which is the open office where you can still shut the doors, right?
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:01.760]   That you have a bunch of people that are really smart that do this all over the world and they're
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.880]   all there like you can say, Hey, I don't understand how this works. And someone will just go, Oh, this
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.200]   is how don't don't do that. And then they go back to what you're doing. So it is all the advantages
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:12.480]   of open office except if you don't want to talk to anyone, you just turn it off.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:17.520]   Office Hours, Stack Global, it's not a show, it's a lifestyle, apparently.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:23.840]   Alex, honey, you're not spending enough time with the families. You know what, tell you what,
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.080]   I'll cut down your just one show a day.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:32.640]   We lost power in Nevada because it's California. It's California.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:36.000]   You get used to it. And the all the all the generators except for me, because I haven't got
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.880]   my generator yet, all the generators turned on. Everyone's got used to it now. And the
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.200]   the funny thing is my biggest problem was like, Oh, I'm not going to be in after hours. I was
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.680]   I was planning to sit there in the evening and hang out. My wife was out hiking. And so I was like,
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.880]   I can go to a party station to get your power converters. Yeah, exactly.
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:51:04.160]   And of course, Renee Richie, you can find him on YouTube YouTube.com/Renee Richie. Anything you
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:10.640]   want to plug? Yesterday I put up my my version, my hot take on the whole Tim Cook Elon Musk
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:16.240]   Bruhaha. And I love it. Today I'm going to talk about the timeline for Apple Silicon Max and how
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:19.280]   long it's actually going to go on out. Oh, I will have to watch that. Yes.
[01:51:19.280 --> 01:51:25.040]   The place to be thoughtful Apple reviews and analysis. And he's and he's really kind of toning
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:31.120]   down the reaction snap shots in the thumbnail, I have to say, just a little smile here. A little
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.800]   eyebrow raised there. Oh, if you go to the videos tab though, you can see I've got some good Tim Cook
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:39.840]   and Elon Musk face going on. Oh, there you go. They got the reaction. Yeah, let them do the work.
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:48.400]   Yeah. I love that. YouTube.com/Renee Richie. Thank you, Renee. Thank you, Alex. Thank you,

[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:18.640]   That would never. A little live offended. That was a good chat. So if you tune in, make sure you
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:23.120]   join us live because that's where you're going to get all that stuff. You can also, if you're

[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:37.680]   working on it, cleaning it up. The final version comes out on the website, twitter.tv/mbw. It also
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:42.720]   is posted to YouTube. There's a whole YouTube channel devoted to Mac break weekly. And of course,
[01:52:42.720 --> 01:52:47.120]   if you have a podcast client who doesn't these days, you can subscribe in that. Just search for

[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:57.120]   star review. Let the world know. You listen to Mac break weekly. Let them share the wealth
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:03.920]   with others. There's another way to play. And that's our club twit. I want to encourage everybody
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.640]   who wants to support this show and keep it on the air and all of our shows to join club twit.
