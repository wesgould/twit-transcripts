[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.360]   I'm Leo Laport, our first show of the new year, I guess.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.040]   Alex Lindsey is here, back from his travels around the world
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.160]   of 20% of the year.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.600]   You're set.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.480]   You got an iPad, iPhone, and Air.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.360]   I'm ready for the show.
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.640]   New Air?
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.960]   No, not a new Air.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.000]   I've had this one for a while.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.760]   I did 11.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.920]   I did order a new laptop, but it's coming.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.680]   It all arrives soon.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.400]   There you go.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.040]   But I keep putting it on.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.880]   We're going to talk about it.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.720]   That might have been a mistake.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.440]   We'll talk about it.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.840]   Also, here Andy Inaco from Baston, or Therian, or Environs.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.640]   Metro Boston, outer Metro Boston.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.080]   Outer Metro Boston.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.520]   He is the guy in charge of tech at the beautiful Chicago
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.680]   Sun Times.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.560]   Also has his own blog, The Celestial Waste of Banwhits.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.320]   Did you have a happy holiday, Mr. Inaco?
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.920]   It was a very exceptional holiday.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.160]   It's a fun Christmas day.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.920]   I spend the entire day driving a load of the backseat
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.840]   with presents for friends and nieces and nephews and sisters.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.480]   And it's great because I come back
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.800]   and have to spend about 10 minutes offloading
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.640]   leftover prime rib and leftover cake and leftover everything.
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.720]   And I still have one small hunk of very, very fine beef
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.600]   left that I'm going to have to stew tonight.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.920]   Yum, yum, yum.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   And apparently acquired a Boston Bruins Stanley Cup cap
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.160]   in your--
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.680]   Exactly.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.120]   Time to rally the team, I think.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.720]   2011.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.960]   They didn't win the Stanley Cup.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.640]   This was just like a hat they made in case.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.920]   No, recently.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.440]   They couldn't stitch this unless the ordering guild
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.480]   had a proof and certified their championship.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.000]   Just checking.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.120]   We're looking forward to the first palindromic Stanley Cup,
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.320]   though.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.960]   That's the oyster in the crown.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.000]   2002 was one.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.600]   When's the next one?
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.280]   2012.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.320]   2112.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.360]   21.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   2112.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.960]   We got 100 years to rebuild.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   100 years left.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   He's very patient.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.600]   When he won 12.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.920]   And he feels very secure about 3,000 years
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.400]   for the World Series.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.880]   Right.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.600]   Now, we are, again, we Puritans.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.200]   We're there.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.760]   We're aesthetic.
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.800]   Suffering is good for the soul.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.520]   I was in Stockbridge for Christmas.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.120]   And it's so funny because I'm a New Englander born and bred,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.120]   but haven't lived out here in California for 30
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   some years.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120]   It's cold.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.360]   It's not that cold.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.160]   It wasn't the weather.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.160]   It's the cold heart.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.440]   It's the flinty New Englander spirit
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.040]   that allows them to survive on that land.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.680]   No, I love it.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.520]   But it's just as funny.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.040]   I hadn't been there in so long.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.000]   It kind of-- I was having a little deja vu or something.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.120]   You've been living in the Bay Area for so long.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.720]   I've lost it.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.440]   You've got really steam.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.560]   If you go to the convenience store
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.960]   and they don't immediately offer you a peyote.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.600]   There are places you can get that sort of stuff,
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.640]   but you've got to walk for it.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.160]   The big story in the paper was that Massachusetts
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.120]   is going to allow package stores to open on December 26th.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.560]   Big story.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.760]   And it was a pro and con thing because on the one hand,
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.720]   the people-- the clerks didn't want to really come in.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.960]   But on the other hand, you can get liquor on Monday.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.640]   It was--
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.720]   You got to ask her first.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.680]   I think the liquor was the trump card.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.360]   No, because they closed these package stores.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.840]   They closed on Sundays.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.640]   It was all within the blue line of life.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.360]   Within my lifetime, you couldn't even
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.960]   open the stores on Sunday.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.480]   Right.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.400]   And again, we are by nature a puret and fishing colony.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.600]   They still have state stores in Pennsylvania.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.480]   I always go back up.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.120]   Where they sell state stores.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.040]   Oh, for the liquor.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.880]   So you can't--
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.680]   Same in Canada.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.120]   I know that sounds crazy for those of you who live in California.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120]   But when you go to a grocery store in Pennsylvania,
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.240]   there's no alcohol.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.760]   There's no beer.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.240]   It's very--
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.440]   It's very--
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.920]   It's very--
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.440]   It's very--
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.440]   It's very--
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.940]   It's very--
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:47.640]   It's all like Walgreens.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.760]   You have to buy it from the state-run--
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.760]   It's crazy, Doug.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.440]   Crazy, Doug.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.960]   And there's no--
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   Crazy.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.200]   But here in California, anything goes-- in fact, you could--
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.120]   almost buy marijuana in the store.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.520]   It's that close.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   As soon as the pharmacy, there's a little extra door.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.880]   Because you can get-- for 20 bucks,
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.560]   you go down Venice Beach.
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.640]   Every five storefronts, there's a guy in a green cannabis suit
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.760]   saying, come on in.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.520]   20 bucks medical marijuana card.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.000]   Come on in.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.480]   Nothing has to be wrong with you.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.160]   What could you have?
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.720]   Headache.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.320]   Backache.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.120]   Chills.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.040]   You're bored.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.800]   You're sleepy.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.480]   It doesn't matter.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.360]   Come on in.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.120]   And you get the medical--
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.040]   I shouldn't be saying this, because this is like--
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.040]   You're ruining for everyone.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.880]   This is going to bring the feds down on our heads.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.520]   But then you get the card.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.960]   Oh, you didn't get the card.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.160]   And now you go to this Emporium.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.840]   And somebody brought me--
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.720]   it's packaged now.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.680]   They even have a cellophane seal around the lid
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.640]   so that nobody can--
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.320]   so it's tamper-proof marijuana.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.680]   And it's like a little-- this was a little one shot.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.680]   It was like a five-hour unenergy drink.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.520]   It was a little shot, one shot.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.640]   I mean, I got to bring this in just to show people.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.520]   Because it's become--
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.720]   it's really become an industry.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.400]   It is.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.240]   Just make sure you limp when you walk back to the table
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.760]   just to sort of sell the poitences.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.920]   Oh, I have-- it's called the five-hour lethargy drink,
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.160]   Emmon Seven says.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.160]   That's it.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.920]   I will bring this in.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.640]   I was just stunned.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.520]   It's like, wait a minute.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.920]   This is like-- it's got nutritional information
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.920]   on the side.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.560]   How many calories?
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.600]   How many calories?
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.440]   How many car-allegrams of carbs?
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.960]   Yes.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.360]   And how many milligrams of THC or kannabenol
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.160]   or whatever they called it?
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.760]   I always thought the first state that would legalize
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.200]   would be something like Kentucky.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.240]   Because they're like, you know, we've got all this tobacco.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.160]   And people don't like tobacco, but people like marijuana.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.920]   Oddly enough, it's still not legal here.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.200]   So unless you have the card, I can't be in possession of this thing.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.520]   But I don't think that-- I don't know.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.160]   It's just really strange.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.440]   I feel like I'm in some weird Philip K. Dick novel.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.840]   It's just like-- it's like the world has shifted
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.680]   and I didn't notice.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.280]   We always talk when I was a kid.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.120]   Oh, well, dude.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.720]   When it be wild, you could go to the drug store
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   and just next to the cigarettes you could buy at doobies.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.920]   Oh, that'd be wild.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.120]   They'd call it Panama Red Man or Purple Kush.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.720]   They do.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.400]   Anyway, I don't know what I'm talking about.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.440]   This is a show about mac and Tusses.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.880]   And the reason we're filling is because there's
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.880]   not a lot to talk about.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.680]   It's mostly rumors, but some big rumors.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.640]   Now, when you-- I got to chill down my back when
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.600]   you said you were going to buy a MacBook,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.120]   because you know that they're now up to two to three weeks
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.280]   on the Mac Pro.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.920]   And I'm wondering now, there's a real question.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.960]   Are they either killing the Pro or they're
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.360]   going to release a new one?
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.240]   And maybe if you're going to release a new Pro,
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.920]   you might come out with some new MacBooks.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.960]   Maybe you should just wait.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.240]   I can't go any longer on the 17 inch that I have.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.520]   It's just too slow.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   So I-- for what we do--
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.440]   Did you get a 17?
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.160]   Oh, you're nuts.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:36.960]   That's for what I do.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.720]   For what I do, I need it.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.160]   I got a 17 with SSD and one to RAM.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.280]   So what do you think is the Mac Pro being discontinued
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.240]   what you've talked about?
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.440]   I think that I still--
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.440]   Well, I don't know what's being read.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.560]   So here's the thing is that I need it so badly that I'm
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.360]   afraid that my radar could be fogged.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.280]   But I really think that Apple's going to release one more Mac
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:54.280]   Pro.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.120]   This is the last one.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.280]   That's got a Thunderbolt.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.120]   And then that's it.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.880]   You know, it's like-- and here's the issue
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.400]   is that I don't think that the support materials,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.040]   the support resources for the iMac,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.360]   are mature enough to get pros through the next year or two.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.960]   So I think if you do one more Mac Pro with Thunderbolt,
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.520]   you end up with-- you've got all the slots
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.560]   and you've got Thunderbolt.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.520]   And then you allow Thunderbolt to mature over the next year
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.840]   or two because it's taking so long for Thunderbolt to come out
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.840]   that I think you then-- then I think Apple,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.520]   I don't think we'll ever see another Mac Pro.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.800]   That'll be it because there's no-- what else?
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.160]   Why should you improve it?
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:30.480]   Now, I do think we're going to see MacBook Air style 15s,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.240]   but not 17.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.120]   So you don't care if you're buying a 17.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:33.840]   I decided that I--
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.480]   You want an optical drive.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.240]   You don't want a thin.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.040]   Well, I'm going to actually take them optical drive out.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.120]   A Mac, a 17 inch in the Air form factor would just be bizarre.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.800]   It looks like a poster.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.280]   I think it'd actually be dangerous because it'd be very long.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.720]   And I think that-- I'm also going to take the optical drive
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.640]   out and then put another drive in it.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.600]   You can get people to do that for you.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.160]   And so then I'll have two drives in it.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.920]   This is really a workbook.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.120]   I've done it by hand.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.600]   I'm not going to do this one.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.320]   I tried that one time.
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.280]   I don't recommend it.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:01.800]   I tried that one time.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.480]   Well, you know what's hard is they--
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.800]   I don't know who makes these.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.000]   Maybe it's machines.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.480]   It's people with smaller fingers than I
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.000]   because you can't-- once you take it apart,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.880]   it all goes, "Boom!"
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:10.680]   It's like a watch.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.360]   And it's too big now to put it back.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.200]   You have to--
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.280]   I'm kind of like there's professionals.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:14.880]   It's a suitcase.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.440]   There are professionals that know how to do that.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:17.200]   And I would let them do that.
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.480]   With their little hands and their--
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.280]   I think--
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.640]   I wasn't going to say it, but you said it.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.800]   I think they have little hands.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.720]   I think they're very tiny little--
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.360]   They hire them.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.640]   To them, it's very large.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.480]   But they're like four inches high,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.080]   and they just work on--
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.760]   Small people to do this.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.280]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.440]   What kind of revs are we going to see on the hardware?
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.280]   Definitely a Mac Pro revs in 2012, though.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.400]   Now, Alex is right.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.800]   They're definitely going to at least bring it up to speed
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.080]   with the ports that are on every other machine right now.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.600]   I also think that once it has Thunderbolt,
[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.160]   and once it has modern processors,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.680]   it's-- the target on its back is green and glowing,
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.040]   and I don't think it's going to come out of this horror
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.280]   movie alive.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.680]   Because once it has those ports and a new processor,
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.560]   that'll give it another two or three years for the life.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.440]   And I think that in two or three years,
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.800]   the landscape for Mac is going to have changed so greatly.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.360]   There's just no need for a Mac Pro anymore.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.760]   The 15-- I also think that, yeah, 15-inch air style Mac Pro
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.000]   is probably-- the only question is,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.040]   are they going to call it a MacBook Pro,
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.640]   or are they going to call it a 15-inch MacBook Air?
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.320]   Does the fact that it has that larger screen, not only
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:28.440]   larger, but higher density screen, and the extra space
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.320]   for extra batteries and extra heat dissipation,
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.360]   does that inherently make it a pro-level MacBook,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.440]   or is the Pro designation itself on its way out?
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.920]   I think there's air, and I still think that what makes a Pro
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.440]   computer-- because I have an air.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440]   I love the air.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.160]   I'm an air fan.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.560]   I have a Leavenand of 13.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.400]   I think Pro is connectivity still.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.680]   I mean, I think there's a lot of pieces that you're plugging.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.000]   And the Thunderbolt's great.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.840]   And slots.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.160]   Well, I mean, in your MacBook Pro.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.480]   But being able to, without a converter,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.880]   being able to connect your firewire, your--
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.360]   all the other things that you connect.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.520]   Now, I think that a year from now, or two years from now,
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.800]   I don't think that that's going to make any sense,
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.120]   because I think the Thunderbolt will fix that.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.520]   But right now, Thunderbolt is so far behind on the accessories.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.320]   I think we need another year or two of maturity
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.480]   before we're going to see it.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.760]   Is it possible that Thunderbolt's DOA is sure
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.720]   taking a lot longer?
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.280]   We thought there'd be stuff by now, right?
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.200]   Hard drives and--
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.200]   Oh, well, it's not that you--
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.320]   It's not that you're by summer.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.760]   I am a little-- I think that--
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.280]   I think some manufacturers are waiting for the PC side of things
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:25.680]   to catch up.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.880]   PC's not going to go Thunderbolt.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.160]   It's going to give USB 3.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.800]   Which is really unfortunate because it's so slow.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.600]   So it's the same.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.800]   It's similar to what happened with SCSI and firewire.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.920]   You didn't get PC adoption, and it killed them.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.680]   USB is dominant everywhere on the PC side.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.240]   It is.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.240]   It'll be interesting to see.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.200]   I mean, I think that that might have been what slowed things down.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.680]   I think that there were some technical issues
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.760]   that people were trying to slow things--
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.160]   that tended to slow things down and getting things in.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.520]   The Thunderbolt tools that we have so far have been great.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.760]   We have a couple interface tools, and it's very exciting.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.320]   Curtis B says Intel has announced
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.280]   that there will be Thunderbolt PCs.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.480]   But Intel-- remember, Intel is one of the developers
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.160]   of Thunderbolt.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.040]   It was called Lightpeak.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.000]   It was an Intel Apple product, just like firewire
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.440]   was an Adaptec Apple product.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.720]   And I think just similar to firewire,
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.200]   yeah, PC manufacturers could put it in, but they won't.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.120]   It depends on licensing.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.960]   It depends on--
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.880]   Well, and even if it's not licensing, if it's just a chipset,
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.600]   you've got to remember the margins in the PC world
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.120]   are so thin, so razor thin.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.880]   They're not going to build in a capability
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.480]   that there isn't demand for.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.920]   And I think most Windows users are perfectly happy with USB 3.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.240]   There are a lot of USB 3 devices.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.600]   We know that technically it's not as fast, it's not as capable.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.360]   But I don't think PC users care, and they're
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.280]   going to opt for the low price product.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.160]   And I don't-- just because Intel says, yeah,
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.760]   we really want to push Thunderbolt on PCs,
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.880]   doesn't mean manufacturers will do it.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.240]   I think the one big advantage of the Thunderbolt
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.800]   beyond just being a lot faster than USB 3
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.400]   and not requiring as much overhead as far as CPU
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.280]   is that it is one very small connector that
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.520]   allows you to connect to a much large variety of things
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.440]   that might be on your desk, your other monitor,
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.480]   all the other pieces that I don't think you can get with--
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.800]   that you're going to get with USB 3.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.320]   And so I think that there are some advantages
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.240]   to save possible money.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.920]   I think we're going to see a lot of computers that
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.800]   get to a point, especially if they're
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.680]   able to power the computer from the Thunderbolt, which
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.320]   has been rumored for the Mac.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:18.820]   Right.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.680]   You get to a point where you just have one connector.
[00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.480]   You just have a Thunderbolt connector,
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.800]   and that's all we're going to give you.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.960]   And I think over time, that could save money.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.040]   If people make Thunderbolt stuff.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.680]   Right.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.360]   And Thunderbolt stuff is really a problem right now.
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.480]   I mean, this is a chicken ring.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.720]   And they were supposed to do a six months.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.800]   And we've got a big long list.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.600]   If you do a search, you'll see all these hard drives,
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.840]   and you'll see all these interfaces.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.240]   And for some reason, they're not shipping it.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.720]   If they don't ship soon, yeah, it could be a problem.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.440]   But Apple can play the winning game.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.880]   Remember, the Thunderbolt is something
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.280]   that every Apple user gets pretty much for free.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.800]   Or even if they never buy a Thunderbolt device ever,
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   they still have that standard monitor point
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.720]   that they never have to really worry about.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.400]   So it's not as though Apple has to cut a new hole
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.040]   in every single device they make in order
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.600]   to put Thunderbolt on board.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.840]   I think that for most users, it is going to be that thing
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   that they don't use for about a year and a half
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.440]   until the first time that they need to buy an external drive.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.480]   And they notice that there isn't just one option
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   for a Thunderbolt drive.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.640]   They're actually four.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.680]   And two of them are actually just maybe
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.880]   about 5% more expensive than the far, far, far slower USB 2 drive.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.800]   I hope that's the case.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.400]   I mean, I hope that that happens.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.280]   I just, I fear that it might not.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.760]   All you need is one great experience.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.200]   No, but I mean, all you need is somebody making them.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.520]   Well, all you need is one great experience
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.160]   with one great Thunderbolt product.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.320]   With a product.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.960]   Well, when people see the first Thunderbolt display
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.040]   and they realize that they're no longer needs
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.000]   to be even a theoretical line between my mobile Mac
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.560]   and my desktop Mac,
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.960]   that all I have to do is plug one cable
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.160]   when I get back home into my MacBook Air.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.040]   And suddenly I have every single port
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.440]   and every single accessory that I could ever want
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.800]   because the display itself has the fast ethernet,
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.320]   has the gigabit ethernet, it has the Fireware,
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.280]   it has like the multiple USB ports.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.080]   One cable connects it up.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.920]   And suddenly I have access to four terabytes worth of storage
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.520]   and enough bandwidth that could stream Netflix
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.960]   and do 8 million online backups.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.520]   Not without having this literally clumsy harmonica
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.320]   like thing that clips to the side.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:22.520]   Those of us who used to use like those little
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.760]   kind of jury rig dock connectors that some companies make
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.840]   know that it's just after two or three times,
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.040]   it's get you get past the G Wiz of these really weird adapters.
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.480]   Then you realize that, God, I'm lining it up
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.480]   and trying to make sure it sits in properly.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.160]   I'm not sure that the USB part is fitting in
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.360]   as well as the gigabit ethernet part.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.640]   One cable plugs in and everything else
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.720]   leaves stays in your desktop.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.200]   That's a really great experience.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.640]   I think that's gonna affect more people who bought
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.320]   the 13 inch air as their replacement MacBook.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.280]   And now it's time for them.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.520]   Now that their iMac is starting to age out of the system
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.600]   and maybe they'll take a look in the Apple store
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.080]   and they'll think I could either buy a brand new iMac
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.880]   for $1,500 which pretty much duplicates the chipset
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.120]   and all the features that I already have in my air
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.680]   or I could save a few hundred bucks
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:11.880]   and just buy this one display that gives me everything
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.200]   that I would want to have in an iMac,
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.520]   the larger display in the wider array of ports.
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:17.840]   And that's when you get,
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.040]   that's when the fans of Thunderbolt come on board.
[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:21.520]   The first time they actually use it
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.720]   or the purpose I was intended.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.560]   - Well, I think the other thing is that the,
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:25.760]   one of the other things you'll see with Thunderbolt
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.440]   is that you have a, the ability to have breakout boxes.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.920]   So Magma is a company that I think is announced one
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.120]   and they're gonna be coming up with it,
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.160]   coming online soon where you have a Thunderbolt,
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.760]   you know, it's fine to say that hard drives
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.360]   will be just as fast on USB three
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.160]   or you can connect to your monitor with other things.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.000]   But the point is,
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.840]   is being able to connect a one little cable
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.080]   and not only get your USB and ethernet
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.120]   and everything else be able to connect
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.880]   to where you have actual boards.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.380]   So you come into your office
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.200]   and this is more of a pro user or high end user
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.040]   - Exactly.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.880]   - That's a solution.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.980]   - But I think that for us it's very important to do that.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.360]   And I think that, you know,
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.420]   I think that it depends on who the consumer is.
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.220]   I mean, if you're looking for a distinguishing consumer
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.580]   that is more, is less price sensitive
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.060]   and more feature sensitive,
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:08.660]   then Thunderbolt is something you put into it
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.060]   and I think everybody else's, you know,
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:11.300]   netbooks and iPads.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.300]   - So you guys, I'm gonna take the position
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.300]   a little extreme that it's DOA.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.840]   You guys think that there will be accessories,
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.440]   Thunderbolt accessories that these are gonna,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.140]   are we gonna see them at CES next week?
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.440]   - I mean, the pro world,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:25.280]   we're already starting to see them.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.680]   - Oh, Black Magic is used.
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.520]   - Black Magic is used.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.360]   - Black Magic is used.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.200]   - AJA is using them.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.020]   So those are all,
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.680]   we're already seeing some.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.640]   What we're not seeing are a lot of the little portable
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.920]   hard drives that we want, little mini raids.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.120]   - And they're really expensive list.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.880]   The one less C is really expensive.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.720]   - It's pretty expensive.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.200]   - And it doesn't have a cable.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   - It's the cable costs extra.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.640]   So yeah, so there's, but I think it's-
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.040]   - I think it could be very specialized
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.320]   and I think it may be DOA.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.520]   I think the PC market might do it.
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.840]   - I think by definition, it's not DOA.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.480]   Like I said, it costs Apple,
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.440]   philosophically it costs them nothing to keep it
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.960]   on this device for as long as it takes
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.760]   for adoption to actually happen.
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.360]   The beatings will continue until people start using-
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.760]   - Does Apple have the clout to get this to happen?
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.520]   - They have the clout to get it into every Apple device
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.360]   they make.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.200]   - Yeah, but I mean, so what?
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.880]   - From their perspective, that's gonna be fine enough.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.440]   So long as it makes users like Alex Happy
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.560]   and gives them the high speed connectors they need
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.400]   on mobile devices.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   - Yeah, but we started this conversation.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.400]   - It makes the entire line much better.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.800]   - With the presumption they might not even make the Mac Pro
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.240]   for people like Alex anymore.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.480]   - Well, I think they might not have to.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.280]   If Alex can get the breakout box for a mobile device-
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.120]   - Or for me.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.080]   - They necessarily want to go for a Mac Pro.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.840]   And if you think about them, Apple one day deciding
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.040]   that maybe it makes sense to put a Thunderbolt port
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:46.480]   on an iPad just so that we can have
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.720]   not just for a built-in display adapter,
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.760]   but also so that we can have wired networking
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.360]   that works really, really fast.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.840]   So we can have it work more intimately
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.080]   with other Apple devices.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.120]   I don't know if that's gonna happen,
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.280]   but that's certainly a possibility with Thunderbolt.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.040]   It's certainly, the big deal here is that
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.520]   it's not like putting in a fancy brand new port
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.800]   that does only one thing.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.600]   It's only for high speed connection to scanners
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.040]   and to hard drives.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.120]   And if the scanners and the hard drives
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.680]   don't materialize, then there's no reason
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.600]   to keep putting this port on the device.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.480]   So long as people still want to connect monitors
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.520]   to no-
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.920]   - It's the minute display port.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.000]   It's their minute display port.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.080]   - And it allows them to continue to miniaturize
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.520]   both the iMac and the Mac books
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.160]   without having to worry about connectors
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.520]   and being able to say if you're really a pro person,
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.640]   we're gonna give you this base unit.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   And if you're really a pro person
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.320]   that needs to add all this other stuff to it,
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.840]   there's one little cable that you can plug in
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.600]   that can handle whatever you're gonna add to it,
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.520]   whether it's expansion cards, GPU.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.160]   - It's funny that we haven't been here before
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.760]   with SCSI with Firewire and now with Thunderbolt.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.960]   In all three cases, these were universal standards
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.360]   AdaptEx SCSI Firewire with Intel,
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.480]   Firewire with, or Thunderbolt with Intel,
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.560]   where Apple did bet the farm on these things.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.160]   - Oh, I mean, but they happened.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.360]   - They lasted for quite a few years.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:01.840]   I mean, I did have SCSI for years.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.400]   I mean, we can't expect these connectors to last forever.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.400]   I mean, it's, you know, I think that we'll be doing
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.880]   wireless in five years, you know, I mean,
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.720]   for most of this stuff.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.280]   But I think the one difference about
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.040]   Thunderbolt for at least people like me
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:19.040]   is that the one of the issues.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.560]   - ADB, I forgot one.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.400]   - Well, ADB.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.800]   - But this is the first pipeline that is as fast
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.040]   as the internal connection. - That's the first
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.240]   connection as fast as an internal card,
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.440]   as fast as an internal drive, as fast as that internal
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.400]   connection, all these other ones were slower.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.040]   So it was always a big shift.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.800]   - And USB 3 is a client server, you know,
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.560]   it's not a peer-to-peer connection.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.000]   And so it's not as fast.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.160]   No, I know technically, I understand technically,
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.200]   I'm just thinking, it doesn't, I mean,
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.800]   this was supposed to happen and it hasn't.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.440]   And I'm wondering if it's too late.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.000]   - You're still upset that you had to replace
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.960]   all of your PS2 keyboards with ADB keyboards
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.400]   when the Mac 2 came out.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.320]   - You pay a price for being a Mac user, my friends.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.400]   And sometimes the price is that Apple throws this weight
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.880]   behind a technology that doesn't take off.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.720]   - Well, I mean, good saying.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.280]   Okay, well, when has that specifically happened?
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.280]   I'm not challenging, I'm just saying.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.120]   - Ah. - We're pretty good
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:13.960]   examples of that.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.280]   - Well, I can go back to the, what was it,
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.000]   the bus that they had on the Apple II FX with the MCA,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.120]   but I can't even remember what it was.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.320]   But I won't go that far.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.160]   That's historic.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.080]   So let's not say historic, let's just say,
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.800]   Firewire, which never took off.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.520]   I mean, we used it because we had to,
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.680]   but remember there were Firewire accessories.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.800]   If there are not, if what happens is the market
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.920]   does not make Thunderbolt accessories,
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.560]   which I think they're not gonna,
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.160]   then I think that what we bought it,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.600]   we have a fancy display port, and that's it.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.680]   - I'll argue though, the Firewire was probably one,
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.520]   the reason that Firewire was not accepted on the PC side.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.160]   - 'Cause Apple required a license fee,
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.240]   and the PC manufacturers were very price sensitive.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.560]   - Which allowed Apple to push forward in the video realm,
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.720]   which back then was important in the late '90s,
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.200]   and push the PC industry behind them
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.040]   when it comes to being able to integrate video
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.440]   with your computer by two or three years.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.800]   I mean, 'cause USB was not there,
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.240]   and all the cameras had Firewire and everything else,
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.240]   and so if you wanted to easily be able to use iMovie
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.520]   and connect your videos and everything else,
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.960]   there was no way to do that easily on the PC.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.280]   And it was because they wouldn't pay for that licensing.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.040]   So I think that while Apple may,
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.800]   and we're still using Firewire 10 years later,
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.760]   which is, I think, pretty impressive for us.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.600]   - It's not like you have to go out and buy Thunderbolt.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.480]   It just comes, I mean, I wouldn't necessarily buy
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.680]   a new computer just for Thunderbolt,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.760]   but it just comes--
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.720]   - We won't buy any new computers without it.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.480]   - Right, I mean, you should, yeah, but--
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.320]   - Right.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.440]   - Because, as Andy says, at the very least,
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.240]   it's a display monitor, you know, display port.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.360]   - At the very least, yes.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.280]   - And at least you get that.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.240]   And I bet you that's all you ever get.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.080]   - We'll see.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.280]   - Two, four, actually it's not too bad.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.960]   A terabyte Thunderbolt, Lussie, external, 432 bucks.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   - And if you get the one with the SSD,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:54.440]   it gets more expensive and you have SSD.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.280]   - Yeah, but that's the SD.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.720]   - But this is where Thunderbolt really starts to sing,
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.680]   is 'cause now you're able to take full advantage
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.920]   of that SSD, you hook that up with Firewire,
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.480]   and you're not gonna get more than 100 megabytes
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.720]   a second at the absolute top end
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.200]   and more like 60 to 80 megabytes a second,
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.400]   where that SSD is able to deliver two or 300 megas a second.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.240]   - Right.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.080]   That's one of the issues.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.800]   One of the reasons why USB 3 is doing all right
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.840]   is because it keeps up with the drives, the spinning drives.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.680]   - Right.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.520]   - And the big thing here is that--
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.360]   - That's enough.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.720]   - One drive to one drive, USB 3 is fine.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   But what if you start stacking a whole bunch of drives
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.720]   on there and you want them all to run that fast
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.280]   and USB 3 then doesn't work so well.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.280]   - We're talking about Macintosh, boy, there's actually,
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.320]   you know, now that I look at it,
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.520]   there are a few things to talk about.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.920]   Apple has an event at the end of the month,
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.080]   what's it all about?
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.760]   - You've got, yeah, that's our number one question
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.200]   on our things too.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.600]   - We are taking questions.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.040]   For those of you watching live at bit.ly,
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.240]   bit.ly/askmacbreak, we'll do a few questions,
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.520]   maybe more than a few if we can get through these.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.240]   Also apparently there's going to be
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.000]   a big lunar new year deal at Apple.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.640]   Did you know that?
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.480]   - I did not know that.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.320]   - It's very exciting.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.160]   - What are we getting at 5% off?
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.880]   - Big shopping event for lunar new year.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.000]   - Gotta fly Taiwan first though.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.560]   - You can call him Sir Johnny,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.840]   start calling him Sir Johnny.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:14.960]   And a CES preview, it's all coming up.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.720]   And did you know that Steve Jobs want a Grammy?
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.680]   Just want a Grammy.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.840]   All of that's coming up.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.640]   So you see there's plenty of stuff to talk about.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.480]   Before we do that, let's talk about Gazelle.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.800]   What do you do with your old scuzzy hard drives?
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.880]   - I don't think they're going to give you much money
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.720]   for that.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.560]   - No, they're not.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.720]   But at least they'll responsibly recycle it.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.000]   - How much is my zoom still worth?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.840]   I keep on forgetting to sell it.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.680]   - Oh, you know what?
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.760]   Let's see, I bet you a zoom HD.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.920]   - I'm gonna get rid of my zoom.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.520]   - I just found my zoom HD.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.360]   - No, I found it too.
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.200]   - We're missing.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.120]   (laughs)
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.800]   - You can see how well I was using it.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.720]   - So when you have gadgets that are gathering dust,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.760]   as we all do, and drawers, closets,
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.720]   garages all over the country,
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.960]   you can just let them sit there
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.160]   and their value decline forever over time.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.680]   Or you can go to gazelle.com.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.240]   And make money.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.320]   Let's see what the Droid Bionic is.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.960]   That's one that a lot of people bought,
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.440]   and then they realize the camera took like a minute
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.760]   to take a picture,
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.240]   and they're probably anxious to get rid of it.
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.320]   So I just entered Droid Bionic.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.000]   By the way, they have over 200,000 unique items
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.720]   at gazelle.com, 20 product categories.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.240]   It is fully functional, barely used, in fact,
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.880]   free of water damage you bet.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.240]   I've got all the stuff it came with.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:24.080]   Let's just see.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.000]   But I see, look at this graph here, by the way.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.440]   The, so, you know, if you'd sold it a couple of months ago,
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.280]   you would have made more money.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.840]   So all that's happening with these gadgets is they're loose.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.760]   113 bucks.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.040]   Now, here's what, that's good.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.880]   - That's still a nice dinner.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.720]   - I'll take it. - For something
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.540]   that's sitting on your desk.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.960]   - No, it's halfway towards a new phone.
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.040]   So I'm gonna add it to the box,
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.480]   and then I'm gonna go on.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.920]   I throw all this stuff in a box.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.440]   They will send me a print for me a mailing label,
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.680]   so I don't have to pay the postage.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.040]   And then I get a check from gazelle.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.880]   Or if you wanna make even more money,
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.640]   you can get an Amazon gift card,
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.960]   and you'll get a 5% bonus.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.200]   You get PayPal.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.800]   You can get Walmart gift cards.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.760]   You can even ask them to donate to charity.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.680]   So if it's that time of year where you thought,
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.040]   you know, I should have given more.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.840]   Maybe my resolution is to give some money to charity.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:08.000]   Gazelle will do it for you.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.200]   Just donate those gadgets.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.160]   You can even set up a page at Gazelle for your,
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.160]   your own charity, a kind of a bake sale,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.400]   a gadget drive for your own charity,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.200]   and they'll even make a page for you and everything.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.760]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E dot,
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.600]   come a great way to get cash,
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.000]   to get your closet cleared up,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.480]   and to get some cash for some new devices,
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.880]   which I really like.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.080]   And if you, and again, if it's something that really,
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.320]   you know, like the CMS drive,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.680]   so cool, it's a SCSI drive,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.040]   20 megabytes for Apple, 20 megabytes.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.400]   Was it $800 when you bought it, John, from CMS?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.920]   I bought the same drive, I remember very well.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.800]   But what are you gonna do with it?
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.600]   Sitting in your closet, I guess you could put it on eBay,
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:48.440]   maybe somebody would buy it,
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:49.680]   but probably the best thing to do
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:51.360]   is just recycle it responsibly.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.720]   Gazelle does not ship it off, offshore.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.880]   They don't put it in the landfill.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.360]   They take good care of it with green recycling.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.920]   So just put it all in one big box,
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.800]   get the money for what you can,
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:04.440]   get rid of the stuff you can't.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.680]   Great way to get a new phone.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.520]   What about your Kindle?
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.280]   What if you have a Kindle e-reader
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.980]   and you wanna get the new one?
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:14.600]   Let's just add a curiosity.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.160]   I wonder if I can get anything for this Kindle.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.000]   Put it in here.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.080]   (mumbles)
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.840]   Have you had trouble with Chrome on the Macintosh?
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.000]   I find that Chrome is not really stable in Lion.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Lion, oh it's Lion, that's probably what it is.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.840]   It's Lion.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.680]   No noticeable flaws.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.600]   Of course, nothing is very fast in Lion.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   I have all this stuff.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.160]   I've become a very bitter person about Lion
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.560]   if you haven't noticed.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.400]   30 bucks.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.160]   I'm twittering about it and I wish I hadn't upgraded.
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.040]   Digital cameras, anyway, I go on and on.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.960]   Why don't you go to Gazelle
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.440]   and find out what your stuff is worth?
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.840]   You can actually do it as an exercise.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.400]   You know, just go there and put all your stuff in.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.240]   At least know what it is.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.840]   Know what your options are.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:55.000]   And that's the issue.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.040]   Yeah, why not?
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.240]   They pay the postage.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.200]   It's a great deal.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.040]   They wipe the data for you too.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.360]   They send you a little box.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.200]   Oh, they send you a box?
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.680]   Don't they send you a box?
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.160]   I think you can wait for them to send you a box
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.000]   or you could just send your own box.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.840]   You send your own box.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.640]   I think I'm just gonna use my own box.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.560]   I have a lot of boxes from Amazon.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.520]   So you take the Amazon boxes.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.360]   Amazon boxes.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.520]   And then put it in the Gazelle
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.360]   and then you send it out.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.960]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, don't sell it.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.360]   Gazelle it.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.480]   We thank them for their sport of Mac break weekly.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.360]   They're right, they've found the right show.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.960]   (laughs)
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.120]   Yes, you could sell all your hard drives
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.680]   and buy one Thunderbolt drive.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.280]   Again, if you're gonna ask us a question,
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.440]   we'll later on we'll get to those bit.ly/ask.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.280]   Got a ton of questions
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.320]   and a ton of votes on those questions.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.920]   Mac break, yeah, the most up voted questions.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.760]   We've won so we'll--
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.840]   So definitely get up there and vote.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.000]   Even if you're not gonna ask a question,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:41.840]   go there and vote.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.680]   I have a question for you guys.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.680]   What is this Apple event?
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.120]   First of all, it's not here.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:47.960]   Hey.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.800]   It's in New York City.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.640]   It's not in Petaluma.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.880]   It's not even in San Francisco, Moscone.
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.000]   All Things D says,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   our sources say it is not an iPad 3 event.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.080]   It is not an announcement of a new hardware at all,
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:04.040]   but in fact it's an event for media.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.400]   Probably according to, I think the Verge,
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.960]   or no, maybe it was in gadget,
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   said our sources say it's publishing, it's books,
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.400]   which couldn't be more boring.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:20.200]   In fact, this event I think is designed not for you and me,
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.880]   not for the press, but for people in the industry.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.600]   That's why they're having it in New York City.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.480]   'Cause there was time when people read books.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.680]   Do you have any thought about what this event could be?
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.200]   Should we cover it?
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.920]   Probably not.
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.760]   I don't, my information is pretty thin too.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.440]   I think, my mind is trying to tickling that I think
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.920]   there's some sort of a publishing conference going on
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:48.400]   at the same time, second half of January in New York City
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.080]   that I can't find right now.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.800]   The digital book world conference in Expo,
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.520]   I think this, I got an indication that a while ago.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:59.000]   So I'm guessing that it has something to do.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.160]   I'm guessing that would just simply be a good,
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.800]   I'm trying to read and think while I talk.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.360]   It's very, very difficult this early in the year.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.280]   Yeah, it looks like it's not going to be something
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.400]   that will change anybody's life.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.480]   It looks like more like a business sort of announcement,
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.080]   more like deals with new publishers,
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.040]   deals with people who bring more content on board eye books.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.200]   That's my guess at least.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.920]   Remember, okay, so it could go either way.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.040]   We could be caught with our pants down,
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.080]   they couldn't have some Apple TV.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:27.920]   Exactly.
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.680]   And we could go, or--
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   We'll be here either way.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.760]   The last time they did this, it was to announce the Daily.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.320]   Right, it could be the Daily.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.400]   And in fact, I think it's more likely something like that.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.840]   Well, I'd love to see an announcement of this.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.640]   They're pushing the technology of books forward.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.600]   You know, so that we're adding more inactivity.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.640]   Clayton Morris did a blog post on this
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.040]   and he says, "I have my sources say the event will focus on
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.240]   iTunes University and Apple and Education."
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.760]   Well, I'd love to see that.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:00.080]   I mean--
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.720]   Maybe it's textbooks.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   Well, it could be textbooks, but it could also be the--
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.760]   I mean, one of the things we saw,
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.560]   I think we saw the hacks to the Apple TV
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:10.320]   and we understand what the Apple TV is capable of.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.200]   The question is, is how when will Apple actually start
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.040]   to open that up?
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.200]   And when you look at the Apple TV,
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.840]   it is a perfect delivery mechanism for education.
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.080]   Well, we focused on Apple TV.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:21.000]   I'm not talking about the big TV.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.840]   I'm talking about the little--
[00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:22.840]   Little Park.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.720]   Little Park is a great distribution method
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:26.400]   if they opened up a little bit more.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.840]   We focused on Apple TV and the Isaacson biography
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:30.840]   because he said he'd licked it and Steve Jepzig.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.760]   But remember, Steve also said that the other thing
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.080]   that he was working on was textbooks.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.640]   So this-- and that's what Clayton's saying.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.400]   This is actually a significant announcement.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.080]   There will be at least two new products
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.880]   and they will have to do with education and textbooks.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.960]   And this is something that Steve was very much working on
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.640]   before his death.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.160]   I think Clayton knows what he's talking about here.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.520]   Yeah, that certainly fits with the sort of thing
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.840]   that would be announced then and there.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.920]   It's also worth mentioning that the only time
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:59.960]   that Apple has done or participated in at least an event
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.760]   in New York City since Mackerel Expo closed there
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.800]   was where announcements that had to do with partnerships
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.640]   with major other companies.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.160]   So you talk about the Daily of also the release
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.600]   of the Verizon iPhone, which was as much of a Verizon event
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.000]   as an Apple event.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.640]   So I wouldn't expect this to be a big Apple logo only announced.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.720]   I expect this would be a partnership sort of thing.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:23.040]   Interesting.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.680]   So the thing we should get all--
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:29.720]   the thing we should break format for and put the big red logo up.
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.520]   Well, we'll hear more as it gets closer.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.320]   I think you should send a correspondent there,
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.240]   put up an hotel for three days from all the computers.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.280]   Someone who's nearby, so you don't have to spend so much darn money.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.040]   And of course, because it's unsafe to drink the water,
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.240]   we'll make sure the champagne is flowing.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.440]   Just because the alcohol content will kill any bacteria.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.000]   Any bacteria.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.720]   That's why you're the-- that's why you're the industry titan.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.400]   And I'm just the person who's going
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.680]   to be at the Millennium Broadway during,
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.040]   during, way 20 years to 20 years.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.360]   Is that your hotel of choice?
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.040]   Yeah, that's a nice hotel.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.400]   Well, I'm guessing central--
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.360]   We don't know where the event is going to be,
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.200]   so I need to be as central as possible.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:06.720]   It's right there.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   Up town.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.040]   Go downtown.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.680]   You go east.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.320]   You could go west.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.040]   You could go anywhere.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.960]   You're right in the middle.
[00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.520]   That's why they call it the city of big shoulders.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.720]   Chicago.
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:19.960]   So you know what's interesting?
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.200]   Apple pulled out of-- when did Apple pull out of CES?
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.560]   It's been a long time.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.160]   Five years.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.720]   Yeah, years.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.120]   And of course, they pulled out of Mackerel a couple of years ago.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.920]   Mackerel even is changing his name kind of the iWorld now.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.000]   Microsoft says this is the last year.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.480]   It's going to be at CES.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.960]   Well, they were a little-- I think they were snubbed.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.000]   They were snubbed?
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.400]   I think that was--
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.280]   Steve Bombers giving the keynote for the last time.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.520]   Oh, I thought that they were--
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:45.560]   there was a couple of things they were pulled out of by CES
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.160]   as far as presentations.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.520]   And the response was, I thought they were pulling out this year.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.520]   Or do they--
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.200]   No, they won't have a booth this year.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.440]   Well, I think that they pulled their booth out of Mackerel.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.600]   Obama will be speaking.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.000]   You know, I mean, I don't know if it has to do with being snubs
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.800]   as much as it has to do with the fact that big trade shows like this
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.600]   are no longer relevant.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.120]   Microsoft has its build conference they did this year.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.560]   Just like WWDC now is the Apple event.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.720]   So I think that Microsoft looks at Apple and says,
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.880]   you know, they're not spending millions of dollars on it.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.520]   The booth at CES for Microsoft was bigger than the studio.
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.920]   I mean, it was huge.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.000]   Yeah, I think that for the companies that
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.280]   have the recognition, that have the size,
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.760]   I think that it's a way to--
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.120]   And here's the problem is they have to build a booth that
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.520]   is big enough that doesn't make them look bad by having
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.800]   some tiny little booth.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.600]   And so it becomes this kind of one-up chip that
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.040]   becomes this real painful process for large companies.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.280]   I do think, from a press perspective,
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.240]   there's a lot of advantages to smaller companies
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.040]   being at these things where people like us can go wandering
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.840]   through and see the stuff and look at the stuff and talk about it.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.880]   We will, in fact, be there.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.640]   We're going to be there.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.280]   It's going to be done.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.360]   When are we doing Mac break weekly?
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   We're doing a Tuesday at noon.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.360]   Tuesday at noon Pacific or--
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.240]   yeah, noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.600]   And Andy, you're not coming out for CES, right?
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.280]   You're staying out.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:02.920]   Alas, no.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.800]   Alas, no.
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:06.160]   I don't think we can Skype you in on the stage.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.320]   So we will have Alex, though.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.480]   So you just have to fly me in?
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:09.760]   OK.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.240]   Yeah, we'll fly in right now.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.200]   And the usual champagne.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.320]   KK7O is this kind of cold up here in New England.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.160]   I'm looking for an excuse to leave for a few days.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.600]   I want out.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.200]   Although, as Leander Connie says in the cult of Mac,
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.480]   Apple's presence is CE, Apple, of course, is Apple Booth.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.760]   But its presence will be felt.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.320]   If in no other way than the fact that there will be 8,000 MacBook
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.160]   Air clones, these ultra books will all be all over.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.360]   It'll be Bryce Moore tablets.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.720]   30 to 50 new ultra book models at CES.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.240]   Of course, tablets will be everywhere.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.120]   And they do.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.000]   And they did this last year.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.920]   They had the eye lounge.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.800]   We're going to do iPad--
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.560]   Sir and I are going to do iPad today from the show,
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.280]   Floor at the Eye Lounge.
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:51.280]   And it's huge.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:56.600]   It was 4,000 square feet in 4,000 square feet in 2008.
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:01.800]   It will be 85,000 square feet this year.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   85.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.560]   What percentage of CES is that?
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.200]   Well, CES is big, so I don't know what percentage.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:09.880]   It's still a lot.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:12.800]   I think it's millions of square feet for CES.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.960]   But it's 85,000 square feet is a lot.
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.880]   This studio is 10,000 square feet.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.000]   That's eight of these.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.480]   I'm glad I gave you guys two hours.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.880]   We're going to do a two hour iPad today.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:24.360]   OK, good.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.360]   Well, recording.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.320]   There will be a lot.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:26.840]   It's going to boil down.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.760]   It was fun last year.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.160]   There was really a lot of cool stuff.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.200]   I'm doing my--
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.800]   we're going to do probably a little bit of live
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.040]   on our end of the front pixel core.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:33.560]   Good.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.040]   And I'm also going to take my little iPhone.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.440]   I'm going to do that again.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.320]   I'm rigging it up.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.240]   I got from KV Electronics.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:42.840]   They make a mini jack that goes in the iPhone
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.920]   and then goes to a regular XLR plug.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.280]   And I tried it with the SM58.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.200]   It sounds great.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.320]   And is the connection work OK?
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.560]   It doesn't go-- that's the problem I have with that.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.400]   Oh, well, I'll try it.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:51.920]   I see.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.240]   I'll try to talk into it loud.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.680]   It's when it peaks, it really sounds bad.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.640]   So that's--
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.520]   I just did a few tests for grades.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.120]   You know what I was going to try?
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.360]   Call me crazy.
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.160]   I could try using SoundCloud.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.480]   So I would record it on SoundCloud on the iPhone.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.240]   And it would automatically upload to SoundCloud
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:06.920]   almost instantly.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.160]   You could listen.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.320]   I'm going to be testing the uploading to YouTube
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.400]   from my iPhone.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.920]   And mine's a little bit more--
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.680]   of course, me.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.640]   Mine's a little more complicated, my little rig.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.480]   But I'm not doing video.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.120]   I'm just going to do all that.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:18.600]   I'm doing video.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.920]   But I'm going to try to be doing it--
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.600]   as soon as I finish one, I edit the endpoints
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.120]   and upload it.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.200]   And that's what I was going to do with SoundCloud.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.160]   SoundCloud lets you do that.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.160]   Because it's all built into the--
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.960]   Crazy, man.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:30.600]   Crazy.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.400]   Should be fun.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.680]   We will see new Intel chips.
[00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.360]   And that's of interest to Apple owners.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.480]   Because of course, the Ivy Bridge
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.600]   is something that perhaps will appear.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.480]   Please.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.960]   In the next--
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.840]   See, that's why you should have bought the MacBook.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.800]   No, I just--
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.880]   well, I knew that we were never--
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.040]   I had to take one for the team.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.160]   I had to take one for the team.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.760]   I knew that this was never going to move forward
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.200]   until I bought something.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.520]   I know that you usually take the hit,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:53.000]   but I decided, you know, leave it ahead.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.800]   Thank you.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:54.680]   I'm going to take the hit.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:56.440]   I'm going to buy something and waste some money.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.560]   And then the flow will begin.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:02.040]   And that's unplug the dam, unopen the--
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:02.400]   Yes.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.360]   --slud gates.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.200]   Unleash the crack in.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.920]   One of the things we'll see-- and it's really
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.680]   isn't a Mac-specific story, but I'm excited.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.520]   LG-- actually the LG Industrial Division
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.080]   that makes flat panels for many companies
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.840]   is going to show a 55-inch OLED screen.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.600]   The first time we've seen one in the big screen size--
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.880]   You get a suntan with that thing.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.000]   And it's 4 millimeters thick.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.800]   That's like--
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.640]   Maybe in a hard time.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.200]   Because that's what you really want.
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.280]   Something 54 inches across made of glass
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.840]   that's super, super thin.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:31.640]   It's not a screen.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:32.320]   It's a sale.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.920]   It's like a pane of glass.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.720]   It's a sale.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.400]   I love that.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.320]   You could be sailing with it.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.360]   It's a pane of glass that costs $18,000.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.680]   Actually, I asked Scott Wilkinson, our home theater guy.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:47.160]   And he said the rumors are eight grand, which is amazing
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.360]   because remember the first plasma TV's?
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.680]   When we bought them a tech TV, they were $15,000 for 50 inches.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.960]   So eight grand means that in a couple of years,
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.840]   it'll be probably down to if they can--
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.080]   It'll be on a laptop.
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.280]   A very large 55-inch laptop.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.600]   And do they think this is a serious product for consumers?
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.680]   Or is it for extreme home theaters and people
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.880]   who are building out TV sets?
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.120]   I mean, the actual video is--
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.640]   Well, LG is showing a panel, which
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.600]   means they're not showing an end product.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.920]   But Samsung, I think, is showing an end product.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.480]   Somebody showing a 4K.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.440]   I heard that Samsung, people who've seen the sample
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:25.000]   that Samsung has, it looks like a production-ready model,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.040]   as opposed to just, hey, look, we're putting our booth.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:31.920]   LG will also have a 84-inch 4K TV.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:32.680]   That's what I like.
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:33.760]   I'm a 4K kind of guy.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.960]   Yeah, that's stupid.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.200]   Oh, perhaps you prefer 3D.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.920]   No, I saw-- I've seen a few 4K presentations.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.200]   And they're all in like darkened theaters
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.960]   on real screens that were about 20 feet diagonal.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.200]   And also manned by real working projectionists who
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.480]   know how to manage an image.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.800]   And it did look gorgeous.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.240]   I don't really think that if you put a 4K display
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:03.200]   in someone's living room, I'm not sure that anybody
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:04.920]   will be able to see the difference between that display
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.280]   and something that cost about 1/3 as much.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.960]   I think it depends on the size of the monitor.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:11.360]   I have to say that I was looking at 100-inch LCD.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.840]   It has to be big before you see it.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.380]   1080p definitely looks pretty pixelated on 100-inch
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:15.880]   Panasonic.
[00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.600]   Yeah, and a big one, 4K.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.000]   They've had them every year at CES for five years.
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.880]   It looks like you're looking out a window.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.800]   I mean, it looks like, oh, yes, right there.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.120]   It's real.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:25.640]   I don't know.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.000]   I just like it.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.400]   It's new and it's shiny.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.240]   We all acknowledge that 4,000 is a much higher number
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.000]   than 1,000, which obviously makes it better.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.480]   Baker is always better.
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.720]   Ford, of course, is going to be there.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:42.240]   Our sponsor, I'll be having dinner with the CEO Ford.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.680]   Just small, intimate dinner.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.800]   A small, intimate dinner with the CEO Ford?
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.880]   On Tuesday.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.320]   Nice.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.640]   So I'll let you know how that goes.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.720]   But they're going to be there.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.640]   In fact, a lot of car companies will
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.400]   be there talking about integration with smartphones
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.040]   and iPhones and all that stuff.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:58.840]   Microsoft--
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.680]   You've got ashtrays in the Mustang.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.760]   And I've got a butt going to my commute.
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.000]   And it's never an ashtray where I want it.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.720]   It brings us another ashtrays in the sky.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.520]   They don't call them cigarette lighters anymore.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.560]   They're accessory ports.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.280]   Did you notice that?
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.240]   I just want-- yeah, I kind of just want outlets built.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.760]   I'm working on trying to figure out how to do it.
[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.400]   I can't plug.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.160]   I just need an outlet.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.120]   I don't need it anymore anymore.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:21.600]   Well, that's DC.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.320]   That's why they don't give you a plug because it's DC.
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.480]   Build an inverter into it.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.960]   Oh, yeah, it could have an inverter in the car.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.840]   That's probably the reason.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.640]   I don't know, a person to flame or something.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.200]   There's probably-- I'm thinking there's a reason.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.240]   I think in there's a reason.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.480]   It will be more likely if you don't build it well.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:36.920]   It would be--
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.760]   You know what I want to hear from--
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.040]   You know what I want to hear from Alan Malawi?
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.320]   A new car!
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:42.680]   No.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.640]   I just--
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.360]   I just want to-- I just want to--
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.840]   I can't wait to find out what's the latest in syncing all
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.280]   that stuff.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.960]   Well, Leo, you know how much it's going to cost us
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:53.440]   a trailer of this car all the way back to the latest--
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:53.960]   Right.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   Why don't we just--
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.520]   Slope is 100 bucks and you just drive--
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.720]   you know, it's much easier.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.920]   It's just simpler for everybody.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.880]   You always less gas.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.560]   It solves that problem.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.120]   I am bribable.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.800]   It's just got to be at a certain level.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.440]   Exactly.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.960]   That's why I don't have an ethics policy link on my site
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.440]   because I would have to say I am purchasable for the right
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:14.920]   price.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.440]   The problem is you have to buy my retirement starting
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:18.280]   from the front of the right--
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:18.760]   Exactly.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.720]   --right to think you've got to write it.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:20.240]   Exactly.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.120]   But I'm fine with that.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.640]   I think that anybody who loves me would say a million bucks.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.400]   OK.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.440]   When I sell out, it'll be big.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:27.880]   That's it.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.280]   Just you and I, it's not that we're not for sale.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.720]   It's just we have a standard.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.960]   A large number.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.720]   It's a big number.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.720]   The least important--
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:36.640]   The least important--
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.880]   If I told you about the offer that I received and turned down,
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.320]   if you want to hit me, then for having turned it down,
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.600]   then I think that that was not the right decision.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.600]   Is there anything else for CES?
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.600]   No.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.600]   That's it, right?
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:54.600]   You're going to-- are you going to be some pro stuff
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.600]   that you're going to look at?
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.600]   I'm going to look at everything.
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.600]   But I mean, well, is this Blackmagic's there, right?
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.600]   No.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.600]   No, no, no.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.600]   There's not a lot of pro stuff, but I'll be looking--
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:02.600]   there are some little bits of things.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.600]   And usually there's things that we look at and we say we could
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:05.600]   use that in the pro field.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   Like GoPros and that type of thing.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:08.600]   Oh, GoPros?
[00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.600]   So a lot of portable--
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.600]   I'll be looking for portable cameras and small cameras.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.320]   And then-- but a lot of times you'll see stuff, especially in the
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.600]   little Chinese section that's over in the North Hall.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   You'll see a lot of stuff that's pending.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   It's coming that they're trying to sell to resellers.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   And a lot of things you go through there and I'll be covering
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.600]   some of that with my little iPhone and stuff like that.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.600]   But a lot of the-- that's the kind of stuff that you'll see
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:28.600]   this year.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.600]   And next year it'll be packaged in, you know--
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:31.600]   Right.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:33.600]   And PMA is across the street.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   Oh, so there'll be a lot of photography stuff.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.600]   PMA's the photo marketing association.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.600]   You forgot the PMA's happening at the same time.
[00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.600]   Oh, right.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   I believe we get in with our--
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:42.600]   We do?
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.600]   I believe-- I'm double checking, but I think so.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   Oh, that makes me feel--
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:46.600]   Let's do some photo stuff.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.600]   I forgot.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.600]   I have to admit I've been so focused on CES.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   I forgot the PMA's.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.600]   5D Mark.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.600]   Tohua.
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.600]   I don't think it's going to--
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   No?
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.600]   I don't know if it's going to--
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.600]   Well, the rumor is it's going to be a little later in the
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:00.600]   announcement.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   It's going to--
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   Patow.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.600]   We've got questions.
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:04.600]   Yep, we do have questions.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.600]   Hold on.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.600]   We're going to get to those in a second.
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   A big article by Jackie Chang in Infinite Loop on Ars Technica.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:14.600]   Apparently, when your iPhone gets stolen, iMessages continue.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   There's an old Johnny Carson joke.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.600]   It says, "When you die, your hair and your fingernails continue to
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:24.600]   grow, but messages tend to taper off."
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.600]   And I think that this is the same story.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   You know, if your phone gets stolen, texts might continue to
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.600]   go to it.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.600]   I don't know why this is a story.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   There was actually-- so what happened was that someone lost it
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.600]   and then they-- it appeared that stuff was still going to that
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.600]   phone.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.600]   Well, of course it was.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.600]   Well, but they-- so that there was a three-step process, I think,
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.600]   that they said.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   Yes.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.600]   You first report it, then you--
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:47.600]   Then you deactivate it.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.600]   You first wipe it, then you deactivate it, and then you deactivate it,
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.600]   and you get a new sim and you're a new--
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.600]   You have to get a new sim and you're a new card.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.600]   Like if you don't do that part.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   Oh, if you don't get the new sim--
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.600]   Yeah, you need to get a new-- you need to turn a new one on to
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.600]   finish the cycle.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   That's good to know.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:44:59.600]   That's good to know.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   It's not just text messaging.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   It's also a high message where there's something in Apple's
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.600]   software that's saying it's not just registering via the sim,
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.600]   it's registering via the unique idea of this phone.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   So it is not sufficient to deactivate the phone, which is what
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   I do.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.600]   I go to AT&T site and I say this phone's been lost and deactivated,
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.600]   but I messages could continue to show up on that lost phone.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   Yes.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.600]   As long as you have-- as long as you have-- as long as you're still
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   registered to the exact same phone numbers before.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.600]   Got it.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   Yes.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   There's a workaround for it.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:36.600]   If you have attached a PIM to your-- a Pintira, to your SIM card,
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   then supposedly that will stop it from working, but also it might
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.600]   stop, find my iPhone and all those other features from working as
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.600]   well because it will essentially disconnect everything on the
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.600]   wrong search.
[00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:48.600]   Yeah, I only do that after you've given up.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   I mean, if you think you might find the phone, don't do that yet.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.600]   You can't wipe it though.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.600]   Find my iPhone still works after a wipe.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   You can wipe it.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   This is just about I message.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.600]   Right.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.600]   It happened when David Hovis contacted ours Technica to say that
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.600]   Mrs. Hovis's 4S had been stolen.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   She remotely wiped the device, deactivated the SIM, bought a new
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   iPhone, activated it with her old number.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   But when he began sending eye messages to his wife, both she
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.600]   and the new owner of the stolen phone received them.
[00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:22.600]   And in fact, Hovis and the new owner of the phone-- owner of
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.600]   the phone had a-- had like a dialogue.
[00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.600]   You say, "Who's this?
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.600]   Why are you messaging me?"
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:29.600]   Well, you stole my phone.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:32.600]   He apparently purchased it from somebody.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   I don't think I would have started with my stolen phone and
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   said, "Hey, I'd like to take you out for lunch."
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   Hey, let's get together.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:39.600]   Yeah, let's--
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   It's allegedly--
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   It's allegedly--
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.600]   Hi, this is Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   You have registered the 100 millionth iPhone.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:54.600]   Come to the Central Police Station, but collect your free gift card.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.600]   See, he had done all of this.
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.600]   Except for change the SIM number.
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   He had--
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.600]   Oh, you have to get a new SIM in your new phone.
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:10.600]   I know that with my old-- with my other phone, as soon as I--
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   well, I haven't done it with eye messages, but with my older
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:14.600]   iPhone 4, you know, obviously it stops working.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.600]   The problem is you can't really test this very well.
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.600]   But apparently-- but that's what Hovis said it happened--
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   is that wipe, deactivate, new SIM, new phone, and still it was
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.600]   happening.
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.600]   And is it just the eye messages that are going on?
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.600]   It's just eye messages.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.600]   So it's because your cell services getting turned off, but the eye
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   messages are still--
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.600]   It's over Wi-Fi.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   Right.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   Mm.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   If it's still logged in--
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   Macworld says that wiping, deactivating the SIM and then
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:47.600]   activating a new SIM works, but apparently some R's Technica
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:52.600]   correspondence say no.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.600]   There's a more complicated process that will work to lock
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   stolen phones-- iPhones from my messages-- but be warned, says
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.600]   Jackie, it could also block you from finding the phone if the
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.600]   reboots your phone.
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.600]   Set a pin on your SIM card, which is different than setting a
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   pin for the phone.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   Right.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   That's what I was talking about earlier.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   Got it.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:16.600]   But if you do it wrong, you could lock yourself out.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   Because apparently there is a default pin for the SIM card.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:20.600]   The carrier says--
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   It's a feature that practically nobody uses.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.600]   That's why it's-- this is news to so many people.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.600]   I myself had not heard about this for like two or three years.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.600]   Seems like a good idea.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   There are frozen cons.
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.600]   The only inconvenience to you is that every time you power down
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.600]   and restart the phone, you'll also have to enter in the pin for
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   your SIM card in addition to whatever, you know, lock screen
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.600]   pin you put in for the OS itself.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.600]   But not every time you just turn it on.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:49.600]   You have to power it all the way down.
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   Only when you boot it up from cold.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   So there's not a whole lot of inconvenience, but it does
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   mean that some services that count on free open access to the
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   SIM might interfere with that sort of stuff.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   Like find my iPhone, like some of these other like low jack
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   type services for devices.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   So it's in settings.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   It's the phone entry in settings.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.600]   So you tap that.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.600]   And SIM pin right there is off.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   So let's put in a new SIM pin.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   I better-- should I hide my--
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   You can change it later.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   You just want two, three, four.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.600]   Do you want me to not show this?
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   No, I don't.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:34.600]   That's not a-- let's say to you.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:36.600]   Okay.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.600]   You do this on Verizon.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   Verizon does not have a SIM card.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   It says--
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   Whoa, now wait a minute.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   Now that I'm scared.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   Could not lock SIM.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   One attempt remaining.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.600]   What the hell does that mean?
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.600]   No.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:50.600]   I'm going to leave that off.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.600]   Did you see that?
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   Yeah, I did see that.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   That looked like I was going to screw up my phone.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:04.600]   So the default is for a Bell, Canada, and 18T is 1111.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.600]   For Rogers Wireless, one, two, three, four.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.600]   For Sprint, it's four zeros.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:10.600]   I don't know what it is for Verizon.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   Verizon doesn't have a SIM card, of course.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   I'm asking you for the pin.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.600]   Is it?
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.600]   I'm asking you for it.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.600]   You've got to put a pin into change to the--
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   So 1111.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.600]   You better hope it can do it right.
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   Okay, there you go.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   Now I almost bricked my phone.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:25.600]   I do.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.600]   Current pin is 1111.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:31.600]   New pin, we'll just say this, because that's what it is.
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   And then save it.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.600]   So now, I've got a pin.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.600]   It's on.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.600]   So if I turn this off though, it's not going to do anything.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.600]   It's just asked for the regular number.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   But it's only if I shut it down fully, then I will do that.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   Okay, good.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:49.600]   So now, I don't have to worry about my images.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.600]   So now if you turn it off, when it comes back on, it's going to--
[00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   It's going to be two coats.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   Wow, very secure.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:57.600]   I set them to the same so I don't have to remember anything.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:03.600]   The SIM pin was a lot more relevant back in the day when batteries lasted all of 20 minutes,
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   and people generally actually powered down their rounds when they were being used right now.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   Given that you might reset your iPhone maybe like four times a year,
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:13.600]   it's of limited use.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   But the idea is just to block people's access to your phone number and to your voicemail
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   and stuff like that.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   So what's unclear is how Apple's doing this, and it says this may not fix the problem if
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:32.600]   Apple is storing the UDID as opposed to the SIM.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.600]   Well, the information I have is just that Apple is aware of the problem in monitoring the situation
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.600]   closely, which means that I think there'll be a 0.01 update some time in the next
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:44.600]   month and a half that fixes this.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:50.600]   So be very careful not to do what I almost did, which is just kind of go, no, I want it to be this.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.600]   And then it'll lock the phone forever.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:53.600]   It's a good tip.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:56.600]   I came within one, because they only give you, it looks like three tries.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:59.600]   And then after that, they came within one of--
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   Well, because--
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   Right, because of course the OS thinks that you're trying to change the password to--
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   You're trying to change the password to assume that you don't actually control.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   So this is good.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.600]   This is an additional level of protection.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:14.600]   So now I have a locked SIM.
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:17.600]   I'll change this later, but that's good.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:18.600]   And now it's unlocking the SIM.
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.600]   But you only do that when you shut it all the way down.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   Thank God.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   I do hope that we're--
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   I wonder if you wipe it.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.600]   I guess I would have tried that too, right?
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:27.600]   Yes.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.600]   This is the problem we're having.
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   It's stored in the SIM.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.600]   The SIM is non-volatile.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   Right.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   So wiping the phone does not wipe the SIM, obviously.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.600]   Good.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.600]   So now I can lose this with impunity.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   So happy to hear that.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.600]   Steve Jobs gets a Grammy.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   Johnny Ive gets a night hood.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   That's pretty fair.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   That seems fair.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   Posthumous Grammy for Steve Jobs for significant contributions to music.
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:55.600]   I think that's wonderful.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.600]   It's a trustees award.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:00.600]   It will be the second Grammy to honor Apple.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.600]   It got a technical Grammy 10 years ago.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:06.600]   You know, that's great.
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   The music industry is recognizing that Apple changed everything, but maybe not for the
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   worse.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   Maybe for the better.
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   They sure made a lot of money off of iTunes.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:22.600]   And he decorated a lot of opportunity, much of which the record industry is not--
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   He capitalized upon?
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   Because their head is in a dark place.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.600]   Sir Johnny.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:33.600]   Sir Johnny Ive is now a knight of the British Empire, KBE.
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   That word came out on the Queen of England's New Year's honors list.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:45.600]   The Mercury News quotes Ive saying, "I'm keenly aware that I benefit from a wonderful tradition
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.600]   in the UK of designing and making to be recognized with this honor is absolutely thrilling and
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:53.600]   I'm both humbled and sincerely grateful."
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:54.600]   I think he should be Sir Johnny.
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   He's a good Sir Johnny.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   He's a good Sir Johnny.
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.600]   If you're going to have knights--
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.600]   This is the kind of guy you want to have.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:53:59.600]   Yeah, a knight of design.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   Yes.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:01.600]   Love it.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.600]   Wonderful.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   You got to imagine what the people in his studio are going to be welcoming him with when the
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.600]   cow came back from vacation.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:11.600]   Oh, God.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   If there was not like a kick butt like you know, mill aluminum armor plate, putting for him.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.600]   With the glowing logo in the chest like Tony Stark.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   Yeah, I would never hear the end of it.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.600]   Sword in the stone.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   I think everyone in my company made fun of me forever.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.600]   And you'd be very pleased that they did.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.600]   Yes.
[00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.600]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:35.880]   When I was in high school, my English teacher got his doctorate in English for an entire
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:36.880]   week.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.600]   We would not allow the class to start.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.760]   Until we all started to be like, "Doctor, doctor, it hurts when I do this."
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.240]   And by Thursday, he'd be like, "Then don't do that."
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:47.600]   "Okay, can we get home with the class?"
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:52.360]   So the goal is to, he's going to be proud of his achievement.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.840]   It's your job as the underling to drive that pride with him and just make it a wearying
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:01.080]   trial after day after day.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:05.640]   I wish they'd come out with us in time for Christmas.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   D.I.D.
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:14.440]   Corp, they do very, very detailed German action figures.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:21.400]   Like here's a Pansa tank on a pallet trooper from Algeria in 1961.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   French resistance.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   Christmas special.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.400]   His name is Pierre.
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:32.440]   And until they get the cease and desist letter, a fully poseable action figure of Mr. Steve
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.480]   Jobs, Grammy award-winning Steve Jobs.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.480]   Look at this.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.480]   It's quite nice.
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   Look how good this looks.
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   It's superlative.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:45.320]   Now, unfortunately, you go on the site, you can't actually, were able to actually see
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:46.320]   that on the site?
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.320]   No.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.960]   Well, I can't find it, which means I wonder if they got to them earlier on.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:56.560]   They have the other, I'm sure, completely unlicensed celebrity likenesses dolls up there.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:00.120]   There is Tom Hanks from Saving Private Ryan.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:03.440]   And it's named after, I think it's called the Captain Miller doll.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:07.680]   But it's obviously, it is just as good as good as the Steve Jobs doll is.
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.360]   That's how good the Tom Hanks likenesses.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:16.880]   There's also a German general that looks absolutely perfect rendition of Ed Harris.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:20.800]   Well, I think the French resistance guy, Pierre, looks just like Tom Selleck.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.280]   Maybe that's what they do.
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.280]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:25.280]   It's totally Ed Harris.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.280]   Right.
[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:30.400]   It's like, so if you want your, finally, your bud-brig-bun action figure from the abyss.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:31.640]   Look at that.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.920]   It's actually a major Erwin Koenig from the Battle of St--.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:36.280]   So obviously, what they do.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.560]   Now, Steve Jobs is a public figure.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.160]   You can make a Steve Jobs doll.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.360]   What you can't do is put trademarked Apple goods with him.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:50.160]   So if they don't include the iPhone or the Macintosh, that's not illegal.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:53.360]   I'd be surprised if they'd also call it Steve Jobs.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.080]   They would call it visionary.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   Right.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   Probably.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.080]   The insanely great action figure.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.040]   Although, now, wait.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.600]   Now, I don't know how does that work?
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:08.680]   Because you can't use Albert Einstein's likeness in an ad unless you pay his estate
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.680]   money.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.640]   Does that mean you can't make?
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:12.640]   I don't know.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.640]   I don't know.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   I think that his likeness, though, is different.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:19.760]   A photograph of him and a painting of a more sculpture of him, I think, is different.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:20.760]   I don't know.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:21.760]   I'm not 100% sure.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:24.600]   I know that you definitely cannot have a Macintosh in there.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.440]   Boy, that really does look like it here is.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.400]   Wow.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   That's really-- these are uncanny.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:37.920]   And they're on-- I've seen figures like this, and you think, oh, wow, that's a really nice
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   wax mannequin.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.480]   And they know that's about a 10-inch doll.
[00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   What?
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.480 --> 00:57:44.960]   These are better than the wax museum stuff.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.960]   How much do they cost?
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:47.960]   I don't know.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.760]   These jobs are all supposedly $99.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.000]   But again, I was looking at this morning.
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   I could not--
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Those are the first days.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.840]   First days since I heard about this, I was able to actually load the site, and I was not
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.640]   able to find the Steve Jobs figures there anymore.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.880]   It's a pretty slow site.
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:03.160]   The DID stands for Dragon in Dream.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.880]   They have a Barack Obama.
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:08.360]   And if it's an Asian company, you know they respect intellectual property rights.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.400]   You know that this must be licensed.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.720]   They have a horse action, man.
[00:58:11.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   You guys have to put me into Polly Onyx.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:14.960]   Here's Jay.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.960]   Huh.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:16.960]   Samurai.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.960]   Samurai.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   Interesting.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:23.960]   I guess it's probably nowadays, Alex, with 3D rendering technology, not so difficult.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.960]   I could definitely get a pretty good start.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.960]   I bet you a lot of that's hand sculpted.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   Oh, you know, I mean, I think--
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.960]   Actually, you'd be surprised.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   A lot of the-- especially the action figures are done today.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:36.040]   The first step is usually ZBrush.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.600]   It's actually like a 3D model that's instead of clay.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:42.760]   And then it's really a digital production for start to finish.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:46.920]   So when it's an actual licensed thing, they will actually get the real guy like in the
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:47.920]   end into a scanner.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:48.920]   Right.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:51.920]   And that will at least be the starting off point for it.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:56.000]   But this, but while since I've bought lots of-- I cured my action figure fetish about
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   20 years ago.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:01.160]   By the way, I realized that these are shelves that could be having electronics and some
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.720]   Star Wars action figures.
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.720]   But it's amazing the level of detail they can put into each one of these.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.720]   I'm going to be able to-- Leon, I'm actually working on building a new 3D model up your
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.720]   head.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.040]   Can I have an action figure?
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:13.040]   Yes.
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.040]   Can I be opposable?
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.040]   We work on that.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:16.200]   I don't know about the action figure.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:19.200]   I have-- we're going to borrow a bunch of 5Ds and do some digitalized--
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.600]   Do you want me to come in and you can put dots on my face?
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.600]   We don't need to do dots anymore.
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.600]   That's the whole thing.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:26.040]   We just take a whole bunch of photos and we upload them to the cloud and then we get
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:27.040]   a model.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.040]   The cloud does it.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:29.040]   The cloud does it.
[00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.280]   You know what else I get from the cloud?
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:31.280]   My audio books.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.280]   Let's take a break.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.760]   When we come back, we're going to have our iOS and Lion tip and our picks of the week
[00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:40.120]   as well with Alex Lindsay of the Pixelcore Pixelcore.com and Pixelcore.tv for the podcast
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:43.320]   and Andy and Ico from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:47.800]   But first, look at all these great books.
[00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:51.520]   I swear Audible is just knocking it out of the park.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:57.280]   100,000 titles now at Audible.com and I'm going to give you one free.
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.240]   The hardest thing is figuring out which one you want.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.080]   Wow.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.200]   So here's the deal and then I'll let Andy make a pick for us.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:12.680]   Right now I'm listening to the second book of the Song of Ice and Fire because I know
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.680]   that the Game of Thrones has sequels coming.
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:21.520]   They're working on a HBO so I want to read a clash of Kings before they do it on TV because
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.520]   I like to read these things.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.920]   In fact, one of the reasons I love Audible is because when you listen to stuff like that,
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:30.880]   it's almost as if you're watching a TV show except your brain is so much better than anything
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.360]   that they could realize on the screen.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.320]   I mean, your brain has an infinite budget.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:41.960]   So I love listening even more than reading it because somehow there's something about
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.080]   how it comes in your ears.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.240]   I think I've seen it almost already.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.960]   I just love that.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.960]   So that would be a good one.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.440]   I'm listening to Seal Team 6.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.880]   Oh, is it the story of the rescue?
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:52.880]   No, no.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:58.480]   It's actually by a, it's basically almost a memoir from a Seal Team 6 sniper and it just
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.920]   gives you a whole world.
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:00.920]   I'm doing some research.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.920]   I'm working on a movie that's all about that type of thing.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.560]   Well, I should warn you, Dana Brunetti was in here and they have optioned the Seal Team
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.320]   6 story of Cap-Tr- the captain.
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.320]   Sorry, I've been optioned.
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:12.320]   They're already making the movie.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   I think Sony's making it.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.320]   They're already making the movie.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.040]   Well, no, I'm working on some different stuff.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]   So anyway, but the--
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.520]   They got the pirates, right?
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.840]   They rescued the captain.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:23.840]   That wasn't incredible.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.200]   But the, you get what he does, he kind of walks you through his whole, you know, everything
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.040]   from his childhood that led up to him being successful and being Seal Team 6.2, which
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.040]   was a lot of beating from his father.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.040]   Wow.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.840]   It turned out, you know, it was kind of like, yeah, it didn't seem that bad when they were
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.280]   doing this stuff because no one was beating me.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.340]   You know, so it was like no matter how bad it got in his training.
[01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:50.000]   But it also talks about the training and what they had to do and everything else.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.600]   It's just a very-- and it's this kind of no, no, I don't know who's reading it, but it's
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.760]   like a no nonsense kind of thing.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.760]   It's a fun--
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:56.760]   It's a fun--
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.760]   It's a fun stuff.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.760]   If you're into that kind of thing, it's fun.
[01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.600]   Audible has a list of five anti-resolutions for new years, including this one, French women
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.560]   don't get fat, the secret of eating for pleasure.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.640]   Oh, I like that.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.680]   I know.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.760]   So give us a recommendation, Andy.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:15.320]   You should go to audible.com/macbreak and you can get your first book free.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.840]   You'll be signing up for the gold account.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.040]   That's a book a month, but the first month's free, your first book is free or credit towards
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.680]   the first book, most books are a single credit.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:25.040]   And the book is yours to keep.
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.640]   You can cancel it anytime.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.960]   You got something that people should absolutely listen to?
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.400]   Well, there's the book that I'm listening to.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.920]   I'm actually reading right now.
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.240]   There's a Christmas gift.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   It's trippy.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.840]   It's like the first real like hardcover book I've read and I don't know how long it's
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.840]   gone.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:41.840]   I'm going to put red on the cover there.
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:42.840]   Exactly.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.840]   It's a book of essays and talks they gave something called God know.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.760]   Obviously, which he speaks his mind on a great many subjects that are very, very familiar
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.280]   to fans of Pendullet.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.160]   So yes, atheism is one of the topics, skepticism, science, another one.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:07.840]   Also, odd environmental places in which she attempted intercourse.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.720]   Oh, dear.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.480]   Such as, again, if you have access to the NASA vomit comet.
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.480]   What?
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.040]   No, scuba geared underwater.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.200]   Okay, that's fine too.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.160]   So I'm just saying that there's a, the, I met page 100 in the book.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:26.640]   It's like 200 page book.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.440]   The very next chapter has a title that I can't really read here.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440]   So I'm not going to.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.400]   He's a wild man.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:38.000]   I gotta say, this is not a book like fear, not for fear, fear, fear on Shelby unless you're
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.240]   on Shelby is pretty hip.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.280]   It's, but I love it for two reasons.
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.800]   As an audio book, it's going to be great.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.520]   There's a long sample of it.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:50.160]   And Pendullet has that really wonderful forceful voice in which he delivers the material that
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160]   he's talking to you.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.160]   Easy.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160]   It's like hanging out with your friend.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.920]   It's definitely not the book you'd listen to like as you drift off to sleep.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.160]   Definitely a good book to keep you awake as you're driving late at night.
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.480]   But one of the reasons why as usual, I love almost everything that he writes is that even
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:10.360]   when I disagree with stuff that he's saying, he's made such an interesting argument, oh,
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:15.920]   in my opinion, wrongheadedness that it really forces me to sort of evaluate why I think that's
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:20.400]   wrong and organized in my mind, not just a reaction of, oh, that's just BS.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.400]   I don't know why.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:22.880]   Where's he talking out of in that one?
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.240]   Actually organizing your thoughts and figuring out here is why specifically I don't think
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240]   that's correct.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.040]   And here the here's the argument I would present.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.640]   And so in doing so, you think more about you learn more about what you believe and what
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.040]   you think about.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:39.240]   So there's only one chapter that so far that I thought, oh, God, this wasn't even amusing
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.840]   leap that offensively wrong.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.480]   He can be pretty offensive.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:47.320]   But you know, you've so I understand that's what you're getting into.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.320]   But that's okay.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:52.120]   And I don't want to say it's just it's all about atheism and intercourse.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.200]   It's also about my two favorite subject.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.480]   So I'm going to read it.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.480]   That's I won't even go there.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.880]   Yes, godless heat.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.880]   Then you come here.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:02.880]   Come here.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:06.880]   Right now, I'm just I'm just looking at like the the the the family to it board.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.080]   I think it's fun to say three of them.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.000]   I shouldn't say two of them are particularly funny.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.640]   One is hysterical, but needs to be carefully worded.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:15.640]   And so I'm right.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.880]   I'm going to have to pass the category to the to the rise.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.880]   The use of my.
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.160]   Well, it's I'm enjoying the hell out of this book.
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.840]   And so it's a really good recommendation.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:28.640]   I feel like the longest one to catalog, but on Audible, it is unabridged.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.640]   So you get to hear the whole thing.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.320]   Seven seven hours and 23 minutes is pretty decent.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.960]   I feel like you know, Pendulate.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.480]   Is that not the case?
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480]   That is not the case.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.480]   I met him.
[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.040]   I met him exactly once.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.240]   And it was the way that everybody gets to meet Penn and Teller.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:43.680]   Oh, actually, which is after the show.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.680]   Backstage.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:48.720]   Although one of the most interesting experiences of my life was going back to the millennium
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:50.120]   Broadway.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:55.880]   I was once stared at by Teller for a good, like solid five minutes.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.960]   Like it was the freakiest.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:04.520]   It was the freaky experience ever because I'd like lock my left my room key in my room.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.920]   So I needed to like have make another one.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.480]   It was like one 30 in the morning.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.280]   It's like one of those horseshoe shaped like perception desks.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.000]   And I'm standing here like sort of and Teller is like just sort of leaning against the
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.880]   four against against the counter waiting for waiting for help.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.240]   And I noticed him just like looking like he's just like leaning, but he's just sort of like
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.280]   looking at me like that.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.280]   Not glaring.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.280]   He's just looking.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.920]   And I'm trying to and I recognize a hey, that's Teller of Penn and Teller.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:33.020]   And I'm a huge tellers written in the magic magazine.
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.020]   I love him.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.020]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:36.020]   Let's say is about just the craft of magic.
[01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:39.860]   And mine stink is to say, hi, you're Teller of Penn and Teller.
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.700]   I'm a big fan of you Teller.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:45.240]   I read I read your book in Jeannie magazine and I was wonderful.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:48.980]   And then thinking that well, perhaps he wants to, you know, he doesn't want adulation.
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.840]   He wants to be sort of like left alone.
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.440]   But then like I know he's still staring at me and I'm like, he's just waiting.
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:58.880]   Is he, is he, is he saying that he did he say this guy looks like exactly the sort of
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.400]   like bird loser who's got to come up to me and bother me about, hey, you know, that
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.880]   I used to do the cups and balls routine at high school.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.480]   And I was like, finally, just like sort of waved because I don't know what to do.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:11.920]   Tell her who's staring at me.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]   It's one 30 in the morning.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.760]   He probably has hours of some sort.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.800]   So did he weigh back?
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   He did not.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.800]   He's just like, just like this.
[01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.280]   And I'm wondering.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:22.280]   He was out of it.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.800]   I don't like there's a painting behind me that had something really.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.560]   He was on ambi and he had no idea what he was doing.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:28.960]   And I have no idea.
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.880]   But again, I, I, that's going to be my icebreaker.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.160]   If I ever get a chance to actually meet tell her, you stare at me for five minutes.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.160]   Why?
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.160]   I don't know if you remember me.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.160]   Mr. Tellers the answer.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.160]   We're the bloody Broadway like back world expert.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.160]   I don't know if you were in problem.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.160]   Are you staring at me?
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.160]   I'm a flexible.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.160]   Anyway, maybe he's trying to figure out maybe he thought he knew you.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:52.160]   I know this guy.
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:56.600]   This was like 97, he was going, but he sees, you know, he travels in time.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.600]   So he was going to be a big fan.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.680]   What is in traveling time?
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.040]   He existed all planes.
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.040]   That's what I mean.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.040]   So in it's just.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.560]   You know, back in, you know, there was a, there was a time when back in 2001 when before
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:11.880]   Andy and I had met actually and we were in, it was in Mac world and I walked by and I
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.640]   looked and I said, that's Andy and not go.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   I stared at him walking by.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   I think you were with me.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:17.520]   And, and, and, but he didn't notice me.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.160]   I know we stared at him for five, a good five minutes.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.360]   Like that's Andy and I.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.040]   Oh, did, did my, did one of my people rough you up because I remember.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.800]   I didn't, I didn't, I didn't want to bring that up.
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.880]   I, I, I thought I really thought you hadn't noticed.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.560]   I just don't know if like how I gave him like the, the small bonus, not the big bonus
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.600]   that year, but I never heard back and I didn't hear a police report.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:41.600]   It was, it was, it was.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.640]   There's a reason why after they rough you up, they give you that comment car because I
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.240]   can't evaluate their performance.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   It was, I'm sorry.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.400]   It was, it was a, it was, you know, it was the fibula.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.960]   Unfortunately, it went on, not the tibia.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:09:00.040]   So, um, you know, I, I, I felt that I got off easy, you know, audible.com/medbreak.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.920]   If you have not yet joined, please do.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:02.920]   I think you'll love it.
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.720]   I'm a, if you're a fan of old time radio comedy, like you've just heard right.
[01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.720]   We're non sequitur humor.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.720]   Ian Alex show.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:16.160]   I use the audible app on both Android and iPhone and download all my audio and they have, it's
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.160]   fun.
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.680]   They have a little gamification thing to, you know, you get points for how much you listen
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.680]   and all that.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.400]   But it's just before I go anywhere, I make sure I got my, I have so many books.
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.720]   I have like a library and I just, and I go back and I listen to other, I listen to some
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:31.200]   books and listen to sections over and over and over again.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.240]   And one of the nice things about the app is your whole library of everything you've ever
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:37.080]   purchased is all this on it.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:42.160]   So you can go back through, in my case, 500 books.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.320]   So it's like, I've got a whole library in my pocket and download.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.320]   You have to download.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.560]   It's a lot easier on your back than taking those all with you on, in a backpack.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:51.400]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   Audible.com/medbreak.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:57.440]   You're going to love it.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.640]   Let's get our iOS tip of the week.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:00.640]   You want to do one today?
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:01.640]   I'm ready.
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.640]   All right.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.640]   I got one for the iPad.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:04.640]   I like Lindsey.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:05.640]   Yes.
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   I'm the listeners for some of these.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   They're good.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640]   They're really good.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.000]   So one of the ones, this is from Jeff Price.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.600]   And by the way, if you're listening, if you're following me on Twitter, a lot of times on
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:19.400]   Monday I'll go, I'm working on the tips and what should I think about and then this is
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.400]   what I got.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.400]   You crowdsource it.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:25.840]   I am crowd sourcing it's great because people are smarter than I am.
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:28.240]   So anyway, so the, so if you go in and you want to type something, one of the things I
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:32.840]   thought was interesting is I keep people talking about the split keyboard on the iPad
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:35.400]   because it's a little bit big.
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:41.680]   If you hold down the on the lower right, if you hold down the keyboard, it says, "Undock"
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680]   or "Split."
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:45.080]   So you go to split and I got two little keyboards.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:48.080]   Here, let me show everybody what it looks like because it is kind of cool.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.480]   You got two little keyboards.
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:50.480]   If you're a Thumber.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.480]   If you're a Thumber.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.480]   If you're a Thumber.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.320]   So that's it for people like type like that.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:59.600]   So you hold down this logo, the little keyboard, and I can reassemble it.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.800]   And if I want to disassemble it, by the way, notice this is very simple.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.720]   It's very subtle, but see those little ridges here?
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.920]   That's so you can move this thing around.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.720]   Did you know that?
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.720]   I have never used it.
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.080]   If I select "Undock" then you can move that up.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   I can slide it around.
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.800]   I don't know exactly how to do that.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.240]   And then splits the one you were showing.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.240]   So there's a way to do it.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240]   How do you do that?
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.000]   We did this on iPad today and I cannot remember.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   To split?
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.200]   I'm moving it around.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.200]   Somebody told me.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.200]   Do you remember?
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:31.200]   That part I don't know.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.560]   I think there's a grabber.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.560]   Just drag it.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.560]   Oh, I did.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.560]   I was pressing it.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560]   That's the problem.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.560]   Don't press it.
[01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.560]   Whoa.
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.560]   Very touchy.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.560]   Okay, I'm sorry, but here you can have this back now.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560]   There's no keyboard left off.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.560]   It ran off.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.960]   So, and then the second one, and this is just a real quick one for the iPhone because
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.320]   it was something that when it first came out, people kept on talking about and I can
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.000]   remember how to do it.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   So you want to take a picture really quickly, just make sure you're waiting your phones off.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:59.240]   Just double click that bottom, that bottom, your home key.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   Double tap the home key.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:03.400]   And then click on the camera and boom, you're in the camera.
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:04.680]   That is a new feature in iOS.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.080]   Yes, it's just fantastic.
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.080]   It's just great.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.920]   But people have heard about it, but I think a lot of people didn't know where it actually
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.120]   was and that came in from a sphere in a box.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.040]   It reminded me that that was a good one to talk about.
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.000]   So you're in the off position.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.480]   You double tap the home key.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.200]   And by the way, that's also handy if you're listening to me.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:24.920]   And you can throw it to an airplane.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.640]   There's a lot of little things that you can do there.
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.640]   All without logging in.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.320]   And then finally, if it's somebody else's phone, you could take pictures and then it'll be
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.320]   on their phone without them knowing.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:34.320]   Cool, huh?
[01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.520]   That is so dangerous.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:39.000]   I didn't even think about that.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   That's a whole tip in itself.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.400]   It's a little security issue there.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.360]   A lion tip and then we're going to get to our questions.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.440]   So get those questions queued up.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.800]   Yes.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:55.080]   This is a technically an iTunes match tip and it's sort of a broad thing.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:01.200]   Everyone knows how well iTunes match works if you buy a song off iTunes.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.520]   It syncs to every single device.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:08.040]   Also, any time you put a piece of music you put into the library, whether it's off a CD
[01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:11.800]   or download from someplace else, it will automatically match iTunes and be available
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.400]   to every other device.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:18.280]   But if you think a little bit beyond that, you realize that now it becomes, you have
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:22.760]   opportunities if you carefully choose what store you buy your music from.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:28.600]   It used to be that there was little difference between buying a song off of Amazon MP3 versus
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:29.600]   iTunes.
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:30.600]   They're all unlocked.
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.680]   They're all 256K bit rate.
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:39.440]   Now though, if you buy your music from Amazon MP3 and you have the Amazon MP3 download a
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:44.560]   wrap, which is free, when you click the buy button on the Amazon site, not only is it
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.600]   purchased, but it also is automatically downloaded and added to the iTunes store.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.000]   Just add it to your iTunes library.
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.720]   You realize that iTunes match doesn't care where those files come from.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.760]   So as soon as the downloader finishes putting those files into iTunes, iTunes takes over,
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.160]   does an iTunes match, realizes that, okay, you actually do own a version of the DevRel
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.440]   and Donna Georgia.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:10.480]   And now that song is available to all of your devices directly from the iTunes store.
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.320]   And remember that when you purchase music off of Amazon MP3, it also goes into the Amazon
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:18.360]   Cloud Player automatically.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:22.200]   And if you have signed up for Google Music and you have that little, that little enhancer
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.360]   plugged in, it automatically will be uploaded into Google Music.
[01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:32.520]   So now there's really an advantage to Amazon MP3 over the iTunes store for purchases because
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:37.680]   if you buy your music from Amazon MP3, you can access it from any web browser anywhere
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:41.960]   in the world because it's there on your Cloud Player and you can play it through any browser.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:45.880]   If you buy it through iTunes, you will be able to play it through iTunes.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.200]   You will be able to play it through your iOS devices.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.400]   If you've got Google Music installed, you can also play it through Android and through
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.240]   that Cloud as well, but you won't have the Amazon Cloud Player.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.960]   So that kind of switched me over from now I will still sample music through the iTunes
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:04.080]   app because I think that's the easiest way to browse for music.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:08.480]   But when it comes time to buy music, I always, always, always buy it from Amazon because
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.720]   I just love the idea of this like Rube Goldberg sort of thing where I click this button and
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.240]   41 different interactions take place to make it so that I don't have to do any sync or
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.240]   anything.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:24.280]   But this music I bought off of this completely unrelated music store is now available on
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.080]   my iPhone about 10 seconds later.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.080]   That is cool.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:30.000]   You should know though that it does count against your total songs whereas if you buy
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.360]   your iTunes, it does not.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.200]   That's the only negative to that.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:34.200]   But what is it?
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.160]   25,000 songs I think we have a little leeway.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:37.560]   I don't have that many.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.800]   Yeah, that's a lot of songs.
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.800]   I think I'm at about 13 to 14,000.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:44.360]   There, Apple finally has kind of explained how iTunes match worked.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.800]   There's a good document which we will put in our show notes where they kind of say this
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.600]   is, answer some questions that people had about iTunes match and how it works and all
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:54.600]   that stuff.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.600]   They finally documented it.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.600]   They should have that from day one.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.600]   I don't understand why they didn't.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:58.600]   It's bizarre.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.120]   It's like, oh, there weren't enough people.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.400]   So, but now we got it.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.800]   But what are people asking in the chat room there?
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:11.080]   Our number one question was, by the way, bitt.ly/askmacbreak.
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   Yes.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.080]   And number one question was end of the month event which we addressed.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.080]   What is it?
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.080]   Why are we?
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:21.680]   Yeah, so what's the deal was technically the one I was the most voted on.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.920]   The second one, which we talked about, I think, as much as we need to.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:31.320]   The second one was why would I want, this is from Mike S. He says, why would I want
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:36.920]   to replace a TV in my house for over $1,000 in comparison of getting a $99 Apple TV?
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:41.480]   What would be the benefit of the TV natively running iOS compared to a box?
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:46.440]   It reminds me of Tivo's failed attempt to put it into TVs.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.120]   As the person who keeps on saying that I think we're going to get an Apple TV, I think
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:53.240]   that for me, the thing is I don't want to deal with any more controllers with my Apple
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   TV.
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:56.120]   I want to be able to watch.
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.880]   I know it sounds like a minor thing, but right now if I want to watch the Steelers,
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.920]   I have to go back to cable.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.680]   If I want to watch live TV and everything else, I have to go back to cable.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:06.600]   I have to use all this crazy stupid, comster stuff.
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.240]   That's why you'll love Google TV.
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:14.120]   And Google TV is a pass-through device that sits on top of your TV, so you never change
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.120]   the input.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.160]   It just pushes a search on top of it or Twitter on top of it.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.360]   The new, now that they've updated it, I actually am liking them a lot.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   It's only $99.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.440]   Why don't I get one of those two?
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.440]   Just play with it and figure it out.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.440]   It's not whatever Apple does.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.440]   It's Googly.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.440]   It's Android.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:33.120]   I guess what I like is once I go into the Apple TV universe, my controller stopped working,
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.120]   for instance last week.
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:37.360]   Once you go into the Apple TV universe, the issue is now you're on your iPhone or iPad.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.040]   You're controlling it.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.200]   If you're a person that has an iPhone and iPad, it means that there's a lot of new interactions
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.360]   that are possible.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.680]   The idea is that it's one thing.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.680]   You turn the TV on and it takes over.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.160]   I still think that the real breakthrough for FaceTime, which I've been using a lot more
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:58.560]   lately than I did when I started, is a built-in camera built into the TV.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.640]   I still think that that turns into a Jetsons.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:08.040]   I can see my parents and my parents in law going crazy over that with our kids.
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:15.320]   I'm actually with this person because it doesn't make any sense to me.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:20.400]   I do think the first step is to unleash the Apple TV, which is let the iOS have to run
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.400]   some free.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:26.000]   That's what Jeremy Carti suggests.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.800]   Who was asking that question?
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:29.760]   That was the follow-up.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.760]   Yes, the next question we had was from Scott Nelson.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.560]   He said iCloud and Apple TV don't always mix well, for example, share on Apple TV across
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.320]   the whole family.
[01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:41.480]   iCloud gives you only one email account.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.360]   Use aliases, create new folders, dads inbox, moms inbox, etc.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.720]   Additionally, some standard apps allow for different Apple IDs, but not all.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.200]   When do you want to create an alternative Apple ID FaceTime, Game Center?
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:19:02.040]   When does it make sense to create it all the time?
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.080]   That's an interesting question.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.480]   It's funny that you should ask this because I got three questions on the radio show this
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:11.280]   weekend from three different people.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.920]   My husband and I share an Apple ID because we like our music, but then I gave it an iPod
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:20.920]   touch to my nephew and now I get death metal on my system.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.960]   I pointed out that you don't have to use the same ID even on a single device.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.800]   That iPod touch could have one ID for buying, another ID for iCloud.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.640]   I think it's probably not a bad idea to have a separate ID for iCloud.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.080]   You still can share apps and music, but it doesn't automatically get copied.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.080]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.120]   I think it's actually there are good times to have a separate ID.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.440]   I think that the one thing that iCloud has kind of broken in a lot of ways is that there's
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:51.520]   not a lot of ways for people to collaborate as groups.
[01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:53.080]   I think it's kind of a bummer where all the stuff.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:58.520]   There's a fact that you can't delete individual pictures from photo stream means that you've
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:01.480]   got to be careful who you share your photo stream with.
[01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:07.000]   I think that for instance, I want to be able to set up very easily and seamlessly, set
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:14.120]   up things that on an iPad or an Apple TV or whatever is going to go, my parents are going
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:15.120]   to be able to see.
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.120]   We had that.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.120]   They took it out.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:18.120]   That's mobile.
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.120]   That's mobile.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.120]   Me did that with the galleries.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:22.480]   They're not going to do that anymore.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.480]   You could have a gallery that grandma saw automatically, wirelessly would go to her Apple
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.000]   TV would show up there.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   It's gone.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   It's gone.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.680]   I have to say that if you've not upgraded, if you've not upgraded, I would highly suggest
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.280]   sticking with mobile me until the very last minute.
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.280]   It's like May or something.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:41.880]   I know, but I'd stay in hope that Apple's going to put some of the stuff back in because
[01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:43.480]   iCloud is a train wreck.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.480]   Right.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:47.560]   I won't say it's a train wreck.
[01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.360]   It's so frustrating.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.800]   It's A in complete and B not well explained and documented.
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.320]   I would agree with Andy.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.320]   It has potential.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.160]   It has an emphasis on A as an incomplete.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.160]   Yeah, it just works.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.160]   It has potential.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.000]   You know, it's like this wheel just works because when you roll it, it just keeps on
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.640]   going, but it's not the whole car that I had before.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:14.280]   Imagine if iPhone 1.0 had the browser work great, the contact management worked great,
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.800]   the mail was rudimentary and required a dial up connection.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:23.800]   That's sort of what iCloud is like where you if on balance, you wish there were a way
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:29.240]   that I could keep the old the old stuff that still works great and have just the new stuff
[01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:30.240]   that you kind of like.
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:32.600]   And you also kind of wish that the new stuff worked better.
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:36.800]   I still think that documents in the cloud, they probably just should have held that back
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:42.520]   until at least they had some support for desktop iCloud sharing.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:46.640]   Because yeah, I mean, I'm still using Dropbox for just about everything because Dropbox
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.680]   isn't as slick as iCloud, but it is all inclusive.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:55.200]   It is the dream of I get to create and edit this document on my desktop, then grab my
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:22:00.600]   bag, go to the bakery cafe or go to the coffee shop and edit that same document on my iPad.
[01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:07.120]   I do have to click a button to and Dropbox to then forward that on to to the app.
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:11.360]   And then later on, I have a problem singing it back down again, but it just it's just
[01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:17.320]   worrying to know that unless I prepared this document for use on my mobile devices by actually
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:21.680]   going to a website and uploading it to the to the cloud, then I will not be able to use
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.400]   that in my future endeavors.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:27.760]   Because the dream of the cloud is that it doesn't matter where your documents got stored.
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:32.680]   The reality of iCloud is that you still have to make sure you carefully pack your bag before
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.800]   you leave the house and leave the documents behind in your hard drive.
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.360]   Or else it's going to bite you right in the butt.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:40.000]   As I did, it all I'm saying is if you're if you're listening, we had to do it.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.480]   I mean, we're all in, you know, we're on the show and we have to make sure that we're
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.480]   looking at the new stuff.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.600]   But I very much regret giving up my mobile me account.
[01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.120]   Like I was like, oh, I'm going to go.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:51.320]   I went away and I forgot that it wasn't there.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.880]   I was like, oh, I left my computer on.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.160]   I was like, I'll just use back my Mac to kind of just go back to whatever.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:56.160]   Oh, yeah, that's not.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:58.160]   It's not there anymore.
[01:22:58.160 --> 01:22:59.720]   One more and then we'll get to work.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.720]   One more.
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.160]   The new for Apple in 2012.
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:08.440]   This is from Jason red appending.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:12.040]   It says with the new stuff coming, IMAX, iPads, MacBook, will there be a new Mac?
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:13.040]   Okay, we talked about this.
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.560]   Will there be a new pack pro?
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:17.920]   Will the new IMAX have an optical drive since the Mac mini has none?
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.440]   I think Apple jumped the gun with killing the optical drive.
[01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:22.280]   What is your feeling?
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280]   And great job.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:27.880]   There's enough room on a IMAX to continue to have an optical drive and still have two
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.880]   drives.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.680]   My new the new IMAX, I have a solid state drive, a spinning drive and an optical drive all
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:33.680]   in one case.
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.640]   And that so there's enough from those that 27 inch display.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:37.640]   It's pretty big.
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:40.120]   So I don't see them killing it because they don't need to.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:41.120]   Right.
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.680]   Not only that, but there's enough margin that they can afford to keep putting in that component
[01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.280]   and not really worry about the extra expense.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.280]   It's cheap.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:50.480]   It makes perfect sense though to get rid of it on the air and this air form factor makes
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:55.920]   perfect sense across the Mac Pro MacBook Pro line except for the 17.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.440]   So I do think that the optical drive is not long for this world.
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.400]   But I think I've said for a while, I think physical media is not long.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.760]   I'm really fine with having a separate drive.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.960]   I mean, I use an optical drive.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:05.960]   Cool external.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:10.520]   I found that there was in my 17 inch, I found this optical I was going to put something
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.320]   into back something from my kids and I popped it open.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.080]   I realized it had been sitting there for six months.
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:15.080]   Right.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:16.080]   I never used it.
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:17.080]   Never used it.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.080]   No, I haven't used it in ages.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:22.320]   But you can get an external and it works fine and it's relatively cheap.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.320]   It's like a hundred bucks, isn't it?
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.320]   Yeah, it looks nice.
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.320]   It fits in.
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.040]   He's the promised carrying it around, but you just leave it at home.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.800]   So you know, I don't I don't need it.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.600]   I'm really happy with the 13 that I got.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.480]   I got the 256 gig drive.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.960]   So I have plenty of space.
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.560]   I got the i7.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:42.100]   I kind of upgraded it thinking that this is going to be somewhat like a 15 inch MacBook
[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.320]   Pro with top of the line.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.320]   And it's great.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.320]   I just love it.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320]   I can't wait.
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:49.520]   I have to admit I'm dying for mine to show up because I went crazy.
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.520]   I went to 512.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.520]   I did the whole thing.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.520]   I did the whole thing.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:53.520]   I did it.
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:54.520]   512.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.520]   I didn't go that high.
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:56.520]   Yeah, I went eight gigs and that's a lot of them in the faster processor.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:59.360]   Yeah, I did everything but the 512.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.360]   Someone says it's back to my Mac is working fine on iCloud.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.720]   So I'll I'll figure out why it shouldn't work for me.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.200]   You were going to tell me that.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.200]   Yeah, I've been using it.
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.440]   Yeah, I got I got I got it working fine.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.280]   I don't know what I don't know if you if you just did a partial change over.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:13.600]   It's always been a little funny, you know, back to my Mac when it works.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.840]   It works so well and you're like, this is magical.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.160]   Yeah, I was editing in my house from Paris, which I thought was just magical editing.
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.200]   I was editing a live stream in my house just as a test.
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:25.960]   That's Paris with back to my Mac.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.320]   And so it's great when it works.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.320]   And it's very exciting.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:31.560]   For some reason, it suddenly is ever since I upgraded to iCloud, I couldn't get any of
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.560]   it to work.
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.560]   I love doing these questions.
[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.720]   Next week, you know, as long as we have enough time, I think it's a great thing to do.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:37.960]   Thank you, Alex, for providing that.
[01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:45.320]   Thanks to Salesforce for the software and again, bitt.ly/askmacbreak.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.200]   You can continue to use it all week.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.720]   By the way, when are you recording?
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.720]   We usually clear this.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.720]   Yucalele.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.720]   Just so you weren't.
[01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:52.720]   When are we recording Andy's, Yucalele?
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.520]   When we get Andy out here to record the Yucalele?
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:57.760]   Andy, are you going to come out and do an Yucalele album?
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   I'm coming out for iWorld.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.680]   And maybe an offer I couldn't refuse in interviewing the South Park producers.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.240]   I don't think we ready then.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.320]   I don't think we ready then.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.320]   But bring the Yuc.
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:08.320]   Bring the Yuc.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:11.720]   We'll find an excuse for me to do a little recording.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:14.360]   I'll even maybe even learn a third song.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.360]   Wow.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.760]   I don't want to make any promises I can't keep.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.640]   It's time for our picks of the week.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.840]   Why don't you start us off, Andy and not go?
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:27.360]   Well this is a sort of a celebration of Johnny Ives Field Promotion, shall we say, of tonight
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.960]   hood.
[01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:33.360]   I thought that, I don't know what it says about my personality, that the very, truly the first
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.440]   thing I thought of is the amount of crap that his underlings are supposed to give him
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:40.400]   the first day back after your boss would be given a night hood.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:44.840]   And so it ain't a bucket of Gatorade toss over his head.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.840]   We're a little more clever than that.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.880]   Well yeah, also, you know, how can he can't really be hurt and offended by the fact that
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.600]   he's been given a night.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:56.680]   It's part of the celebration I think.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:27:00.880]   And so of course I had a tweet, oh well he's going to have a unibody, you know, aluminum
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:01.880]   armor.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.880]   And then I said that no, there's also going to be an apple intern whose job it is to
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.400]   follow him around everywhere on the apple campus banging, holding up an iPhone that's
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:11.720]   playing the Son of Two Coconuts banging together.
[01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:17.320]   And then of course I did a search on the iTunes store and there is actually an app for like
[01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:20.240]   an iPhone like playing the Son of Two Coconuts banging together.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:21.240]   Wow.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.240]   And there are four such apps.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.240]   Wow.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.360]   Check them out, my favorite is called Coconut Horse by eager her software.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.360]   Oh my God.
[01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:33.200]   And it works great because it doesn't do anything until it actually, hang on, I have to take
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.200]   it off of mute.
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.600]   I don't know why I need to buy this, but I need to buy it.
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.160]   You do not need this.
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.440]   Do not do that.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.440]   Stop it.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.440]   Does nothing.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:44.440]   But if you have in your pocket, just.
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:47.760]   Oh, so it's a, oh well that's different.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.960]   I didn't realize it's accelerometer driven.
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:50.960]   Now you know exactly.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:51.960]   No, I need it.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:57.400]   No, don't be deceived by the other iPhone Coconuts banging together apps.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:59.560]   This is a coconut horse by a girder software.
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.840]   It's the one you want it is hands free, it has a good interface.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:06.800]   Also the others don't actually use the actual sounds of coconut's clapping together.
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.560]   They use some sort of synthetic or mock coconut treatment for the sound effect.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:15.440]   So this is the only, the only thing that I wish that now it's 99 cents.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.560]   So you got a lot of expectations for 99 cents.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:22.280]   So my comment to Chris Erdiger would be to when you stop, it should just simply stop.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:28.720]   It should go, just like the sound Patsy does in the actual movie.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:32.520]   But again, I assume that this is the reason why at least two staff members at Apple got
[01:28:32.520 --> 01:28:38.160]   fired because they decided it was funny on Monday, it was tolerable on Tuesday on Wednesday.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.160]   Congratulations.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:45.960]   You are now working on the updates to the laser writer to support.
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:46.960]   Wow.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.960]   Very nice.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.960]   Very nice.
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.960]   Ozzy likes him.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:51.960]   Ozzy is excited.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:57.200]   He saw Tom come in with a new MacBook Air.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:59.040]   That's why he's excited.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:02.760]   Did Tom, did you and Eileen get his and her MacBook Airs?
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.160]   Oh, you're going to sell it.
[01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.160]   Okay.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.160]   Any takers?
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:09.160]   Query Tom.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.160]   He's going to gazelle it.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:11.160]   Don't just gazelle it.
[01:29:11.160 --> 01:29:12.160]   Gazelle it.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:13.160]   Even better.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:14.160]   Let's see.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:16.360]   You're pick of the week, sir.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.680]   Actually, I have to warn you, it's been done.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:20.680]   But go ahead.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:21.680]   This one's been done.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:22.680]   I think Andy did it.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:23.680]   Did you do this one, Andy?
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:24.680]   Did I miss this episode?
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:25.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.680]   That looks.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680]   And I have one too.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.680]   I mean, you look for it.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.680]   You must know.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.680]   I was in one of those.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.680]   But it's really, really cool.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.680]   That's worth recommending.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:34.680]   Go ahead.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:35.680]   Do it again.
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:36.680]   We love the plug bug.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:37.680]   It's 10 watts.
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:38.680]   10 watts.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:42.040]   That's one power to charge your iPad in like some serious speed.
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.360]   I mean, I couldn't believe how fast it was charging.
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:48.680]   So this is a-- so you know when you have your power adapter for your laptop, you can
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:55.720]   slide off the longer cord from it and then just use a plug for it.
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:58.900]   I use that in international because you can buy an international kit that gives you
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.040]   plugs for different countries.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:02.160]   But you can also slide this on.
[01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:03.160]   This is the plug bug.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.160]   What is it?
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.160]   $30?
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.160]   I think it was something like that.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.680]   It has a 10 watt USB connector.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:09.200]   So now you only bring this with you.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:12.200]   You put this on your power brick for your laptop.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:14.600]   You charge your laptop and your iPad with the same device.
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:15.600]   There you go.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.600]   And that's the deal.
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:17.600]   You just leave it there.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:18.600]   Right.
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.160]   You always have a 10 watt USB charger.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.160]   Right.
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:25.080]   Is it faster in your experience than just plugging into the computer?
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.080]   Well, yeah.
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:27.920]   It's a lot faster than plugging into your computer.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:30.600]   But it's also faster than your-- I found that it was--
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.320]   Faster than the one that comes with the iPad?
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:35.160]   Haven't timed it yet, but I think it's about twice as fast.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:36.480]   Oh, well, that's nice.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.600]   As the-- as charging with the one that comes with the iPad.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.760]   So Geico Asaki had something to do with these guys.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:43.760]   How did he?
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.320]   Well done.
[01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:47.720]   It was his idea to make them red, as a matter of fact.
[01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:48.720]   Oh.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:49.720]   Good.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:50.720]   And the red part is not I'm not so excited about.
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.960]   I really would have just preferred it to be white.
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:52.960]   But--
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:53.960]   There you go.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:56.480]   But I love-- like I was kind of amazed by that.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:58.240]   And the idea that I can hook it in an airport,
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:01.400]   and it's just like it's not another outlet suite.
[01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.400]   It's great.
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.400]   So there's one--
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.400]   I missed the--
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:06.400]   Yeah, no, I wasn't here either.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.400]   It was just you, Andy, I think.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:09.400]   That was one I was hosting the whole show.
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:14.040]   But I saw-- I watched the show, so I knew.
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.040]   You want to do something else?
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.040]   You don't have to.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.040]   That's fine.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:18.040]   Go ahead.
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.040]   You do yours.
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.040]   I'll do mine.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.040]   I'll do mine.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.040]   So you all know Rogumiba.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.040]   Yeah, they're great.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.040]   Great little company.
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:26.040]   They do something that we--
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:30.840]   audio professionals use regularly called Audio High-Jack Pro.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.200]   But it's a little bit much, frankly, for the--
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.200]   Yes.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:38.600]   The normal person who just simply wants to record stuff going on in their Mac.
[01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:42.240]   And so they've released a very inexpensive-- I think it's $5 or $10.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:46.760]   It's a little inexpensive thing called-- how do you pronounce this?
[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:47.760]   Pizzo, piezo?
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:48.760]   Pizzo, yeah.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:49.760]   Huh?
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.760]   Pizzo.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:51.760]   Pizzo.
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.960]   I've used that component a lot.
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:55.120]   I've never actually had a pronounce.
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.120]   It's like these piezo.
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:57.920]   But one time I've heard someone--
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:32:01.880]   There's a store in Needham, Massachusetts that sells really good parts.
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:03.880]   And the one time I needed to get to replace him.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.200]   He actually pronounced it piezo.
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.200]   So that's how I've actually--
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.920]   I've been saying piezo, the chairman says piezo.
[01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:10.400]   I've heard piezo.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:13.960]   Anyway, it's an electrical thing.
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.440]   It's creating electrical--
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:17.080]   It's a transducer-- it's a sound transducer element.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:19.920]   You create an electrical field through sound pressure or something like that.
[01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:26.080]   But anyway, this is just a little inexpensive app that's in the app store that just makes
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:28.480]   it very simple to record.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.480]   And I like that.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.680]   Let me just launch it here.
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:34.560]   By the way, that was the new Alfred 1.0, which is now out too.
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.240]   You couldn't make this any easier.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:41.000]   I'll hide this so that you can see what the app is.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000]   Where is it?
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   There it is.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   It's really pretty.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.440]   I like Rogenme, this UI design.
[01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:50.240]   You can choose the source, which means you can record Skype.
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:55.040]   That's one thing people do all the time and want to do it, as well as a built-in microphone
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.040]   if you just want to see.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:57.040]   I'm recording now.
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:58.600]   Great little interface.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:32:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:02.000]   They're very simple on the quality.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.160]   You can do spoken word, low quality music, high quality music.
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.400]   It'll tell you what it is.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.280]   For instance, it does AAC or MP3.
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:18.440]   The high quality internet distribution is MP3, 256-kilobit VBR, which is more than enough
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:22.080]   if you want to do it for yourself, AAC 256-kilobit stereo.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.440]   It doesn't have mono.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.440]   That's about it.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440]   It's simple.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.440]   It does it.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.440]   It's a little recorder.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:29.640]   That's what I love about it.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:34.880]   It works exactly the way that an audio recorder should work because I love the power features
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:41.000]   of these apps that let you program in what URL, what time of the day, and what destination.
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:46.520]   This is just simply stick a tape in the machine, press record, tell it where you want to record
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.520]   from, done.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:54.720]   I can plug in a microphone in my USB port and then I can use this to record the radio.
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:55.720]   I like the interface.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:34:01.000]   The little analog counter that's ticking over the low-dometer and so forth.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.000]   I just like this.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.240]   That'll always be the difference between Apple products and non-Apple products.
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:13.400]   This is not created by Apple, but Max and iOS, it creates an environment in which talented
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:18.360]   developers are motivated to create software that's as pretty as this.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.720]   It would have worked just as well if they were ugly, but someone decided, why don't
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:23.800]   we just spend an extra half a day on this?
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.040]   I'm sure it was more than half a day, but let's put the extra effort in actually making
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.000]   a very beautiful, satisfying thing.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:32.520]   Actually, ROGAMIBA has an in-house designer who does a really good job.
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:33.520]   She's very, very good.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:36.160]   This is an example of her work.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.160]   There it is.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.160]   It's $10.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:41.560]   Pizzo in the PIEZO.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.080]   It's in the Apple App Store.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.160]   I thought it was worth mentioning just because it's cool.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:48.400]   Now you go ahead.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.400]   Is my little extra pick just to have it?
[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:53.240]   I just want to remind people that Dern Doll is now available on the iPad for free.
[01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.240]   What the hell's that?
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:55.240]   It's Marathon 2.
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:56.240]   Oh, Marathon 2.
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.240]   So, Marathon 2.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:58.240]   So, Marathon 2.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.240]   But you put Marathon 1 out and now you can get this.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.240]   It's not Bungie.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:01.240]   It's because it's open source.
[01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.240]   It's open source.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.600]   So, it's out there and it runs better than it did ever on my Mac.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.800]   Just on the iPad.
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:10.240]   And yeah, the technical term for this is as a pick, you have to just say.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:12.240]   What's the...
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:13.240]   It's the...
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.240]   It's the first person shooter.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:17.640]   If you've played Halo, you've played the successor to this.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:18.640]   Let's see it.
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.680]   Are you in water here?
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.680]   I have to...
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.960]   The problem with me showing it to you is I have to drive.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.600]   Let's move that little thing around.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.600]   There you go.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.600]   Oh, now you're in the water.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:29.600]   It's okay.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.600]   It looks like Quake.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.600]   It does.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:32.600]   It's free.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.600]   And it's...
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:35.600]   What would be really great if the developers are listening?
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.600]   Oh, he's killing you.
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.600]   I just need to shoot him.
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.600]   There you go.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.360]   It's good for a little nostalgia.
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.680]   And it's still a great game.
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:47.640]   What's really missing is being able to do multiplayer on an iPad, a bunch of iPads, being
[01:35:47.640 --> 01:35:53.640]   able to log in and do it, because they have multiplayer available for the Mac ones.
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:57.640]   And it'd be great to do multiplayer, because that's really where all these games are more
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:58.640]   fun.
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:35:59.640]   This is great.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:00.640]   This looks fun.
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:03.160]   Yeah, we used to play Halo multiplayer at Tech TV all the time.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:07.960]   So much so that they actually had to put out a memo to stop us, because we would do it
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:08.960]   during the commercials.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:16.920]   Well, and what's funny is, is back in the day, you had to restart your Mac and with the
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.560]   shift key held down to make sure that all the extensions are off, so you could get maximum
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:22.560]   frame rate.
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.040]   Otherwise, you just get your butt cleaned.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.680]   So it's kind of a maze.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.000]   I hear some bad...
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   I would so...
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:33.000]   See?
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:36.560]   I do pretty good impression of that guy.
[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.360]   Where'd they come from?
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.080]   All right, I'll give it back to you.
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:43.080]   What does that call?
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.720]   This is Marathon 2 or Durindall.
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:45.720]   It's Durindall.
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:46.720]   And so it's...
[01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:48.400]   But if you do a search for Marathon, you'll find it.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:54.240]   I sure would love to have Skyrim on an iPad.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:55.240]   Dovahkiin.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.240]   All right.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.760]   Andy Enoco, Chicago Sun Times.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:36:59.760]   Check him out.
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:02.600]   Also his website, www.cwob.com.
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:09.600]   Also his other podcast, Enoco's almanac on the other podcast network, 5x5.tv.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:13.600]   I hope to finish the Pendulat book, and that's going to be the topic of next week shows,
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.600]   as a matter of fact.
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.600]   Good.
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:20.680]   And Alex, I really do feel bad that I scooped your pick.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:26.240]   So I just wanted some gesture I can do to give you some...
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:29.560]   I've decided after much thought that I'm going to send you back the power brick that
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:31.080]   you left here.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:34.320]   So I can attach it to that one.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:38.840]   I know I don't have to do that, but I think that you deserve just that little extra sort
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.840]   of...
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:41.120]   It's so sweet.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.120]   I feel bad.
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:43.680]   That's so sweet.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:49.400]   That's the one thing I probably leave in the most number of places is my power supply.
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.520]   If everyone sent them all back, I would...
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:54.840]   I was just hoping that if I didn't send it back to you, you'd have an excuse to come
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:55.840]   back here and visit me.
[01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:56.840]   I don't need another excuse.
[01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:59.400]   You'll see, Andy, I'll just come back.
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:00.760]   You should do like hotels do, Andy.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:04.800]   You just have a little basket behind the front desk with any kind of power supply you'd
[01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:05.800]   ever want.
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:06.960]   And then just there.
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:08.160]   You need a power supply here.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.160]   We have one.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:11.600]   Oh, I already got that going on very well.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:14.840]   You need a PS2 to USB adapter?
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.840]   We got one of those.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:17.840]   Got it.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:22.720]   Mr. Andy, I'm sorry, Alex Lindsey is the head honcho at the Pixel Corp because of
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.360]   Word.com is the website.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.160]   Every Thursday you do a live thing, right?
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.680]   It hasn't been every Thursday in December.
[01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.680]   It was a little December's office.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:29.680]   We're getting ourselves back.
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:31.160]   You're going to be doing anything this week.
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:32.160]   What are we talking about?
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:36.240]   It's going to be a gear meeting taking a little bit more informal than the last ones.
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:38.880]   But yeah, it's 6 o'clock on Thursday.
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:41.560]   And I do believe you'll be at CES with us.
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:42.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.720]   And so we'll have I know Pixel Corp coverage, but also a coverage we've got our Sky booth,
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:47.960]   which is not in the sky.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:52.320]   But in fact, on the first floor of the South Hall, right as you come in the door on the
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:54.720]   first floor, right to the left there, look for us.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:39:00.640]   And we'll be broadcasting Monday night, Tuesday night, Sunday night, Sunday night, Monday
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:03.560]   night, all day, Tuesday through Friday.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.360]   In fact, we're going to do Windows weekly right after the bomber keynote.
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:10.720]   We got we got a whole bunch of plan and 12 noon for our next Mac break weekly, 12 new
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.920]   Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern at on Tuesday.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.760]   And I will be there and hopefully well researched.
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:17.040]   I want to be spending a lot of time trying to figure out what we're going to put.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:19.760]   So you will you will have we'll have a lot of coverage for you from CES.
[01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:20.960]   That should be a lot of fun.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:23.080]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.040]   Anything else I need to tell the kind people.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.840]   I think you're good.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.840]   I think you're good.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:29.840]   All right.
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:30.840]   Oh, PMA is also next week.
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.640]   And so we'll have photo coverage to it photo.
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:35.520]   In fact, it's coming up next in just a bit.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.600]   Our dear friend, is Catherine Hall will be here to talk about photography.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.600]   So stay tuned for that if you're watching live.
